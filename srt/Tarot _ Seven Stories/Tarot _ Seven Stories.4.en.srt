(This program is sponsored by the Broadcasting and Communications Development Fund of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Information and Communications Technology)

4
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:17,687
Mom I'm scared

5
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:26,830
Mom, I'm scared. Open the door quickly, Mom.

6
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:29,468
Emily's mother is busy

7
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:32,134
Open the door quickly and go back to sleep

8
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:36,639
I told you I'm busy

9
00:01:37,173 --> 00:01:39,219
Why is your child so sensitive?

10
00:01:39,243 --> 00:01:39,842
What's up

11
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,954
Strange noises can always be heard in the room

12
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:44,247
I already told you it was the water heater. How many times do you have to tell me?

13
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,259
No, it's completely different from that voice.

14
00:01:47,283 --> 00:01:49,483
Let her go back quickly, won't you?

15
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:52,022
What did you say? Be careful not to be overheard by the children.

16
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:55,968
I told you it was the hot water heater. Go back and go to bed.

17
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:57,603
I'm scared

18
00:01:57,627 --> 00:01:59,629
Go back to bed quickly. Mom is busy.

19
00:02:01,237 --> 00:02:02,238
What's this

20
00:02:06,863 --> 00:02:09,113
Eun San, is this your thing?

21
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:15,563
not mine

22
00:02:16,038 --> 00:02:17,105
Go back to your room quickly, really

23
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:22,518
(tarot cards)

24
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:25,721
(Mom in the rental area)

25
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:30,675
Yingzhi’s mother is here. Isn’t she here yet?

26
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:31,710
I asked her to park the car

27
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:33,943
There's an asbestos smell in the underground parking lot recently

28
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:40,045
But doesn’t her daughter think it’s a bit immature?

29
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,043
I heard that Youngji occasionally said strange things to Eunsan

30
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:46,570
They are playing together there

31
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:47,685
Be careful if she hears you

32
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,521
She is also lucky

33
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:53,091
We never interact with residents in rental housing estates

34
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:54,051
That's right

35
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:56,130
Why do high-end communities have to interact with rental housing estates?

36
00:02:56,337 --> 00:02:57,596
We study hard

37
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,247
Not to hang out with poor people

38
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:01,784
Don't say that they are still children.

39
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:04,659
What's wrong

40
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:06,863
what happened emily

41
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:17,601
Hello Zheng Enshan

42
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,780
are you kidding me

43
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:24,347
I saw you when you came out

44
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,927
Damn why is the room so messy?

45
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:33,200
Why did I take out all my cosmetics?

46
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,521
("Spider and the Candy Shop")

47
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:35,791
hateful

48
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,096
This dust is really annoying

49
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:43,799
Zheng Eunshan, I have seen you

50
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,536
Come out quickly, really

51
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:56,245
Yingzhi, what are you doing?

52
00:03:57,206 --> 00:03:58,508
sorry

53
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:00,595
Hello Zheng Enshan

54
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:04,513
what the hell are you doing

55
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:06,239
Mom was scared, right?

56
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:08,524
You are so abominable

57
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:13,350
Hey mom, I'm going out to meet my friends.

58
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:15,285
Do you know how to restore the room before coming back?

59
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:16,653
don't want

60
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:17,645
Why

61
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:18,639
tidy up

62
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:20,490
knew

63
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:27,920
Can I take off my makeup now?

64
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:29,365
What do you say?

65
00:04:29,952 --> 00:04:31,754
You put this in my mother's room, right?

66
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:33,595
I didn't put it there

67
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:35,860
who would it be if it wasn't you

68
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,452
Don't you often do strange things?

69
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,461
Bring it to me to see

70
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,107
I know this thing

71
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:48,538
Isn't it just an ordinary card?

72
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:51,678
This naked woman is a god

73
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:54,229
Behind is the Big Dipper

74
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,011
The water is flowing

75
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,629
From this water will be born human beings and create the world

76
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:02,050
so what

77
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:05,528
That is to say, your mother is praised as a god

78
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:07,322
Isn't it because your mother is supporting you?

79
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:11,907
Where is your husband?

80
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:13,589
Business trip

81
00:05:19,662 --> 00:05:22,521
Oh my God, how could this happen after only a short time?

82
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:25,719
Yingzhi mother

83
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:28,571
I've kept you waiting for a long time, haven't I?

84
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:30,973
If not, I just came here

85
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:32,705
Thanks for your hard work

86
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,127
Oh, there's no need to do this.

87
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:52,260
What happened in Eun-san's room just now?

88
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:55,410
Nothing

89
00:05:55,831 --> 00:05:57,967
They are playing with cosmetics

90
00:05:58,186 --> 00:06:00,522
Turning into a ghost scared me a lot

91
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:04,146
Could it be that Yingzhi took advantage of your cosmetics without permission?

92
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,762
Such expensive cosmetics

93
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:07,476
I can't stand it

94
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,115
My Yingzhi is a bit special

95
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:16,706
If you use it too much, I'll buy one for you.

96
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:19,368
what is this

97
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:22,804
Do I want you to pay for the cosmetics?

98
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:34,075
yes

99
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:37,439
That's it

100
00:06:39,207 --> 00:06:40,184
Yinghao's mother is

101
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:43,322
This is 500,000 won, but it looks like street food.

102
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:44,922
What do you think of the fabric?

103
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,290
Just wear it for a season and throw it away.

104
00:06:46,315 --> 00:06:47,158
Buy it first

105
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:47,893
So be it

106
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,297
Good style

107
00:06:52,321 --> 00:06:54,551
Mother Yingzhi, why don’t you buy some? The price is okay too

108
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:55,284
Um

109
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:02,000
Every time like this she would pretend to be on the phone

110
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:06,127
Shopping is really not an easy activity

111
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:11,735
Thanks

112
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:19,323
Yingzhi’s mother, this is not an expensive thing.

113
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:23,586
Last time I noticed the collar of your shirt was loose and dirty.

114
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:25,557
Let me wear this for you

115
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:29,569
No

116
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:31,366
This is not expensive

117
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:32,314
for you

118
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:35,997
Thanks

119
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:52,349
Do you prefer zombie makeup or vampire makeup?

120
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:54,252
What's the difference

121
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:55,738
Don’t you even know this?

122
00:07:58,286 --> 00:07:59,821
Really stupid

123
00:08:01,902 --> 00:08:03,699
Do you prefer faceless male makeup or clown makeup?

124
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:05,194
Don't like either of them

125
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,555
All right

126
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:08,372
Then put on zombie makeup

127
00:08:08,397 --> 00:08:10,241
Because of you, I also became a zombie

128
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,673
what did I do

129
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:13,731
Didn't you see this?

130
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:17,023
How can you blame me?

131
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:18,343
Shut up

132
00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:19,918
I was just trying to help you...

133
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:20,976
I told you to shut up

134
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:25,463
You go home

135
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:27,024
My mother said she would wait here for her return

136
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,652
So what does it have to do with me?

137
00:08:48,623 --> 00:08:50,822
Go away, go away

138
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,969
let me help you

139
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:54,921
Get away

140
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:56,846
Get away

141
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,152
Hello, are you okay?

142
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,266
The size should be OK

143
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,579
certainly

144
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:12,312
very beautiful

145
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,949
hope you like it

146
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:15,022
like

147
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:18,819
I'll get it, okay

148
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:23,913
So annoying

149
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:25,215
I will accept it in the end

150
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,599
But you have to pretend to save face

151
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:28,205
Why did you give her clothes?

152
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:30,488
Of course I owed it to her as a favor.

153
00:09:30,513 --> 00:09:31,514
Otherwise, why would you give it to her?

154
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,205
Or if it weren't for her daughter

155
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,984
Something big happened to Eun San at that time

156
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:38,766
How can there be stray dogs in such a high-end community?

157
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,277
You only paid attention to her because of the sentiment at the time.

158
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,693
But this relationship should be broken off, right?

159
00:09:45,514 --> 00:09:47,683
Why to break

160
00:09:48,223 --> 00:09:50,258
The problem is that she doesn't know what's going on

161
00:09:50,612 --> 00:09:53,888
I thought she would leave voluntarily if we gave her a wink.

162
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,246
did not expect…

163
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,380
Because I want to get along well with Eun San

164
00:09:56,405 --> 00:09:58,474
Only if you can keep this relationship in the future will you delay leaving.

165
00:09:58,881 --> 00:09:59,665
This is obvious

166
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:00,651
Very clever

167
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:01,318
that is

168
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,587
brazen

169
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:03,345
I know

170
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:04,379
Why

171
00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:31,668
It's so noisy

172
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:33,261
not me

173
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,785
It rang from your place

174
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:42,523
Damn it's so annoying

175
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,928
Curious?

176
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,297
Yesterday you went to the bathroom

177
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:47,769
I saw it when I was alone

178
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,799
What did you see again?

179
00:10:50,277 --> 00:10:53,113
Things always fall off there

180
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:58,341
Drop something

181
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:03,172
A woman fell three times on her head from there.

182
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:10,557
Bang bang bang

183
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:16,859
Didn't you see any traces there?

184
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:27,856
You are so annoying

185
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:28,867
Scared?

186
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:30,944
What are you afraid of?

187
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:32,171
I'm not afraid

188
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:35,391
By the way, Yingzhi’s mother

189
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:39,508
There will be a gathering for mothers in our community this Saturday

190
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:40,872
You go too

191
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:42,153
Mom in the community?

192
00:11:42,177 --> 00:11:42,760
Yes

193
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:45,013
It’s a gathering of mothers of Eun-san’s classmates

194
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,722
You can go too, okay?

195
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:55,095
Wisdom

196
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:00,708
Yingzhi, don’t you say hello?

197
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:01,710
yes

198
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,831
goodbye

199
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:07,622
Ah, see you next time

200
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:09,930
Thanks

201
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:11,708
be careful on the road

202
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,076
good

203
00:12:22,383 --> 00:12:23,246
Wisdom

204
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:26,310
Do you and Eun San not get along well?

205
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:29,044
I've been trying my best to endure it.

206
00:12:33,855 --> 00:12:35,079
Mom, I'm sorry

207
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:47,121
Emily where are you

208
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,120
I'm in the living room

209
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,851
Why don't you call me without looking for me?

210
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:54,239
Hey, how can you find a house this big?

211
00:12:55,243 --> 00:12:56,792
Not a big deal

212
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,294
Didn't you and Yingzhi have any unpleasant incident today?

213
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:02,133
she is very annoyed

214
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,434
She is the only one living in the rental housing complex

215
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,454
I heard everything you said

216
00:13:07,141 --> 00:13:07,808
Eun San

217
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:11,490
I said you can't be picky when it comes to eating.

218
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,548
Eat junk food occasionally to improve your immunity

219
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:18,621
I don’t want it if you don’t want it

220
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:24,893
Why is this kid so rude?

221
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:27,722
hateful

222
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,126
Eunsan Eunsan

223
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:08,196
You slept too long too

224
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:10,508
Yingzhi is here, get up quickly

225
00:14:11,306 --> 00:14:12,381
You two have fun

226
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:24,539
So annoying

227
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:26,652
What's wrong

228
00:14:27,295 --> 00:14:29,736
Hey, what did you mean yesterday?

229
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:31,686
What to say about a woman falling off

230
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:34,683
Want to know? You can see it too

231
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:37,138
What's the meaning

232
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,387
Then let me show you

233
00:14:38,987 --> 00:14:40,388
Is there a washbasin?

234
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:42,305
Also need mirrors and matches

235
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,567
I don't know. It should be in the kitchen.

236
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,754
Go get it

237
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:49,039
If you take Yingzhi’s mother with you,

238
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:51,042
You won't be disliked by them, right?

239
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:52,042
Blame us for lowering their level

240
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,051
Will not

241
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:55,757
The community residents regard us as angels

242
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:58,060
After all, no one cares about the residents of the rental community.

243
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,878
Anyway, you know what the plan is for today?

244
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,252
Eun San’s mother, you can’t pretend to be nice again.

245
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:09,092
When did I have you again?

246
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,485
If it happens again I will ignore you

247
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:15,089
What's wrong

248
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:19,470
What's wrong

249
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,879
It's nothing, maybe it's just dazzling

250
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:27,035
boring

251
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:47,834
Is the water surface moving?

252
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,966
Of course if you put a match just now it will move.

253
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:52,357
are you a fool

254
00:15:55,216 --> 00:15:56,684
Then I'm going to start

255
00:15:57,552 --> 00:16:00,019
Close your eyes and never look in the mirror

256
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,646
good

257
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:19,314
Bloody Mary Bloody Mary Bloody Mary…

258
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:22,310
The woman just came to the mirror

259
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:24,731
If you have anything to ask, just ask.

260
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,128
Who are you

261
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,078
I'm the one who's always lived here

262
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,870
She said she knows you very well

263
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:38,158
Why fall from above?

264
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:40,367
because she made a mistake

265
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:43,334
Said he made a big mistake in this house

266
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:47,215
So what can we do to drive her away?

267
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:48,793
have no idea

268
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:51,987
She said it depends on your performance

269
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,878
Didn't I tell you not to look in the mirror?

270
00:17:05,146 --> 00:17:07,114
You're bored and don't want to play anymore

271
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:09,638
Are you really not playing anymore?

272
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:11,779
But maybe we can drive her away

273
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,442
Forget it, I won’t play with you anymore

274
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:24,257
Late and late

275
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:28,762
Who is this…

276
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:30,430
She is Yingzhi’s mother

277
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:31,699
Say hello to Yingzhi’s mother.

278
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:33,822
Hello everyone

279
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:37,132
Our children are all classmates

280
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,399
We all live in the same neighborhood and this is the first time we have met.

281
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:45,318
Does Yingzhi’s mother also live in Building 3?

282
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:51,659
I live in building 10

283
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,818
I see. It turns out you live in the building at the back.

284
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:58,807
No wonder

285
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,334
So what?

286
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,102
We are all parents in the same class

287
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,152
yes

288
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:08,530
That's right

289
00:18:09,096 --> 00:18:10,064
That's right, that's right

290
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:11,166
right

291
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:12,033
That's right

292
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:14,114
They're all in the same class

293
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:17,107
Anyway, today is a regular gathering day

294
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:19,947
Let’s discuss the matter of children attending classes in groups during the holidays

295
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:21,223
Isn’t that pretty good too?

296
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:23,177
So we will charge by group every month...

297
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,522
some dues

298
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:26,990
Yes, let’s collect the membership fee first.

299
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:28,583
Two million won per person, right?

300
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:32,187
Yingzhi’s mother doesn’t need to pay

301
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:34,522
Anyway…

302
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,970
Yingzhi’s mother didn’t accept it

303
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:45,433
Teacher’s courses…Consulting services

304
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,572
Course consulting services refer to…

305
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,283
I mean, have you ever had any consultation?

306
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:54,913
You and the class teacher

307
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:58,445
You never called me alone

308
00:18:59,808 --> 00:19:03,178
Then you must not have heard about Yingzhi either, right?

309
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:05,429
Is it about Yingzhi?

310
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:09,217
You also know that her grades have dropped significantly, right?

311
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,861
To be honest, her English ability is not up to standard.

312
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:17,518
Well, just treat it as if it had just been transferred here not long ago.

313
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,277
I heard that when the children are together

314
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:22,270
He often does strange things

315
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:25,573
What strange behavior did she do?

316
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,419
For example, stealing something

317
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:30,578
She said her hands and feet were unclean

318
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:33,915
Originally, she gave people a rather gloomy impression.

319
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,603
At least she can still play with Eun San

320
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,634
I heard that the children often isolate her

321
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,661
There's nothing wrong with Yingzhi

322
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:49,601
She never said anything to me

323
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:52,265
no problem

324
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:55,079
I didn’t say anything. How can I talk to my mother?

325
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:56,404
Yes, it must be difficult to speak

326
00:19:56,705 --> 00:20:00,041
That's right. It must be difficult to speak.

327
00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:03,887
I...go to the bathroom first

328
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:04,779
good

329
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:11,052
Don't know how to observe words and emotions at all

330
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:12,587
What should I do?

331
00:20:18,398 --> 00:20:18,832
What's up

332
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:21,171
Is there a restroom here?

333
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:23,307
If you are not a resident of Buildings 1 to 5

334
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:24,666
(Non-smoking apartment)

335
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:24,399
You can't go in or out of this place

336
00:20:25,953 --> 00:20:28,389
Can I use the bathroom temporarily?

337
00:20:29,523 --> 00:20:32,271
You can use the restroom in the mall over there.

338
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,677
It's too far over there

339
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:37,875
Yingzhi mother

340
00:20:39,493 --> 00:20:41,124
You don't have a keycard here?

341
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:42,293
I am a resident

342
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:43,694
OK, please come in.

343
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:44,625
Hello

344
00:20:55,597 --> 00:20:57,268
There are a lot of people today.

345
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:04,799
Looks like we have to wait a while

346
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,947
Are you OK

347
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:38,462
Damn it, no, I said no

348
00:21:39,613 --> 00:21:40,884
my doll

349
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:44,034
Why is it missing? I'm so annoyed.

350
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:47,061
Hello

351
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,318
Didn't you say you wanted that before?

352
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:53,658
right

353
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:55,715
What does it mean

354
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,259
It's impossible to disappear suddenly

355
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,027
Anyway, I didn’t take it

356
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,462
I haven't asked you yet. How can you answer first?

357
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:06,432
Ah, it seems you are feeling guilty, right?

358
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:09,048
I told you I didn't take it

359
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:10,451
Just look for it again

360
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:12,919
I don't like you from the beginning

361
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:14,434
Your family is still so poor

362
00:22:15,663 --> 00:22:17,520
Only your house is a rented house

363
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:18,989
What does it matter?

364
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:19,977
From the moment I played with you

365
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:21,416
I heard a strange sound in the room

366
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:24,628
The doll was also stolen by you

367
00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:25,817
I said it wasn't me

368
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,152
Yeah

369
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,718
That's what your mother took away

370
00:22:34,602 --> 00:22:36,638
Your mother is also a beggar like you

371
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:38,691
Isn't it? Yingzhi

372
00:22:39,286 --> 00:22:40,497
Don't talk about my mother

373
00:22:41,035 --> 00:22:42,812
What can you do

374
00:22:43,337 --> 00:22:44,047
Hello

375
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:44,707
Hello

376
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:45,574
hateful

377
00:22:47,022 --> 00:22:48,030
Mother

378
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:50,653
Come on, help me pull her away from Emily

379
00:22:50,678 --> 00:22:53,012
Let it go, let it go, what do you want to do?

380
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:55,450
She stole my doll

381
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,760
I told you it's not me

382
00:22:56,784 --> 00:22:58,485
So you beggar

383
00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,718
Hello

384
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:01,496
Hey, damn, loosen up!

385
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:11,880
Emily let's go

386
00:23:23,383 --> 00:23:24,676
You're here, come in

387
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:29,257
correct

388
00:23:29,644 --> 00:23:31,142
Let’s go to Eun-san’s room and have a chat.

389
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:33,891
Put on slippers

390
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,422
Yingzhi mother

391
00:23:56,923 --> 00:23:58,330
can you tell me the truth

392
00:23:59,486 --> 00:24:01,075
Have you seen that doll?

393
00:24:01,835 --> 00:24:04,439
That was Eun San's favorite but it's missing

394
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,134
But Eun San said

395
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:09,609
She saw with her own eyes that Yingzhi took it away

396
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:15,502
Isn't that quite big?

397
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,142
Yingzhi didn’t get it back

398
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,519
I haven't seen such a doll at home

399
00:24:21,996 --> 00:24:23,082
No

400
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,793
Think about it carefully

401
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:26,994
I think

402
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:30,104
It’s normal for children to have some conflicts among themselves

403
00:24:30,371 --> 00:24:31,458
but

404
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:36,491
The mothers also said that Yingzhi’s hands and feet were unclean

405
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,455
Why do you even say that?

406
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:45,012
Yingzhi is not who you say he is

407
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:46,243
What

408
00:24:47,814 --> 00:24:49,250
Could it be Eun San...

409
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:51,679
Are you lying?

410
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,084
After me…

411
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:08,436
Let’s ask Yingji later

412
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:11,566
Wait a moment

413
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:13,597
Stop for me, mother Yingzhi

414
00:25:14,594 --> 00:25:16,879
I'm a little panicked

415
00:25:18,331 --> 00:25:20,223
You come and go together because of us

416
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:22,697
I thought we were all the same friends

417
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,034
but not like this

418
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:31,906
Eun San's mother

419
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,743
Other mothers have said this

420
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:39,647
Why hang out with people in the tenement area?

421
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:44,010
without prejudice we

422
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:46,973
I just accepted you, don’t you know?

423
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:52,482
I wanted to always be on your side

424
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,662
do you know

425
00:25:58,066 --> 00:25:58,877
All right

426
00:25:59,747 --> 00:26:03,517
People should flock together

427
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:07,775
If you don't want to, then forget it.

428
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:12,046
You actually feel uncomfortable being with us, right?

429
00:26:13,453 --> 00:26:15,218
No, it’s not what you said, Eun San’s mother

430
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:17,393
I turned around and looked for it

431
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:19,222
If not I would buy you a new one

432
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:20,982
Yingzhi mother

433
00:26:21,702 --> 00:26:22,903
Do you know how much that is worth?

434
00:26:23,838 --> 00:26:26,407
Can I still ask you to compensate me for one?

435
00:26:27,815 --> 00:26:29,216
Let’s talk about Yingzhi’s mother

436
00:26:29,637 --> 00:26:31,071
when you eat with us

437
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:34,055
Every time I say I'm full, I still look at other people's faces.

438
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:38,785
What's wrong

439
00:26:41,154 --> 00:26:42,122
are you crying

440
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:50,538
it's so funny

441
00:26:51,858 --> 00:26:52,631
Really

442
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,125
Not like a joke

443
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:01,462
The plan worked, right?

444
00:27:14,394 --> 00:27:15,141
What's this

445
00:27:17,424 --> 00:27:18,559
why is it here

446
00:27:23,364 --> 00:27:25,990
Hey, is this what you hid?

447
00:27:27,408 --> 00:27:29,410
No, I hid it

448
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:32,493
Show that to your mother quickly

449
00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:36,130
After seeing it, you can drive away the ghosts

450
00:27:36,497 --> 00:27:37,900
Are you lying again?

451
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,152
What is the relationship between ghosts and dolls?

452
00:27:41,623 --> 00:27:44,318
Now my mother is being scolded for this.

453
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,208
So that's it

454
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:50,303
But what to do

455
00:27:51,645 --> 00:27:53,981
This has nothing to do with me

456
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:04,185
Or should I destroy that doll now?

457
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:06,013
Or throw it out the window

458
00:28:07,355 --> 00:28:08,956
It's like it never existed from the beginning

459
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:12,886
for you

460
00:28:14,201 --> 00:28:15,269
ruin it with this

461
00:28:15,456 --> 00:28:16,991
What are you talking about?

462
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:18,382
put the knife down

463
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,807
If you don't destroy it now

464
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:23,110
Maybe that ghost will follow you for the rest of your life.

465
00:28:26,848 --> 00:28:27,839
Then I don't want to

466
00:28:28,883 --> 00:28:30,151
This is your choice

467
00:28:39,723 --> 00:28:42,372
Oh, Eun San’s mother was so terrible just now

468
00:28:42,396 --> 00:28:42,930
That's right

469
00:28:43,297 --> 00:28:44,645
Have we gone too far?

470
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,029
We need to treat Eunsan’s mother well

471
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,543
But this is also the sincerity of Eun San’s mother

472
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:53,482
On the contrary, it's quite good

473
00:28:53,507 --> 00:28:55,350
Did you just see Yingzhi’s mother crying?

474
00:28:55,675 --> 00:28:58,145
Oh, now that it’s reached this point, it’s time to admit it, right?

475
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:00,360
Yingzhi’s mother is also quite pitiful, right?

476
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:03,211
But how old is she?

477
00:29:03,236 --> 00:29:04,395
How many candles should we put in?

478
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:06,162
Just insert one

479
00:29:06,187 --> 00:29:07,297
Ignition is very troublesome

480
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:08,429
Really? Well

481
00:29:09,036 --> 00:29:11,271
It should be fine if you insert it in the middle, okay?

482
00:29:11,825 --> 00:29:13,120
It would be great if you can persist to this extent.

483
00:29:13,513 --> 00:29:14,614
At least give it a blessing

484
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:20,443
Yingzhi mother

485
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,012
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you…

486
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:23,204
Here comes the surprise

487
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:24,631
what happened

488
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:26,252
Isn't she here?

489
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,923
Are you out?

490
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:35,524
Oh my god

491
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:36,083
Oh my god

492
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:37,553
Oh my god

493
00:29:39,566 --> 00:29:40,534
Come and help

494
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,885
Use force

495
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:50,798
pull up

496
00:29:51,098 --> 00:29:51,732
What should I do

497
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,625
what to do

498
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:01,642
How to do how to do

499
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:05,568
sorry

500
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,639
I wanted to perform well

501

uncle

503
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:47,975
Is that true? What?

504
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:50,657
Several mothers who died after falling from the building here

505
00:31:50,818 --> 00:31:52,434
Was it done by people from the rental area?

506
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,934
that

507
00:31:54,374 --> 00:31:55,776
It's all rumors

508
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:59,520
They are not residents who live here at all.

509
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,655
Who is that person?

510
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:04,223
How did she get to know these mothers?

511
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:06,610
I don’t know. Since then

512
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:08,669
No one said they had seen her, right?

513
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,205
Okay, then I'll go first

514
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,474
Goodbye

515
00:32:26,008 --> 00:32:27,768
They are the bad people

516
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:30,417
I will definitely find you a good friend this time

517
00:32:31,392 --> 00:32:31,892
Um

518
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:33,853
I will listen to you carefully

519
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:35,775
You can't be too picky about people

Eat some junk food occasionally

521
00:32:38,485 --> 00:32:38,993
Um

522
00:32:40,746 --> 00:32:41,476
It's now

523
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:45,832
do not come

524
00:32:46,653 --> 00:32:47,435
go away

525
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:48,695
