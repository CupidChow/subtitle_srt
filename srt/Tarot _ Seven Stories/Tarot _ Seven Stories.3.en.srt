The atmosphere here is really nice

Delivery location is locker six

6
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:05,702
According to my statistics

7
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:08,117
Possibility of prank up to 70%

8
00:01:09,784 --> 00:01:12,120
But I will still go why

9
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:14,176
Because I received a takeout order

10
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,071
What exactly is...

11
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,927
Just as I expected

12
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:29,427
What's this

13
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:32,835
hateful

14
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,445

(Priestess)

16
00:01:41,323 --> 00:01:42,157
What's this

17
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:44,673
Is it a reward for delivery people?

18
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:54,590
Hello

19
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:56,017
May I ask who it is?

20
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:57,140
Dear customers

21
00:01:57,165 --> 00:02:01,210
Thank you very much for taking the time to do this kind of prank.

22
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:03,941
You're welcome, dear customer

23
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:05,343
Even though it’s a prank, you have to go all out

24
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:07,782
Even if it’s a prank, don’t take it to heart

25
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:09,634
I wish you a long life

26
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:13,288
Let's go

27

You receive an order

00:02:57,675 --> 00:03:00,398
How many orders did brother deliver today?

39
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,399
I only made 80 pictures.

40
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:05,870
Oh my gosh, there should be more than a thousand orders this month.

41
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:08,912
He is indeed the ace delivery guy

42
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:11,253
Brothers salute the ace delivery man

43
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:12,449

Get up and hate me

46
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,896
Sit down and don't be so formal

47
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,299
Sit down, sit down

48
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:26,504
Hurry up and take the order. There are a lot of orders today.

49
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:28,950
go ahead

50
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:29,475
Go quickly

Big brother

54
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:38,717
Why are you working so hard?

55
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:40,562
Qiyun, I told you before

56
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:42,320
I have made 100 million won

57
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:44,890

Big brother

59
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,672
If you open a takeaway company

60
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,473
Will you take me with you?

61
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,284
It depends on your performance

62
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:55,152
I beg you

63
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:57,208

73
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:14,095
If you were a friendly advisor

74
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:15,654
Can make a lot of money

75
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:19,524
You receive an order

76
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,740
Are my babies full?

77
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:28,233
When I make more money, I will buy you a wireless charger

81
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:45,827
Hello

82
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,052
Hello

83
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,554
Now that you’ve made so much money, it’s time to change your packaging.

84
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:52,657
Just because you steal a bunch every time you come here, you can’t change it.

85
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:54,435
Then let's live together

86
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:55,160
Don't play with me, got it

87
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,475
I'll take a bite

88
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,375
here we go again

89
00:04:57,524 --> 00:04:59,005
Anyway, this needs to be sent to Kaoleya.

90
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,109

92
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:04,779
Don't mess it up when sending it.

93
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:06,237
I'm the ace delivery guy

94
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,947
gone

95
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:12,036
Sorry to bother you, you're welcome

96
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:13,845
Goodbye

97
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:29,227

101
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:40,720
so cute

102
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:45,836
Hello

103
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:50,609
Thanks

104
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:53,718
I want to eat with my friends

105
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:56,655
Be careful about falling

106
00:05:59,544 --> 00:06:02,413
But I only have one pair of shoes. Goodbye

107
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,588
Wait a moment

108
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:06,198
Uncle is very tired, right?

109
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:12,190
Being a delivery boy is inherently tiring

110
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:15,478
Have a drink of water

111
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:19,355
Do you have chocolate milk?

112
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:20,612
No

113
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,914
chocolate milk

114
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:23,951
chocolate milk

115
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:24,692
It's fun

116
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:25,633
Yes

117
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:37,130
Drinking water is good for your health

118
00:06:38,503 --> 00:06:39,004
cheers

119
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:40,774
Drink it all at once

120
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:41,433
finish drinking

121
00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:54,806
Thank you, you're welcome

122
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:01,586
why so salty

123
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,401
I admit I'm handsome, but why did she give me water?

124
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:18,837
At least give me chocolate milk

125
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:21,439
He actually gave me some water

126
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:25,510
Always feel weird

127
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:44,796
Hello Yin Dongren

128
00:07:45,096 --> 00:07:46,087
What are you doing

129
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:47,198
Go out and vomit

130
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:48,800
go out

131
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:55,940
Almost choked to death

132
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:03,214
1259

133
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:06,631
No. 816

134
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:08,494
How many takeaways did she order?

135
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:13,958
Is it here? No?

136
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:16,828
good

137
00:08:21,707 --> 00:08:22,508
scared me

138
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:24,969
Please enjoy

139
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,646
Are you hungry?

140
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:28,633
Not hungry

141
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:30,436
It's meal time now

142
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:34,546
There's a call

143
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:36,323
Hello

144
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:37,515
Obviously no call

145
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:38,897
You are very observant

146
00:08:39,517 --> 00:08:41,186
But at the same time, I don’t know how to observe.

147
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,260
Then accept this

148
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,801
Just a tip

149
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:05,844
Miss

150
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,377
What

151
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,830
There are obviously so many delivery people

152
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,989
But it's amazing that we meet again

153
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:19,867
It doesn't feel magical at all

154
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:21,259
It's just magical

155
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:26,042
I have a way for you to send it to me

156
00:09:28,793 --> 00:09:29,845
6:55

157
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:31,889
I will order takeout every day and remember to take my order

158
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:40,255
Tasty

159
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:42,039
A smell

160
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:54,626
What's this

161
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:14,092
You receive an order

162
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:15,359
I'm leaving now

163
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:22,574
No matter how impatient I am

164
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:25,290
Why should I take this order?

165
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:31,839
can we chat

166
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:32,473
Can't

167
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:33,507
Do you have a girlfriend

168
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:34,108
No

169
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:36,363
Do you often peek at women when delivering food?

170
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:39,926
Are there any scantily clad women?

171
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:45,844
Madam, why do you ask these things?

172
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,720
If you like that style of woman

173
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,859
You'd better put your things in quickly.

174
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:03,094
If you don't like it, I won't ask.

175
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:07,332
Once I fall in love with someone, I

176
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:10,101
Will try to cater to the other party's preferences

177
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:12,904
so called love

178
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:15,807
They have to sacrifice each other

179
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:22,307
It seems that you are a man of few words

180
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,002
My ideal boyfriend is a man of few words

181
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:26,268
lady is

182
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:29,163
It seems you don’t know me very well. I really talk a lot.

183
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:30,264
When I go to a coffee shop with my friends

184
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:31,765
I talked alone for four hours

185
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:33,133
I made them unable to stand me

186
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:34,418
Say I never stop once I start talking

187
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,435
Asked me if I had a motor on my tongue

188
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,747
You always say that to me

189
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:39,397
It’s okay even if you talk a lot

190
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:43,261
Why don't you come in and sit down?

191
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:46,938
Could you please go in?

192
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,385
I'm done

193
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:55,366
Miss

194
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:58,712
I don't need this crap

195
00:11:59,197 --> 00:12:00,832
Don't call me again, got it?

196
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:28,646
so troublesome

197
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,462
To start a business successfully

198
00:12:33,718 --> 00:12:35,453
The winner will be decided within 300 days

199
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:40,825
The entrepreneur who ultimately succeeded after investing hundreds of billions of won...

200
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:48,099
hateful

201
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:50,744
What's up

202
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:51,235
Brother Yin

203
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:53,780
The woman you deliver food to every day

204
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:55,437
We live at No. 816, right?

205
00:12:57,074 --> 00:12:57,684
Qiyun

206
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:58,285
yes

207
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:00,423
Do you know what article I just read?

208
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:02,121
To start a business successfully

209
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:03,381
The winner will be decided within 300 days

210
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:04,082
What

211
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,593
But one of those important 300 days was hindered by you

212
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:07,618
tell you something

213
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:10,130
What are you talking about? She's completely crazy.

214
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:12,298
Send out a takeout order every half hour

215
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,133
She would stare at me strangely when I was delivering food.

216
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:15,347
Then he asked me to take it back

217
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:18,829
Do you think the person she is looking for is you?

218
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:22,393
Hey, I won't go to her house.

219
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:23,134
What

220
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:25,461
Talking nonsense

221
00:13:28,153 --> 00:13:29,888
When can I be the boss?

222
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:32,316
Jinyo

223
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:34,125
The boss's illness is not recovered yet

224
00:13:39,764 --> 00:13:40,819
You really don't like me

225
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:43,863
Thanks for your hard work

226
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:45,878
I've heard strange rumors recently

227
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:49,669
Are you talking about the rumors about our relationship?

228
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:50,361
certainly not

229
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,620
When you deliver food, you didn’t deliver the wrong food, right?

230
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:55,166
who I am

231
00:13:57,268 --> 00:13:58,188
Ace delivery boy

232
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,025
I'm the ace delivery guy and I'm leaving

233
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:11,649
Oops, are there any takeout orders?

234
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,819
You receive an order

235
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:24,401
Hello

236
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:27,498
Hello, I am the customer service center of the head office.

237
00:14:27,523 --> 00:14:29,932
Are you the delivery boy Yin Dongren from Laidong area?

238
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:31,091
yes i am

239
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,255
May I ask if you have delivered food to Rosehill Apartments recently?

240
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:37,509
I have delivered food to so many places, so I must have been there.

241
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:38,109
What's wrong

242
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:43,248
A customer complains about sexual harassment against you

243
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:46,218
Said you looked at her lustfully

244
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:46,844
Excuse me

245
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:50,408
How do you look at someone with lustful eyes?

246
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:53,291
Do we still need to consider facial expressions when delivering food?

247
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:55,844
Then you have never sexually harassed a customer, right?

248
00:14:56,057 --> 00:14:58,005
No no

249
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:59,931
No, even if the customer comes first

250
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:02,426
She does this just to make things difficult for others, you know?

251
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:04,706
But due to company regulations

252
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:08,687
You will not be allocated orders until the complaint is resolved

253
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,874
What are you talking about?

254
00:15:11,723 --> 00:15:13,343
Takeaway order has been cancelled

255
00:15:15,913 --> 00:15:17,415
hateful

256
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:22,080
Is anyone here

257
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,476
Is it your fault?

258
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:31,762
That's right, it's you

259
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:34,499
We can't be like this as human beings, right?

260
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:36,094
Do you have a grudge against me?

261
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:39,456
I said I could cater to you, but you ignored me

262
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:41,305
Then withdraw your complaint against me first

263
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:44,085
Can I take your order?

264
00:15:47,378 --> 00:15:50,581
Why haven't I finished speaking yet?

265
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:54,185
This is ordinary garbage

266
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:08,199
Another 10,000 won

267
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,280
You have to add some money

268
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:11,302
Why

269
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:20,224
He actually regards me as his little follower

270
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:22,962
I'm Yoon Dong-in, okay?

271
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:25,063
Why do you still do this?

272
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:28,553
Really

273
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:33,724
Hey, these are newly bought shoes

274
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,435
After working as a delivery boy for three years, I actually experienced this kind of thing

275
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:47,999
Can't even wash it off

276
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:53,451
what on earth is this

277
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:55,887
Can't be saved

278
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:00,527
never mind

279
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:01,617
If I can earn 10 million won a month

280
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:02,820
Just buy another pair

281
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:07,091
Yes, I won’t care about you anymore.

282
00:17:15,654 --> 00:17:18,311
Didn't I just find something strange in your trash?

283
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:19,704
Don't put these in

284
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:21,872
My shoes are all stained. These are new shoes.

285
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:31,308
I told you not to put weird things, why is it still like this?

286
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:35,553
Didn't you put stones in it? Why is it so heavy?

287
00:17:41,472 --> 00:17:42,240
What exactly is installed?

288
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:46,631
hateful

289
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:39,483
What a shame

290
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,412
Is there any delivery person in this community that I can’t contact?

291
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:49,491
Didn’t I say it last time?

292
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:51,108
His name is Li Huan

293
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:52,540
How long has he been missing?

294
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:55,166
About two weeks ago

295
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:56,200
Two weeks?

296
00:18:57,368 --> 00:19:00,104
Hey, that stinky woman ordered takeout for the first time two weeks ago.

297
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:01,806
Am I exaggerating?

298
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,776
How can it be

299
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:06,844
Maybe it's just raw meat or something.

300
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:09,047
Feed that one and put it in the kitchen garbage bag

301
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:10,518
Who would put regular garbage bags in?

302
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:12,353
that's true

303
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,593
Hey Qiyun

304
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:15,286
You said before that you were working in a research institute before doing this.

305
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:16,487
Yes

306
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,230
What to major in

307
00:19:24,348 --> 00:19:25,383

308
00:19:26,017 --> 00:19:27,084
Life engineering?

309
00:19:28,632 --> 00:19:29,676
Is there any way?

310
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,370
Can you tell the difference between animal blood and human blood?

311
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:35,659
for you

312
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,497
Garbage bags Garbage bags

313
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:46,717
You thought I would just do whatever you wanted, right?

314
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:55,826
When identifying blood types, don’t you look at the agglutination reaction?

315
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:58,177
If that's really human blood

316
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:00,884
will be agglutinated in the human blood type detection reagent glass slide

317
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:02,319
I'll take that

318
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:05,202
Brother, go get the blood clot sample back.

319
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:31,362
It seems like she really killed someone

320
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:35,039
Hey Qiyun is here

321
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,715
You said before that someone disappeared, right?

322
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:39,170
Do you want to contact him?

323
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:41,872
Wait a moment

324
00:20:42,648 --> 00:20:45,117
How could she let me throw these things away?

325
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:47,187
If you just throw it away, someone will find it.

326
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:49,346
Cut off the meat bit by bit to reduce the size...

327
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:50,614
Oh so terrible

328
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:52,542
In the end, only the bones are left. Where do you plan to bury them?

329
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:56,695
If I get another order from her,

330
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,222
Just bring that blood clot back with you

331
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,868
Hey, do you think I dare to go again?

332
00:21:01,892 --> 00:21:03,694
No matter what, she is still a woman

333
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:06,363
If I don't go, let me take her order.

334
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,873
I'll call the police directly after I go there

335
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,202
I know, help me push Qiyun first

336
00:21:11,616 --> 00:21:12,417
good

337
00:21:17,672 --> 00:21:19,365
Didn't she really kill someone?

338
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:22,680
Do you want to call the police?

You receive an order

Is it too big?

345
00:22:02,012 --> 00:22:03,120
