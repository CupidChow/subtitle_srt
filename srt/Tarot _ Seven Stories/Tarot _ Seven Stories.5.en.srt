4
00:00:56,506 --> 00:00:58,474
You asked me what happened at that time

5
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:01,691
Oh, I remembered

6
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:03,658
When I walked out of the hotel

7
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:05,832
Something bad happened

8
00:01:06,373 --> 00:01:07,109
What's up

9
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:31,693
how so

10
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:32,134
(Lift failure)

11
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,313
My legs are weak

12
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:38,040
(Lift failure)

13
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:39,996
Yanxi, how long have you been with our company?

14
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:41,332
5...5 years 5 years?

15
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:43,177
There is no tissue in No. 302

16
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:45,546
No. 307 has no sheets.

17
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,780
Didn't empty the trash can

18
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:47,947
the most important is

19
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:50,117
This ball pen… why not

20
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:51,718
Why does it always disappear from the guest room?

21
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:53,911
Did I ever say that I should be optimistic about the ball pen? It's not what you said.

22
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:56,356
Ball pen... sorry

23
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,050
I've bought five boxes of ball pens

24
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:01,060
Excuse me, why don't you take good care of your ball pen?

25
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:02,195
Why can’t I do it well every time?

26
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,930
Boss, I will do a good job

27
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:06,090
Do I need to prepare a ball pen every day?

28
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:10,394
hateful

(Please return the access card here)

31
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:22,866
I searched online because I was curious about the meaning of that card.

32
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:25,175
What about a free-spirited playboy?

33
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:30,881
Actually, that's not wrong

34
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,184
But cheating is not a crime, right?

35
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:35,127
Did I say I wanted to know this?

36
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:39,203
That one?

37
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:41,449
good

38
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,264
Let me tell you now

39
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:51,347
(tarot cards)

40
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:54,483
(go home)

41
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:55,380
Um

42
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:58,409
Either a group dinner or a small group dinner

43
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:02,858
It’s really annoying when the minister is drunk.

44
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:05,659
Who can take care of him if not me?

45
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:07,461
Were you in the bathroom and heard the echo?

46
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:07,952
What

47
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:11,107
Currently...Director and others...

48
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,151
Vomited until it was a mess

49
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:14,544
Hurry up and call a taxi to take him back.

50
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:15,902
I have to send him home

51
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:17,528
How can we let him take a taxi back?

52
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,781
So when are you planning to come back?

53
00:03:20,665 --> 00:03:22,700
Oh, the minister is out

54
00:03:22,877 --> 00:03:24,595
Just wait a moment and I'll leave

55
00:03:24,902 --> 00:03:25,436
good

56
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,390
Have I become a minister again?

57
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:30,419
So are you still having sex with the minister from behind?

58
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,295
do not talk like that

59
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:35,345
Section Chief Gao Qinglai

60
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:37,668
You have to go all out for the minister

61
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:41,638
It's time for me to go back. Something bad happened at home.

62
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:43,221
I gotta go

63
00:03:52,897 --> 00:03:55,008
What's the matter? We can meet again soon.

64
00:03:57,254 --> 00:03:58,411
You also know how to let a woman stay in a hotel by herself

65
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:00,073
That's scum, right?

66
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:03,425
I carefully came to such a far place

67
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:05,598
If I could always find an excuse

68
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:08,063
But today... I'm really tired

69
00:04:09,673 --> 00:04:10,341
are you tired

70
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:13,637
Then I have to change my mind too

71
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:15,428
If you leave now

72
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:17,169
I need to call Jiyeon directly

73
00:04:17,194 --> 00:04:17,761
What

74
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:20,045
Do you think I don’t even know your wife’s number?

75
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:25,756
Don’t you have a number?

76
00:04:26,062 --> 00:04:27,187
Yes, I have

77
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,331
elder brother

78
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:45,984
Did I say not to play this?

79
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:47,344
i really care

80
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:52,135
Joo Hee, please don’t do this.

81
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:54,034
Jiyeon has a bad temper

82
00:04:54,058 --> 00:04:55,293
She will definitely go to the company and cause an uproar

83
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:58,194
It wouldn't do you any good if it spread.

84
00:04:58,735 --> 00:05:00,017
Do you think…

85
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,086
I can't do it, right?

86
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,604
sorry

87
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:10,206
You also know that I only have you in my heart

88
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:11,992
don't call

89
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:12,862
do you know

90
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:35,592
I'm in Jiangnan

91
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,211
It should be right in the center of Gangnam Station.

92
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,110
Um

93
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,278
Today is a hot Friday

94
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:42,772
Why call a taxi at this hour?

95
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,017
It really gives me a headache

96
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,907
Why don't you just rest in the jjimjilbang for one night?

97
00:05:50,932 --> 00:05:52,618
Can you take the first bus back tomorrow morning?

98
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:55,639
Didn't I just call a taxi?

99
00:05:55,886 --> 00:05:57,154
A young man from nowhere

100
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:59,013
How dare you jump in line

101
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:00,845
I almost grabbed him by the collar

102
00:06:01,437 --> 00:06:01,917
yes

103
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,914
Got it, got it, I'll keep calling a taxi

104
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:07,543
Well I love your wife

105
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:14,381
That... uncle

106
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:15,573
Please help me charge my phone

107
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:16,830
OK

108
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:31,060
In the middle of Gangnam Station

109
00:06:31,322 --> 00:06:33,133
But not a single building is hateful

110
00:06:33,157 --> 00:06:35,226
Is the country subjugated?

111
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:36,542
right

112
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,340
What

113
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:41,665
uncle

114
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:44,300
Have you cheated?

115
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:46,689
No

116
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:49,298
It's a long story

117
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,385
I was fired from the company

118
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,452
But not brave enough to tell my wife because I feel embarrassed

119
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:57,958
I knew he was cheating as soon as I saw it

120
00:06:57,982 --> 00:06:59,817
It doesn't matter, we all understand

121
00:07:01,385 --> 00:07:04,531
As a wife, she always interferes with our outside affairs.

122
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:07,067
Don’t hate it. Didn’t your husband make money for her?

123
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:07,834
Since you are living with that money

124
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:10,895
You should be honest, right?

125
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:11,802
yes

126
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,112
If it had happened in the past, I would have taught you a lesson directly.

127
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:21,979
My temper is much better now

128
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:28,078
This guy…

129
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:29,332
that…

130
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:32,329
Why is this damn guy riding a motorcycle like this?

131
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:34,084
Bastard, you're going to die today

132
00:07:37,888 --> 00:07:42,259
Hey brat, how do you drive? Bastard

133
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:50,027
The brat who doesn't even dare to respond

134
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:57,261
Well...I want to check my phone

135
00:07:57,641 --> 00:07:58,642
Not fully charged yet

136
00:08:00,578 --> 00:08:02,346
It's all that damn bastard's fault

137
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,249
Reminds me of the past

138
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:09,098
I think back then I was...

139
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:11,856
People who have eaten national food

140
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:13,757
I usually do the job of interrogating people.

141
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:17,287
Who hasn't seen the abomination at that time?

142
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:21,303
I can tell a liar right away.

143
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:23,880
look at this bastard

144
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:26,221
You did it, right?

145
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,894
Why don't you confess that brat quickly?

146
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:36,078
If he keeps lying, he should be slapped on the chin.

147
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:40,751
Then hang him upside down

148
00:08:40,997 --> 00:08:41,731
So….

149
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:48,085
He will urinate until all is confessed

150
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,683
Then someone died and I was fired.

151
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,766
These bastards have been resting like this for a long time.

152
00:08:58,215 --> 00:09:00,518
Damn bastard

153
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:03,404
hateful

154
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:03,952
(ID card)

155
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,564
What are you doing

156
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:10,058
What

157
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:12,001
The laces of my leather shoes are loose

158
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:20,776
What you do depends on the front

159
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:24,474
that

160
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:27,270
This is my distant cousin's personal taxi

161
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:30,153
I'm temporarily borrowing it to drive and do some business.

162
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:30,846
Work night shift

163
00:09:33,048 --> 00:09:35,417
(Company name: Yongzhu Business Name: Kang Chung-il)

164
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:35,764
Damn it, you thought I could kill people and steal cars.

165
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:37,109
is that so

166
00:09:37,874 --> 00:09:38,308
Yeah

167
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:40,710
if that's really the case

168
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:43,113
I must have sold my anonymous car and ran away.

169
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:49,948
Hey what's wrong

170
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:51,243
Brother where are you

171
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:54,191
I will arrive soon

172
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:55,517
The one I caught today

173
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,164
The customer requested that it be delivered as soon as possible

174
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,697
I know, I'll go there after I'm done.

175
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:02,900
OK

176
00:10:11,688 --> 00:10:13,302
Is this...is this the right way?

177
00:10:13,857 --> 00:10:16,693
What? I have to pass by a place temporarily

178
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:18,501
I will deduct this part of the taxi fare

179
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,989
Uncle, I'm a little anxious now

180
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:23,628
(empty truck)

181
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:24,514
Listen to me, it's better to go in while my wife is asleep.

182
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:01,978
The meter...hasn't turned on yet

183
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:01,837
(empty truck)

184
00:11:02,878 --> 00:11:03,379
right

185
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:05,395
yes

186
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:13,108
I need to take a pee

187
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:38,640
(empty truck)

188
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,782
Why don't you listen to the phone? Damn it?

189
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,458
Already caught and put in the trunk of the car

190
00:11:58,482 --> 00:11:59,650
Damn it, it's almost freezing to death

191
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:02,826
Hello

192
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:05,914
How much is left after draining the blood?

193
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:09,377
Yeah

194
00:12:10,194 --> 00:12:13,231
But the liver and kidneys must be very fresh

195
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:14,323
why not buy those

196
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,533
Um

197
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,971
Can't feed

198
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:24,155
This time the size is huge

199
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:26,610
You have to give a good price, you know?

200
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:30,456
And you brats must abide by the time.

201
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:32,043
I was freezing to death in the mountains

202
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:32,922
Catch up, brat

203
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:38,255
hateful

204
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:46,429
it hurts

205
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:47,809
What did you say

206
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:54,386
What scares you like this?

207
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:04,579
Did you go pee?

208
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:14,102
I'm asking if you went to pee.

209
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:16,486
yes

210
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:20,737
Now that I’m done peeing…

211
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,200
Then go in. It's quite cold.

212
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:27,905
yes

213
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:33,470
Why are you standing all the time?

214
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:35,905
yes

215
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:38,361
yes

216
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:42,497
It's so cold. Damn it, I'm almost freezing to death.

217
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:48,885
You can get in the car first, okay?

218
00:13:56,645 --> 00:13:58,647
(empty truck)

219
00:13:58,734 --> 00:14:00,803
Come on, get in the car. What are you doing here? It's so cold.

220
00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:09,658
(empty truck)

221
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:23,069
Cold, cold

222
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:25,529
that…

223
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:26,062
What's wrong

224
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:26,754
Give me my phone

225
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:28,899
Well… mobile phone

226
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:34,513
Damn it, no charge at all

227
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:35,214
What

228
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:37,708
It happens occasionally, but I didn't expect that my old habit has recurred.

229
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:39,676
Damn it. I should have bought a new one sooner.

230
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,584
hateful

231
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:45,655
Is anyone else coming?

232
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:50,666
Why are you so curious about everything?

233
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,591
Do you really want to know?

234
00:14:56,859 --> 00:14:59,261
He is the one who buys things

235
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,933
Second-hand transactions such as second-hand transactions

236
00:15:05,969 --> 00:15:08,505
Driving a taxi at night makes a decent income

237
00:15:15,084 --> 00:15:15,617
Yeah

238
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,402
Am I second-hand? Asshole

239
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,651
Am I second-hand? Asshole

240
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:18,532
I'm a self-defense bastard

241
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,533
(empty truck)

242
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:55,564
hateful

243
00:16:56,477 --> 00:16:57,247
what to do

244

245
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,501
(1 unread SMS merchant)

246
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:11,439
(Businessman: They are expected to arrive within 5 minutes. It is the first time to meet, so don’t be surprised)

247
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:51,860
We have been talking on the phone for the first time today.

248
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,222
oh…

249
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,517
All the young people here are welcome.

250
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,260
Where is the thing?

251
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:00,701
before that

252
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,120
Can you pull the car out first?

253
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:03,947
Damn the tire got stuck in

254
00:18:08,952 --> 00:18:09,801
Help me

255
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:13,320
hurry up

256
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:14,396
good

257
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:26,587
You have to keep your foot on the gas pedal

258
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:35,938
Parking Parking

259
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:42,370
(Personal from Seoul)

260
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:44,749
Really

261
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:46,909
thank you all

262
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:50,739
Where are your things sir?

263
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:53,697
I've put it behind

264
00:18:56,865 --> 00:18:57,701
have a look

265
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:01,303
This guy has been disobedient so I had to take action first.

266
00:19:01,637 --> 00:19:02,776
Made me sweat a lot

267
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:06,343
Still fresh

268
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:09,123
Where are the tools?

269
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:16,386
Open the trunk

270
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,714
Oh ok ok

271
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,139
Hey wife, sorry

272
00:19:39,822 --> 00:19:40,756
that…

273
00:19:41,637 --> 00:19:43,038
There was a car accident just now

274
00:19:44,594 --> 00:19:46,529
No, I did call a taxi.

275
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:52,555
What happened to him

276
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:53,535
have no idea

277
00:19:54,423 --> 00:19:55,625
Didn’t you agree to sell the deer?

278
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:57,105
have no idea

279
00:19:57,928 --> 00:19:59,095
How come you don’t know anything?

280
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:04,854
Wait a minute, you have to act more natural, you know?

281
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:08,181
But the taxi driver was on his way out

282
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:10,532
I lost my way and kept going in circles

283
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:12,455
Now the tire is stuck again

284
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:15,544
um sorry um

285
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:20,158
need more time?

286
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:22,713
No, this thing is bigger

287
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:24,173
We have to deal with it briefly

288
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:39,057
How much is left after draining the blood?

289
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,091
But the liver and kidneys must be very fresh

290
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:43,850
why not buy those

291
00:20:48,211 --> 00:20:49,679
hateful

292
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,094
Do you want to call the police?

293
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:55,725
Catch that kid first

294
00:20:57,487 --> 00:20:57,954
Hello

295
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:07,502
All right

296
00:21:09,332 --> 00:21:11,692
If you want to get people away, you need equipment to move the deer there first.

297
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:14,236
Do I want to move now?

298
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:16,238
Of course I want you to move

299
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:18,401
Because one needs to be prepared

300
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:22,584
Grab the front legs first, hurry up

301
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:23,513
front legs

302
00:21:25,627 --> 00:21:26,733
1  2  3

303
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:34,426
Tell me what you want to do

304
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:36,054
Actually it's nothing

305
00:21:36,446 --> 00:21:37,313
First we need to bleed

306
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,397
Put the front on first

307
00:21:40,422 --> 00:21:41,023
What

308
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,698
Put the front on first

309
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:45,502

310
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:47,089
1  2

311
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:50,033
Go up first

312
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:50,791
Shall I go up?

313
00:21:55,078 --> 00:21:55,995
That's ok

314
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,949
What do you want to go down to see first?

315
00:21:58,394 --> 00:21:59,591
If you go down first, you have to lift it up from behind.

316
00:21:59,616 --> 00:22:00,216
Lift from behind

317
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:04,018
Be sure to catch it from behind

318
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:06,528
Carrying 1 2 3 to and from inside

319
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:11,003
who are you

320
00:22:11,027 --> 00:22:11,740
let go

321
00:22:14,957 --> 00:22:15,858

322
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:16,666

324
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:23,473
where is he

325
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,129
Where are you?

326
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:25,918
what happened

327
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:26,743
hateful

328
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:27,749
Where did you go

329
00:22:28,178 --> 00:22:28,823
hateful

330
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:34,884
Damn it

331
00:22:35,585 --> 00:22:36,953
Where has this bastard gone?

332
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:44,065
Why can't I see it?

333
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:47,571
Mr. Damn, come here and we can handle it ourselves.

334
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:50,480
Damn it or I'm going to call the police.

335
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:52,136
What

336
00:23:03,212 --> 00:23:03,756
Damn it

337
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:06,216
hateful

338
00:23:07,943 --> 00:23:09,778
I'm a self-defense bastard

339
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:29,226
(empty truck)

340
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,523
hateful

341
00:24:07,956 --> 00:24:09,224
Did you see the photo I sent you?

342
00:24:09,777 --> 00:24:12,046
There was indeed a car accident. Why don't you believe me?

343
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:13,683
You said that the minister lives in Jiangnan, right?

344
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:17,587
Then turn on the GPS and send me a screenshot.

345
00:24:18,087 --> 00:24:19,189
I don't believe you now

346
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:21,836
Hello

347
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:24,726
Don't play tricks

348
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:26,338
Send me your current location too

349
00:24:26,362 --> 00:24:28,625
The call keeps getting intermittent. I'll call you later.

350
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,599
You can't hear what I say...

351
00:24:56,017 --> 00:24:56,841
What's up

352
00:24:59,268 --> 00:25:00,602
Come on, you are Gao Qing

353
00:25:01,202 --> 00:25:02,637
Please come with me

354
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,982
What happened to me?

355
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:06,058
I didn't call the police

356
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:09,714
Have you stayed in room 513 of Yushang Hotel?

357
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:11,107
7pm today

358
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:12,948
Then what

359
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:14,829
I'll tell you as I walk

360
00:25:15,011 --> 00:25:15,778
Let's go first

361
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:33,641
(scientific search)

362
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:37,286
What on earth was this stabbed with?

363
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:40,111
Please take a photo from a close distance

364
00:25:40,136 --> 00:25:40,696
yes

365
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:47,118
What happened after you and Lee Joo-hee entered the hotel?

366
00:25:47,143 --> 00:25:48,244
Please tell me everything

367
00:25:50,272 --> 00:25:51,340
Stayed for about an hour

368
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:53,335
I `m coming out

369
00:25:54,924 --> 00:25:55,825
also by phone

370
00:25:56,547 --> 00:26:01,797
But she said she heard someone knocking on the door

371
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:03,778
I remember it was like this

372
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:05,671
Don't make up random stories

373
00:26:05,695 --> 00:26:07,551
After investigation, no trace of intrusion from outside was found.

374
00:26:09,224 --> 00:26:10,352
That's legitimate defense

375
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:13,435
What did you say

376
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:14,723
justifiable defense?

377
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,182
You thought...I couldn't do it, right?

378
00:26:23,853 --> 00:26:24,687
sorry

379
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:27,496
You also know that I only have you in my heart

380
00:26:28,403 --> 00:26:29,137
don't call

381
00:26:33,996 --> 00:26:34,663
Well

382
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:35,834
I want to take what you just said

383
00:26:35,858 --> 00:26:37,894
Also tell your wife Jiyeon in person

384
00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:41,125
0105013…

385
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,317
found it

386
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:46,354
Oh my god

387
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,671
Are you Zhiyan, the wife of Section Chief Gao Qinglai?

388
00:26:50,245 --> 00:26:52,050
My relationship with him…

389
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:53,977
very close

390
00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:56,611
Do you know what he just said to me?

391
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:59,761
Said he only has me in his heart

392
00:27:02,752 --> 00:27:03,720
hateful

393
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:14,756
Damn it's trouble

394
00:27:19,668 --> 00:27:21,470
In fact, she is a very scary woman

395
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,506
She has been threatening me since before

396
00:27:24,907 --> 00:27:26,518
Said to tell my wife

397
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:29,178
And she colluded with the taxi driver

398
00:27:29,672 --> 00:27:32,217
You want to kill me and you want to buy and sell my organs?

399
00:27:34,008 --> 00:27:35,454
what do you mean

400
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:37,194
Mr. Police, don’t you know that too?

401
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:39,465
How dangerous is this world?

402
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:41,666
If you appear weak, others will try to bully you.

403
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:43,641
If you want to protect me and my family

404
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:46,633
We should move forward bravely like them

405
00:27:46,658 --> 00:27:47,463
Yes Yes

406
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,931
Liu Yingzhe said the same thing

407
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:57,539
What are you doing

408
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,067
What's wrong

409
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:26,961
Why are you so tired today?

410
00:28:27,503 --> 00:28:30,173
I almost died while hailing a taxi again.

411
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,408
It's all Minister Liang's fault. What do you call this?

412
00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:34,743
Are you lying again?

413
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,498
I just contacted Agent Park

414
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,490
He said there was no dinner party today

415
00:28:39,515 --> 00:28:41,993
The minister didn't ask me to come out alone and go together.

416
00:28:42,018 --> 00:28:44,335
Does it have to be a dinner party to be called a dinner party?

417
00:28:45,021 --> 00:28:46,616
After inviting the staff of the group to have a meal

418
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:49,831
The minister said a friend of his opened a bar

419
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,393
So we were the only ones to go

420
00:28:51,712 --> 00:28:53,549
I will believe you for the moment today

421
00:28:54,034 --> 00:28:55,903
You must wake up

422
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:59,176
Bao Lan got into a fight with her classmates at school today

423
00:28:59,300 --> 00:28:59,834
What

424
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:02,384
She has been waiting for her father because she is sad

425
00:29:03,345 --> 00:29:04,546
do you really want this

426
00:29:06,023 --> 00:29:07,521
Dad, why haven't you come back yet?

427
00:29:07,797 --> 00:29:09,532
Yeah sapphire blue

428
00:29:10,678 --> 00:29:12,747
Dad was on his way to get off work today

429
00:29:13,315 --> 00:29:14,650
A lot of tiring things happened

430
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:16,196
haven't you slept yet

431
00:29:16,952 --> 00:29:18,153
I woke up

432
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,574
Yeah

433
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,777
But Bao Lan, why did you fight at school today?

434
00:29:23,118 --> 00:29:24,286
Not a fight

435
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,848
The teacher made a mistake

436
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,676
You didn't lie to dad, did you?

437
00:29:30,172 --> 00:29:31,974
You can tell dad everything

438
00:29:32,435 --> 00:29:34,203
It was she who hit me first

439
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,691
That's why I fought back

440
00:29:36,537 --> 00:29:37,605
Dad told you before, right?

441
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:40,501
Don't let others look down upon you, you know?

442
00:29:40,942 --> 00:29:43,144
No one should suffer losses while living

443
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,380
but…

444
00:29:44,914 --> 00:29:47,016
Well done I hit her more often

445
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,759
Papa Baolan is coming soon

446
00:29:50,784 --> 00:29:51,853
I'll go home right away

447
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:53,555
Um

448
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:08,382
(The so-called husband and wife are not half of each other, but two become one. Because it is you, because we are together)

449
00:30:15,723 --> 00:30:19,927
(Adventure and Wandering Card)

450
00:30:49,940 --> 00:31:00,521
(The card of Adventure and Wandering reversed indicates rash and reckless decisions)
