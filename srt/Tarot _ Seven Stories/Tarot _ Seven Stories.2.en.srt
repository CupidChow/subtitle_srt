00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:40,409
(tarot cards)

2
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:44,966
(This program is sponsored by the Broadcasting and Communications Development Fund of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Information and Communications Technology)

3
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:47,669

4
00:00:51,745 --> 00:00:53,990
Ask the groom to smile brighter

5
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:56,793
I'm going to take 1 2 Okay

6
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:59,924
Okay, let’s take the photo together this time, friends.

7
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:02,366
friends of the groom

8
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,792
Don't just stand and take pictures together, come on

9
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:07,367
I'm going to shoot

10
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:10,412
funny 1 2

11
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,440
OK, shoot again 1 2

12
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:20,827
Hey what's wrong

13
00:01:22,576 --> 00:01:23,577
Hey Yingxi

14
00:01:30,985 --> 00:01:31,819
Brat

15
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:33,335
Are you so nervous?

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,896
It's not that I'm nervous but I really want to vomit.

17
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,258
Really

18
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:43,130
Your good times are also over

19
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:45,392
You are already a married man

20
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:47,334
Will you marry Yinmei?

21
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:49,270
When do you plan to get married?

22
00:01:52,226 --> 00:01:53,709
Make a meeting ceremony first so that both parents can meet each other.

23
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:55,835
Then set a date this year

24
00:01:56,477 --> 00:01:59,589
Please consult before setting a date.

25
00:01:59,613 --> 00:02:00,797
It is said that there are many such companies

26
00:02:01,227 --> 00:02:02,928
What to consult

27
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,118
Marriage makes people very realistic

28
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,954
You need to cheer up

29
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,790
I'm going out first

30
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:10,867
Come out after washing your hands

31
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:12,230
Okay, let's go first

32
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:13,807
Brat

33
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,301
As a man, he is so timid

34
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:21,402
What's this

35
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:29,761
(The Class Couple Manager)

36
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:28,209
couple manager

37
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,514
That's too late

38
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:43,644
(tarot cards)

39
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:46,957
(The Class Couple Manager)

40
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:24,031
This painting is called "The Hermit"

41
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,439
Are you the manager?

42
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,681
He is a person who seeks the root of wisdom in the dark places of the world

43
00:03:35,943 --> 00:03:39,380
So hold a lamp and illuminate the world beneath your feet

44
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:39,732
(Hermit)

45
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,967
I have faith and religion

46
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:47,454
Not interested in these divination techniques

47
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:49,589
No difference, they are all the same

48
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:53,521
If you knew the cause and effect of everything

49
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:56,897
The future is already determined

50
00:03:57,998 --> 00:04:02,184
This destiny is what we call God, isn’t it?

51
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:11,242
(Hermit)

52
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,211
Mr. Park Minchan

53
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:13,981
You are a graduate of a 4-year university in Seoul

54
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:16,350
34 years old this year and a working professional

55
00:04:17,184 --> 00:04:20,519
Your girlfriend Chen Yinmei is your junior college student

56
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:23,927
I am 29 years old and have just joined a financial state-owned enterprise.

57
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:24,992
Right

58
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,160
is right

59
00:04:26,794 --> 00:04:28,405
Compared with those related companies in the industry, we here

60
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:30,779
has a stricter level

61
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:33,901
Judging from your girlfriend’s age and occupation

62
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:36,903
Belongs to the most popular class in the marriage market

63
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:39,269
Educational qualifications from family background

64
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:42,142
Judging from future prospects and appearance popularity

65
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:44,437
you

66
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:46,914
Compared to Miss Chen Yinmei

67
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:49,712
Instead, they belong to ordinary people

68
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:50,236
What

69
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,086
We have already agreed to get married

70
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:55,956
Why are you talking about level?

71
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:59,569
Because marriage will ultimately follow the hierarchy

72
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:01,004
Everything will be subverted

73
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:01,495
Miss

74
00:05:01,795 --> 00:05:03,807
Isn’t this the place to consult about weddings?

75
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:05,775
Is this a place that helps destroy marriages?

76
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:10,233
I'm the one who can help you solve the problems you're facing

77
00:05:10,257 --> 00:05:11,372
There's nothing wrong with me

78
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,934
I shouldn't have come

79
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,547
Wait a minute, I haven't officially started talking yet.

80
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:22,616
If you just leave like this

81
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:24,618
your marriage will be irreparable

82
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:34,617
I heard there is a good Chinese restaurant

83
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:35,729
Why don't you go and have a look soon?

84
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:38,978
More beautiful than silver

85
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,247
About dowry and betrothal gift

86
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:43,170
yes

87
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:44,481
Before the meeting ceremony

88
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:45,939
Why don't we talk first?

89
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:49,109
This one

90
00:05:49,702 --> 00:05:50,147
Um

91
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:54,481
But have you talked to your dad?

92
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:56,717
It's not like your father can sell his house in the country.

93
00:05:57,151 --> 00:05:58,652
Can you help me buy a house?

94
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,265
To be honest

95
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,124
I don't like starting our new life with full rent.

96
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:07,135
OK, I'll go talk to him.

97
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:08,986
good

98
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,281
Hye-won and her husband bought a house in a high-end community

99
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:12,232
so envious

100
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:15,901
Your girlfriend is an employee of a state-owned enterprise

101
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:18,826
And he joined a financial state-owned enterprise

102
00:06:19,626 --> 00:06:21,528
Now is the time to be easily shaken

103
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:24,578
Once dowry and bride price are mentioned

104
00:06:25,231 --> 00:06:27,462
She should change the topic to the issue of the wedding room

105
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:31,333
Tell you something difficult on purpose

106
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:35,098
Put this matter aside for now

107
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:37,739
I'm going to make a reservation at the restaurant next Saturday, okay?

108
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,267
Wouldn't it be better to simply let both parents meet as soon as possible?

109
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:43,864
Why are you so anxious?

110
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,065
It will be difficult to book a wedding hall next month

111
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:48,629
I think it would be better to do it after this summer

112
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:50,390
What is anxious

113
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:51,748
This matter was mentioned very early, right?

114
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:53,583
But I found that among my friends

115
00:06:53,607 --> 00:06:56,543
Some people live a life of free love without obtaining a certificate.

116
00:06:56,944 --> 00:06:58,045
Really

117
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:01,531
Occasionally when I hear such words, I feel envious of them

118
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:02,749
Really

119
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:05,628
When you mention the specific wedding date

120
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:07,120
She would make a joke and bring up the topic

121
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:09,432
Before I found a job

122
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:12,559
She is the one who is anxious to get married, isn't she?

123
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:16,897
Brother Mincan

124
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:17,831
Um

125
00:07:18,732 --> 00:07:21,502
I'm not saying I want to live that kind of life

126
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:23,741
You know my friends are very free spirited

127
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:24,905
What to do to be unhappy

128
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,939
All right

129
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:37,399
Anyway, what I said is right, right?

130
00:07:39,353 --> 00:07:42,871
So what should I do next

131
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:44,237
Do not worry

132
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:48,195
What you're worried about won't happen because I'll help you

133
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:52,175
Please tell me carefully what method to use.

134
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,201
My condition is that you don't ask this kind of question

135
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,458
I have my own way

136
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:00,322
Just trust me and do as I say

137
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:02,603
One thing is clear

138
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:04,526
Soon

139
00:08:05,073 --> 00:08:10,332
I will help you and Chen Yinmei walk into the wedding hall hand in hand

140
00:08:20,494 --> 00:08:23,730
There is one more thing you have to do

141
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,118
Brother Bingji, thank you

142
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,431
In front of my girlfriend

143
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:36,929
Look at this again

144
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:37,798
Hey, is it interesting?

145
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:40,047
It just pops up automatically

146
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:41,915
You are too rude

147
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:45,018
Don't eat it until it's everywhere. I don't have it.

148
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:47,554
Didn't fall off

149
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:50,523
Really right

150
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:51,925
Everyone

151
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:12,637
sorry sorry

152
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,823
you are crazy

153
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:14,548
sorry sorry

154
00:09:14,748 --> 00:09:15,625
I'll get you a tissue

155
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:18,201
Forget it, what's wrong with you today? You're so annoyed.

156
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,386
Sorry got it

157
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:22,142
Sorry, wipe it well

158
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:22,779
good

159
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:11,151
(This is a screenshot of Ms. Chen Yinmei’s chat content)

160
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,487
I envy Yinmei so much

161
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:18,554
I heard that I entered a training institution

162
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:21,224
Can you find someone?

163
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:23,593
What are you talking about? I have a boyfriend

164
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:25,361
To be honest, Minchan is older than you

165
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:27,254
My background is not as good as yours, and I am not an employee of a big company.

166
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:28,464
Based on Yinmei’s condition

167
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:29,532
Even if you fall in love and don’t fall in love, you’ll find a boy with a high-end career

168
00:10:29,556 --> 00:10:30,390
He wouldn't dare complain, right?

169
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:31,892
you are crazy

170
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,338
I would like to introduce someone who has this kind of profession.

171
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:35,220
Really

172
00:10:35,244 --> 00:10:37,266
How about I introduce to you the brother Bian Lixi I mentioned last time?

173
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,633
I got his photo and the future prospects are good.

174
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:40,684
He drives a Mercedes

175
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:43,452
Please keep it for me first and don't introduce it to others.

176
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:57,730
what you do

177
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,816
Minchan hyung, I haven’t taken a shower yet.

178
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:05,357
So what

179
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:08,495
Wait, are there condoms?

180
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:12,632
 <b>condom?</b> <b>Don’t you like wearing condoms?</b>

181
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:15,368
Do it later

182
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,184
It doesn't matter, I'm getting married anyway

183
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,507
Really

184
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:24,344
Do you know how worried I am that I didn’t have my period last month?

185
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:32,005
you…

186
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,851
Go out and buy it, okay?

187
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:47,200
Forget it, I'm tired

188
00:11:51,238 --> 00:11:52,172
I'll buy it

189
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:23,770
Tired

190
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:27,874
Thanks

191
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:31,695
Just now you went to the vending machine

192
00:12:32,345 --> 00:12:34,114
But I saw the way he came back without any coins.

193
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,734
Really

194
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:37,250
Yes

195
00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:40,930
This is my favorite drink

196
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:41,488
What

197
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:46,326
At that time, I drank a lot to wake up when I was looking for a job.

198
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,441
black coffee

199
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:52,532
My parents are still in the United States and I’m the only one back.

200
00:12:52,966 --> 00:12:54,034
So do you live alone?

201
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:56,303
I live alone in my apartment in Seoul

202
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,438
But it belongs to my parents and I have to pay back the rent.

203
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:00,842
When will it be repaid?

204
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:03,203
Working in a financial company makes a good salary

205
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,687
What is the starting salary

206
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:05,688
About 40 million won

207
00:13:05,712 --> 00:13:06,279
Yeah

208
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:21,453
My friend came to pick me up and left first.

209
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:23,244
Okay, bye

210
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:27,567
Brother Mincan

211
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:31,910
who is he

212
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:33,543
colleague

213
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,417
Didn't you come by car?

214
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:50,023
it is true

215
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:53,279
I'm not interested in him

216
00:13:53,593 --> 00:13:56,038
But he suddenly gave me a drink and wanted to get close to me

217
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:57,764
So you exchanged phone numbers?

218
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,171
He asked me and I told him.

219
00:14:02,254 --> 00:14:03,288
you are crazy

220
00:14:03,637 --> 00:14:05,348
Do you give your cell phone number to other men if they ask you for it?

221
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:06,740
All colleagues

222
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,904
If you don't give it, you'll look arrogant.

223
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:10,844
Don’t you also have the contact numbers of female employees in the company?

224
00:14:11,077 --> 00:14:13,522
Did I flirt with them and get off work together?

225
00:14:13,546 --> 00:14:14,014
talk

226
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:17,350
Don't yell at me

227
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:27,394
not you

228
00:14:28,462 --> 00:14:30,097
You know you've been acting weird lately

229
00:14:30,964 --> 00:14:32,432
Is this what you should say to me?

230
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:34,777
Never found a job and suddenly became the lowest employee

231
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:36,970
Do you feel you are superior to others?

232
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:43,088
Superior?

233
00:14:58,191 --> 00:14:59,559
Did Yinmei get home safely yesterday?

234
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:01,748
I'm sorry for losing my temper with you

235
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:06,047
It doesn't matter

236
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:07,527
enjoy your lunch

237
00:15:12,038 --> 00:15:13,372
How to do how to do

238
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:14,374
sorry again

239
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:17,000
I may be too tired from working overtime

240
00:15:18,011 --> 00:15:19,612
Let me treat you to a delicious dinner

241
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:27,220
please please

242
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:35,077
But today I had a dinner with my colleagues from the training institution

243
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:36,596
Almost all female colleagues

244
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:42,969
She is protesting to me

245
00:15:57,484 --> 00:15:58,151
Wait a moment

246
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:02,255
There's something here

247
00:16:41,454 --> 00:16:42,922
I have my own way

248
00:16:43,496 --> 00:16:45,098
Just trust me and do as I say

249
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,311
One thing is clear

250
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,215
Soon

251
00:16:49,803 --> 00:16:55,141
I will help you and Miss Chen Yinmei walk into the wedding hall hand in hand

252
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:01,641
I actually want to marry this kind of person

253
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:24,986
Are you leaving so soon?

254
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:27,507
I gotta go

255
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:31,343
It's still very early

256
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:34,981
Wait a moment

257
00:18:08,114 --> 00:18:11,033
what to do

258
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,062
hateful

259
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:22,529
Brother, I'm sorry, I just fell asleep

260
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:24,631
don’t worry

261
00:18:25,978 --> 00:18:28,681
I'm crazy, really crazy

262
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:45,138
Hey brother

263
00:18:45,652 --> 00:18:47,402
Are you really angry?

264
00:18:47,954 --> 00:18:50,471
I'm worried because you didn't reply to me.

265
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:51,803
I was very busy just now

266
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,933
Oh, you still work on Saturday?

267
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,796
I am really sorry

268
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,698
I promise not to do this again

269
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:01,367
I should go in and have a meeting.

270
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:11,894
You'd better put it down quickly

271
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,719
Marriage is a reality

272
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:16,669
Depending on your conditions, you can definitely choose a better man.

273
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:19,352
Why are you in such a hurry to marry Minchan?

274
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,888
what did you say

275
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,392
You need to let go quickly

276
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:29,010
Brother Minchan can suffer less

277
00:19:30,396 --> 00:19:32,180
I'm really not at the level you said.

278
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,472
What's not

279
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:36,996
As soon as we met, you said you were worried about getting married.

280
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:38,847
I always feel that I got married out of loyalty.

281
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:39,915
That's just...randomly...

282
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:42,008
Just talking

283
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:49,521
Why are you in such a hurry to go out that I haven't bought you breakfast yet?

284
00:19:50,116 --> 00:19:52,630
If it's convenient tomorrow, how about we go hiking together?

285
00:19:52,654 --> 00:19:53,255
Incredible

286
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:55,488
It's him

287
00:19:55,873 --> 00:19:56,908
how should i reply

288
00:19:57,523 --> 00:19:58,428
how to reply

289
00:19:58,452 --> 00:19:59,534
Hey, did you just say go?

290
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,136
Should I go? Yes, you go

291
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,172
But what should I say? It’s really embarrassing.

292
00:20:03,196 --> 00:20:04,981
Go there quickly and confirm your feelings

293
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:06,566
You also need to confirm his intentions.

294
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,268
confirmation…

295
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:09,969
right

296
00:20:10,436 --> 00:20:14,173
Let's at least confirm each other's feelings.

297
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:19,876
If you think I'm too impatient

298
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:22,327
Then I apologize to you

299
00:20:22,949 --> 00:20:23,616
No…

300
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:27,553
Last time... I also made a mistake because of drinking.

301
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:31,991
I'm not the type to interact with people casually

302
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:34,360
Everyone makes mistakes

303
00:20:34,772 --> 00:20:35,795
Plus we…

304
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:38,765
I have been stuck in the days of preparing for the exam.

305
00:20:39,044 --> 00:20:40,846
It’s not easy to be free now

306
00:20:41,988 --> 00:20:42,855
But Yinmei

307
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,872
Do you want things between us to be treated as if they don’t exist?

308
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:46,839
What

309
00:20:49,776 --> 00:20:50,519
Are you OK

310
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:51,444
It's okay I'm okay

311
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,561
I'm fine

312
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:56,403
have a look

313
00:20:58,151 --> 00:20:59,118
It must be painful

314
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:05,827
are you injured

315
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:07,141
No

316
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:10,845
That... what's wrong

317
00:21:11,544 --> 00:21:12,545
you…

318
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:16,215
Will you cherish me?

319
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:21,967
To be honest, I'm still thinking about my relationship with my boyfriend

320
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,598
Thank you for saying that

321
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:33,031
Yinmei, just trust me.

322
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:35,801
I'm serious about you

323
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:38,596
I will cherish you well

324
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:44,580
So…

325
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:46,966
I'll be talking to my boyfriend right away...

326
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,302
break up

327
00:21:50,622 --> 00:21:51,304
Thank you

328
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:54,040
correct

329
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:56,568
So today is our first day of dating?

330
00:21:57,844 --> 00:21:58,411
first day?

331
00:21:58,745 --> 00:21:59,145
yes

332
00:22:00,046 --> 00:22:02,115
Can we take a photo together to commemorate the first day of dating?

333
00:22:02,949 --> 00:22:04,592
Right here I think it's beautiful

334
00:22:04,936 --> 00:22:05,704
come here

335
00:22:07,332 --> 00:22:08,066
careful

336
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:10,944
Then... let's take a picture of that tree

337
00:22:11,224 --> 00:22:11,934
Over there? Yes

338
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,541
It's better to raise your arms a little bit

339
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,694
Come

340
00:22:15,828 --> 00:22:18,364
1  2  3

341
00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:24,783
What a great shot

342
00:22:25,171 --> 00:22:26,204
Take a look, okay?

343
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:30,199
What...what to do

344
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,236
Yinmei, believe me

345
00:22:33,413 --> 00:22:34,355
hold my hand tight

346
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,648
You have to hold my hand and hold on.

347
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,425
If you don't, I'll pull you up

348
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,786
Yinmei, hold on... hold on a little longer

349
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,621
Don't hold on

350
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,826
What should I do if Yinmei holds my hand tightly?

351
00:22:43,856 --> 00:22:45,158
Yinmei, what should I do if I insist?

352
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,927
Yinmei, what should I do if I insist?

353
00:22:48,227 --> 00:22:49,829
Hold on, Yinmei, hold on

354
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:51,831
Hold on, hold on, hold on...

355
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,677
What to do? What to do? What to do

356
00:23:10,198 --> 00:23:11,117
All sweating

357
00:23:19,025 --> 00:23:19,759
Oh damn it

358
00:23:21,373 --> 00:23:23,976
Now my mission seems to be over

359
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,206
Chen Yinmei's level has been lowered

360
00:23:29,836 --> 00:23:32,823
He fell from a high place and it was too late to save him in the mountains.

361
00:23:33,668 --> 00:23:38,167
(Tibial fracture Chen Yinmei)

362
00:23:33,673 --> 00:23:37,558
I’m afraid I won’t be able to walk like before for the rest of my life.

363
00:23:38,911 --> 00:23:41,881
Chen Yinmei has now been demoted

364
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,183
Lower level than Park Minchan

365
00:23:47,753 --> 00:23:49,789
I'm really sorry bro

366
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:54,994
Maybe I got carried away temporarily

367
00:23:59,832 --> 00:24:02,502
But I promise... I'm not serious with him.

368
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:03,718
that's because…

369
00:24:05,371 --> 00:24:06,906
he treats me well

370
00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:10,863
So I went hiking with him

371
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:15,281
elder brother

372
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:20,486
elder brother

373
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,537
are you listening to me

374
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:29,262
I was really wrong

375
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:31,563
Please forgive me

376
00:24:32,131 --> 00:24:32,798
OK

377
00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:37,803
elder brother

378
00:24:43,276 --> 00:24:44,710
Didn't you suffer a lot before?

379
00:24:47,713 --> 00:24:50,550
When your tuition fee is not enough, I said I will help you

380
00:24:50,762 --> 00:24:53,100
You would rather work the night shift than rely on yourself

381
00:24:55,975 --> 00:24:58,206
I think it’s normal for a person to think wrong temporarily.

382
00:25:04,263 --> 00:25:05,598
I can understand it all

383
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:10,669
elder brother

384
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,216
Thanks

385
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:20,500
thank you very much

386
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,565
Park will file your documents on behalf of you.

387
00:25:34,913 --> 00:25:36,563
Agent Park, have you been promoted?

388
00:25:35,162 --> 00:25:37,135
(2025 promotion list Park Minchan is promoted to section chief by acting)

389
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:37,261
Yes

390
00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:38,764
What section chief?

391
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:41,782
Great. Congratulations, Agent Park.

392
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:42,735
Thank you very much

393
00:25:42,995 --> 00:25:44,269
So handsome for you

394
00:25:45,364 --> 00:25:46,765
Thank you, you're welcome

395
00:26:00,353 --> 00:26:03,231
Advertisements should be inserted directly or...

396
00:26:03,255 --> 00:26:06,668
In this case...the situation may be better in the future

397
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,034
I don’t know what everyone thinks

398
00:26:10,796 --> 00:26:11,564
That’s pretty good too…

399
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:21,783
Section Chief Park

400
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,142
This is also troubling you

401
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:39,652
Brother, can’t you come today?

402
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,160
(Chen Yinmei has been expelled from the training institution due to insufficient attendance days. Notice hereby)

403
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:50,824
(The Class Couple Manager)

404
00:27:56,862 --> 00:27:58,275
There is no need to scold others for this matter

405
00:27:59,705 --> 00:28:01,722
After all, marriage is a reality

406
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:04,844
Looking for someone who meets your level as your significant other

407
00:28:06,512 --> 00:28:07,947
love between parents and children

408
00:28:08,141 --> 00:28:09,676
It will also vary depending on the conditions

409
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:11,257
This is the way of the world

410
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:20,259
If you don’t have the confidence to improve your level

411
00:28:20,726 --> 00:28:23,043
Then you can lower the opponent's level

412
00:28:26,198 --> 00:28:29,250
And that's what I do

413
00:28:30,749 --> 00:28:31,750
People

414
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:34,382
The worse your situation is

415
00:28:34,406 --> 00:28:37,576
The more we can't live without each other

416
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:38,944
Yes

417
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:42,491
Even if we see through each other's personalities

418
00:28:42,515 --> 00:28:44,016
But there will still be many people who maintain the status quo

419
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,289
I just hope he doesn't run away

420
00:28:48,713 --> 00:28:50,481
Just stay with me

421
00:28:51,903 --> 00:28:53,844
Maybe Park Minchan thinks so too

422
00:28:59,665 --> 00:29:02,868
I accept...your commission

423
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:08,522
Put you into the same level

424
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:10,958
I promise

425
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:09,470
1  2  3

426
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:13,759
Ok

427
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:14,960
Okay

428
00:32:15,921 --> 00:32:17,189
Thanks for your hard work

429
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:19,665
Come

430
00:32:20,432 --> 00:32:21,033
Help me sort it out

431
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:23,635
You have to behave well

432
00:32:24,737 --> 00:32:25,704
be careful

433
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:30,342
Too nervous. Maybe too nervous.

434
00:32:30,454 --> 00:32:32,244
relax relax a little

435
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:34,962
Let's start shooting when we get there

436
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:35,787
So handsome

437
00:32:35,908 --> 00:32:37,691
Come on, you two, come closer. He's so handsome.

438
00:32:37,716 --> 00:32:39,718
Come and start shooting 1 2

439
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,034
There is a pair of wings behind

440
00:32:46,058 --> 00:32:47,459
Really looks like an angel

441
00:32:47,772 --> 00:32:48,968
Just like spreading your wings and flying high

442
00:32:48,994 --> 00:32:51,035
Come and applaud together

443
00:32:51,397 --> 00:32:53,565
You two, please look here

444
00:32:53,818 --> 00:32:54,986

here

446
00:32:56,869 --> 00:32:58,270
Come 1 2

447
00:32:58,737 --> 00:32:59,738
My husband is so handsome

448
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:01,073
1  2

449
00:33:01,774 --> 00:33:02,641
1  2

450
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:05,310
1  2

451
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:11,050
Come and see here

452
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:12,651
Come 1 2

453
00:33:13,152 --> 00:33:14,253
My husband is so handsome

454
00:33:14,553 --> 00:33:15,254
1  2

455
00:33:16,321 --> 00:33:16,955
1  2

(Card of Wisdom and Sage)

457
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,992
1  2

458
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:34,200
(The card of Wisdom and Sage reversed indicates greed and carelessness)
