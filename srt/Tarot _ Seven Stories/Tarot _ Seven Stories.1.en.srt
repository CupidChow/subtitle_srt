Mom, let's go quickly

00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:14,034
Good mother is here

9
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,739
Let's go

10
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:26,953
Let’s eat first

11
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:28,382
Let's go

Mina

21
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:17,907
Didn't I say don't leave me even half a step?

22
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:20,100

Didn’t mom buy you a doll last time?

27
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,012
Mom is very busy today. Maybe next time

28
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:33,954
Okay, mom will definitely buy it for you next time

29
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:35,404
I want it now

30
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,871
Mom, promise you, I want it now

31
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,776
I will definitely buy it for you next time

Mina, let's go

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,567
OK

37
00:03:09,783 --> 00:03:10,684
Go this way

00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:19,760
How could this be?

41
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:22,477
Tinkerbell is dying

42
00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:26,433
Peter Pan cried while holding Tinkerbell

43
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:28,235
Can't

44
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:30,688
If children don't believe in elves

45
00:03:30,904 --> 00:03:33,073
Tinkerbell will die

46
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,717
If you believe in elves

47
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:36,009
Children, please applaud her

48
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:38,312
Hurry now

49
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:41,848
Mina, do you also believe in elves?

50
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:43,450
believe

51
00:03:46,553 --> 00:03:48,598
Many of you believe in the elves

52
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:50,390
Tinkerbell is alive again

53
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:51,825
Really? Mom

54
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:53,393
of course it's true

55
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:57,457
There is a spirit living in our hearts

56
00:03:58,548 --> 00:04:01,021
But if someone says there are no elves in the world

57
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:04,765
At that moment all the elves will disappear

58
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,374
Will we never see you again?

59
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:10,344
certainly

60
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:12,112
Never see you again

61
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:17,617
So you have to continue to believe in elves.

62
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,125
Do you understand

63
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:34,945
Didn't you play with Lily today?

64
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:36,303
No

65
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,306
Lily appears whenever no one is around

66
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:43,810
Lily seems to be shy

67
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:47,924
No, she has been to our house.

68
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:49,416
It's just that you don't know

69
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,086
Yeah

70
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:57,528
Where did Lily come in?

71
00:05:27,073 --> 00:05:31,244
Don't watch it, it will scare Lily

72
00:05:35,922 --> 00:05:36,956
knew

73
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:43,303
Mina is so good at telling stories

74
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:45,658
Let her become a novelist in the future

75
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:47,547
Maybe she will become

76
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:49,546
People like JK Rowling who wrote Harry Potter

77
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:50,550
Really

78
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:54,080
That's all because of being like you

79
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:58,234
When it comes to making up lies, no one can compare to you.

80
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:00,630
I won't scold her like you did

81
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:02,255
Will continue to let her lie

82
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:05,258
Only in this way can you write good works

83
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:08,124
What about Yin’s son-in-law?

84
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:10,756
I don't have any hope for him

85
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,052
I also want to find a job

86
00:06:14,296 --> 00:06:17,644
That...don't do unseemly work casually

87
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:20,006
I didn't send you to college to do this kind of thing

88
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:24,137
Hey, don't worry

Hello, I am An Zhiyou

91
00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:00,914
Have you never worked as a cashier?

92
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:04,164
I worked in a convenience store for three months when I was in college.

93
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:07,928
This is completely different from a convenience store

94
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,024
yes

95
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:15,831
If you are conceited because you are a college graduate,

96
00:07:15,856 --> 00:07:17,145
Just don't start doing it

97
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:20,200
The employees who work here are also university graduates

98
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:23,336
That's it

99
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:25,906
Start working on Christmas Day

100
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:28,850
What Christmas words

101
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:30,376
It's the day after tomorrow, right?

102
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,397
Yes

103
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:34,808
It's a busy day. You need to cheer up.

104
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,604
OK

105
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,712
But you also know

106
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,161
Our kindergarten will also have a holiday on Christmas Day

107
00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:51,164
Right, I guessed it too

108
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:53,733
Sorry teacher

109
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,769
OK, thanks

110
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,248
Feed mom

111
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:12,251
Can you spare time on the 25th?

112
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,275
That was my first day at work

113
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:16,141
But no one helps me take care of Mina

114
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:18,792
Isn’t the 25th a public holiday?

115
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:22,462
Which company requires people to work during public holidays?

116
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:25,432
If I'm not working in a company, I just have a part-time job

117
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:28,868
I told you not to do that kind of thing

118
00:08:29,536 --> 00:08:33,573
What should I do if I have no income next month?

119
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:36,142
What should I really do?

120
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,380
knew

121
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:55,904
(Yoon Jong Hoon is a scumbag)

122
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:07,734
Gregor looked out the window

123
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:11,711
The cloudy day made him feel melancholy

124
00:09:12,112 --> 00:09:16,145
He heard the loud sound of rain hitting the windowsill

125
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,539
(Franz Kafka, "The Metamorphosis")

126
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,687
Mina

127
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:22,335
This book is a bit difficult to follow, isn't it?

128
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:24,758
No, I find it interesting

129
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:27,427
But I'm sleepy too

130
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:28,995
Sleepy

131
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:30,330
Go to sleep

132
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:33,900
alright

133
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:38,938
Mina

134
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:43,109
Mom has to go to work tomorrow

135
00:09:43,677 --> 00:09:45,712
can you be home alone

136
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:47,681
Can

137
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:49,716
Is it really possible

138
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:53,520
Mom will prepare lunch and dinner in advance

139
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:55,651
I'll put it in the refrigerator

140
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:57,824
You can take it out and eat it yourself

141
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:02,762
Can I invite friends to my house?

142
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:05,965
 <b>friend?</b> <b>Do you mean Lily?</b>

143
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:09,836
I know you and Lily have fun.

144
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,777
knew

145
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,601
And if someone rings the doorbell or knocks on the door,

146
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:17,377
Never open the door

147
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:20,447
Don't make any noise like no one is home

148
00:10:22,428 --> 00:10:23,596
Why is this so?

149
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:29,989
Lily would be frightened if a stranger came in.

150
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:34,106
So this is ah

151
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:35,648
Got it mom

152
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,497
Go to sleep

153
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,184
I hate Christmas the most

154
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:53,246
do you know

155
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,716
I heard hundreds of children were sacrificed when Jesus was born

156
00:10:57,584 --> 00:11:00,019
It’s not a good day, but everyone wants to celebrate

157
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:01,187
I really can't understand it

158
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:03,913
Mina’s mother, see clearly

159
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:08,328
If a customer forgets to take something away after checking out

160
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:13,266
In principle, you should first get it to the customer service center to register.

161
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,202
But many people won’t come and get it

162
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:17,846
If you see this kind of thing

163
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:19,205
You put it under the cashier first.

164
00:11:22,075 --> 00:11:22,776
Then what

165
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:26,231
If a customer comes to the checkout looking for something, just leave it to him.

166
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:29,991
But people who live in that kind of high-end community

167
00:11:30,016 --> 00:11:32,185
I usually don’t come looking for small things like that.

168
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:33,405
Because it's troublesome

169
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:37,490
So it will be ours in a few days

170
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:41,628
Is this okay?

171
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,789
No one will care

172
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:47,167
And the manager seems to know about it but doesn't care.

173
00:11:55,408 --> 00:11:56,848

Let's go

00:12:03,283 --> 00:12:04,517

181
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:42,736
Hey Mina

182
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,890
You called me, right?

183
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,815
Mom was too busy and didn’t receive the call

184
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:47,847
Are you having fun alone? Have you eaten?

185
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:49,729
It was eaten

186
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:51,597
well done

187
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,521
Did you have fun with Lily?

188
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:54,743
no

189
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:57,370
It’s not Lily who’s here today, it’s another friend

190
00:12:58,765 --> 00:12:59,699
Who?

191
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:01,901
Santa Claus

192
00:13:04,303 --> 00:13:05,240
Santa Claus?

193
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:07,580
Yes the real Santa Claus

194
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:09,582
We are playing together

195
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:15,021
You didn't open the door for others, did you Mina?

196
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,357
No door opened

197
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:21,027
Santa Claus climbed down from the window

198
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:22,969
Yeah

199
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:27,342
Mom is very busy. I'll close the line first.

200
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:28,735
You better have fun

201
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:35,768
Feel sorry

202
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:48,885
(Did Mina have fun?)

203
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:40,046
worn out

204
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:46,306
Mina’s mother, hurry up and eat

205
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,627
Of course I have to eat it

206
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:59,422
(Baby girl: Mom, Santa Claus also gave me a gift)

207
00:13:52,492 --> 00:13:54,160
If you don't eat it now you will regret it

208
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:01,861
(what gift?)

209
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:03,913
You have to eat and then go to the bathroom

210
00:14:03,937 --> 00:14:04,771
If you don't eat it now you will regret it

211
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,718
I don't really need to go I need to

212
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:10,443
I need to go to the bathroom

213
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:21,726
(Did Eunji give this to you before? Mom doesn’t remember)

214
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:26,523
(I said it was given to my mother by Santa Claus)

215
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:30,927
(What does Santa Claus look like?)

216
00:14:30,927 --> 00:14:34,816
(Baby girl: tall with a lot of beard)

217
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:41,605
(With a beard as white as snow? And wearing red clothes?)

218
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:46,042
(No, it’s not a black beard wearing red clothes)

219
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:47,195
An Zhiyou, are you here for an outing?

220
00:14:47,676 --> 00:14:48,884
Why not just go to dinner and send text messages?

221
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:50,049
Come back after a cup of coffee

222
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:52,285
sorry

223
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:55,955
I told you it would be busy today

224
00:14:56,582 --> 00:14:57,349
Go out to work quickly

225
00:14:58,224 --> 00:14:59,189
sorry

226
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,042
Thanks

227
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:18,808
(Mina’s mother will go back soon to let Santa Claus go)

228
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:20,886
(We are playing a transformation game)

229
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:28,078
What are you watching when you're not working?

230
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:31,372
If you send text messages like this, you won't be able to concentrate on your work, my friend.

231
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:32,592
yes

232
00:15:34,636 --> 00:15:35,537
manager

233
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,792
can i go to the bathroom

234
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:39,799
What

235
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:42,843
You are really hopeless

236
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:45,039
I was sending text messages when I had time just now

237
00:15:45,063 --> 00:15:46,105
Just busy with your own things

238
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:53,976
I really can't stand it anymore

239
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:57,683
That would be very troublesome.

240
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:03,023
You really have no idea

241
00:16:10,443 --> 00:16:12,265
I'll give you 35 seconds to go and get back quickly

242
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:13,599
If you come back late

243
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,268
Don’t even think about working anymore

244
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:37,727
The call you made is temporarily unavailable

245
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:38,700
Please after one beep...

246
00:16:38,724 --> 00:16:39,492
It drives me crazy

247
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,028
(Yoon Jong Hoon is a scumbag)

248
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:58,211
Hey, hey

249
00:16:58,544 --> 00:17:01,180
If you have time now, go and see Mina

250
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:02,582
May I

251
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:05,527
What happened to you so suddenly?

252
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:06,686
I'm a little tired now

253
00:17:08,154 --> 00:17:09,188
Do you know where I live?

254
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:10,957
I'll pass you the password

255
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:13,793
Help me check if Mina is safe. I'm very anxious now.

256
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:16,796
No, I'm out of the country now. No, no.

257
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:19,385
What foreign country?

258
00:17:22,902 --> 00:17:24,103
Did you go play again?

259
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:25,972
Yeah

260
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,875
Feed this bastard

261
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:31,511
Your daughter is home alone for Christmas...

262
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,313
Do you still have the heart to travel with a woman?

263
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:40,353
Go to hell with this bastard

264
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:41,807
I'm going to kill you when you come back

265
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:07,346
Mina

266
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:08,727
Mother

267
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:11,734
Look at my dress, it still fits me

268
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:15,454
Mina's mother is very worried about you

269
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:18,257
I'll dance ballet for you

270
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:19,425
good

271
00:18:33,606 --> 00:18:34,240
Wait a moment

272
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:35,908
Wait a minute Mina

273
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:39,705
is there anyone beside you

274
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:43,416
this…

275
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:46,312
Who is taking the photo for you now?

276
00:18:47,888 --> 00:18:48,433
Mina

277
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:50,563
Mina

278
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:05,137
You went to poop, right?

279
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:07,306
That manager actually...

280
00:19:08,174 --> 00:19:10,176
I've been feeling a little unwell since this morning

281
00:19:11,177 --> 00:19:12,621
You can also deduct today’s salary

282
00:19:12,645 --> 00:19:13,546
I want to go home and see

283
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:14,713
sorry

284
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:15,548
All right

285
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:18,017
No wonder I think you don’t look good

286
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:22,548
You can resign if you want

287
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:27,223
(Snow Queen)

288
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,093
But it's best to make it clear before leaving

289
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:30,863
what is this

290
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,741
You come with me

291
00:19:44,674 --> 00:19:46,354
(Snow Queen)

292
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:46,715
Explain it

293
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:50,520
This is a customer who left at the checkout counter after missing it.

294
00:19:51,484 --> 00:19:52,824
I thought I would come back to find you

295
00:19:53,352 --> 00:19:55,187
So I put it on the cashier for now.

296
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:58,177
How did you learn about this kind of item before?

297
00:19:58,544 --> 00:19:59,245
Tell me

298
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:02,128
It's my first day at work today and I don't have time...

299
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:03,996
Say it how you learn it

300
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:13,406
Put it in the customer service center

301
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:15,800
don't you have time

302
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:17,743
I ate everything I needed to eat.

303
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:19,521
The text messages that should be sent have also been sent.

304
00:20:19,545 --> 00:20:21,047
There's still time to go to the bathroom

305
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:22,728
But you said you didn't have time

306
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,117
sorry

307
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:29,255
Now...my daughter is home alone

308
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:31,824
I'm really worried but I can't contact her...

309
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,198
Aunts working here

310
00:20:33,526 --> 00:20:36,362
I know how to steal sheep in this way

311
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:38,898
I originally wanted to see how far I could go

312
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:40,259
But you've been like this since the first day

313
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:44,976
manager

314
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,207
I'm talking to you, you should concentrate

315
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:49,342
don't make me angry

316
00:20:49,742 --> 00:20:51,577
Put your mind on your phone

317
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,278
I want to talk to my daughter on the phone

318
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:54,513
Give it back to me first

319
00:20:57,516 --> 00:21:00,353
I also know that in your case, you won’t call the police right away.

320
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,588
I need to go over and check the CCTV

321
00:21:02,988 --> 00:21:04,056
wait for me here

322
00:21:05,024 --> 00:21:05,791
manager

323
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:15,835
Ah, it's really hard to judge

324
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:19,782
It's hard to call the police just because of this.

325
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:21,540
It's not so much that she took it as her own

326
00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:23,477
It should be placed in the supermarket

327
00:21:23,502 --> 00:21:25,288
The aunt who manages to steal sheep in this way

328
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:26,773
But there are more than one or two people

329
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:28,781
If according to you

330
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:31,192
He should have put it quietly in his bag

331
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:32,852
This is the only way to take a picture like this

332
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:34,987
This is really difficult to judge

333
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:37,790
I'd better go to the police station

334
00:21:38,524 --> 00:21:39,225
You sue me

335
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,397
In addition, I will also sue you for stealing my mobile phone.

336
00:21:56,342 --> 00:21:57,176
Can you leave now?

337
00:22:04,496 --> 00:22:06,417
If something happens to Mina

338
00:22:07,686 --> 00:22:09,522
I will come back and kill you

339
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:29,375
Mina's mother will come home soon

340
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,376
What happened today

341
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,747
I spent the whole day playing with Santa Claus today

342
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,182
And danced ballet

343
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,151
I'm not asking this

344
00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:41,520
Tell me carefully

345
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:45,224
I also received a gift and had a lot of fun.

346
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:48,194
Santa Claus also taught me magic tricks

347
00:22:48,661 --> 00:22:50,429
Mom, can I show it to you now?

348
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:53,098
When will you become sensible?

349
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,570
Santa Claus is fake

350
00:22:57,837 --> 00:22:58,871
How can there be such a thing?

351
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:02,050
Everyone is bad except mom and you.

352
00:23:02,074 --> 00:23:02,975
Don't you understand?

353
00:23:04,242 --> 00:23:05,033
Mother

354
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,000
Answer me well

355
00:23:08,848 --> 00:23:09,548
You now…

356
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:10,883
is a person

357
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,011
Still with someone else

358
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:15,187
No

359
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:18,390
There's no one here

360
00:23:22,261 --> 00:23:25,297
Mom, go back now. You stay at home.

361
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,165
Mina

362
00:23:44,817 --> 00:23:47,620
Mom is worried about you

363
00:23:49,648 --> 00:23:50,415
Mina

364
00:23:50,823 --> 00:23:51,866
Have you been waiting for a long time?

365
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:52,558
Let's eat

366
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:53,559
ok

367
00:23:58,197 --> 00:23:58,898
Mina

368
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:05,604
My Mina

369
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:09,314
Are you playing hide and seek with your mother like last time?

370
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:11,277
knew

371
00:24:12,211 --> 00:24:13,846
Mom is here to find you

372
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:20,067
Are you scared when your mother talks to you loudly?

373
00:24:23,722 --> 00:24:24,723
Where is mom?

374
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:28,394
Worry about Lily and Santa Claus scaring you

375
00:24:28,894 --> 00:24:30,930
So I'm worried about you

376
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:38,459
Come

377
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:41,173
This is the only place left now

378
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:44,276
You'll scare me when mom opens it, right?

379
00:24:44,877 --> 00:24:46,679
Oh, I'm so scared

380
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:51,050
Come on, mom, open it now

381
00:25:39,224 --> 00:25:39,691
Mina

382
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:43,488
Where are you

383
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,161
Mina

384
00:25:52,324 --> 00:25:53,050
Mina

385
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:56,782
Mina

386
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,424
Mina, are you here?

387
00:26:01,953 --> 00:26:02,320
Mina

388
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:03,789
Mina

389
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:05,278
Mina where are you

390
00:26:05,557 --> 00:26:06,112
Mina

391
00:26:08,293 --> 00:26:09,881
Mom is in no mood to joke now

392
00:26:10,943 --> 00:26:11,710
Come out quickly

393
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:12,831
Okay Mina

394
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:39,681
("Peter Pan")

395
00:26:42,825 --> 00:26:44,360
("Peter Pan")

396
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:46,351
(How could this be possible? Tinkerbell was dying. Peter Pan held Tinkerbell in his arms and shed tears.)

397
00:26:46,376 --> 00:26:47,930
(No if the children don’t believe in Tinkerbell they will die)

398
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:49,232
(If you believe in elves, please applaud her, now hurry up)

399
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:51,567
("Peter Pan")

400
00:26:53,318 --> 00:26:53,852
Mina

401
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,249
There is a spirit living in our hearts

402
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:01,188
But if someone says there are no elves in the world

403
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,249
At that moment all the elves will disappear

404
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,351
Will we never see you again?

405
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:07,953
certainly

406
00:27:08,387 --> 00:27:09,788
Never see you again

407
00:27:17,663 --> 00:27:18,263
Mina

408
00:27:19,144 --> 00:27:19,917
Mina

409
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:25,270
Meina Meina

410
00:27:26,324 --> 00:27:27,826
Mina where are you

411
00:27:28,527 --> 00:27:29,094
Mina

412
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:32,110
Mina

413
00:27:33,078 --> 00:27:35,714
Mina, where are you, come out quickly?

414
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:37,820
Mina

415
00:27:40,085 --> 00:27:41,453
Santa Claus is fake

416
00:27:41,886 --> 00:27:42,687
How can there be such a thing?

417
00:27:43,088 --> 00:27:45,066
Everyone is bad except mom and you.

418
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:45,724
Don't you understand?

419
00:27:46,592 --> 00:27:47,477
Answer me well

420
00:27:48,731 --> 00:27:49,595
You now…

421
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:51,130
is a person

422
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:52,731
Still with someone else

423
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,175
The phone number you dialed has no user registration

424
00:27:57,569 --> 00:28:00,272
Please reconfirm and call again

425
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,983
I won't scold her like you did

426
00:28:03,008 --> 00:28:04,877
Will continue to let her lie

427
00:28:05,544 --> 00:28:07,713
Only in this way can we create perfect works

428
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:08,853
Tomoyuki

429
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:11,683
It’s time to stop talking about Mina, right?

430
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,861
Your daughter is home alone for Christmas...

431
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:16,421
Do you still have the heart to travel with a woman?

432
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:19,872
It’s here again. Don’t mention Mina again.

433
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:20,896
I'm in pain too...

434
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,328
Go to hell with this bastard

435
00:28:24,082 --> 00:28:25,016
Mina's mother

436
00:28:25,597 --> 00:28:28,021
I can understand you thinking of her every Christmas

437
00:28:28,046 --> 00:28:29,268
so call

438
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:32,371
It’s time for you to let go of Mina

439
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:46,552
Mina

440
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:49,848
you…

441
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,426
Not...here?

442
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:39,301
(The luck and opportunity card reversed indicates loss and misfortune)
