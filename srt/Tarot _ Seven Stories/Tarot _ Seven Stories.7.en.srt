Hey, why don't you have fun?

5
00:01:16,437 --> 00:01:18,806
Seeing how she looks, she will definitely agree if you ask her to go out for fun.

6
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:21,621
Are you so serious when you are in love?

7
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,879
certainly not

8
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:26,881
Don't be so boring

9
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,004
Life is meant to be fun, you know?

00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,492
knew

11
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:36,691
Just believe in your own looks

12
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:39,293
And I believe you okay

13
00:01:39,993 --> 00:01:40,960
Come up quickly

14
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:07,573
Hey, have you seen him?

15
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:08,713
So handsome

20
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:56,752
Hey, come in too

21
00:02:59,954 --> 00:03:01,889
That we...

22
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:06,314
We haven’t exchanged contact numbers yet...

23
00:03:06,714 --> 00:03:07,396
What's wrong

24
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:10,818
Do you want to have a sweet love with me?

25
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,687
No?

26
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,042
I wouldn't call you if I had a boyfriend

27
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,631
That's it

28
00:03:23,743 --> 00:03:24,244
Hello

29
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:27,916
You won't go to bed with me, will you?

30
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:31,501
I thought you were pretending to be cute on purpose

31
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:32,526
Turns out he is really an honest man

32
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:34,489
So funny

33
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:38,112
You've never been in love, have you?

34
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:41,048
no

35
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:46,320
I was... nervous...

36
00:03:46,987 --> 00:03:49,221

38
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:20,756
Because is you

39
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:23,290
Because I'm with you

So hot

45
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:38,522
Please help me take a look

Jae Yoon

47
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,762
She said it was hot and quickly helped her take it off.

48
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:45,285
The timer hasn't gone off yet

49
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:49,276
Customers say it's hot, don't you care?

50
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:52,111
Besides, when customers look at their phones, do you also look at your phone?

51
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:56,684
Is it hot?

52
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,419
It's been a little hot since I've been wrapping it for a long time.

53
00:06:05,618 --> 00:06:07,115
Are you Yu's hairstylist?

54
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:07,896
Yes

55
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,888
How long have you worked here?

56
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:11,232
a month

57
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,200
That's it

58
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:16,442
After the perm, other hairstylists will keep in touch with the customer

59
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:18,258
I can also send you a text message

60
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:28,115
for you

61
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:29,843
It’s great to be handsome

62
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:32,219
He is really stupid

63
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:36,739
In short, only one of the two interns is left

64
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:39,513
Just quit him with sincerity.

65
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:41,875
The problem is that it makes me depressed. I’m afraid I won’t be able to wait for that day.

66
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:44,298
You actually said that the timer hasn't gone off yet?

67
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,454
Really

68
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:54,548

Hello

72
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:15,021
What are you listening to? What are you doing?

73
00:08:16,023 --> 00:08:18,025
It's such a cold day and you still look poor

74
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:21,295
Hello

75
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:24,050
Have you paid your salary?

76
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:26,192
Lend me 1 million won

77
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:31,920
What should I do again? I have no money.

78
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:34,041
Even though I have no money, I still say I have no money.

79
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,789
Don't you guys even work on weekends?

80
00:08:37,544 --> 00:08:38,493
Do not lie to me

81
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:41,382
Didn’t I give you the rent yesterday?

82
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:43,762
I also paid off the loan

83
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:46,139
never mind

84
00:08:47,313 --> 00:08:48,948
I'm stupid for believing you

85
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:52,474
Clean up after eating

86
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:56,864
What are you doing here? Go and clean it up quickly.

00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:27,725
You messed up your hairstyle

89
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:30,497
I want to attend a parents' gathering. How are you going to be responsible?

90
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:43,757
(I’m off tomorrow, you can talk to other hairstylists and they’ll do it for you again)

91
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:38,324
I am off tomorrow

92
00:09:39,206 --> 00:09:43,277
Just talk to another hairstylist and they will redo it for you.

94
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,256
What do you want from me?

95
00:09:57,524 --> 00:09:59,326
What are you doing? Drinking.

96
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:01,331
I dated two girls I met last time

97
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:02,730
We agreed that the four of us would drink together

98
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:03,756
Just drink it at your house

99
00:10:04,131 --> 00:10:05,332
Go buy some meat and wine

100
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,143
Hey, I'm inconvenient today

101
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:09,145
You kid, stop pretending to be reserved.

102
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:10,938
It would be meaningless without you as the facade.

103
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:12,793
Anyway, I’ll close the line and see you later.

104
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,060
Hello

105
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:27,121
I didn't expect you to be so slow

106
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:29,709
(Perm customer Kim Hae Young: I didn’t expect you to be so slow. I went to the hair salon because of you)

107
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:29,456

Jae Yoon has been popular since he was a child

112
00:11:53,352 --> 00:11:55,221
We went to a boys' school

113
00:11:55,411 --> 00:11:58,145
Valentine's Day and White Day

114
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,446
He will definitely receive the chocolate

115
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:01,482
It was really funny at the time

116
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:04,678
Hey what are you thinking about

117
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:06,353
The atmosphere here is nice. Can you tell me something?

118
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:09,289
Come with me to eat something delicious later.

119
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:11,825
What do you want to eat

120
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:13,026
that…

121
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:18,431
Do you believe in...destined fate?

122
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:26,373
What? Are you born in the 1980s?

123
00:12:27,053 --> 00:12:28,922
Hey, do you know what he said?

124
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,211
What about destined fate?

125
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:37,804
We can be called girl killers if we don’t open our mouths in Yun

126
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:39,987
He's just too honest

127
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:41,188
so cute

128
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:42,856
It seems that you are a very simple person

129
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:44,944
Do you want to eat something sweet?

130
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:46,760
Do you want to go out for something to eat?

131
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:47,494
go ahead

132
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,701
let's go

133
00:12:49,262 --> 00:12:50,706
Let's go hand in hand

134
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:51,999
I'm going to buy cigarettes

135
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,455
Smoking less will give me a headache

136
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:59,485
I'm really fed up with the smell of smoke

137
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:02,584
Be careful not to slip

138
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:05,412
Why don't I carry you? Do I need to carry you?

139
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:30,751
(Who are you across from the locker?)

140
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:46,133
(Who are you across from the locker?)

141
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:55,175
(Who are you across from the locker?)

142
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:42,976
I discovered by chance that there was a different world across the locker

143
00:14:44,156 --> 00:14:47,059
But I didn’t expect that there were actually people

144
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:50,038
Is the world on your side the same as mine?

145
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,587
Who are you

146
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,463
I also saw the hair

147
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:01,661
I just learned that the locker is connected to a certain world

148
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:05,173
(It was only after I saw the hair that I learned that the locker was connected to a certain world. I really want to know your world over there)

149
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:05,532
I really want to know the world on your side

150
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,536
It seems that the left and right sides of your world are just opposite to mine.

151
00:15:11,038 --> 00:15:13,407
I'm curious if the opposite is true for others.

152
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:16,309
Let’s talk about the two-dimensional mirror

153
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:18,779
Then we cannot leave behind the magical cosmology

154
00:15:19,413 --> 00:15:20,588
cosmology

155
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:26,686
Once again, it means that there are different worlds in the universe...

156
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:29,156
It's so noisy

157
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:34,594
What does this mean? Many people will say they don’t understand.

158
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:36,263
Oh, Father

159
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:38,565
Father God, who created heaven and earth...

160
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:45,590
Fried rice cake is ready

161
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:46,652
Thanks

162
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:55,282
I'm sorry that the strands of hair I put up scared you, right?

163
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:57,918
I wanted to send you a signal

164
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,602
But I hesitated for no reason

165
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:04,124
please allow me to introduce myself

166
00:16:02,314 --> 00:16:06,039
(Minchan Eunmi is here to become a fried food expert)

167
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:09,396
My name is Woo Jae Yoon

168
00:16:10,557 --> 00:16:13,760
I am a high school graduate majoring in hairdressing.

169
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:24,377
Do we really live in different universes?

170
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,862
I really want to know what are the similarities

171
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:30,362
What are the differences?

172
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:35,388
This is Seoul, South Korea

173
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:37,497
(This is Seoul, South Korea, which hosted the World Cup in 2002 and the COVID-19 epidemic broke out at the end of 2019)

174
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:38,358
The World Cup was held in 2002

175
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:41,995
The COVID-19 epidemic broke out at the end of 2019

176
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:43,562
Same here

177
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:48,176
Now the air is getting cooler and there are fallen leaves everywhere

178
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:50,070
It seems winter has arrived

179
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:55,569
The news this morning also said that the temperature dropped to minus ten degrees.

180
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,226
Exactly the same

181
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:01,181
There's also a hairdresser here where you work.

182
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:06,953
But the people there are completely different from what you said

183
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:09,890
so amazing

184
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:22,015
(The so-called husband and wife are not half of each other, but two become one because it is you and because I am with you)

185
00:17:13,593 --> 00:17:15,495
Across from my locker.

186
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:18,198
There is an advertising light box about couple managers

187
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:23,203
I'm thinking that I will be able to find my other half sooner or later.

188
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:30,944
Lately I've been thinking about things I've ignored before

189
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:56,102
(Can I hear your voice?)

190
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:56,937
can you let me hear your voice

191
00:18:01,884 --> 00:18:03,543
You...hello

192
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,453
Hello

193
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,915
You...hello

194
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,043
Hello

195
00:18:33,431 --> 00:18:36,658
I...didn't...want to stutter

196
00:18:39,277 --> 00:18:43,631
But I'm...really nervous right now

197
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:58,598
(Because it’s you, because I’m with you)

198
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:10,329
Is my voice okay?

199
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:12,712
I feel shy for some reason

200
00:19:13,747 --> 00:19:16,283
My name is Wu Zhiyu

201
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:20,687
Until recently, I was just an ordinary office worker.

202
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:22,756
correct

203
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,138
Your name is Jae Yoon, right?

204
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:28,343
Your voice is really nice

205
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,745
you can have confidence

206
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:32,972
actually

207
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:37,437
Like you, I'm not good at getting along with others.

208
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:40,472
I feel so too…

209
00:19:40,974 --> 00:19:43,710
I have been isolated for a long time

210
00:19:47,913 --> 00:19:48,948
But do you know

211
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:51,084
I've recently started to have palpitations for no apparent reason

212
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:54,496
When I think about it, it’s like a movie

213
00:19:54,521 --> 00:19:56,556
A gateway to the outside world

214
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:59,192
When I think about it, there are people like you there too

215
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:01,810
People who speak a common language with me

216
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:04,257
I feel amazing

217
00:20:04,777 --> 00:20:06,278
Make me look forward to every day

218
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:09,488
It's like I finally got a chance to breathe

219
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,252
He is singing

220
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:12,072
Looks very happy

221
00:20:12,405 --> 00:20:13,707
It's really scary

222
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:15,826
Wow I'm really scared

223
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:18,256
It seems like he is crazy

224
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,333
It's really scary

225
00:20:27,387 --> 00:20:29,956
If it's night there, it's day here

226
00:20:30,523 --> 00:20:34,743
If you raise your left hand there, it becomes your right hand.

227
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:37,647
Go straight ahead along the underground passage

228
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,933
Go out from the right exit

229
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:40,953
correct

230
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,884
It should be on your left side, right?

231
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:51,244
Go out and walk fifty steps forward

232
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:54,963
By the way, my stride is quite long.

233
00:20:56,296 --> 00:21:05,601
(Fried fat intestines and fried rice intestines)

234
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:03,055
From the alley intersection, walk twenty-five steps to the right.

235
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:10,096
That building…

236
00:21:10,597 --> 00:21:11,431
That's my home

237
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:14,547
You're still some distance from the building entrance, right?

238
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:17,190
Now look below

239
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:23,389
To be precise, that's a four-leaf clover

240
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,152
i look at it every day

241
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:28,006
Go to Work

242
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:33,701
If you reach the overpass

243
00:21:34,454 --> 00:21:36,222
Then keep walking in the opposite direction

244
00:21:40,378 --> 00:21:42,514
Then you can see there is a park

245
00:21:43,555 --> 00:21:46,625
This is a space I cherish very much

246
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:51,671
Bench in front of vending machine

247
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,379
sit there

248
00:21:54,253 --> 00:21:55,588
You can see clearly even at night

249
00:21:59,178 --> 00:22:02,715
The nickname here is Rabbit Park

250
00:22:04,202 --> 00:22:05,036
but

251
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,870
No one will take care of those rabbits

252
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:15,376
I think these rabbits are just like me

253
00:22:48,574 --> 00:22:50,742
Why don't you even say a word?

254
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:54,749
Did something happen to you?

255
00:22:56,035 --> 00:23:00,121
Did I do something wrong?

256
00:23:08,034 --> 00:23:12,452
(Woo Jae-yoon)

257
00:23:12,218 --> 00:23:13,253
Is it too much?

258
00:23:14,988 --> 00:23:15,889
Feel sorry…

259
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:16,856
Feel sorry

260
00:23:24,489 --> 00:23:27,492
Why haven't you spoken for several days?

261
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:29,908
Could it be...

262
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,007
Am I not a good person?

263
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:37,310
Have you seen the photos before?

264
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:38,511
my hair is messy

265
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:40,154
this lady

266
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:42,315
But...that...

267
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,596
No need to defend

268
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:45,907
Just cut it off for me and make it short.

269
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:49,871
knew

270
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:56,778
But your text message reply is too short, right?

271
00:23:57,397 --> 00:23:58,531
are you ignoring me

272
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:02,535
terribly sorry

273
00:24:02,835 --> 00:24:03,303
What

274
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,571
Please explain it clearly to me

275
00:24:07,723 --> 00:24:09,510
The store warned us…

276
00:24:10,734 --> 00:24:13,112
Be restrained from contacting customers privately

277
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:17,350
Yes...is it?

278
00:24:23,222 --> 00:24:23,990
Really

279
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,040
Oh my god

280
00:24:41,674 --> 00:24:42,709
Oh my God

281
00:24:43,142 --> 00:24:45,111
Feed you bastard

282
00:24:45,411 --> 00:24:48,615
What should I do? Oh my god

283
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:54,120
What are you doing here Jaeyoon?

284
00:24:54,988 --> 00:24:56,889
The room manager asked you to pack your things and come out quickly.

285
00:24:58,124 --> 00:24:59,392
Don't forget your name tag

286
00:25:02,908 --> 00:25:03,511
Hello

287
00:25:05,116 --> 00:25:09,283
Your dismissal and reconciliation are two completely different things.

288
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:10,903
so

289
00:25:11,797 --> 00:25:14,033
You must contact the customer personally

290
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,141
Apologize to her, you know?

291
00:25:21,864 --> 00:25:26,133
I...became a human again

292
00:25:27,786 --> 00:25:30,021
I thought I had someone on my side

293
00:25:32,892 --> 00:25:34,027
in this world

294
00:25:35,662 --> 00:25:38,231
no one needs me

295
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:41,868
It seems like I've been abandoned again

296
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:45,597
just like those rabbits

297
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,880
Sorry it took so long to leave you a message

298
00:25:54,773 --> 00:25:56,208
Are you suffering a lot?

299
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:01,502
The thought of us never seeing each other

300
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:04,489
I don’t know why I’m getting lonelier

301
00:26:05,457 --> 00:26:06,591
more afraid

302
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,280
It seems that I am the same as you

303
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:16,284
I'm the only one in this world

304
00:26:20,165 --> 00:26:21,000
Me too…

305
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:25,244
It's really painful

306
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:29,797
It seems…

307
00:26:33,018 --> 00:26:36,204
I'm the only one in this world

308
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:46,213
Do we... want to meet?

309
00:26:47,826 --> 00:26:48,994
I miss you

310
00:26:50,837 --> 00:26:52,605
Are you serious

311
00:26:54,006 --> 00:26:55,208
Yes

312
00:26:55,641 --> 00:26:57,944
I mean every word I say to you

313
00:26:59,238 --> 00:27:00,602
I'll go find you

314
00:27:01,807 --> 00:27:02,908
just tell me how to do it

315
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:07,035
Correctly speaking 12pm

316
00:27:06,285 --> 00:27:09,388
(item locker)

317
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:08,755
I'll open that door

318
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,797
Then you also open the door and wait for me

319
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:15,209
If you miss that time, the door will close

320
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:28,641
(Warning only for one person)

321
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:48,427
(Because it’s you, because I’m with you)

322
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:12,747
Ji…Chi-Na

323
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:16,837
are u there

324
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:27,565
Intelligent entertainment…

325
00:29:34,445 --> 00:29:36,369
Intelligent Entertainment… Intelligent Entertainment… Intelligent Entertainment

326
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,157
Who are you

327
00:30:28,282 --> 00:30:30,204
Wait a moment please wait a moment

328
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,524
please wait a moment

329
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:33,492
help me

330
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:34,860
are u there

331
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:36,729
help me

332
00:30:46,465 --> 00:30:50,532
(Because it’s you, because I’m with you)

333
00:31:16,903 --> 00:31:20,448
(Because it’s you, because I’m with you)

334
00:31:20,473 --> 00:31:36,856
(Lockers can only be used once)

335
00:31:29,074 --> 00:31:29,890
Feel sorry

336
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,618
Ways I can attract attention

337
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,567
only this one

338
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:57,643
There are people here

339
00:31:58,644 --> 00:31:59,445
There's someone here

340
00:31:59,712 --> 00:32:00,913
here...here

341
00:32:56,469 --> 00:33:05,119
(Lockers can only be used once)

342

(Item locker warning is for one person only)

344
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:31,603
you are right

345
00:33:32,705 --> 00:33:34,206
In fact, everyone is alone

346
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,087
(item locker)

347
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:38,623
But...it'll get better

348
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:42,156
(CCTV is recording and if you encounter a dangerous situation, please call 112)

349
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,113
If you have someone who can bear it for you

350
00:33:42,181 --> 00:33:53,274
(Warning only for one person)

351
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:44,617
This is

352
00:33:46,378 --> 00:33:48,447
the laws of this world

353
00:33:54,026 --> 00:33:58,453
(Card of love and happiness)

354
00:33:58,478 --> 00:34:04,403
