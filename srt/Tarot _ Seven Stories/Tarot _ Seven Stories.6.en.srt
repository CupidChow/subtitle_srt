Hello Moriko TV viewers

7
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:58,956
I came to buy a car today

8
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,689
Why buy a car?

There's a great driving venue at my doorstep

11
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:08,244
I really wanted to go for a drive, so I came to buy a car.

12
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,469
Why do you buy a car just for driving?

13
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:13,639
Isn’t the purpose of buying a car just to go for a ride?

Great. Do you have a driver's license?

16
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:20,379
I don't have you to help me drive.

17
00:01:22,193 --> 00:01:23,058
Why

18

What else

19
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:26,018
If I tell you to drive, you have to drive. What else can you do?

20
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,313
Then let's go see the car

21
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:30,422
Everyone

22
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:32,783
This is exactly the type I want

23
00:01:32,808 --> 00:01:34,676
This car suits me perfectly

24
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:39,785
Just because my place is so big

25
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,578
So when buying a car, you should also buy a big one.

26
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:44,013
I think a small car is enough

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,682
Shut up

33
00:01:56,352 --> 00:01:57,605
It turns out you came to see the car.

34
00:01:58,301 --> 00:01:58,778
Yes

35
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:00,363
Is this a good car?

36
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:01,898
very good

37
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:04,099
I want this one

38
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:05,902
But there is no stock

39
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:09,415
Why are you displaying it if it’s not in stock?

40
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,908
Sorry, how is this car?

41
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:13,710
Really speechless

42
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,126
Same for this car

43
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:18,057
The suspension system is stronger and better than that car

44
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:19,731
But it's smaller than this car

not bad

50

Be strong

51
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,862
It's quite soft, so I decided on this one.

52

53

The expert is here

179
00:09:00,282 --> 00:09:05,621
Generally speaking, the chariot means the courage to rush towards success.

180
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,730
It seems you really know

181
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,580

182
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,333
Shhh

183
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:22,224
Hello

184
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:28,711
Yes, can we meet today?

185
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:32,998
If you drink, you can skip the hotel and I'll book it.

186
00:09:34,897 --> 00:09:35,684
Why

187
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:38,452
Isn't it just for sex when you ask me to meet?

188
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:39,976
Don't forget it

189
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:45,594
See you at the Great Wall Station at seven o'clock that evening

A question by the way

194
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:58,351
Those average-looking men

195
00:09:58,374 --> 00:09:59,975
You don't know who you are and you try to have sex with me

196
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,744
Disgusting

197
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:06,682
Then I will immediately educate the man who tried to have a one-night stand with me.

198
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:10,706
Let’s say goodbye Moriko together.

199

Come directly to room 308

226
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:34,897
This guy actually arrived so quickly

227
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,970
Let's see what this guy looks like

228
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:48,318
looks ugly

229
00:12:50,577 --> 00:12:52,778
Everyone, I am going offline.

230
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:54,576
I'm so sick that I'm going to vomit.

231
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:03,485
So for the real-time live broadcast, let’s go and watch.

236

May I come inside

239
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,084
This guy just came in and people were looking forward to it.

240

Hello

241
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:02,111
My name is Kim Byung-soo, and I just talked to you on the phone.

242
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:07,783
The location of the hotel is very conspicuous, so I found it quickly.

243
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:14,035
When were these prepared?

244
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:16,918
If I had known earlier, I would have brought a bottle of red wine...

245
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:23,532
Mommy mommy

246
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,902
This guy called mom

247
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,715
Smelly woman

248
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:50,259
Damn damn woman

249
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:56,732
Damn it

250
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,771
What should I do if he gets mad?

251
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:07,559
(banana penis)

252
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:13,214
Damn it, I almost got discovered

253
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:54,056
Oh my God, have you seen it?

254
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:55,730

He came from Bupyeong City for a one-night stand.

258

Username is banana penis

259
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,395
The username is also very perverted

(Sista provides sponsorship and looks forward to the next live broadcast^^ Reward 9,000 currency points)

261
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,380
Didn't you say he was an exam taker?

262
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:13,120
He can't be a pervert, right?

263
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:16,390
I am scared

264
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:18,460
His face is too ugly, right?

265

270
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:41,303
Damn the traffic jam

271
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:00,460
What

272
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:06,014
At this time, Moriko thought he had caught me.

273
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:10,699
There's a traffic jam right now. She should be in the taxi.

274
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,931
Because she has a car but no driver's license

275
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:15,464
Are you asking me why I know her so well?

276
00:18:17,005 --> 00:18:17,973
Everyone

277
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:22,472
I have been a big fan of Moriko TV for the past year

278
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:24,232
But that stinky woman...

279
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,302
Allow me to tell you about this later

280
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:30,823
In short, no matter whether there is a traffic jam or not,

281
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:33,354
It took me ten minutes to get back on my motorcycle.

282
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,457
I'll go in first

283
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:37,960

286
00:18:41,282 --> 00:18:42,898
Then let’s go in and take a look from there first.

287

291

300

(Little Chicken provides sponsorship without any conditions for die-hard fans! Reward 20,000 currency points)

355
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:39,036
In fact, he is a pauper

356
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:42,357
I didn’t ask him to reward all the property.

357
00:22:42,382 --> 00:22:43,349
He's an idiot

358
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:46,338
(Kunyo provided sponsorship and the shameless lunatic, Sister Moriko, started live streaming again and rewarded 3,000 currency points)

Good-for-nothing guy

361
00:22:57,979 --> 00:23:00,247
The number of subscribers is actually only this small

362
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:06,240
No one will watch your live broadcast just to see how ugly you are.

363
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:18,537
What is this guy doing? Are you crazy?

364
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:23,845
I feel so sorry for your parents, madman.

365
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:34,983
Anyway, if I catch you, you'll be dead.

366
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,368
I will hire a lawyer

367
00:23:37,392 --> 00:23:39,828
Sent him to jail for home invasion

368
00:23:43,265 --> 00:23:44,247
what happened

369
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:51,847
My microphone is very expensive

370
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:28,543
so spicy

371
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:31,179

Stinky guy

375

I know, brother will come right away

Checkout

377
00:24:50,933 --> 00:24:51,967
Moriko

378
00:24:53,818 --> 00:24:56,438
You've been ignoring me before, why did you suddenly ignore me again?

379
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:58,872
so exciting

380
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:02,290
I thought I would never see you again

381
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:09,658
what are you doing there

382
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,667
What are you doing?

383
00:25:16,411 --> 00:25:17,062
hateful

384
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:19,961
Damn what is this

385
00:25:27,702 --> 00:25:28,336
mom

386
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:31,405
mom

387
00:25:33,475 --> 00:25:34,204
mom

388

389
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,524
mom

390

mom

392
00:26:12,876 --> 00:26:16,283
This idiot actually calls me mom

393
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:19,453
Damn this guy is really hopeless

394
00:26:20,254 --> 00:26:21,616
(I wonder if this is a self-directed farce, right?)

395
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:22,223
Why don't I hire him to come and help me?

396
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,249
(Hahaha, it’s better than the movie)

397
00:26:23,273 --> 00:26:24,851
(Looking forward to the next live broadcast)

00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,717
(Today’s live broadcast was really awesome)

399
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:32,662
The above is today’s live broadcast of “Those Who Want to Fish”

400
00:26:26,741 --> 00:26:28,759
(stimulating stimulation)

401
00:26:28,784 --> 00:26:31,384
(It looks good, hahaha)

402
00:26:34,015 --> 00:26:37,938
See you next time, brothers.

403

(Goodbye Moriko who immigrated to the United States)

406
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:44,247

407
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,880
I will do the show for her

408
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:46,570

409

Goodbye, Moriko

410
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:54,690
(Goodbye offline)

411
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:57,585
(Today’s live broadcast was really great, wow)

412
00:26:57,609 --> 00:27:00,150
(I don’t mind the next time I broadcast the live broadcast of killing him. Who can reward me with 100 million currency points, hahaha)

413
00:27:00,174 --> 00:27:07,010
(I agree)

414
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:14,698
(How about I do it once?)

415
