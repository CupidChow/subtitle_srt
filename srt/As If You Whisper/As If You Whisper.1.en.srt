1
00:00:54,917 --> 00:01:03,708
AS IF YOU WHISPER

2
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:23,250
Please don't grumble
About the traffic on your way

3
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:29,333
Because we still have the bus lane

4
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
With my car on it's way

5
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:42,000
Will have tears on 60 dollars of fine

6
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:48,333
Please don't worry about
Your way back home

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,292
Because we still have
The transportation card

8
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:01,333
And take the subway, the bus as well

9
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,500
Transferring is the basic option,
Super to erotic city

10
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:14,875
We all shout I love busking

11
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,625
Busking

12
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,167
Busking

13
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:27,292
We all shout I love busking

14
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:29,458
Busking

15
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,500
Busking

16
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:44,792
Thank you!

17
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,083
Excuse me,
I need to pack these as well, right?

18
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,333
Do you live nearby?

19
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,083
No, I don't.　-I saw you often.

20
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,042
Oh, really?

21
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:11,958
It's a great honor!

22
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,667
Mr. Bum Soo!

23
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,292
Bum Soo?

24
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,833
I am a real fan of you.

25
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:25,583
You're always on the same place
whenever I perform.

26
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:32,833
I think you are so cool when you sing.

27
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:36,917
You can say that again.

28
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,375
Do you like to drink?

29
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:56,208
Do you own this coffee shop?

30
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,333
No, I don't.

31
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:03,208
It's my sister's coffee shop.
I'm just in charge of at the moment.

32
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,625
This place is awesome.

33
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,708
It is.

34
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,250
I decorated the interior.

35
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:15,083
Are you a designer?

36
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,792
This beer tastes good.

37
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,792
It's actually from the convenience store.

38
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:31,250
Again.

39
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,083
Let's try again.

40
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:45,708
Are you alright, my love?

41
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,167
Again.

42
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:12,542
Please try again.

43
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:18,208
Are you alright?

44
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:21,292
I am now getting tired...

45
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:24,375
What's happened to your voice?

46
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,583
It sounds too soft.

47
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:33,875
Ms. Kim, but it's the beginning
of the chorus.

48
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,667
You only need to focus on the melody.

49
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:41,875
The song doesn't come from anything.

50
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,542
Try again!

51
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:53,333
I am now getting tired

52
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,000
It's too boring!

53
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,667
Has no tension at all.

54
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
What's going on today?

55
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,500
Get out of there.

56
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:26,500
Hey, give that to me.

57
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,250
Just do the vocal guide.

58
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,792
The door is closing.

59
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,042
The door opens.

60
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,250
The door is closing.

61
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:24,292
The door is closing.

62
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,333
Are you going for delivery?

63
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,458
Yes.

64
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,417
Oh, I see.

65
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,208
Are you...

66
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,625
listening to music?

67
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:58,917
Ah, yes.

68
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,875
I see.

69
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,583
The door opens.

70
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,458
The door is closing.

71
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,083
Wait, Hyun Woo!

72
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:39,458
Can't see you

73
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:47,708
Getting cold now

74
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:54,125
I am getting tired

75
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:54,958
It's good.

76
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,833
Is it?　-Yeah.

77
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:01,375
Honestly,

78
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,833
I...

79
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:05,958
love it.

80
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:08,292
Sorry?

81
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:14,750
Oh, I just wanted to say it's cool.

82
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,500
You know...

83
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,667
-I should go for delivery now...
-Oh, that's right.

84
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:49,875
May I...

85
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,125
listen to this song again later
when it is completed?

86
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,875
Okay, well done.
Good job, come over here now.

87
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:33,375
You now should debut as a singer
and graduate being a vocal guide.

88
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,958
But you are actually
good at guide singing. Well done.

89
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,292
Is it done?　-Yes, it is.

90
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:40,125
Well done.

91
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,667
I have good feelings on this.

92
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,250
The song is well completed.
It well fits on your tone.

93
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,125
Excuse me...

94
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:50,958
Let's introduce.

95
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:53,667
This is Eun Chul
and he just debuted as a singer.

96
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,125
You know him as well, don't you, Bum Soo?

97
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,125
Let's start recording! Let's go!　-Sure!

98
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,542
Spring comes right beside you

99
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:27,792
Oh, your smile

100
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:31,458
Oh, might melt soon

101
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,500
A shine soaking into the spring breeze

102
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,833
Oh, I feel the best

103
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,250
I could hear the spring from your singing

104
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,167
Oh, I feel the best

105
00:11:51,833 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, spring comes right beside you

106
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,417
Ms.Kim. I should check the microphone.

107
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:03,417
It sounds strange.

108
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,750
Could you back off for a while?
Just checking the microphone.

109
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,125
It has the strange sound.

110
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,917
Okay.

111
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,375
Ms. Kim.

112
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,000
Did you listen to the file
I handed to you the other day?

113
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,250
It was fine.

114
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,542
Don't you see that I am working now?

115
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,500
Let's try again.

116
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,417
You leaving, Bum Soo?

117
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,542
Okay, let's try again.

118
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:21,917
(WHAT ARE YOU DOING?)

119
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:24,708
(JUST WORKING?)

120
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:41,167
(ARE YOU WORKING LATE TONIGHT?)

121
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:48,042
(WHY? IS THERE SOMETHING GOING ON?)

122
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,917
Are you waiting for someone?

123
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,500
You don't have to know.

124
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:21,417
You don't need to say.
It's all over your face.

125
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,875
Hey, you don't know anything.

126
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,625
Isn't that him?

127
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,042
Don't you want to sing?

128
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,250
No.

129
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,208
I don't have the courage for it.

130
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,083
I'll help you anytime.

131
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,958
Nope,

132
00:15:54,708 --> 00:16:00,125
I enjoy listening to music
more than singing.

133
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,208
Sit down please.

134
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:40,167
Can't see you

135
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:47,417
Getting cold now...　-Mr. Kwak!

136
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:51,833
What do you think?

137
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,667
Sing something you can earn money.

138
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:57,750
Pardon me?

139
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:00,958
You can do the art by yourself...

140
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:07,958
Please keep working on this vocal guide.

141
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:16,458
Vocal guide again?

142
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,583
Ms. Kim!

143
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:36,542
Hello.

144
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,542
What brings you here?

145
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:46,667
I'm leaving!

146
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,708
See you tomorrow.

147
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,125
Is it one of those days?

148
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,875
I feel stifled.

149
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:19,333
I'm afraid I will be like this for long.

150
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,000
Will I be a singer someday?

151
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,375
Should I give up?

152
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:42,208
If you have no place to stay,

153
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,875
even though you try your best,

154
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,833
but still have hard times,

155
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,167
you can lean on me.

156
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,000
Are you sure?

157
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,583
I love you.

158
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,708
Our poem

159
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:15,042
Our words

160
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,292
Where you stand to see me

161
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,583
We whisper...

162
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:37,417
With the biggest secrets

163
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,333
I...

164
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,500
can't do it anymore.

165
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,875
I thought you need money.

166
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:49,875
So I...

167
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:57,667
I am giving them back to you.

168
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:02,708
Just do good things for Bum Soo.

169
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:05,583
For him to focus on his music.　-No.

170
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,833
I can't do this any longer.

171
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:09,500
Why?

172
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,333
Did you start to have feelings on him?

173
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,583
Alright. Go away.

174
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,583
Let's build the world

175
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:51,250
Where only can see by us

176
00:23:53,167 --> 00:24:00,083
Remember you

177
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:04,583
Remember the present

178
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:10,125
Bashful words

179
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:13,500
Fluttering words

180
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,917
Whisper to me

181
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,708
Remember you

182
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:32,792
Remember me

183
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,917
Remember the present

184
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,875
Bashful words

185
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:47,958
Fluttering words

186
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,042
To me...

187
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,250
Ms.Kim, please listen to the recording
from last night.

188
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:19,792
Okay, let's do that.

189
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,292
Ah! Ms.Kim. Let's fill our stomach first.

190
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,125
-What are you talking about?
-No, please don't. Ms.Kim.

191
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,250
Are...

192
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,083
you guys dating?

193
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:45,958
Actually I was curious
what you were distracted at.

194
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:00,875
Just focus on your music!

195
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,750
Only Music!

196
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:20,833
Cha Bum Soo,

197
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:23,208
what a taste you have...

198
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:28,417
Okay, I understand.

199
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:35,958
But you won't be able to survive
in this industry with it.

200
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:41,458
This world is not that easy.

201
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,792
Stop dating someone like Hyun Woo.

202
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:48,625
Wake up!

203
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:51,750
Someone like Hyun Woo?

204
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:55,333
Ms.Kim.

205
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,708
Did I introduce him to you before?

206

(BUM SOO)

207
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,833
What are you doing?

208
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:20,583
Hey, I'm leaving.
You may wrap up and leave.

209
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:22,792
But it's too early to close the shop.

210

(AS IF YOU WHISPER)

211
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,583
Our eyes

212
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:14,250
Our thrill

213
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:53,125
This song is "As if you whisper".

214
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,500
I am singing for my beloved friend.

215
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,708
Thank you.

Our words

218
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:39,292
The place where we are

219
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:51,500
We whisper with the biggest secrets

220
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:57,833
Quick, recognize me

221
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:04,708
Let's build the world

222
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:10,583
Where only can see by us

223
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:18,917
Remember you

224
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:24,083
Remember the present

225
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,625
Bashful words

226
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:31,833
Fluttering words

227
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:36,917
Whisper to me

00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,500
Our eyes

229
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,583
Our thrill

230
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:10,125
Where you stand to see me

231
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,208
We whisper...

232
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:22,250
With the biggest secrets

233
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:28,708

Whisper to me

241
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:23,333
I recognized your little heart
From the sight

242
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:36,375
I recognized you
On the day wandered outside

243
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,542
Remember you

244
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:44,792
Remember me

(BUM SOO CHA'S BUSKING VIDEO)
(AS IF YOU WHISPER)

250
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:12,125
Wow!

251
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:15,708
Can't believe there are so many views
in an hour!

252
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,417
Ms.Kim, have you seen this video?

253
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,583
It's Bum Soo's busking video.

254
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:24,375
But look, these hits are not a joke.

255
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,375
You mean, Bum Soo?　-Yes.

256
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,958
Wow, look at him.

257
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:33,000
Come and see!

258
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:38,167
He should have his own album now.

259
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:50,333
It's quite a waste of him
only working on vocal guide.

260
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:18,125
It's a contract for your single album.

261
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:20,375
Read this.

262
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,542
The song was good.

263
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:27,667
Let's go for it.

264
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:32,083
Is it?　-I liked your eyes.

265
00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:34,208
You were just like a real singer.

266
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:38,958
Your gestures, expressions, voice,
they were all perfect.

267
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:42,208
Thank you.

268
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,750
How did it go?

269
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,792
What's wrong?

270
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:21,458
It's just amazing.

271
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,542
But why did you do that?

272
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,125
What?

273
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:43,875
You know, Hyun Woo.

274
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,458
It wasn't necessary for you to do that.

275
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:53,542
It's because
you couldn't focus on your music.

276
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:57,167
Let's just concentrate on it.

277
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:01,958
If you do those kinds,

278
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,583
rumors will get stirred up.

279
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:08,167
I don't care.

280
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:11,583
I had a chance to know Hyun Woo
because of it.

281
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,083
Aren't you gonna sign it?

282
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:24,083
I was happy when we were together.

283
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:25,792
What?

284
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:29,417
Being with someone you love...

285
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,583
is the most wonderful
and happiest thing to do.

286
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:36,458
-What are you talking about?
-People judging it as my weakness...

287
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:39,542
They are too obvious.

288
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,708
Just do whatever you want.

289
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:12,542
Are you going to make him
walk away like that?

290
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,375
He should be back.

291
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:19,083
We should bring him back.

292
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:09,833
AS IF YOU WHISPER
