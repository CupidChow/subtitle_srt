1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,753
It's 2:00 a.m. in Philly.

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:06,255
It's the kind of winter night
where the air is crisp

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,466
and the streets are dead quiet.

4
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:10,885
<i>I was waiting for a cheesesteak at Pat's.</i>

5
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:14,639
The guy behind the window,
he's working steaks on the grill

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,933
like he's been doing since he was a baby,

7
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,978
a maestro like that kid Brad Cooper.

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,689
There I am.
I'm watching this, and it hits me.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,276
The cheesesteak is Philly.

10
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,071
The ingredients may seem
run-of-the-mill,

11
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,783
your steak, your cheese,
your onions,

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,369
mushrooms if you're a pussy.

13
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:39,498
But it's the way you bring
it all together that matters,

14
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:44,419
something greater than
the sum of its parts.

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,671
The thing of it is if you try

16
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:50,092
to change one thing
in that formula,

17
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,302
you ruin the whole thing.

18
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,264
<i>Same with our city,
same with our business.</i>

19
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:59,767
In other words, it's gonna be
very hard to digest,

20
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,188
and some people die of indigestion.

21
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,962
Shit! Fuck!

22
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:31,007
So we're missing a few kilos
of uncut cocaine.

23
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,634
Can't we just like, I don't know,
get some more?

24
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,511
I thought drugs were your specialty?

25
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,763
They are, and when I lose mine,
I call my guy,

26
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,182
and he gives me
a five-hour window.

27
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,601
Will you stop talking?

28
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,020
How pissed
do you think Chickie is?

29
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,564
On a scale of hospital stays?

30
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,064
One month.

31
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,357
Okay, well, maybe it's not that bad.

32
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,901
Maybe he picked it up early for us,

33
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,819
like a kind neighbor does
with Amazon packages?

34
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,529
This isn't a 12-pack of socks.

35
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,866
It's a pallet of illegal drugs.

36
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,455
Mr. Lozano will see you now.

37
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,748
Game time.

38
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,041
Okay, okay, okay.

39
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,751
When you go see this guy,

40
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,546
just don't, 
say anything stupid.

41
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,047
- Okay?
- Okay, got it.

42
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:15,010
Actually... 
Don't talk at all.

43
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,553
- Cool.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,554
<i>Chup.</i>

45
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,902
It shows up in my city, on my dock.

46
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:36,490
It sits there unclaimed
and somehow it's yours?

47
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,158
Remember, it's your privilege
that I allow you

48
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,619
to do business in Philadelphia.

49
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,539
Alright, who's the boss?

50
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,872
They are.

51
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,082
Th-these are Baba's sons.

52
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,708
This Is Mir and Raj Dar.

53
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,546
They completely took over
the business after Baba died.

54
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,006
I liked your father.

55
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,759
Giant balls.

56
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,177
But how come I never met
you guys till now?

57
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,139
What, did you not inherit
your father's balls?

58
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,392
- Um, permission to speak...
- No.

59
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,519
...Mr. Lasagna?

60
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,481
We do have our father's balls, we both do.

61
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,943
He just hadn't brought us into
the business yet for our own safety.

62
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,152
You're soft?

63
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,487
No.

64
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,781
Your permission
to sell cocaine

65
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:23,035
in the greater Philadelphia area
is hereby revoked.

66
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,620
- What?
- No.

67
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,082
With all due respect, Chickie,

68
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,834
we need at least a chance

69
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,878
to try and unload
this shipment.

70
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,797
The only money we have is in that pallet,

71
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,299
along with your vig.

72
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,967
Feels like a you problem.

73
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,178
We just need a little more time.

74
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,054
Um, Mir, beg.

75
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,724
Please, Mr. Lozano,

76
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,474
please give us a chance.

77
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,268
We-we'll do whatever we have to do.

78
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,521
This has been a very weird time
for us, okay?

79
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,898
I-I've been to business school.

80
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,691
Between us,
I know how business works,

81
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,028
and my brother, he's kind of a dumbass.

82
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,695
Okay? But, but he means well.

83
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,739
I know, I know we're new at this,

84
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,949
but we can do a good job, okay?

85
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,577
For, for our Baba.

86
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,329
If you really loved him
as much as you say you do,

87
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,997
and if you just give us
this one opportunity,

88
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,498
we'll all be making so much money...

89
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,917
Okay, I'll give you 24 hours

90
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,503
to fucking move that shit,

91
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,713
get me my money.

92
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,466
Otherwise, I'll hunt you
all down and kill you.

93
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,967
Thank you, Chickie.

94
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,844
Boys. Your compassion knows no bounds.

95
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,138
- Get the pallet.
- Hey, hey! Yo!

96
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,807
I need some collateral.

97
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,725
The human kind.

98
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,227
Ooh! All in favor of Ahmad.

99
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,645
- <i>Haanji!</i>
- What the fuck?

100
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:31,812
I had the votes.

101
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,064
Thank you.

102
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,152
- Get in through the...
- Okay. Alright.

103
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,947
Are you... Get, get in...

104
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,614
So angry.

105
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,158
Can you just carry more
than one fucking box?

106
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,993
Hello?

107
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,371
Bushra!

108
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,873
You should really lock
the door if no one is working.

109
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,291
Thank you so much
for the tip, Bushra,

110
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,085
but Mir is very busy.

111
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,962
I'll be right there, please.

112
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,713
Five minutes, let's go.

113
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,965
Bye, Bushra.

114
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,091
You look great.

115
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,301
Is this one of your pharma rep outfits?

116
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,554
Yes, it is, Mir.

117
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,179
I'm a working woman again.

118
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,058
I don't know what our life is anymore,
so I had no choice.

119
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,433
What does that mean?

120
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,435
Our wedding is around
the corner,

121
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,271
and you're running
around town with Raj

122
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:14,438
doing God knows what.

123
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,691
In the three seconds
that we do talk before you hang up,

124
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:17,901
you don't tell me shit.

125
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,404
We used to do everything together.

126
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,656
Now it feels like you don't want me
to be a part of your life anymore.

127
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,741
I just...

128
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,702
I can't explain.

129
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,288
So you're shutting me out again?

130
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,749
It's like you're not even here.

131
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,254
Take it.

132
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,884
It's obvious that's what you want,
you just can't say it.

133
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,644
Okay.

134
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,855
Raj's Pluto is in his fourth house,

135
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,523
which means crazy upheaval,

136
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,234
so maybe that's what
the FBI is picking up on.

137
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,196
You really think the FBI tracks
persons of interest

138
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,240
based off of planetary movements?

139
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,534
- They should.
- Their father was a criminal,

140
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,120
and they are criminals.

141
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,123
Scorpio.

142
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,920
That's beside the point.

143
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,339
Settle into your
new home for the day.

144
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,216
Sure you don't want some soup?

145
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,218
I'm intermittent fasting.

146
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,388
You know, I really thought that you
would be the boss after Baba died.

147
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,683
In the old days, I'd have
been boss automatically,

148
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,227
because, you know...

149
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:37,063
But nowadays, everything's
so fucking bureaucratic.

150
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,689
You saw how they took
a vote to get rid of me?

151
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,900
They took a fucking vote!

152
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,819
I can't say anything either.

153
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,613
I got kicked out of a deal
because I happened

154
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:49,576
to state some "facts" about Indians.

155
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,497
I thought you were Indian?

156
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,832
No.

157
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,084
I'm Pakistani.

158
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,421
So you guys hate each other
even though you look exactly alike?

159
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,219
Chickie's canceled.

160
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:13,725
Canceled.

- Hello?

165
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,076
You gonna blink or...?

166
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,287
Baba loved Bushra.

167
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,580
He was really proud of you,
'cause she was way out of your league.

168
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,251
He's gonna be so pissed
I let her go.

169
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,462
There is no time for heartbreak.

170
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,508
Ralph, the coke processor, is here
and he needs hands now.

171
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,636
Just give me five more minutes to mourn
the losing of the love of my life,

172
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,557
and I'll get back to being
your little drug dealer.

173
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:57,435
We have 18 hours
to get the cocaine cut,

174
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,605
bagged, and out the door,
or we are all fucked.

175
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:03,816
Whoa, toxic freaking workplace.

176
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,651
Hey, guys.
Mir, what's wrong?

177
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,486
Bushra broke off the engagement.

178
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,821
My God!

179
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,198
It's okay. I'm here to help.

180
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,116
What the fuck is she doing here?

181
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,375
You fix him, we have work to do.

182
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,335
Thanks, Prair, you're my angel.

183
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,548
<i>♪ Fire, I bid you to burn... ♪</i>

184
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:30,009
Raj, this is Ralph,

185
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,178
our expert cocaine processor.

186
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,555
More like a, a cocaine chef.

187
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,349
Ralph, this is Raj,

188
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,476
Baba's older son,
and he's here to help...

189
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,644
The extra lazy one?

190
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,355
Well, except for when it comes to drugs.

191
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,191
Some would say they're my passion.

192
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:48,069
Okay. We have a shit ton of coke
to move by tomorrow morning.

193
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,571
- Chop-chop.
- Alright!

194
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:54,867
This is my famous recipe,
so don't fuck it up.

195
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,411
- You got it.
- We take the pure cocaine from the pallet,

196
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,039
we cut it with 25% baking soda,

197
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,709
25% baby laxative, and a dash of cardamom.

198
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,795
Pow. That's how they know
it's from the chef.

199
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,091
Then we re-bag the cut bricks,
place them in the Achar,

200
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,718
and they make their journey
out into the world.

201
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,929
I mean, with this mix,
the final product comes out

202
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,474
to barely half cocaine?

203
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,478
A mathlete.

204
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,689
That's correct.

205
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,899
That's how we get more from each brick.

206
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,444
I-I mean, I would never do
this shitty bargain blow,

207
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,363
and your boy's got
a season pass for the slopes.

208
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,991
- Bargain blow.
- Um...

209
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,450
can we switch it up?

210
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:37,952
- Switch it up?
- That would be great.

211
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,412
Let's switch it up.

212
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,664
Yeah, make a new recipe,
I think it'd be fun.

213
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:42,790
Okay.

214
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,211
So the thing is, I'm a coke savant.

215
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,130
The Willy Wonka of white.

216
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:52,175
I was the Doogie Howser of Coke,
and I'm the Cocaine Chef.

217
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,094
So when I tell you to do something,

218
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,680
you say, "Yes, Chef."

219
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,309
Yeah. No.

220
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,358
The tub is a womb,
and you, Mir,

221
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,694
you are both mother and child.

222
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:12,821
Okay?

223
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,532
A Return to Womb,
certified US trademark,

224
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,370
allows you to rebirth yourself
and come out anew.

225
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:23,123
Come on, tell me what's going on.
Be honest.

226
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,668
My fiancée and I broke up.

227
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,253
I am poor.

228
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,630
My dad died.

229
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,925
That's what I'm saying,
you guys are just in turmoil.

230
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:34,510
What?

231
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,929
Nothing. Deep breaths.

232
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,432
What the hell?

233
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,017
Bath time is over.

234
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,228
Mir, you are coming with me.
Your brother...

235
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,771
But I'm still in the womb.

236
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,940
If you pull me out now,
I will be premature.

237
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:52,194
- That's true.
- Too bad, very sad. Get up.

238
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,530
I really can't,
Lucky Auntie.

239
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,075
I got, like, a situation
going on downstairs.

240
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,285
Feelings make me grow.

241
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,539
You're a little asshole, aren't you?

242
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,833
What's next, cutting our coke
with Fentanyl?

243
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,961
Fentanyl? Fentanyl.

244
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,419
Fentanyl?!

245
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,464
- What are you doing? What are...
- How dare you?

246
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,382
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
what's happening?

247
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,342
- I quit.
- No! Ralph.

248
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,469
No, no, no, no, no.
Ralph, no.

249
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,054
No, no, no. Let him go.

250
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,890
This little furry punk is trying
to tell me how to cook cocaine?

251
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,725
- Get out of here, go.
- No one is telling you...

252
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:25,935
We respect you here.

253
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,478
I'm just gonna
carry it out like this.

254
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,731
- This guy's taking our furniture...
- That's right!

255
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,861
I'm taking my table
that my wife got for me at Costco!

256
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:35,946
- Ralph.
- Yeah, good luck.

257
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,824
No! Don't help me!

258
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,076
Ralph, we are running
out of time. Please!

259
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,745
This is a serious business.

260
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:46,789
Who the hell's that guy?

261
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,295
The one competent employee
I could depend on,

262
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,296
and you made him quit.

263
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,463
How is this my fault?

264
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,425
If you weren't so busy
crying in the bathtub,

265
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,760
you'd be here to keep Raj in check!

266
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,430
Take it easy on him, Auntie.

267
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,140
- The man just had his heart shattered.
- Yeah.

268
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,434
This is why your father
didn't want you in the business.

269
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,228
You're both as soft
as my ex-boyfriend

270
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,314
when he's not getting choked!

271
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:13,274
- Okay.
- Everybody relax.

272
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:16,444
I've spent a lifetime doing
more rails than SEPTA.

273
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,696
I will lead our family
through this moment.

274
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,072
Raj is right.

275
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,117
I mean, I hate to say it,
but I trust him with this,

276
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,579
and literally nothing else.

277
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,207
That makes one of us.

278
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,082
Ralph!

279
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,544
Mir, let's get to work.

280
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:35,254
This was supposed to be my time.

281
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,423
And then Baba meets Lucky,

282
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,883
and suddenly I'm the third wheel.

283
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,010
I'm gonna say it, she scares me.

284
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,178
She's a holy terror.

285
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,263
She left you here as collateral.

286
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,849
That's emasculating.

287
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:48,936
Just as a hypothetical...

288
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:53,064
if I were to make a move,
would you support me?

289
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,026
Well, you're not in a position
to make any moves

290
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,861
with just 14 hours left.

291
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:02,532
Right. So you're still gonna kill me?

292
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:05,994
No.

293
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,830
Nick's gonna do it.

294
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:11,750
Right.

295
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,002
I don't know why you let Bushra go, man.

296
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,879
Like, I think monogamy equals death,

297
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,006
which is why Prairie
and I are obviously open,

298
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,593
but you and Bushra, man,
you're just so... boring.

299
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,053
It's like you're meant to only have sex

300
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,638
with each other
for the rest of your lives.

301
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,559
I'm bagging cocaine
in my underwear on the floor.

302
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,185
Okay, I can't bring her into this life.

303
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,354
I get it.

304
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,606
So...

305
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,233
I spoke to Ralph,

306
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:40,027
and he's willing to come back
under one condition.

307
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,196
A bonus of $5,000.

308
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,740
We don't need him, we got this.
Look at us.

309
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,660
You know they cut cocaine in underwear
in the movies so that no one steals it.

310
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,706
Why would you steal
your own cocaine, you idiots?

311
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,958
We will take that into account
moving forward.

312
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,587
There is no moving forward
if we don't get this done.

313
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,882
Where the fuck
am I gonna get five Gs from?

314
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,722
Will this cover it?

315
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,015
Bro, you don't have to do that.

316
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,394
Go find a pawn shop.

317
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,314
Two-carat stone,
18-carat white gold.

318
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:17,940
Oval with a halo.

319
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,194
This is just like on my Pinterest.

320
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,737
You must have really loved this girl.

321
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:23,822
I did.

322
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,157
I still do, but things change.

323
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,534
What did you do?

324
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,119
It's complicated.

325
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,245
You break her heart?

326
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,414
You cheat on this beautiful girl?

327
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:36,167
Look at him, his hairline is running away

328
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,711
because he knows what a coward
that he is attached to.

329
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,004
Look at this chin.

330
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,840
- What the fuck? What the fuck?
- It is dishonest. It slope down.

331
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,634
That's not good, you need strong jaw.

332
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:47,346
Not weak like little baby man.

333
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,138
That's the chin of a cheater.

334
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,308
I didn't cheat, okay?

335
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,894
- She's better off without me.
- Galina knows.

336
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,979
Peepee that's scared, go in like turtle.

337
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,523
He could not handle real woman.

338
00:14:58,524 --> 00:14:59,942
Hey, my peepee's not scared.

339
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,651
- It's actually very brave.
- Easy.

340
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,819
Easy, man,
you got a good peepee.

341
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,780
Thanks.

342
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,448
I don't think you should sell it, Mir.

343
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,659
You love Bushra.

344
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,409
It has to be done.

345
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,994
We need to get Ralph back on board,

346
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,454
and Chickie off our backs.

347
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,081
Price is $5,000.

348
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,667
That's a bargain.

349
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,585
Five-K?

350
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,420
Are we just saying things now?

351
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,089
I'm a princess.

352
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,341
You think you're at Christie's,
peepee boy?

353
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,634
Look around you.

354
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,137
You are on pawn shop south of Washington.

355
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:32,056
You want to know what that smell is?
It's snakes.

356
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,933
If you want, I can hook you up.

357
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,019
People don't come here
unless they have to.

358
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,522
- Two-K.
- Yeah. Okay, Mir, come on, let's go.

359
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,190
This lady is crazy,
we're not selling this.

360
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,734
Okay, okay.

361
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,570
You drive a hard bargain.

362
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,197
Five-K, I get from safe.

363
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:49,992
We gotta do it.

364
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,827
It's time to move on.

365
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,581
Can I get you guys anything?

366
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,540
Bump?

367
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,083
My God.
Gorgeous spread, Jan.

368
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,460
- Yeah, okay.
- That is not necessary.

369
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,255
Raj is just here to apologize.

370
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:05,923
You're okay with all this drug stuff?

371
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,718
Honey, this snow pays
for my kids' braces

372
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,761
and this gorgeous home.

373
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,557
Plus, my Ralphie made it, so I love it.

374
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,393
- Love you.
- I love you.

375
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,687
Well, I am gonna go check

376
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,982
on the hash banana bread
I've been working on.

377
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,901
- Love you.
- I love you more.

378
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,319
Cutest couple ever.

379
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,404
I love your love.

380
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,489
I used to love my love with my fiancée,

381
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,368
but I had to sell her ring.

382
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,662
For a coke chef.

383
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,456
Perfect segue.

384
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:39,790
Ralph.

385
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:43,252
Here's your money,
along with our sincerest apologies.

386
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:46,006
I only asked for that because
I figured you couldn't get it.

387
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,219
I'm not coming back to work
with this little douche.

388
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:51,928
Whoa.

389
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:59,435
Ralph, please don't do this. Please.

390
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,271
You know that our lives
literally depend on this.

391
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,023
No, I'm out.

392
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,859
My craft is no longer appreciated
in this world.

393
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,152
I appreciate you.

394
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,321
It is appreciated, right, Raj?

395
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:11,948
Yeah, sure.

396
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,950
Remember what I said,
<i>meri jaan,</i> grovel!

397
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,160
I...

398
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,120
Okay.

399
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,498
Listen. I flew off the handle, okay?

400
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:21,792
But it's only because I care.

401
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,085
No disrespect, Ralph,
but the best cocaine

402
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,379
I ever had was in Miami.

403
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,464
Art Basel, 2014.

404
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:32,385
Me and my crew,
we were railing this shit all night long.

405
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,636
Not hearing an apology.

406
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:36,514
We wrote a whole new Spider-Man movie,
<i>Spider-Woman.</i>

407
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:38,766
An entire new Spider-Verse.

408
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,936
And it would've been a massive hit,

409
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,896
but nobody wrote anything down.

410
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,649
That's what cocaine does, it inspires.

411
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,276
So, if I have the opportunity

412
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:51,905
to make my own cocaine,
I'm gonna do it right.

413
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,698
Somewhat unconventional,

414
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,742
but a lovely and heartfelt apology.

415
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,828
Thank you.

416
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,329
I was at that Art Basel.

417
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,123
So maybe you had this cocaine.

418
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:07,004
Okay, it was in a gold vial
with the letters MDR.

419
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:10,089
We called it "Murder."

420
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,844
That was no murder.

421
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:17,681
MDR stands for Muqtedar, my real name.

422
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,267
I made that cocaine.

423
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,394
What? That's insane,
I mean...

424
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,812
I tho... I thought
your name was Ralph?

425
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,022
Me too.

426
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:27,440
I changed it to Ralph because

427
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:30,151
none of the dumb white kids
growing up could say Muqtedar.

428
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,485
No.

429
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,487
Wait. You're MDR?

430
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,031
- Fuck yeah.
- My God!

431
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,453
I'm in the company of greatness.

432
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,038
I got chills.
You guys feel that?

433
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,332
Well, this is so cool.
Meant to be.

434
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,458
So, are we good, Ralph?

435
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,168
Can we please get back to work?

436
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:48,753
We only have nine hours left.

437
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,713
Only if we do it the way we used to.

438
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,091
This little douche is right,
I need to find my art again.

439
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,426
I lost it somewhere,

440
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,345
in between finding the love of my life,

441
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,222
having two kids and a mortgage,

442
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:01,807
and you buy a Honda Odyssey that requires

443
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,185
a lot of money because
the interest rates are so high.

444
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,520
No, see that...

445
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,856
But I wanna find
the inner da Vinci again.

446
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,483
I want to make magic.

447
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,443
That means more coke
per Achar container,

448
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,445
and we are so deep in the hole

449
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,573
that there's no way
we can afford that.

450
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,118
No, absolutely no.
. Cannot afford it.

451
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,870
No. No. No. No.

452
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,915
Mir, what do you think?

453
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,751
Um, it sounds like
a classic premium rebrand.

454
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,795
Higher margins, lower volume.

455
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,549
We could end up making more money faster.

456
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,968
Yeah, the sad simp is right.

457
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,388
Whatever it takes to get
the show on the road.

458
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:41,764
- Let's do it!
- Alright.

459
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,641
Dark DarCo is leveling up.

460
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:46,727
Janet! I'm going back to work.

461
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:47,896
Is that okay?

462
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,399
I love you, rich or poor,

463
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,024
drug chef or not.

464
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,026
My sweet...

465
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,778
I've made a huge mistake.

Don't try to be so cute.

Always a pleasure, Chickie.

475
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,732
They're not doing anything illegal.

476
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,734
They're just going through a lot of shit.

477
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:19,112
And I would know, I'm very perceptive.

478
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,656
I cannot believe that my entire career

479
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:23,115
is riding on this piece of intel,

480
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:27,412
and I have picked
the worst mole of the century.

481
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,165
Are you okay?

482
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:33,752
I need this case to go well so badly.

483
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:36,212
My boss is such an idiot.

484
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:39,757
And it is such a fucking boys club.

485
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,718
They never ask me out
to lunch or to drinks.

486
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,513
- My God.
- I know they go

487
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,598
- because they post about it.
- My God.

488
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,852
- It just, like, really hurts my feelings.
- My God, you poor baby.

489
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:52,813
Let it out.

490
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,232
- I'm here for you.
- I'm...

491
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:57,484
I'm fine.

492
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:00,736
This never happened, just so you know.

493
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,656
Stop, stop looking at me.

494
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,157
Okay.

495
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:17,546
- Hi.
- Hey.

496
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,967
What was so important
that I had to come here?

497
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,468
I need to show you something.
Come with me.

498
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,430
Whatever you need to tell me,
you can say here and make it quick.

499
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:28,765
Please.

500
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:31,435
I need you to see this.

501
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:35,772
Okay.

502
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:47,534
What is this place, Mir?

503
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:49,912
This is where I live now.

504
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:54,040
Are you trying to say
you're a bachelor from the '70s?

505
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,085
No, this is Baba's old place.

506
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,754
I didn't want you to see
what my life is now.

507
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:03,008
I mean, I work in a deli,
I live above it, I'm poor.

508
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,967
I had to pawn off your engagement ring.

509
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,719
You pawned my engagement ring?

510
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:09,055
No, no, no, no, no.

511
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,264
Hey, Bushra, please, please.

512
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:11,558
Please, Bushra, don't go.

513
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,352
- I love you.
- You're not acting like it, Mir.

514
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:17,022
I wanna give you the life
that you deserve, but I can't.

515
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,485
And you think I only love rich Mir?

516
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,196
I mean, I like him better so...

517
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,617
I didn't realize Bushra
was going to be here.

518
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:32,495
Lucky Auntie, read the room.
This isn't exactly the best time.

519
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,580
I think it is.

520
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,334
Is that...

521
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:40,711
Will you take Mir back?

522
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,296
He is a good boy,

523
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:46,425
and he is doing his very best
under difficult circumstances,

524
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,428
and he really loves you.

525
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:50,639
I do.

526
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,432
Yes.

527
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,686
<i>Mashallah.</i>

528
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:00,107
- This isn't my ring.
- It's a ring.

529
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,281
