1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,002
<i>We're the new heads
of the Dar crime organization.</i>

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,462
<i>We propose that you make us</i>

3
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:07,632
<i>the exclusive distributor in West Philly.</i>

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,304
- What the fuck?!
- FBI or Bushra?

5
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,847
This place is a pigsty!

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,766
Worse. Lucky.

7
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,355
Ahmad here scored us invites
to Chickie's Super Bowl party.

8
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,731
- You serious?
- Hell yeah!

9
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,234
Where you left me for dead, remember?
'Cause I do.

10
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:29,111
Can you move on already?
You're still alive, for God's sake.

11
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:33,199
Anyway, this is the most exclusive party
in Philly's underbelly.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,537
Basically, it is the Met Ball
for the local crime world.

13
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,747
This is your chance
to pitch Chickie

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:43,042
on expanding the business to sell
Raj's new coke in West Philly.

15
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,836
Holy shit!

16
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,004
It's game day,
motherfuckers. Let's go!

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,297
Cover up
your pee-pee, Raj.

18
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,590
It's time for business.

19
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,716
Shut up, Mir.

20
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,780
Gun.

21
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,241
Silencer.

22
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,576
Brass knuckles.

23
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,744
Alright.

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,328
Come on.

25
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,164
Phone. Wallet.

26
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:22,749
Inhaler.

27
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,502

33

To the left are the guys
who run Clark Park.

34
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,645
Don't wave.

35
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,938
- Sorry.
- Goddammit.

36
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,275
The Pho Brothers are already
neck deep up Chickie's ass.

37
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,905
They got here early.
Clever little fuckers.

38
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,115
Anyone else afraid?

39
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,575
Yeah, a little bit.

40
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,785
Ooh, the pretzel statue.

41
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,330
Dude, check it out.
I could've gone pro.

42
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,790
Hey, Lucky, cute pants.

43
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,875
Gucci?

44
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,752
I just rock them that good.

45
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,338
Go off, queen.

46
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,422
Who are these dorks?

47
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,590
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

48
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,342
My name is Mir Dar,
and this is my brother Raj Dar.

49
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,593
Hello.

50
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,261
Gigi. Chickie's daughter.

51
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,430
Raj and Mir took over
the business after their dad died.

52
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,681
Well, it must be nice.

53
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,351
My dad won't let me work with him
'cause he's a fucking boomer

54
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:26,229
who thinks women
can't be involved in business!

55
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,064
I thought it was
because you shattered

56
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,817
both of Vinnie's eye sockets
when he shit-talked Lady Gaga.

57
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,611
He had plenty
of good seeing days.

58
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:34,904
He really did.
Is your mother here?

59
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,865
No, she's in Florida. She hates the cold.

60
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,282
And by that, I mean
she's getting a neck lift.

61
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,371
Chickie.

62
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,248
Hi. Behaving yourself?

63
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,834
Am I behaving myself?

64
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,002
What am I, 10?

65
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,380
I should set this place on fire.

66
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:52,881
Again!

67
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,508
- Nice to meet you.
- So scary.

68
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,802
She's nice sometimes.
When she's sleeping.

69
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,887
So good.

70
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,348
- Chickay!
- Ahmad, my man.

71
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,516
Where's your boyfriend?

72
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,851
Dialysis.

73
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,354
Sunday's still Sunday
when you've got ketchup for blood.

74
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,148
- Mr. Lasagna, I...
- It's Lozano, actually.

75
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,858
- Sorry.
- Sir, we really would love

76
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,150
to talk to you
about expansion.

77
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,361
Expansion?
Big boy pants over here.

78
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,612
Yes, sir.

79
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,322
We really would love
to talk to you in private

80
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,699
if you have a few minutes.

81
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,868
Baby wants his bottle.

82
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,996
Okay. My office downstairs
in five minutes.

83
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,923
Director Simpson!
I was not expecting you.

84
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,677
Couldn't find anyone
to come back you up.

85
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,471
Lucky for you, I got zero going on
on the personal front.

86
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,681
Same.

87
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,224
So, what's the haps?

88
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,101
The Dars are in there
with a boatload

89
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,478
of Philly organized crime.

90
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,938
We got 'em.

91
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,065
Not until we prove it.

92
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,360
Now, we gotta slow play this.

93
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,404
You and I have
a lot of time to kill.

94
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,489
Speaking of,

95
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,867
think it's time for your boy
to do what he does best.

96
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,911
Sir, I'm very flattered,

97
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,705
but that is not...

98
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,957
I'm not talking
about that thang.

99
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,169
I'm talking about
what I do second best.

100
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,380
Go undercover.

101
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,217
Wait, you were thinking what?

102
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,885
Me and you? No.

103
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,303
No offense,
but you're not my type.

104
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,597
I like a short, bossy brunette.

105
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,681
Like someone who's like,

106
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,558
"We gotta be here at this time."

107
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,852
"What are you doing?
Saturday we have plans."

108
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,146
That's the good stuff.

109
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,315
He's with the Pho Bros.

110
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,817
He's saying something about
Chickie has furry balls?

111
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,862
What is he saying?

112
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,448
I think he's saying
Chickie has fibroids?

113
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,160
- That's so sad. My...
- He's saying, "Pho Brothers."

114
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,453
I'm an expert lip reader.

115
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,873
I know stuff about Travis
and Taylor you would not believe.

116
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,625
So, I guess I should tell my dad
that you were eavesdropping.

117
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,836
- Gigi. Come on. Don't.
- You don't have to do that.

118
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,129
- Come on.
- I'm not a rat.

119
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,091
Unless it seems fun.
Then I would be a rat.

120
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,969
If I had a little sister,
it would be someone like you.

121
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,262
Be more like Gigi, boys.

122
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,763
Yeah, be more like me.

123
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,473
Let me see what these jokers are saying.

124
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,142
Their family wants West Philly.

125
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,103
They're saying
they really deserve it.

126
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,897
Now my dad's saying
some bullshit.

127
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,357
I just check out
whenever he starts talking.

128
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,944
It literally sounds like,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

129
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,654
Bluh, bluh, bluh, bluh, bluh.

130
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,199
- The fuck you doing?
- What are you doing?

131
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,536
We're wrapping up in here.

132
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,745
A gift for you, Chickie.

133
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,706
- The boss of bosses.
- Beautiful.

134
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,000
It's going in the vault.

135
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,882
It's the pickle crew.

136
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,425
I could smell you from in there.

137
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,970
All I smell is Grade F beef,
you bitches.

138
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,058
Okay.

139
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,770
Come on in. Not you, Gigi.
We're doing business.

140
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,731
Okay. The mooks
can come in, but not me?

141
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:57,940
Alright. Yeah.

142
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,818
I'll be in the garage
cutting your brake line.

143
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,322
You three right here...

144
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,369
Yeah, I built up quite
a collection over the years.

145
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,580
Wow.

146
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,917
You know, I got something
of your dad's in there.

147
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,544
It's a Dawkins jersey
from back in the day.

148
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,505
Whoa! You got Baba's jersey?

149
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,507
I won it off him
in a dice game.

150
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,342
That's so awesome, Mr. Lasagna.

151
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,676
You know, we don't
really have much

152
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,803
of Baba's keepsakes
because of the frickin' FBI.

153
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,473
Do you mind if we take
that one home?

154
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:31,557
It's mine.

155
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,226
I mean, but, like,
we don't really have anything.

156
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,560
Yeah. Just moving along.
Moving along.

157
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,645
Let's make this quick.

158
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:36,812
I don't wanna miss the hologram

159
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,481
of Mario Lanza dancing with Gritty.

160
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,234
- Icons upon icons, here we go.
- I get it.

161
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,236
Hey, Raj, fellow business
classmate of mine.

162
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,197
Would you like to try
some of this bargain blow?

163
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,532
Sure.

164
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,991
No!

165
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,576
I have
to shit immediately.

166
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,996
I know, it's because
it's mostly baby laxatives,

167
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,916
but you should try
this new blend,

168
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,252
which is now 80% pure cocaine.

169
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,463
Whoa, that's way better!

170
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,674
I'm high as a kite,
and my diarrhea is cured.

171
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,260
Sir, I've crunched the numbers,
and we can triple our profits

172
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,637
and, by extension,
yours by the third quarter.

173
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,597
Mr. Lasagna,
drugs are my passion.

174
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,141
And I know with this blow
we can make Philly

175
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,393
the cocaine capital...

176
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,979
Of the world.

177
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,486
Yeah, it's a no.

178
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,197
You guys are real cute.

179
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,949
But who we kidding?

180
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,618
Yous ain't ready. Gigi.

181
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,538
- What?
- Meeting is over.

182
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,914
The Pho Brothers
have been doing this

183
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,708
way longer than you two.

184
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,626
I have to go with experience.

185
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,004
Take our friends
to the kids' table.

186
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:46,382
I'm really sorry
it didn't work out for you guys.

187
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,176
- Thank you, that means a lot.
- Thank you

188
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:51,095
I'm kidding.
I don't care, like, at all.

189
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,681
Come on.

190
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,475
Sir, you'll be
too exposed in there.

191
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,519
I still think this is too risky.

192
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,563
For you, maybe.
They know who you are.

193
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,106
But they've never met...

194
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,649
Joey from Fishtown.

195
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,277
What are you lookin' at?

196
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,154
Killer?

197
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:08,947
Yep.

198
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,200
So, camera's set.

199
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,997
<i>Okay, I have reception,
so if anything goes wrong in there,</i>

200
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,750
- you signal me by saying...
- No.

201
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,502
No. Look at me.

202
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:23,628
Look at me.

203
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,129
I am looking at you.

204
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,799
Never interfere with
an undercover mission.

205
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,886
No matter what happens,
you stay in the van.

206
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,887
No safe words.

207
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:33,972
You got that?

208
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,015
- Yeah.
- No safe words.

209
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,226
Got it, sir.

210
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:38,976
Good.

211
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,063
You're about to receive
a MasterClass.

212
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,565
No subscription necessary.

213
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,361
'Ey, what kind of food
you got in this place? Come on.

214
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,321
Alright, I'm ready to go.

215
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,448
<i>That was an incredible first half.</i>

216
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,660
<i>What a game we have going here...</i>

217
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,495
Can't believe I'm stuck here
with you mooks.

218
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,163
We're not mooks. Okay?

219
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,540
We're the bosses.

220
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,333
And we shouldn't even be
at the kids' table.

221
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,793
Right.

222
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:04,961
What's a mook?

223
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,880
They conquered Spain
in the 8th century.

224
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:08,589
That can't be true.

225
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,299
Fuck you, you bag of shit!

226
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,843
I fucked your grandma.

227
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,054
You probably would fuck
that ugly hoe!

228
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,013
My nephews.

229
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,849
So would they have
the same grandma?

230
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,350
Yeah, my mother.

231
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,935
This place sucks!

232
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,770
We shouldn't be here.
We should be over there!

233
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,063
I should be over there.

234
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,572
What's wrong
with this fuckin' orange?

235
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,156
That's not an oran...

236
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,242
Fuck oranges.

237
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:40,037
So, Chickie, would you like
to try a pick-me-up?

238
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,290
Maybe, you know,

239
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:42,957
give our new blend a shot?

240
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,292
Hey, no business right now, doll.

241
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,668
It's the biggest day of the year.

242
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,546
Yeah, rude, doll.

243
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,715
Some broads, you can't take
'em anywhere. Am I right?

244
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,928
Look, at the next commercial break,
we're gonna go to the adults' table.

245
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,763
Okay? I know we can
still convince him.

246
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,932
Will you give it up?
He's never gonna give you a chance.

247
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,644
He won't even let me in.
And I'm way smarter than you two.

248
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,606
And a therapist once said
I had little to no conscience.

249
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,106
That's terrifying.

250
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,525
Hey, Gigi, do you know
how to get into your dad's vault?

251
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,153
Ooh, that's interesting.

252
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,696
Yeah, the combo's
his own birthday.

253
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,781
- Fucking narcissist.
- Raj, what are you talking about?

254
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,658
Baba's jersey. I want it.

255
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,744
We cannot steal
from Chickie's vault.

256
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,495
Not only will he not
give us the territory,

257
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,872
he will skin us alive.

258
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,333
Yeah, he will.
Ooh, I'm into this.

259
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:29,003
But the jersey, Mir,
it's, like, calling me.

260
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,671
I hear it. It is calling you.

261
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,840
Yeah, Mir. I need
to see the jersey.

262
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,051
I have this distinct memory
of getting Cheez Whiz

263
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,552
all over that thing
when I was a kid.

264
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,596
That was me.

265
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,473
It was a white Dawkins jersey.

266
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,892
Mooks! There is only
one way to settle this.

267
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,560
Mir, I know you want
to see it too.

268
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,646
Come on.

269
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,189
Fine.

270
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,023
You're a fucking troublemaker.

271
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,734
- You flirting with me?
- No.

272
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,237
Chickie, about West Philly...

273
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,488
What you really
should be doing

274
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,156
is getting me another one
of these beers.

275
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,783
Grab it yourself,
fish sauce breath.

276
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,952
Hey, don't talk
to my brother like that.

277
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,954
And stick to your side
of the Schuylkill

278
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,039
unless you want
a <i>Dao Vua</i> to the chest.

279
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,834
A <i>Dao Vua</i> to my...
Try me, noodle boy.

280
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,295
That should have gone
in the basket.

281
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,381
I apologize, Chickie.

282
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:13,799
Basket.

283
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,553
Aw! Nom nom nom nom nom.

284
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,597
- Bitch.
- Can't take her nowheres.

285
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,945
Welcome to Philadelphia's museum
of contemporary bullshit.

286
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,321
Whoa.

287
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,199
The first cheese steak, petrified.

288
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,577
Black Thought's first lunchbox.

289
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,246
It's kind of cool, actually.

290
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,706
Vince Papale's bar rag.

291
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:47,957
Bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit.

292
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,626
Ship in a bottle.
Who gives a fuck?

293
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,170
Championship rings.
There's one missing.

294
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,754
I sold it.

295
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,090
Kevin Bacon's baby tooth.

296
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,176
M. Night Shyamalan's
original iPhone.

297
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,636
Yo, Chickie's collection is sick.

298
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,305
Look at this little guy.

299
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:05,683
And my dad's pride and joy,
good ol' Uncle Frank Rizzo.

300
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,852
Ew. The asshole racist mayor?

301
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,021
Yeah. And my dad's hero.
Can you believe that shit?

302
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,689
He made him wanna be a mob boss.

303
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,525
Wait, you knew that your dad was
in the mob your whole life?

304
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,819
- He never hid it from you?
- I mean, yeah.

305
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,863
But I didn't see him kill anybody
until I was 12.

306
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:19,989
He's not insane.

307
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,408
Our dad kept us out
of the business our whole lives.

308
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,868
So, you hate him, right?

309
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:24,994
- No.
- No, he's dead.

310
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,246
We actually miss him a lot.

311
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,789
Maybe you should appreciate
that you still got yours.

312
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,416
Yeah. Maybe I should.

313
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,085
Fuck you.

314
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,253
- What?
- We gotta get outta here.

315
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,381
No, we gotta find that
fucking jersey, dude.

316
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,509
<i>Touchdown! Philadelphia.</i>

317
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,387
<i>Right as time expires
at the end of the third quarter.</i>

318
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,139
I would really appreciate it

319
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,518
if you wouldn't undermine me
in front of Chickie.

320
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,522
I'm trying to close the deal.
So... piss off.

321
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:53,649
What?

322
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,526
Look,

323
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,903
the boys screwed it
with Chickie.

324
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,029
They should never have
been made Chief <i>Saab.</i>

325
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,113
I should be the boss.

326
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,407
Chickie even said so when
we were hanging out together.

327
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,951
But you fucking
stole it from me.

328
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,327
Hold on. I stole it from you?

329
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:07,912
I should have been
the Chief <i>Saab.</i>

330
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,789
Baba never wanted you
to be Chief <i>Saab!</i>

331
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,415
He told you that to your face.

332
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,709
Don't pretend like it never happened.
I was there.

333
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:17,339
Yeah.

334
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,216
But Baba's dead, isn't he?

335
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,600
This is it. I found it!

336
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,351
It's Baba's jersey.

337
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,645
Look, it's got the cheese splotch
on it and everything.

338
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,146
I told you it was
a white Dawkins jersey.

339
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,649
It was my memory.

340
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,317
<i>Yes! Yes! Gimme five.</i>

341
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,152
Whoa!

342
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,946
Holy monkey.

343
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,992
<i>Okay, boys, get out of here.
I have to do some work.</i>

344
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,369
I forgot my foam finger.

345
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,001
Shh.

346
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,631
<i>Raj.</i>

347
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:01,883
<i>Raj. Snap out of it.</i>

348
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,677
Whoa.

349
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,470
I knew Baba was a drug dealer.

350
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,972
- What are you talking about?
- The jersey.

351
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,724
It unearthed a memory.

352
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:12,019
I saw him stuffing coke
inside a MegaGlug.

353
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,604
You knew who Baba was
this whole time?

354
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,189
Ooh.

355
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,816
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

356
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:19,902
Fight.

357
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,279
How could you not tell me?

358
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,655
It was buried, man.

359
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,365
Like, really fucking deep.

360
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,992
That's how I deal
with all my hard memories.

361
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,204
I put 'em in my memory palace,
and now it's open.

362
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:31,663
No.

363
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,707
Here comes a lot more shit.

364
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,459
I fed you a centipede
when you were six.

365
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,877
Alan Iverson only agreed
to meet you

366
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,670
because I told him you were
a Make-A-Wish kid.

367
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,756
- I had a boner at <i>Dadi's</i> funeral.
- I knew it.

368
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,885
Take that, you son of a bitch.

369
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,261
What the fuck are you doing?

370
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,471
She's getting in trouble.

371
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,556
Fuck. Hey, come back here
with Frank Rizzo's ear.

372
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,274
I'm going around the back.

373
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,443
Watch and learn from the master.

374
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:04,863
<i>Yo.</i>

375
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,698
Raj, we gotta find her
or we're fucked.

376
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,867
I started the rumor
about you having three balls.

377
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,452
I catfished you
on AOL instant messenger.

378
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,871
Raj, shut up! Stop.

379
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,164
Okay, thank you
for ruining my life.

380
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,250
I had a fucked-up sense
of humor back then, man.

381
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,668
I didn't know
you were gonna fall in love

382
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:19,877
with MasalaMommy1989.

383
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,588
That's not what
I'm talking about.

384
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,468
Raj, if I knew Baba
was a drug dealer,

385
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,513
I wouldn't have spent my entire life
trying to be like him.

386
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,391
But you are like him, man.

387
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,018
Like, without even trying.

388
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,020
In a great way.

389
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:39,565
You think so?

390
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,817
Okay. Okay.

391
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,069
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>

392
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,697
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>

393
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,616
Ooh!

394
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,870
<i>Take it easy.</i>

395
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,373
They're gonna kill him.

396
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,042
<i>Help. Help me.</i>

397
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,626
<i>Help.</i>

398
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,588
<i>Nobody's gonna help you,
you fuck!</i>

399
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,228
I'm not crying. Those guys
kicked dirt in my eyes.

400
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:22,482
I got a couple good shots in there.

401
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,861
After the lapel pin fell off.

402
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,283
Excuse me. Sorry. Yeah.

403
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,828
Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry, guys.

404
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,749
For fuck's sake.

405
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,006
Chickie, let's talk about
West Philly, man to man.

406
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,968
Man to man,
your crew isn't tight.

407
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:51,677
You and Lucky hate each other.

408
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:55,015
These young guys at the head,
they don't have the grit.

409
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,141
Doesn't give me
the confidence I need

410
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,019
to give you more territory.

411
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,944
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

412
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,486
What am I doing?

413
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:11,614
I'm at a mobster's house
trying to gain drug territory?

414
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,032
Yeah.

415
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,243
It's pretty messed up.

416
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,454
You really think
I'm like Baba?

417
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,250
Put your arms up.

418
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,795
I'm gonna put this on.

419
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,552
Get your head through.

420
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,933
It fits.

421
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,727
It fits.

422
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,190
I'm sorry my brain
is so fucked up, man.

423
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,609
But if I got to shield you
from any of this bullshit

424
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,945
then it was worth it.

425
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,197
That's what Baba was doing
with us, I guess.

426
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,283
Yeah.

427
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,204
Get me the Dar boys!

428
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,289
- Shit.
- Fuck.

429
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,374
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

430
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:13,050
Is this, some kind
of, like, retaliation

431
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,844
fo-for not giving you West Philly?

432
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:17,263
No, not retaliation. Okay?

433
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,556
We swear we didn't do anything.

434
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,183
Mr. Lasagn... Lozano.

435
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,685
I know it looks bad
but if you let me explain...

436
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:25,521
<i>...turn of events,
the Eagles have lost the game</i>

437
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,689
<i>76-6.</i>

438
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,399
Goddamn.

439
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,860
Everybody out!

440
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:31,277
Party's over.

441
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,279
- Alright. Thank you for the hospitality.
- Out!

442
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,032
You assholes stay right here!

443
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,867
Nick, get in here.

444
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,285
I did it.

445
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,996
I took Rizzo's ear.

446
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,081
And I gave 'em
that stupid jersey too.

447
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,334
Why would you do this?

448
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:47,503
Felt like it.

449
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,671
Mr. Lasagna,
your daughter is calculating

450
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,674
and deceitful
and for sure crazy.

451
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,719
All the qualities one needs
to be a good gangster.

452
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:57,596
Don't take it for granted.

453
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,598
Our dad kept us outta
the business to protect us.

454
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,141
And now we'll never know
what it's like

455
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,769
to work together as a family.

456
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,811
And I don't know
if we'll ever get over it.

457
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,689
Don't make the same mistake
our Baba did.

458
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,232
You still have a chance.

459
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,859
I was just trying
to protect you,

460
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,362
but now I gotta let you fly,

461
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:14,862
like an eagle.

462
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,697
I'm ready to fly, Daddy.

463
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,574
And these guys
aren't total mooks.

464
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:19,785
I mean, I don't hate them.

465
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,996
- Aw.
- See? She likes us.

466
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,832
And while I have
your ear, I'm kidding,

467
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,918
I'd like to tell you why
we should get West Philly.

468
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,045
'Cause we're gonna make you
a fuck-ton of money.

469
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,297
It's that simple.

470
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,424
The balls on these guys.

471
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,596
<i>This product will be shipped
to every ABC Deli</i>

472
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,684
across the Delaware Valley
on a weekly basis.

473
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:46,061
What do you say, Chickie?

474
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,192
West Philly's yours.

475
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,111
What? Really?

476
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:56,362
My God.
Thank you so much, sir.

477
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,074
- Thank you so much.
- Hell yeah.

478
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,200
No one believed
in your father either.

479
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,827
You know, I gave him a chance,
and it paid off.

480
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:05,204
I promise we will not disappoint you.

481
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,455
- We won't.
- Pho Brothers might be

482
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,708
a little disappointed,
but we'll not disappoint you.

483
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,334
Things went a different way.

484
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,920
Sometimes the favorite
doesn't win.

485
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:13,797
That's why...

486
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,133
I bet against the Eagles
and made a fortune today.

487
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:18,718
- A smart man.
- Genius.

488
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:19,803
A smart man.

489
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:21,972
It's the next generation's turn.

490
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:24,182
Come here.

491
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:25,434
- I'm coming...
- No.

492
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,602
I think he means Gigi.

493
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:29,395
- Right, right, right.
- Yeah, that makes sense.

494
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,605
That makes sense.
Father-daughter.

495
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:31,690
Yeah.

496
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,778
Daddy, let's fire Nick.
I hate him.

497
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,115
Why are you guys still here?

498
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:43,326
- Sorry. Yes.
- Let's get outta here. Let's go.

499
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,619
- Thank you for the hospitality once again.
- Thank you.
