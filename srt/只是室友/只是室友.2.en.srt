1
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,768
Hello? Ma'am? Hello?

2
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,104
I-is this your car? You can't park here.

3
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,732
Boom.

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,360
♪ In my stid I'll hops ♪

5
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,111
♪ At the top like fizz and soda pop ♪

6
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,572
♪ The effect of my flics
hit you like a judo chop ♪

7
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,677
Salaam, salaam.

8
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,589
What the fuck is happening, Lucky?

9
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,849
Hey! Nothing we can't handle.
Just need a plan.

10
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,678
I'm not taking my shoes off
inside the house.

11
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,559
- I hate that bullshit.
- Like hell you won't.

12
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,021
Bastard.

13
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,731
Ek minute, okay?

14
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,072
What are we gonna do, man?
I don't know where he is.

15
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,699
My God. What idiots.

16
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,033
Is he dead or...

17
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,203
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

18
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,371
Fuck!

19
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,867
Stop screaming! You're making it worse.

20
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:21,915
You stop screaming!

21
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,452
We gotta think about this. Okay?

22
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,794
We gotta go hide somewhere
unfathomably far from here.

23
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,754
Florida?

24
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,674
Yes.

25
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,676
God, it's Lucky Auntie.

26
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,470
Okay. Whatever you do,
do not pick up the phone.

27
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,390
Lucky Auntie, hi. W-what's good?

28
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,768
You know, we're just
at the deli doing deli things.

29
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,729
Being, being deli guys.

30
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,772
I can see you.
There's a camera up there. Look.

31
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,357
Up. Left.

32
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,442
Other left.

33
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,777
Up, up.
What the hell is going on there?

34
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,778
Hi, Lucky Auntie. It's Mir Dar.

35
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,525
We were talking,
and we think we're better suited

36
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,027
to doing something
other than running this front.

37
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,778
We're gonna run away
to Tallahassee, Florida.

38
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,280
Shut the fuck up. That ship has sailed.

39
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,538
Look, we're in crisis point here. Hold on.

40
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,453
If this meeting with the board
doesn't go well, we're all dead.

41
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,127
- Dead?
- What board?

42
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,838
The board. The...
You know what?

43
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,131
I don't have time to explain
the illegal drug business

44
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,300
to you two baby men.

45
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,712
Okay? I just need to go in there

46
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,428
and take control of stuff right now.

47
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,472
Wait. Is that why you tried
to kill Hamza?

48
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,143
What do you mean "tried"?

49
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,483
- I...
- Well, he just...

50
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,236
He's just, like, not dead, like, at all.

51
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,904
H-h-he's-he's like half-dead.

52
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,155
Well, he-he's half-dead,

53
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,026
and he got up and ran away
and we sort of lost him.

54
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,367
What do you mean not dead?

55
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,577
You need to go, you need
to fucking find him.

56
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,199
You need to kill him,
and you need to put him in the apartment

57
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,581
upstairs of the deli, okay?

58
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,035
There's an apartment above the deli?

59
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,458
- You hear me? You need to...
- Yo.

60
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:49,545
- Almost done.
- Okay.

61
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,712
Just coming.

62
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,465
You need to get him
and you need to do it right now!

63
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,050
- Okay.
- Okay. Alright. Okay.

64
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,266
Sorry. That was my gynecologist.

65
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,095
- I have no idea where he went.
- Shit, shit, shit, shit.

66
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,763
- You know where he went?
- How are we gonna find this guy?

67
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,265
If we don't, we're screwed.
We're closed!

68
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,773
I'm sure we can find a guy
with a paper bag on his head.

69
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,901
- Shit! I mean, hello.
- Hi.

70
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,571
Agent Mercer from the DarCo raid.

71
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,155
What are you doing here?

72
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,034
I heard there was an ABC Deli
somehow still open and operating.

73
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,953
Just thought I would
come see it for myself.

74
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,294
Yes. Well, this is
a completely separate enterprise

75
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,880
on account for it lacking
the proper hookup

76
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,584
- for a regulation hotdog turner.
- Yes.

77
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,008
Do you expect me to believe

78
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:39,178
that you two spoiled brats
are actually working here?

79
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,965
Why is everybody being
so mean to us today?

80
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,182
Detective, ma'am,
you know more than anyone

81
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,309
that the government
has taken everything from us,

82
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,935
including my casual tennis clothes.

83
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,063
Yes. So if you don't have
a warrant, then we...

84
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,233
"...reserve the right
to refuse service to anyone."

85
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,695
Guys, I know you're hiding something.

86
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,156
Your father was a master criminal.

87
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,326
There's no way the two of you
could possibly be this stupid.

88
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,119
What?

89
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,913
N-nothing.

90
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:07,873
Please continue.

91
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,419
I got a hunch that you Dars
are up to something worse than tax fraud.

92
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,422
Ma'am, there is nothing worse
than tax fraud.

93
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,595
I'm taking this Tastykake.

94
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,472
Okay. You can have it.

95
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,183
T-thank you. Have a good day.

96
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,519
Okay! Go-Go in the back!
Go in the back!

97
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,271
I'm gonna cover two blocks
west of the deli.

98
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,850
You cover two blocks east.
We'll find him in the middle.

99
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,275
Dude, you don't catch
a guy by chasing him.

100
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,568
But this is a chase.

101
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,779
Hamza runs. We chase
or people are gonna kill us.

102
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,280
I don't chase.

103
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,032
I attract.

104
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,576
What does that even mean?

105
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,620
My God,
I've known you my entire life.

106
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,908
I don't understand half the shit
that's coming out of your mouth,

107
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,910
and now I'm stuck in this
fucking nightmare with you.

108
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,120
I like that we get to learn
about this part of Baba's life.

109
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,753
It's like another facet to the guy.

110
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:58,173
Raj, Baba was a fraud, a drug dealer,
and possibly a murderer.

111
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,133
Everybody's got flaws, Mir.

112
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,511
I love him even more
knowing he wasn't perfect.

113
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,346
You're completely insane.

114
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,391
Ooh, pretzels!

115
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,850
Why are you collecting garbage pretzels?

116
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,311
Come on, help me grab these.

117
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,693
We can't start without Hamza.

118
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,570
I'm sure he's just late.

119
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,364
We'll catch him up later.
We have so much to get through.

120
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,742
I do hope
nothing has happened to him.

121
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,370
What could have possibly happened to him?

122
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,788
Do you know something I don't?

123
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,748
Like, was he trying to make
a move on the deli

124
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,292
to help you take over as CEO?

125
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,457
No. He's probably just late.

126
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,424
Let's start.

127
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,052
Salaam, everyone.

128
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:48,182
In the wake of the loss
of our beloved leader, Baba Dar,

129
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:52,936
I hereby call this emergency meeting
to discuss next steps for Dark DarCo.

130
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,105
Shall we take attendance? Lucky, present.

131
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,857
- Ahmad, here.
- Ali. Here.

132
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,901
- Feraz, here.
- Hassan, present.

133
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,152
Dawar, here.

134
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,612
Hamza, absent.

135
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,284
Okay, let's begin.

136
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,916
Just a matter of time.

137
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,870
This isn't gonna work, man.
We're fucking screwed.

138
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,288
That attitude is gonna get us nowhere.

139
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,254
Really? And your pretzel trap
is gonna work?

140
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,673
- Life is not a cartoon, Raj.
- Agree to disagree.

141
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:25,385
What do I know? My life is ruined.
I have nothing. Who cares?

142
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,430
Hey, man. You're gonna be
all right, little bro.

143
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,060
Holy fucking shit.

144
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,355
- Got you now, you fuck!
- Stop screaming.

145
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,397
- You're gonna scare him away.
- He's not a cat.

146
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,120
So, the recent disruption
to our business

147
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:56,083
by the fucking FBI has had
a catastrophic effect

148
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,334
on our bottom line.

149
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,128
We are currently in the red. Blood red.

150
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,333
Yes. Ali, thank you so much
for letting us use your house.

151
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,423
It's very nice.

152
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,133
My wife has great taste.

153
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,052
What the fuck is happening?

154
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,179
Without ABC Delis, we have
no distribution system.

155
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,722
Correct. We are trying to get

156
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,683
a new distribution system
up and running.

157
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,845
And how long will that take?

158
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,304
We are in the process
of finding the best...

159
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,436
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

160
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,233
Look, this organization is on
the path to total destruction.

161
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,860
- It...
- Baba pissed away millions

162
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,319
on those golf courses

163
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,238
and depleted all our cash.

164
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,866
Baba was using those golf courses

165
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,361
to get into the international market.

166
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,161
Very smart move in the long run. So...

167
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,454
In the long run.

168
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,624
But in the short run, where we live,

169
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,793
the Peruvians want their ten mil.

170
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:40,878
Ten million?

171
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,255
We're in a fucking hole,

172
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,175
and we can't even earn
our own bread and butter.

173
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,177
This is just a temporary setback.

174
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,888
Tell that to the Peruvians
when they're slitting our throats.

175
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,723
Not if we kill them first.

176
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,268
Whatever you think,

177
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,813
panicking is not going to get us anywhere.

178
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,232
What we need is a plan and a leader.

179
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,109
Me. I'm the obvious choice.

180
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,396
- I don't think so.
- And so...

181
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:09,114
No. I think we need
to elect a new leader. Me.

182
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,410
I call for a vote to elect
the new CEO of Dark DarCo.

183
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,828
A vote?

184
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,499
Come on, watch this.
All in favor of a vote.

185
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,545
Fuck me.

186
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,547
My God.

187
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,217
Our friend had way too much
to drink last night.

188
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,010
- Hey.
- Tequila. You know how it is.

189
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,262
That must be the apartment.

190
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,307
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

191
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,808
Come on,
let's get him upstairs.

192
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,146
Okay.

193
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,315
Okay. Alright. We got this.

194
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,983
Okay, come on.

195
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,278
Whoa!

196
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,405
My God.

197
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,950
Holy shit.

198
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,037
Baba had a secret lair.

199
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,374
That is so fucking baller.

200
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,963
Look at these pillows, man. Wow.

201
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,006
Miss you, big guy.

202
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,021
Goddammit.
This fucker is still alive?

203
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,189
How is that possible?

204
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,648
We gotta think of something, man.

205
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,318
Tie him to that radiator.
Okay, grab his arm.

206
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,070
- One, two, three.
- Three!

207
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,191
- Where is the radiator?
- It's over there!

208
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,032
I haven't scanned
the whole place yet.

209
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,200
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

210
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,660
Okay.

211
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:39,997
Let's tie him up.

212
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,749
Okay.

213
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,501
Poor bastard.

214
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,212
Hey, Lucky Auntie. It's Mir Dar.

215
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,838
We talked earlier on the phone today.

216
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,884
I called you, you idiot.
Did you find Hamza?

217
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,047
Yes, we indeed found him,
we took him upstairs,

218
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,637
and he's currently tied to a radiator.

219
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,933
What do you mean tied?
Is he still alive?

220
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,935
Yeah, he is, but just barely alive.

221
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,770
You know, it's actually kind of amazing.

222
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,355
This guy's a real survivor.

223
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,690
- He got hit by a car.
- Yeah.

224
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,317
Amazing. Re-kill him.

225
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,321
Um, what? You're the one
that didn't kill him enough.

226
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,566
There's a gun in the credenza.

227
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,490
You need to just finish him off now.

228
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,320
- What?
- "What, what, what, what, what, what?"

229
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,118
What part of this are you
not understanding?

230
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,746
Credenza, if I'm being honest.

231
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,123
I-I-I don't think I know
what that is. Is it a...

232
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:24,958
Okay, Lucky Auntie, we can't kill a guy!

233
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:28,003
And yet you are going to,
or we are all fucked.

234
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,005
Will you just fucking handle this?

235
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,717
I have to go write my campaign speech.

236
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,851
Goddamn. How did all these videos
about guns not get taken down?

237
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:46,146
I don't know, man. They flagged my video
making weed-infused biryani.

238
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,398
- You were naked in it.
- So?

239
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,778
Yikes. He does not sound too good.

240
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:54,899
Yeah, maybe we won't have
to kill him though.

241
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,072
You know, it sounds like
nature is taking its course.

242
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,659
Maybe we should do something for him.

243
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,702
Like, like get him a last meal.

244
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,540
You're so smart. You are so smart. Yes.

245
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,958
I'm gonna go get him a Slim Jim.

246
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,251
Maybe something sweet.

247
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,377
Ice cream!

248
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,256
Smoke was trickling in
through a broken window.

249
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,800
As we ran down the hallway
yelling and screaming,

250
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,301
emotions ran high.

251
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,512
The kind of emotions that you can only get

252
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,682
when you've given in
to a treasonous cause.

253
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,602
Two years undercover
with the Lads of Honor?

254
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,479
You're a legend.

255
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,022
Show the video again.

256
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,775
Yeah! Y'all ready for this?

257
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,318
Yeah!

258
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,946
It's not moving.

259
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,532
Suck on this, Nancy.

260
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:48,250
So you actually took
a dump on Pelosi's desk?

261
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,668
I shit on someone's desk.

262
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,336
You have to buy my book to find out.

263
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,049
What's it called?

264
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:59,261
January 6th: How I Saved Democracy.

265
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,929
- Epic.
- Thank you.

266
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,097
I think it is pretty epic.

267
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,558
Director Simpson,
you're my new supervisor.

268
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,977
Francis Mercer. Welcome to Philadelphia.

269
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,140
I have something major that
you are gonna want to hear about.

270
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,981
Can you come back
in, like, 10 minutes?

271
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,318
Wait, make it 20.

272
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,654
"Chapter Six, The Aftermath.

273
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,823
"We met at the hotel bar,
and shots were on me.

274
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,492
What did they order? Well whiskey."

275
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,206
As you know, I was Baba's key disciple

276
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,292
with deep involvement
in both DarCo and Dark DarCo.

277
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,085
I know where all the bodies are buried.

278
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,754
Put half of them there myself.

279
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,633
And, I also know that
this organization works best

280
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,218
when it comes to our enemies.

281
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,427
Would you just stop that?

282
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,598
I have proven my worth
to this organization

283
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,642
with decades of dedication

284
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,228
that has helped make each
and every one of you

285
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:51,730
very, very rich, so you're welcome.

286
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,607
And, um, yeah...

287
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,276
thank you so much.

288
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,154
No, thank you, Lucky.

289
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:03,951
Some say "Loser Lucky."

290
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,369
That's my nickname for her.

291
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,412
"Loser Lucky" 'cause that's what she is.

292
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:10,958
Can you imagine this woman thinks

293
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,960
she can fill Baba's shoes?

294
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,212
I was the only one who stood up to Baba.

295
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,791
Because you were trying to undermine him.

296
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:20,008
Those golf courses put us
in debt. I was right.

297
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:22,177
Baba died before he could see
his vision through.

298
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:24,346
Stop interrupting.
Wait, you're a woman.

299
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,223
You can't.

300
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,101
Come on! You guys know me.

301
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,562
I'm fucking crazy!

302
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,021
But in a good way.

303
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,816
In a way that outlaws respect.

304
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:40,320
So let's put an end to this
and do the only responsible thing.

305
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,197
All in favor of me.

306
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:43,615
Yeah.

307
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,954
Watch and learn, old man.

308
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,958
All in favor of me, go ahead,
raise your hands.

309
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,836
Take your hands off your dicks
and raise them.

310
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,136
- I think he likes it though.
- I don't think so.

311
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:11,268
Shit. It's Bushra.

312
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,686
I'm gonna lose her too.

313
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,480
Fucked.

314
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,900
Goddammit!

315
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,151
I got this, bro.

316
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,696
Hey.

317
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,198
- Alright.
- What are you doing?

318
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,401
Alright, let's fucking do this.

319
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,611
No, no, no, no, no, no, dude,

320
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,529
we can't just kill a guy
because you're hyped up about it.

321
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,537
Why not? That's, like,
how every stabbing works.

322
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,331
The stabber is all hyped up to stab.

323
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,826
Are you listening
to yourself right now?

324
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,957
The universe brought us here, man.
Stop fighting it.

325
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,295
Why can't you allow yourself
to think for one second?

326
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,589
This is not normal. Baba was not normal.

327
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,757
Normal is a...

328
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,925
Social construct, man.

329
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,219
"It's just capitalism, dude."

330
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,054
Stop talking like a Bad Brains T-shirt

331
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,347
and think for one second.

332
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,973
I don't have time for that, Mir.

333
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,392
Okay? Yeah, this situation is fucked.

334
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,686
But how's it gonna be
if both of us are freaking out?

335
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,772
You're gonna do it?

336
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,525
- No.
- Then let me.

337
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,652
Okay.

338
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:03,529
Alright!

339
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,281
You ready to die, man?

340
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,742
You ready to get fucked up, man?

341
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,537
Ooh! Die!

342
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,169
- I couldn't do it.
- Yeah.

343
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,964
Was I ever in danger?
Yes, I was.

344
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,091
Next Question?

345
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,432
Holy shit.

346
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,398
Poison, too much screen time,

347
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,608
autoerotic asphyxiatio...

348
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:43,986
What happened to the knife?

349
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,364
What happened to Hamza?

350
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,741
Shit!

351
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,841
My God. You saved me, man.

352
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,801
- My God, I killed him!
- But to save me.

353
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,678
I actually killed him for real this time.

354
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:10,762
To save me!

355
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,733
God. I-I should
put pressure on it, right?

356
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,021
Or am I not supposed to move you
until the ambulance gets here?

357
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,190
No, we can't call an ambulance, man.
You just killed a guy.

358
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,198
Okay, for the record, we killed a guy.

359
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,985
Okay? I don't want that on my hands alone.

360
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,409
Okay, stick your finger in it.

361
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,244
What? Why would I do that?

362
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,782
You stick your finger in it
and then you smell your fingers.

363
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:37,873
If it smells like poop,

364
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,452
then I'll die
of the worst infection ever.

365
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,376
- Go.
- Who told you that?

366
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,748
It was on Better Call Saul, man.
You didn't watch Better Call Saul?

367
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:44,880
No, I don't have AMC Plus.

368
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,501
You can buy every season on Prime Video.

369
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,419
But I'm already paying
a subscription fee, Raj.

370
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,345
I'm not gonna pay more
for a specific show just on principle.

371
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,137
Okay, just hurry.
Stick your finger in it.

372
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,348
Mir?

373
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,307
- Bushra?
- Mir, are you there?

374
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,352
No, no, no, no, no!

375
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,604
Hey!

376
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:01,980
I know we promised not to look

377
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,227
at each other's shared location
unless it was an emergency.

378
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,484
But this is an emergency.

379
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,236
I'm worried about you.

380
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:08,904
What is this place?

381
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,864
Hurry, Mir.
I need your finger.

382
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:11,990
Is someone in there?

383
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,785
Yeah, it's, um, Raj.
He actually wants to say hi.

384
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:15,911
Hold on a second.

385
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,623
Hi.

386
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,333
- Hi, Raj.
- See you.

387
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,541
You know, we're so busy grieving.
You know, Raj is in a really bad place.

388
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:27,548
I'm gonna die.

389
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,341
Is he saying he's gonna die?

390
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,801
From grief.

391
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,218
You know, he's, he's really dramatic.
You know how he is.

392
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,180
Something's not right, Mir.

393
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,850
Do you like Florida?

394
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:41,979
Miami and the Keys are nice.

395
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,939
I love you so much.
I really have to go.

396
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,606
Okay. I promise I'm gonna get
our lives back to normal so soon.

397
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,444
Okay? I'll see you
in the next 24 to 96 hours.

398
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:50,946
Don't shut me out, Mir.

399
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,197
I'm not shutting you out.

400
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:58,328
Call Prairie.

401
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:00,414
Raj, your shaman can't help us.

402
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,743
There's some things
that can't be cured with DMT, okay?

403
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,793
Call her.

404
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:07,754
I'm told that the Dalai Lama's robes
brushed up against it.

405
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,715
And it's deeply discounted right now.

406
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,300
Hold that thought.

407
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:15,179
Hi, my king. I can't talk
right now. I'm liquidating.

408
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,389
I didn't realize how important
you being rich was

409
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:18,473
to my healing abilities.

410
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,309
Turns out the strongest crystal is money.

411
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,643
Hi, babe. I just wanted to...

412
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,145
No, but don't worry
about it, baby.

413
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,271
I got this. I got us.

414
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,766
I'm gonna do whatever I need to do

415
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,150
to get us back into alignment
with our orgy cabal.

416
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,276
What's up?

417
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,071
Nothing. I just wanted to say hi.

418
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,948
Okay. Hi. I gotta go.

419
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,284
What the fuck was that?

420
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,162
We should probably go
to the hospital so I don't die.

421
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,123
Raj, we can't take you to the hospital.

422
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,212
Hey, Baba trusted Dr. Elahi-Khan, okay?

423
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,588
She won't report this.

424
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,381
They still have the same toys.

425
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,509
Yeah. 
Yeah, they do.

426
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,135
Eissa Ibrahim Dar?

427
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,720
It's Raj.

428
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:00,015
Dr. Elahi-Khan will see you now.

429
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,350
Okay.

430
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,061
I think I can do it.

431
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,389
- There you go.
- Alright, fine.

432
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,105
- There you go.
- Um...

433
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,149
- Alright. See you soon, buddy.
- Okay.

434
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:19,785
Hey, psst.

435
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,496
I know he seems like a great guy.

436
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,498
He gets you ice cream, he reads to you.

437
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,292
But in your quiet moments,
ask yourself...

438
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:29,795
do you really know him?

439
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:38,971
And on our seventh vote,

440
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:42,933
we are three for him and three for me.

441
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,935
Look, we are wasting precious time

442
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,056
when we should be getting
the business up and running.

443
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:48,897
Why don't you just vote for me,

444
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:52,109
and we can move on
with our lives? Goddammit.

445
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,318
Is it because I'm gay?

446
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,196
No. No. Of course not.

447
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,907
We love Charlie.
Makes great chaat.

448
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,659
Wait, Charlie's your boyfriend?

449
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:03,120
I thought he was your dad. He's like 90.

450
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,080
Yeah. And I'm the twink.
What's your point?

451
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,541
Goddammit! I just wish Baba were here.

452
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,793
None of you can fill his shoes. Idiots.

453
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:11,295
He was a great man.

454
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,547
I truly miss him.

455
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,427
Lunch is here!

456
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:24,224
I've got the 76ers foot-long slam-wich
for my friend right here. How you doing?

457
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,351
Ooh! You got the slam-wich!

458
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:29,479
Okay, we need to stop this, Ahmad.

459
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,017
I don't like you, you don't like me...

460
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:33,108
That's putting it mildly.

461
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,484
You're power hungry.

462
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,236
Baba let you get away with murder.

463
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,030
But he's gone now.

464
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:41,491
You are a petty narcissist
with a cheap suit on.

465
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,118
But guess what?

466
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:44,530
We have to put
our differences aside

467
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,038
for the greater good, don't we?

468
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:47,998
If Hamza were here,

469
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,168
I'd be Chief Saab
and you'd be serving me chai.

470
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:55,214
Will you just cut the misogyny,
you fuckstick?

471
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,800
We have to get the business operational
by naming a CEO.

472
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:01,595
The clock is ticking with the Peruvians,
and you know it.

473
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:06,934
I have an idea.

474
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,812
One of the lads put
his gun right here,

475
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,190
and he said, "You wanna hang out
with Mike Pence?"

476
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:16,401
I said, "Relax, brother.
I want to hang Mike Pence."

477
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,111
So then, we all got to...

478
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:21,114
I am this close to blowing up
the entire Dar crime family.

479
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:22,449
I want to reopen the case.

480
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:23,951
On what grounds?

481
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,617
Why are you giving me
a half-eaten Tastykake? I don't want this.

482
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,667
That Tastykake is from
a prime impulse buy spot

483
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,210
at the last ABC Deli.

484
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:37,089
Look at the wrapper. It expired in 2021.

485
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:39,967
The bestselling prepackaged cake
in all of Philadelphia?

486
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:41,760
That's fishy.

487
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:43,345
So, you think it's a front?

488
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,721
Y-yes.

489
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:48,100
This is gonna be big. I can feel it.

490
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,396
When I went after the Lads of Honor,

491
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,398
they told me I'd be wasting
millions of dollars

492
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,816
in federal resources,

493
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:59,069
that I'd embarrass myself,
my country, the agency.

494
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:00,904
But look at me now.

495
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:03,866
Go get 'em.

496
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,326
