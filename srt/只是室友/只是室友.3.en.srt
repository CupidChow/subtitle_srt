1
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,721
When I was 10, I
wanted to be Wolverine.

2
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:16,601
The OG GOAT.

3
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:19,881
In this life we all know
it's hunt or be hunted.

4
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:21,721
I choose to be a hunter.

5
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,161
The alpha.

6
00:00:23,261 --> 00:00:24,361
Yes! Yes!

7
00:00:24,461 --> 00:00:25,801
And this is my hunting ground.

8
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,121
Yes!

9
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:29,921
In Australia, footy
players are gods

10
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:32,561
and I'm gonna be the
hardest centre half forward

11
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:34,481
this country's ever seen.

12
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:36,241
Our ancestors were staunch.

13
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:37,361
It's in our blood.

14
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:38,761
He takes after me.

15
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:40,921
Mum's been hustling
with me since the jump.

16
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:42,021
Since then...

17
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:43,121
Go, son!

18
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:44,841
...we've been an
unstoppable team.

19
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:46,001
Come on!

20
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:47,401
Yes!

21
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:48,761
Yeah!

22
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:50,561
Go, Hammer!

23
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:52,201
Whoo-hoo!

24
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:53,761
Fuck, yeah!

25
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:56,121
Go, Hammer! Go, Hammer!

26
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:07,441
My woman Rochelle's a
10, with a god-tier body.

27
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:10,801
If I'm going to be the best,
I've gotta be with the best.

28
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:14,641
I pledge my body to God
until sacred marriage.

29
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,901
This is my vow.

30
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:22,681
Mum says the Ground Shakers
aren't a real church,

31
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:24,761
but I like how freaky it is.

32
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:26,481
OK, so the rules are -

33
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:28,201
kissing with tongue,

34
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,961
touching's OK,

35
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:31,921
and some light
rubbing, but undies on.

36
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:34,021
Um, finger?

37
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:36,681
Yeah.

38
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:38,281
Yeah, one finger.

39
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:40,361
Oh, and oral.

40
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:43,001
Just no swallowing.

41
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:46,401
She's not like the other
loose girls in this town.

42
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,501
And that's a turn on.

43
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:56,841
This year it'll all pay off.

44
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:59,361
I'll be a top 10
draft pick for sure.

45
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:01,121
Mum says pressure makes diamonds

46
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,761
and no one can take away your
shine from you except you.

47
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:06,881
So this year I'm going
to be unstoppable.

48
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:08,801
Oh! Oh!

49
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,961
Oh!

50
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:12,321
Oh!

51
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:14,121
♪ Pressure
makes a diamond

52
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:15,521
Pressure makes a diamond

53
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:19,061
♪ Pressure makes a
diamond Let's go. ♪

54
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:24,841
Cheers to that!
Cheers to that, boys!

55
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:26,641
A couple of bevvies
with the boys.

56
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:29,641
Go, the boys, boys, boys.
Who's up for a chugalug?

57
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:31,321
Oh, I'm always up for it!

58
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:39,201
So...

59
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:41,601
...tomorrow's our
one-year anniversary.

60
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:42,761
Really?

61
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:44,441
Mm-hm.

62
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:50,401
And I was thinking maybe we
could do something special.

63
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:53,401
You tell me what you
want and I'll get it.

64
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,881
No, I don't want a present.

65
00:02:55,981 --> 00:03:00,741
Well, at least not
something you can buy.

66
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:04,621
You mean a wristie?

67
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:10,841
I was thinking maybe we
could go further than that.

68
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,361
Hmm?

69
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:15,501
Like, all the way?

70
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:19,361
And what about this?

71
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:22,561
Well, like, Jesus
sees our commitment.

72
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:27,381
And it's not like either of
us are going anywhere, right?

73
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:30,941
We're ride or die.

74
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,441
16 million
can now vote yes or no

75
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,121
for same sex marriage.

76
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:40,637
Every
Australian will have their say.

77
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:43,281
Jesus, Malcolm, you're
useless as tits on a bull!

78
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:45,461
Hey, blood pressure, Jack.

79
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:48,121
Are you off, darls?

80
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:50,121
Yes, Mrs Hammersmith.

81
00:03:50,221 --> 00:03:52,201
You send love to your
family for us, OK?

82
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:53,801
I will. Goodnight.

83
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,161
Goodnight.

84
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:56,761
...to
same sex marriage,

85
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,521
the result declared
on November 15.

86
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:00,001
Bye.

87
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,681
If yes, a vote is
expected in Parliament

88
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:05,721
and expected to pass
by the end of the year.

89
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:07,281
I think my knee's getting bungy.

90
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,681
OK, so we'll strap it up
extra tight this week.

91
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:11,321
The combine's just
around the corner.

92
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:13,801
You need to kick arse
at the time trial runs.

93
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:16,361
That's the event the clubs
are really watching. OK?

94
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:18,481
They dumped it. No.

95
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,641
They changed it from
three kilometres to two.

96
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,721
So, no distractions.

97
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:25,641
Rochelle's really lovely,
but you've got to focus.

98
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:26,921
OK?

99
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:29,021
Tea's ready!

100
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,321
So, I see St Lawrence's

101
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:35,901
still hasn't expelled
that Charlie Roth.

102
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:41,562
Um, Mulroney reckons I might
make dux of the school.

103
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:43,562
Ah.

104
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:47,082
I had a word to that
Father Mulroney today.

105
00:04:47,182 --> 00:04:48,602
About what?

106
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:50,602
Oh, the curriculum.

107
00:04:50,702 --> 00:04:53,842
Turns out that smut wasn't
on the approved viewing list

108
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:55,922
after all.

109
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:58,482
What did you do?

110
00:04:58,582 --> 00:05:01,482
Well, I just made sure

111
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:04,382
you won't be subjected
to that filth anymore.

112
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:09,742
You didn't tell him, did you?

113
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:12,762
No.

114
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,882
I didn't tell him about...

115
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,722
..the pornography.

116
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:19,082
I think we both know he
wouldn't be as understanding.

117
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:21,122
Mum, I told you.
It's not like that.

118
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,682
I was just curious about
like... size and stuff.

119
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:29,122
Size? Size?

120
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:31,802
I just wanted to see if I...
you know, like, measured up.

121
00:05:31,902 --> 00:05:33,682
It's true, Mum.

122
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:36,602
OK. I'm not a
hateful person, Zeke.

123
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:38,002
You know that. Mum.

124
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:40,762
OK. I just want
what's best for you.

125
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:45,162
But these lies and this filth...

126
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,382
That's not my boy.

127
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,162
So, I'll keep your secret,

128
00:05:51,262 --> 00:05:52,922
but you need to promise me

129
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:55,642
you're not going
down a dark path.

130
00:05:55,742 --> 00:06:01,362
Because that life, that...
that is such a sad one.

131
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,982
I just want to know that
you're still my boy.

132
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:08,302
Do we have a deal?

133
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:10,182
Yeah.

134
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:11,442
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

135
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,722
Yes, Mum.

136
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:15,122
Good.

137
00:06:15,222 --> 00:06:17,602
'Cause everything I
do is for you boys.

138
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:19,522
I know.

139
00:06:19,622 --> 00:06:21,782
Mm. OK.

140
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,222
So, what's news
in old Gero town?

141
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:25,322
Well, I can't go anywhere

142
00:07:25,422 --> 00:07:29,002
because some dick monkey's
busted my scooter.

143
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:31,482
I can probably fix that for you.

144
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:33,202
Yeah?

145
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:35,542
Fuck, that's so masc.

146
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:40,762
I wish you were here.

147
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:42,362
Me too.

148
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,642
I wanna snuggle and
get to know you.

149
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:46,442
Just snuggle?

150
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:50,722
OK, maybe more.

151
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:53,522
I was half expecting
a cheeky pic from you.

152
00:07:53,622 --> 00:07:54,802
You went all silent!

153
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:56,282
I wasn't going to break it

154
00:07:56,382 --> 00:07:58,642
with a, "We haven't
spoken in a few days.

155
00:07:58,742 --> 00:08:00,522
"Here's my juicy penis!"

156
00:08:00,622 --> 00:08:03,562
LOL. Don't send
your juicy penis.

157
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:05,942
That's for in person only.

158
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:16,542
You know not to take it
personally when I go quiet?

159
00:08:19,222 --> 00:08:21,422
I'm so into you, Charlie.

160
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,482
Why?

161
00:08:25,582 --> 00:08:28,842
I've never met anyone like you.

162
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,962
Even after all the shit
you've gone through,

163
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:35,822
you have this energy about you.

164
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:39,282
It's infectious.

165
00:08:39,382 --> 00:08:41,922
The feeling is more than mutual.

166
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,122
Is it my Akubra?

167
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:46,882
So if you had to have
dinner with someone famous,

168
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:48,802
who would it be?

169
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:50,402
Um...

170
00:08:50,502 --> 00:08:52,802
Alive or dead...?

171
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:55,922
Oh, that is a fucking
dark question.

172
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:57,842
Yeah, it's a dark
question, I know.

173
00:08:57,942 --> 00:09:00,202
And if you were
going to be famous,

174
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:02,302
why would you be famous?

175
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:28,803

187
00:09:58,743 --> 00:10:00,879
Yeah, but it's just gonna keep
happening if we don't. So...

188
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:02,803
Bec. Rocky.

189
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,643
What are you doing here?

190
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:06,243
Did someone say
your name five times

191
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:07,483
while looking in the mirror?

192
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,203
Don't. I'm still pissed at you.

193
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:11,643
You promised you
wouldn't go rogue.

194
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:13,283
I know.

195
00:10:13,383 --> 00:10:16,363
It was selfish and I don't think
about anyone else but myself.

196
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:17,463
Yeah.

197
00:10:17,503 --> 00:10:18,763
That's why I totally understand

198
00:10:18,863 --> 00:10:20,359
if you have to kick
me out of the band.

199
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:22,283
Wait. You do?

200
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:25,083
Totally. I'm a
liability. A loose unit.

201
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:27,563
And Cemetery Drive is
never going to book gigs

202
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:28,843
with that kind of reputation.

203
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:31,403
Yeah, yeah, I guess not.

204
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,403
Well, we had a good run.

205
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:37,203
Let's end it now before
we get... disenchanted.

206
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,483
But this band means
everything to you.

207
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:44,723
You always said it's like your
only way out of this shithole.

208
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:47,783
Maybe I need to look at
things from a different angle.

209
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:52,803
Ha.

210
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,423
Reckon he got into
his mum's stash?

211
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:09,003
What time you boys heading
to the drive-in tonight?

212
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:10,243
Nah, not going.

213
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:11,643
It's our anniversary.

214
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,523
Rochelle's got something
special planned.

215
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:14,963
Fuck yes, boy!

216
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:16,363
Get some!

217
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:18,923
You are about to feel
the ground shake!

218
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:20,363
Knock it off, bruh.

219
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:21,843
How did you talk her into it?

220
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:23,639
Hasn't she got the purity
ring and everything?

221
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:25,159
She tried to resist for
as long as possible,

222
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:26,683
but... she's only human.

223
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:29,883
Bro! Get outta here.

224
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:39,483
Can I come out now?

225
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,903
Just a second, babes.

226
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:49,263
OK.

227
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:01,783
You can come out.

228
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:07,343
Come out!

229
00:12:08,383 --> 00:12:11,083
Surprise!

230
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:13,603
Babes!

231
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:17,623
Don't you just love it?

232
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:20,723
Uh-uh!

233
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,203
Wait!

234
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:24,303
Photos first.

235
00:12:28,863 --> 00:12:31,583
I want to remember
this night forever.

236
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:36,483
Now can I kiss my woman or what?

237
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,583
Mm-hm.

238
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:41,963
Oh. Sorry. Sorry.

239
00:12:42,063 --> 00:12:43,123
Ow.

240
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:44,963
All good? Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

241
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:47,063
Just watch out.

242
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,663
Um...

243
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:27,123
Ah!

244
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,043
Yes!

245
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,963
Mmm.

246
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:32,203
Mm.

247
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:34,443
Uh-huh.

248
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:36,543
OK, I think I'm ready.

249
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:39,863
Yeah.

250
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:18,484
Shit.

251
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:20,284
What's wrong?

252
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:22,384
Just give me a minute.

253
00:14:23,224 --> 00:14:24,364
Oh, is it...

254
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,964
No, it's all good.

255
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:28,064
OK.

256
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:33,804
Let me help. No,
it's all good.

257
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:35,904
Let me help.

258
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:39,324
Is that right? Yeah.

259
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:40,724
Ow! Fuck!

260
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:42,044
Oh! Sorry! Sorry.

261
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:44,144
It's all good.

262
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:58,864
It's OK.

263
00:15:00,304 --> 00:15:02,324
Ooh!

264
00:15:02,424 --> 00:15:04,444
I think it's my guts.

265
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:06,364
Just give me a moment,
eh? Yeah. Yeah.

266
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:08,464
Yeah.

267
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:21,864
Put your throbbing
cock in my mouth.

268
00:15:27,864 --> 00:15:29,864
Oh, yeah.

269
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:52,064
That's it, bruh, that's it.

270
00:15:54,944 --> 00:15:58,544
Ooh...

271
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:07,544
Oh, f...

272
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:22,904
Oh, fuck it!

273
00:16:24,624 --> 00:16:26,624
I've got an idea.

274
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:43,124
Oi! Look who it is!

275
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:46,784
Ooh! Ooh! Ah! Oh, yeah! Honey!

276
00:16:47,944 --> 00:16:50,284
Shut the fuck up.

277
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,884
How are you? You cheeky dog.

278
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:56,924
Damn, bro, must have
been some good pussy.

279
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:58,124
It was alright.

280
00:16:58,224 --> 00:16:59,844
Alright?

281
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:02,040
Bro, you got limited edition
Ground Shakers holy grail,

282
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,064
mate.

283
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:16,124
Hamz!

284
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:17,804
What's up? What's
going on, bro?

285
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,604
Enzo! How are you, man?

286
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:22,364
Hey, I hear Buddy Franklin
better watch his back.

287
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:23,604
I dunno about that, bro.

288
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:25,244
The way your Mum talks,

289
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,200
you'd think you'd already
got a few Norm Smith medals

290
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:28,284
hanging on your mirror.

291
00:17:28,384 --> 00:17:29,764
Hi, I'm Nat.

292
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:32,884
Sorry, my soon-to-be
better half.

293
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:33,884
Ooh, look out.

294
00:17:33,984 --> 00:17:35,364
And Zeke you know, right?

295
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:36,764
We go way back.

296
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:39,484
The stories I could
tell about this fella.

297
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:40,764
They used to sneak us piss

298
00:17:40,864 --> 00:17:42,204
when we were
underage at the Gero.

299
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:43,844
Jeez, we ran amok!

300
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:45,044
Good to see ya, champ.

301
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:46,444
Good to see you, my bro.

302
00:17:46,544 --> 00:17:47,764
Keep your nose clean.

303
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:49,444
You too.

304
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:50,804
Nice to meet you.

305
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,904
Zeke, grab us snacks, would ya?

306
00:17:56,624 --> 00:18:00,124
Here you go, my
love. One hot dog.

307
00:18:00,224 --> 00:18:02,284
Be careful. He's a big one.

308
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:06,644
What will it be, tiger?

309
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:09,764
Two popcorns, three
choc-tops and a large Coke.

310
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:12,124
Guessing by your order,
you're here on your own.

311
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,664
I'm not going to
eat three choc-tops.

312
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:15,044
That was a joke.

313
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:17,464
You should look them
up on Wikipedia.

314
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,884
I'm Sabrina.

315
00:18:19,984 --> 00:18:21,684
My mum knows your mum, I think.

316
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,204
Yeah, you do drama, right?

317
00:18:23,304 --> 00:18:25,084
This year we're
doing Sweet Charity.

318
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:27,284
It's my favourite school
musical about hookers.

319
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:31,984
Young fella,
that'll be 18 bucks.

320
00:18:42,145 --> 00:18:44,185
Mini treasure hunt.

321
00:18:46,905 --> 00:18:48,905
Thanks.

322
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:53,745
I'll add you on Insta.

323
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:07,645
She's pretty.

324
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:09,445
Totally into you.

325
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:11,565
What? No.

326
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:13,665
Yeah.

327
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:24,005
You know, I've never
been here before?

328
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:28,325
My dad always said he'd take me,
but... never got around to it.

329
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:31,685
Do people actually watch a movie
or is it just one big fuck-fest?

330
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:34,165
I'm sure some do.

331
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:36,885
But someone's definitely
getting a JFK.

332
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:38,325
A JFK?

333
00:19:38,425 --> 00:19:41,485
Yeah. You know, messy
head in the back seat.

334
00:19:41,585 --> 00:19:43,745
You're cracked.

335
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:55,545
What's this? A secret entrance?

336
00:19:56,745 --> 00:20:00,045
This looks like a good spot.

337
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:02,165
Our feature film
starts in five minutes,

338
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:04,665
so head over to
the candy bar now.

339
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:10,945
What?

340
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:13,965
I just thought we
were gonna go inside.

341
00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:15,365
You can see perfect from here

342
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,185
and you don't even have
to pay the 20 bucks.

343
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:26,445
♪ Raise your head

344
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:28,325
♪ Raise the dead

345
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:31,885
♪ Raise your head,
raise the dead

346
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:37,005
♪ Raise your head,
raise the dead... ♪

347
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:38,445
Oh, yeah?

348
00:20:38,545 --> 00:20:39,805
Enlighten me.

349
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,245
You're quiet tonight.

350
00:20:42,345 --> 00:20:44,345
I guess.

351
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,445
Is something wrong?

352
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:51,565
Why would something be wrong?

353
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:53,285
This is great.

354
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,525
We can see perfectly from here
and we got to save 20 bucks.

355
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:01,685
You wanna go inside?

356
00:21:01,785 --> 00:21:03,445
Kinda.

357
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:05,365
But people will see.

358
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,085
That's the whole fucking point.

359
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:08,965
I've never had a boyfriend,

360
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:12,085
but I guess I thought
that when I did get one,

361
00:21:12,185 --> 00:21:14,765
he might want to be
seen in public with me.

362
00:21:14,865 --> 00:21:16,881
And I guess I thought that my
first date would involve me

363
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:19,085
being taken out
somewhere and shown off,

364
00:21:19,185 --> 00:21:20,925
like everyone else
gets to fucking do.

365
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:24,065
Not be hidden in the shadows by
somebody who is ashamed of me!

366
00:21:31,985 --> 00:21:33,445
I'm sorry.

367
00:21:33,545 --> 00:21:35,545
I didn't realise.

368
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:39,845
Yeah, well...

369
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:41,945
...now you know.

370
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:50,285
Don't take this the wrong way,

371
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:52,385
but I'm not sure I can do that.

372
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:56,165
I like you, Charlie.

373
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:59,845
I think you're like a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

374
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:03,165
But I'm not the holding
hands in public kind of guy.

375
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:04,725
Not because I'm ashamed of you,

376
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:08,365
but because I'm not
ready to live like that.

377
00:22:08,465 --> 00:22:12,365
You get up onstage and you wear
eyeliner and shout at people

378
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:15,605
and give zero fucks
what the world thinks.

379
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:18,525
I'm not that guy.

380
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,865
Don't you think you could be?

381
00:22:26,105 --> 00:22:28,105
Maybe.

382
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:30,965
But not yet.

383
00:22:31,065 --> 00:22:33,105
I've got to get used to this.

384
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:36,265
I hope that's OK.

385
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:47,725
Nah.

386
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,865
Everyone has somebody
who understands them.

387
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:56,445
You're not the only one
who wants out of this town,

388
00:22:56,545 --> 00:22:57,845
you know.

389
00:22:57,945 --> 00:22:59,765
Who
said I want out?

390
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:01,865
I'm sorry.

391
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:08,645
You look fire tonight.

392
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:11,665
If I'm so hot, then why
couldn't you fuck me?

393
00:23:15,425 --> 00:23:17,425
Did you tell the girls?

394
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:24,286
Babe, look at me.

395
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:26,386
Please.

396
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:37,146
How the fuck did I get so lucky?

397
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:45,446
Come here, baby girl.

398
00:23:45,546 --> 00:23:47,326
It's still our anniversary.

399
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,606
Let's make it special.

400
00:23:48,706 --> 00:23:50,206
In here? Yeah.

401
00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:51,726
What if someone sees?

402
00:23:51,826 --> 00:23:53,366
These tints are
practically illegal.

403
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,466
No one's seeing shit.

404
00:23:56,306 --> 00:23:58,306
OK.

405
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:01,046
Ow! Shit! Sorry. Oh!

406
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:02,326
Yeah. Yeah.

407
00:24:02,426 --> 00:24:04,666
Are you good? Yep.

408
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,986
OK.

409
00:24:09,746 --> 00:24:11,746
Yeah.

410
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,206
No panties.

411
00:24:14,306 --> 00:24:16,046
That's so fucking hot!

412
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:26,526
No, no, no. I got this. OK.

413
00:24:26,626 --> 00:24:28,946
Yeah? Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

414
00:24:33,186 --> 00:24:35,526
Just give me a sec.
Yeah. OK.

415
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:37,626
Yep.

416
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:52,646
Let's do this.

417
00:24:52,746 --> 00:24:54,746
OK.

418
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:26,206
Come on. Ow! Ow! Ow!

419
00:25:26,306 --> 00:25:27,646
Ow! What the fuck?!

420
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:29,446
Ow! Ow!

421
00:25:29,546 --> 00:25:30,846
What the fuck?!

422
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:40,666
Hammer,
where are you going?

423
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:09,526
Hammer?

424
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:11,626
Are you OK?

425
00:26:12,386 --> 00:26:14,386
Hammer, are you OK?

426
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:21,562
Have you
had a panic attack before

427
00:26:21,586 --> 00:26:23,766
or ever struggled with anxiety?

428
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:25,406
It wasn't a panic attack.

429
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:27,206
OK. Just deep breaths for me.

430
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:29,306
Nice and slow.

431
00:26:30,186 --> 00:26:31,926
Have you taken anything tonight?

432
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:33,966
Any drugs or alcohol?

433
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,406
No.

434
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:37,086
It's OK. I'm not the police.

435
00:26:37,186 --> 00:26:39,186
I didn't!

436
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:50,446
Is there anything you'd like
to talk to me about, Kade?

437
00:26:50,546 --> 00:26:53,986
Whatever you tell me is
completely confidential.

438
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,866
No.

439
00:27:00,906 --> 00:27:02,906
Can I go now?

440
00:27:09,506 --> 00:27:11,526
Oh! Nyorn, my baby!

441
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:13,366
Oh, honey!

442
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,606
Oh, what happened?

443
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:17,846
I'm OK, Mum.

444
00:27:17,946 --> 00:27:19,806
The hero returns.

445
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:21,046
How are you feeling?

446
00:27:21,146 --> 00:27:22,606
It was nothin'.

447
00:27:22,706 --> 00:27:24,806
Let's get you home, hey?

448
00:27:24,906 --> 00:27:27,246
Thank you so much for
looking out for him.

449
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,946
It was actually Zeke
here who saved the day.

450
00:27:31,906 --> 00:27:33,566
Thank you.

451
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:36,006
Thanks, Zeke.

452
00:27:36,106 --> 00:27:38,526
Come on, Bub.

453
00:27:38,626 --> 00:27:40,006
Thanks.

454
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:42,106
Be safe. Mmm.

455
00:27:47,146 --> 00:27:48,846
Just stay here.
I'll get the car.

456
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:50,946
You did good tonight.

457
00:27:53,386 --> 00:27:55,386
You're a good man.
