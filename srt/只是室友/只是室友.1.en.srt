{\an8}Hello, sir.

00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,447
Are you all disrespecting me
because my term ends in less than a year?

60
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,740
Is that it?

61
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,074
Of course not, sir.

62
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,205
Then how dare you come late
the day your suspension is lifted?

63
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,506
I was just about to call you.

64
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,133
I've reserved a court…

65
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,594
- Why does he kick me in the same spot?
- Meet me there later.

66
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,222
He always goes for the same spot.

67
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,441
Jeez, this is expensive.

68
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,277
Excuse me.
I only want that one flat tire replaced.

69
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,072
Man, you've driven this thing for so long.

70
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,364
Hasn't it been over a decade?

71
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,908
Give me that.

72
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,120
Who replaces a flat with a used tire?

73
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,371
A broke one.

74
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,791
It's hard enough
paying for my kid's overseas tuition.

75
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,877
Your life must be pretty dull

76
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,712
with your daughter and wife
in the Philippines.

77
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,881
Get four new tires with this.

78
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,176
What's going on? Why are you being nice?

79
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,512
Help out Dae-yong in the RIU
for the time being.

80
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,472
He's got all sorts of crazy cases.

81
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,265
Golden Bunny?

82
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,518
The commissioner
is watching that case closely.

83
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:36,021
Who knows what kind of crumbs
might fall your way if you help out?

84
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:38,148
That was originally my case.

85
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,567
You blew it when you took
a lawyer referral fee from a victim

86
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,277
and received a suspension, remember?

87
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,113
Leave the Golden Bunny case to Dae-yong.

88
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,405
He'll wrap it today.

89
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,784
He can never catch Golden Bunny.
That punk's too sneaky for him.

90
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:49,743
I told you before.

91
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:52,830
If you want Golden Bunny,
you have to catch Silver Bunny first.

92
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,374
It sounds like you want him to fail.

93
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,000
Whatever.

94
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,840
One more thing.
I want you to take on a kid.

95
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,051
A kid? Who?

96
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,847
This is garbage.

97
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,182
- What?
- It's garbage.

98
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,101
This is an elaborate piece of garbage.

99
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,311
Do you take my place for a dumping ground?

100
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,782
- Is this real?
- Yes.

101
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,492
What's your name again?

102
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,206
Yoon Dong-ju.

103
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,251
Gold medalist in middleweight boxing,
2018 São Paulo International Sports Games.

104
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,548
Hand me that, sir.

105
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,219
YOON'S METEORITE GOLD MEDAL

106
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,263
I see.

107
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,515
You're that…

108
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,601
- That little turd?
- Yeah.

109
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,687
The national athlete
selected as a special recruit.

110
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,315
Why are you pairing
that little turd with me?

111
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,941
<i>He's with the Seoul riot police.</i>

112
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,611
<i>He got into trouble and came back
after being demoted to officer.</i>

113
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,364
Two, four, six, eight, ten…

114
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,744
The medal has a meteorite embedded in it.
He could've given me the full 500,000 won.

115
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,995
INSUNG PAWNSHOP

116
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,249
Two broken jaws and three broken noses.

117
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,919
He got demoted for that?
Things happen when catching bad guys.

118
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,837
They weren't the bad guys.

119
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,633
You think you're better than us,
you bastard?

120
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,635
<i>They were his colleagues.</i>

121
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,679
<i>I guess those guys took some bribes
in the nightlife district.</i>

122
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,681
<i>They quarreled when Dong-ju found out,</i>

123
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,725
<i>and the argument
turned into a nasty brawl.</i>

124
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,310
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

125
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:42,147
<i>That incident made him a marked man,
and he has nowhere else to go.</i>

126
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,858
So why is that my concern?
Why do I have to take him on?

127
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:47,861
<i>His bank account got seized because of
his former teammates' medical bills</i>

128
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,821
<i>and other compensation.</i>

129
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,533
I'll reserve this one, sir.

130
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,702
I'll give you 450,000 won now

131
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,204
- and wire you the rest later.
- Okay.

132
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,622
When will it get delivered?

133
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,916
But why does it have to be me?

134
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,709
Don't you feel bad for him?

135
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,337
You should help him out
as a special recruit yourself.

136
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:09,549
You taught him boxing
and helped him become a police officer,

137
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,301
<i>so take responsibility for him
until the end.</i>

138
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,054
<i>And the kid…</i>

139
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,056
<i>Well, he's a good kid.</i>

140
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,225
SIGNS

141
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,480
Good kid, my ass.
I have no use for that little turd.

142
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,107
What if that turd helps your career bloom?

143
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,650
A turd is still a turd.

144
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,069
Look, my nose bridge
used to be pretty high.

145
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,072
But his punches warped it
and gave me rhinitis,

146
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,908
and now I have problems breathing.

147
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,244
You've been on the force for 14 years.

148
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,954
How long are you going to be a doormat?

149
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,206
Suck it up so you can win
the commissioner's favor.

150
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,419
You need to score points with him
to fly coach to the Philippines at least.

151
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,296
If you'd rather not,
find a big case like Dae-yong

152
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,381
and fly business class.

153
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,800
If you're patient,

154
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,512
the commissioner
will assign you your own team.

155
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,557
Got it?

156
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,360
Cut!

157
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,737
- Cut!
- Let's go again.

158
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,655
Cut!

159
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,533
What's so hard about this?

160
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:18,952
Ms. Han-na.

161
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,040
Ms. Han-na.

162
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,960
How many times do I have to tell you
that your posture and gaze are crucial?

163
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:30,589
A strong cop with a steely gaze
who never lets a criminal escape.

164
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,091
That's what we need to see.

165
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,343
Jeez.

166
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,928
- Hey, director.
- Yes, sir.

167
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,722
This is serious.

168
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,849
If this keeps up, it'll be a disaster.

169
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,601
This is the last time, right?

170
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:44,853
Once the shoot wraps up,

171
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,564
just grit your teeth
and take a few photos with him.

172
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,482
That will be all.

173
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,649
You brought your medals, right?

174
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,859
We'll do another take.

175
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:51,943
Standby.

176
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,278
Do better this time.

177
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:59,242
Ms. Han-na, do that pose of yours.

178
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,620
{\an8}- Get ready to roll.
- All right. Standby.

179
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,164
Looks like it'll start soon.

180
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,249
- Yes, sir.
- Remind me the operation's name.

181
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,751
It's "Bunny Hunt," sir.

182
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,463
Catch Golden Bunny

183
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,173
and make us look good.

184
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:17,260
Take this opportunity to shut up
the reporters and city council members.

185
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,303
The title will be

186
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:23,225
"Insung's Major Crime Syndicate
'Golden Bunny Gang' Taken Down."

187
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,103
This is the largest operation
in Insung Metropolitan Police's history,

188
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,688
involving the highest number of personnel.

189
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,858
We request that each department cooperate
without fail under the command of RIU.

190
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:32,901
Insung!

191
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,277
- RIU!
- RIU!

192
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,987
- Let's catch that bunny!
- All right!

193
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,698
- Let's go, RIU!
- Let's go, RIU!

194
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,785
INVESTIGATION SUPPORT TEAM

195
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,209
She definitely stands out.

196
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,794
She should've become a celebrity instead.

197
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,421
Why did the Shooting Fairy join the force?

198
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,381
Apparently, it was her dream.

199
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,841
But she gained some weight, right?

200
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,803
Senior Officer Ji,
you need to brief me on the meeting first.

201
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,098
I thought we should get ready
to head out to the field.

202
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,393
There's something more important

203
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,936
for you to take care of.

204
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,314
DRUNK DRIVER'S STATEMENT REPORT

205
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,862
I was told we were requested in the field.
Why do we need to handle this?

206
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,530
The task isn't for our whole team.

207
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,031
It's for you, Ms. Ji Han-na.

208
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,202
OPERATION "BUNNY HUNT"

209
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:27,622
You're working harder
than the investigation team.

210
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,625
Do you want to be
out in the field that badly?

211
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,753
That's why I joined the force.

212
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,632
Don't tell me you still believe
you'll be moved to a field position

213
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,134
in the next personnel reassignment.

214
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,137
The commissioner
already denied your reassignment request.

215
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,598
You're so naive.

216
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,976
Why do you think they selected you
as the national team special recruit?

217
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,144
Isn't it obvious?

218
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,439
Did you think you'd be carrying a gun
and taking down criminals?

219
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,523
What is this, a movie?

220
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,692
This is a personnel order,

221
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,277
and there's a friendly face for you.

222
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,155
They're coming to our agency,
so I thought you might be happy about it.

223
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:04,534
Hannam-dong.

224
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,286
I'll give you details on the way.

225
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,662
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

226
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,251
FOR APPROVAL

227
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,139
TO BE DEMOLISHED

228
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,307
Hey.

229
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,605
Look at your face.

230
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,607
What kind of champion gets beat up?

231
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,025
Do you have pillow fists or what?

232
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,444
If you're that concerned,
why don't you take a punch?

233
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,658
How have you been?
I see you're as jumpy as ever.

234
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,202
And you're as rude as ever.

235
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,037
Jeez, you idiot.

236
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,372
- What?
- Take those off.

237
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,668
What kind of cop goes around
announcing they're undercover?

238
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,263
Jeez, what a fuss.

239
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,431
They sent a drone to catch a bunny.

240
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,565
I hear that bunny
is the biggest gang boss around.

241
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:17,566
He's a big fish then.

242
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,734
Big fish, my ass.
He's just a low-life thug.

243
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,572
What are you doing?

244
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,532
I need to warm up to catch that bunny.

245
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,325
We're far from the operation area.

246
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,702
We just need to manage the civilians.

247
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,079
Didn't you hear me?

248
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,414
I'm anxious as is.

249
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,623
Keep still, will you?

250
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,335
Oh, no. Hold on.

251
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,713
- I have to pee.
- What?

252
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:40,839
<i>Bagboy on the move.</i>

253
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,674
Hey, I'll be right back.

254
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:43,717
Give me a minute.

255
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,559
SAMGWANG SUPERMARKET

256
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,897
Laundry service.

257
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,859
{\an8}BAGBOY, 35 Y/O
GOLDEN BUNNY GANG'S ERRAND BOY

258
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:04,154
- Suits, blouses, shearling coats.
- Hey, he came out.

259
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,530
Dry cleaning.

260
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,991
Laundry service.

261
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,285
Find me at 25 Eungcheon 1-ga.

262
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,995
Yes, sir.

263
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,623
Laundry service.

264
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,436
<i>What was that?</i>

265
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,021
<i>What is it? What just happened?</i>

266
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,523
- You, the laundry guy!
- Hey!

267
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,692
- Get him!
- Catch him!

268
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,569
Bagboy, stop right there!

269
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,322
Hey! It's over for you!

270
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,823
Damn it. Hey!

271
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,370
Boss! Get out of there!

272
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,289
- What the…
- Captain!

273
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,918
Where are they? Behind you!

274
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,628
Damn it. Hey!

275
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,506
Lee Sang-gon!

276
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,801
Hey, catch the bunny.
Don't let him get away!

277
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,803
<i>We have an emergency situation.</i>

278
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,596
We have to catch that darn Golden Bunny.

279
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,764
<i>Split up and search.</i>

280
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,684
<i>Red top and blue pants.
Everyone, split up and look for him.</i>

281
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,491
Where?

282
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:35,203
Let's split up.
You go in there, and we'll go up here.

283
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,747
<i>It seems like he went down Eungcheon 2-ga.</i>

284
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,582
Eungcheon 2-ga? That's right here.

285
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,251
Hey, Dung-ju!

286
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,086
Stay right there and don't do anything!

287
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,295
What?

288
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,343
Bunny.

289
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,013
You bastard!

290
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,224
You little bastard!

291
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,101
Turd Dung-ju! Stay right there!

292
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,144
What was that, sir?

293
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,201
Get over here, you bastard.
It's you, right?

294
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,203
What's going on?

295
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,664
Dung-ju, do you have him?

296
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:59,120
<i>But why is he "Golden Bunny"
instead of just "Bunny"?</i>

297
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,456
<i>You'll know once you see his ugly mug.</i>

298
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,044
{\an8}LEE SANG-GON, 40 Y/O, AKA GOLDEN BUNNY
THE GANG'S BOSS WITH GOLD TEETH

299
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,181
Oh, gosh.

300
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,475
Where is he?

301
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,269
What's wrong with you? Get up.

302
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:25,855
Get up, you punk!

303
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,276
Hey, what happened?

304
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,196
Why didn't you radio us?

305
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,280
What?

306
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,908
- What the heck?
- What did you do?

307
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,785
What are you talking about?

308
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,329
- What's going on?
- What happened?

309
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,580
What do you mean?

310
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:43,790
What happened?

311
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,922
Let's cross the road.

312
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,926
SCHOOL ZONE

313
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,978
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

314
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,357
<i>Jae-hong, that low-life showed up
in front of the school again.</i>

315
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,402
Yes, their plate's definitely a fake.
It won't show up in our system.

316
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,946
We need to catch that punk
before something serious happens.

317
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,990
Not without backup, we won't.

318
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,700
I suppose not.
Jae-hong, how about some coffee?

319
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,159
No, thank you, sir.

320
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,328
Okay, then. You're such a hard worker.

321
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,330
Look at you, studying in between shifts.

322
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,874
You'll make it this time. You got this.

323
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,041
Thank you, sir.

324
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,085
- Coffee?
- Let's go, sir.

325
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,300
Isn't promotion a long shot for Jae-hong?

326
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,801
He was sent here as a penalty

327
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,678
for going after the Viper Gang
a few months back.

328
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,722
I heard he failed
the promotion review back then.

329
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,891
I'm sure he'll pass one of these days.

330
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,852
People who used to be athletes
are really determined.

331
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,896
Does his sport even qualify
for special recruitment?

332
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,273
- I don't see why they hired him.
- Me neither.

333
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,366
What a day.

334
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,043
Dung-ju?

335
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,633
Get your heads straight!

336
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,718
Get it together, you little punks!

337
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,680
Earn your keep!

338
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,266
- I'm sorry, sir!
- I'm sorry, sir.

339
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,603
You almost had him but lost him instead!

340
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,063
You idiots.

341
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,398
Get out! I can't stand the sight of you.

342
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,986
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE

343
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:42,033
Hey, my guys didn't even
get to shower for months

344
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,577
and trailed after this punk to get him.

345
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,204
How could you lose him

346
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,373
when he was served to you
on a silver platter?

347
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,379
I'm sorry about what happened,

348
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,881
but let's not be so harsh
to fellow officers.

349
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:57,924
It's not like we meant to...

350
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,468
Fellow officers? Don't be ridiculous.

351
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,303
You came through the backdoor.

352
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,097
Don't act like you're one of us.

353
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:12,814
Are you okay?

354
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,194
- Get in here!
- Yes, sir!

355
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:25,827
Dong-ju!

356
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,037
Jae-hong!

357
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,081
What the heck?

358
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,249
You sure made a grand entrance.

359
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,751
- I didn't know you were here.
- I got here a little while ago.

360
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,171
Are you in the traffic unit?

361
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,172
It just happened that way.

362
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,383
- I'm on duty now, so I'll see you later.
- Okay.

363
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,968
- See you.
- I'll call you later.

364
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,177
Okay.

365
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,721
- Hey, Dong-ju.
- Yes?

366
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:45,805
Hold on.

367
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,229
These belong to my kids,
but you should replace yours.

368
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,275
- Thanks, Jae-hong.
- Don't get hurt, okay?

369
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,568
Okay.

370
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:45,740
COUNT ON US TO KEEP INSUNG SAFE

371
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:49,660
You look pretty relaxed.

372
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:50,995
How can you be smiling?

373
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,101
Hey, Steamed Bun!

374
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:15,937
Steamed Bun!

375
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,074
Hey, Steamed Bun.

376
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,495
Steamed Bun.

377
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,956
Steamed Bun.

378
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,689
Didn't you hear me calling you?

379
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,652
No.

380
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,534
How have you been?

381
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:12,785
It's been ages, hasn't it?

382
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:14,412
Three years since the academy, right?

383
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:17,707
You had long hair back then.
Now it's short.

384
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,791
It's a different vibe.

385
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:23,796
Come on, Steamed Bun.

386
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:28,384
Steamed Bun!

387
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,513
I finally got you to look.

388
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,015
I told you not to call me that.

389
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:35,892
What do you mean?

390
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,186
Steamed Bun?

391
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,897
Stop calling me that!

392
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,524
We've known each other
since our days at Taereung.

393
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,443
Isn't it nice to have a friendly nickname?

394
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:48,321
I got assigned to the police agency.
We're work buddies from now.

395
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,363
I don't care.

396
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,575
And don't speak to me informally
like we're close.

397
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,118
But you speak informally to me

398
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,745
even though you're younger.

399
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,413
I outrank you.

400
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,499
- You got demoted.
- How did you know?

401
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,460
I thought you didn't care.

402
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,508
Do you still like me?

403
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:10,760
Yeah.

404
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:12,511
Am I not allowed to?

405
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,472
No, you're not.

406
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,891
Don't start any weird rumors.

407
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,519
Hey, Steamed Bun.

408
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:21,604
Wait up.

409
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:49,632
I came to tell you something.

410
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,301
Can we talk on the way?

411
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:56,889
Maybe later.

412
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:34,135

416
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,327
Goodness, look who it is.

417
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:04,040
- Oh, my, it's been so long!
- It really has been.

418
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,208
- This looks delicious.
- Eat up before it gets cold.

419
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:09,795
Goodness.

420
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:18,429
The sign looks so pretty.
I hope it didn't cost you a whole lot.

421
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,306
No, it didn't cost much.

422
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,603
You should've stayed in Seoul.
Why did you come back here?

423
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:27,897
Because I missed your food.

424
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,149
The food in Seoul isn't that great.

425
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,817
Goodness, you're talking nonsense.

426
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,281
Are you sure everything is okay?

427
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,158
Yes, everything's fine.

428
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,079
By the way, where's Gyeong-il?

429
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,372
He's at work.

430
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:47,458
Coach Oh referred him
to some security company.

431
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,959
It's been a couple of weeks.

432
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,420
Do you mean Oh Jong-gu?

433
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,546
Yeah.

434
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,591
He must be very busy though
because he's never home.

435
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,094
Eat up.

436
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,932
Gosh, you're eating so well.

437
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,517
- Have some more.
- Sure.

438

00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,933
Did you find a place to live?

440
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:12,144
If you haven't, come stay here
and save some money.

441
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,230
I already found a place. Don't worry.

442
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:18,234
Really? That was quick.

443
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,944
That's enough for today.

444
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:21,862
I have to get going now.

445
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,697
You're leaving?

446
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:25,699
Yes. I have to go home and unpack.

447
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:29,495
Okay. I've had enough today.

448
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,624
Thank you for dinner.

449
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:34,750
Don't mention it.

450
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,757
- I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

451
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:49,390
Hey, why don't you people
put this back upright?

452
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,100
How can you just walk by and do nothing?

453
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,726
Jeez, that's so mean.

454
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,479
Darn, it tore a bit.

455
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,982
How could they be so heartless?

456
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,403
My goodness, look at this.

457
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,321
Seriously.

BANG

470
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:24,461
Anyway, why did he come here?

471
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,930
Is there still something between them?

472
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,247
<i>Do you still like me?</i>

473
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,165
Yeah.

474
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,083
Am I not allowed to?

475
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,423
He's so obvious about it.

476
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:16,930
<i>I'm not late, am I?</i>

OFFICE OF AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS

00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:20,267
Jeez.

479
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,520
You told me to be on time,
but where have you been?

480
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:25,898
Watch your every word today.

481
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,108
They'll first check for
any instruction violations.

482
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:31,069
Never mind. Just don't do anything.

483
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:33,155
Your yapping can get us
harsher disciplinary action.

484
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,282
Just keep your mouth shut
and don't say anything silly.

485
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:38,035
- I should just sew your mouth...
- Dress properly.

486
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,002
Jeez.

487
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:50,672
Shall we?

488
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,007
Right, we're here.

489
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,094
Hello?

490
00:34:58,806 --> 00:34:59,932
Excuse me?

491
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,811
- Excuse me?
- Oh, jeez!

492
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:07,147
- Why did you do that?
- What do you mean?

493
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,148
You did this.

494
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:09,900
It fell off because you kicked the door.

495
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,068
That can't happen, you punk.

496
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,694
It fell because you applied force.

497
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,363
You're tall enough to…

498
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,906
Hey, did you see him?

499
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,991
I've been his fan forever.
Should I get an autograph?

500
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,912
- Hello.
- Hello.

501
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,123
Hello, Sergeant Kim.

502
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:26,124
Hello, Sergeant Kim.

503
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:29,419
I'm a huge fan.
May I ask for an autograph?

504
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:30,796
An autograph?

505
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,714
- Does he think he's a celebrity?
- How about a photo?

506
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:37,636
Get over yourself. Did you think
they were talking about you?

507
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,513
What does he have that I don't?

508
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,139
Height? Good looks? Broad shoulders?

509
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:43,600
Plus, he got a silver medal
while I got a gold medal.

510
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:45,602
- Come on, sir.
- Good for you.

511
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,688
You won a gold medal
and ended up like this.

512
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,022
What's wrong with the way I am?

513
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:50,566
- Why, I ought to…
- Thank you.

514
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,611
Hello.

515
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:56,822
Lieutenant Go Man-sik, right?
I'm Kim Jong-hyeon.

516
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,533
Hi there. I know you pretty well.

517
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,952
Since when? You've never met him before.

518
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,457
Right, so what brings you here?

519
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,084
Did you get in trouble too?

520
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,502
No, sir. This is my office.

521
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,505
Where?

522
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:14,423
This one here?

523
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,174
Yes, the Office of Audits and Inspections.

524
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:18,135
I got assigned here today.

525
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,220
I'll be questioning you and Officer Yoon.

526
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,764
I see.

527
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:24,558
So it's you.

528
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,935
You're the officer in charge.

529
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:28,979
Yes, you must've been waiting a long time.

530
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,273
I'm sorry.
The commissioner had much to say.

531
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,109
Of course, you should apologize
for making us wait.

532
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,069
It's understandable when you're busy.

533
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:39,573
Just a moment, please.

534
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,925
I'll be in trouble if I get a pay cut.

535
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,927
I'm about to lose my mind.

536
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:03,138
No, I'm sure he'll go easy on me
as a fellow national athlete.

537
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,556
Why should he go easy on you?

538
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,224
This must be handled
fairly and impartially.

539
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:09,519
What kind of cop
relies on personal connections?

540
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,067
You sure eat well, don't you?

541
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,611
Did you take all the food?
Are there any side dishes left?

542
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,447
I have to eat a lot
to catch that Golden Bunny bastard.

543
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,158
Don't be ridiculous.

544
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,993
Hey, let me take a look.

545
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,246
I bet you've gone flabby.
I knew it. You've lost all your muscle.

546
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,665
Zip up your top all the way.

547
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,167
No workouts, no weight management.

548
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,921
No wonder a so-called champ gets beat up.

549
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,756
- You can't catch anybody.
- But that was…

550
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,259
Forget it.

551
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,807
If you're that upset,
why didn't you catch him yourself?

552
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,308
You just stood there and peed.

553
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:49,434
Everyone pees, including you.

554
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,658
Man, isn't he something?

555
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:08,036
He's rising through the ranks fine
unlike a certain special recruit here.

556
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,123
He got here on a special promotion, while
you ended up here after a demotion.

557
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,750
Are those two back together?

558
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,877
How am I supposed to know that?

559
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:16,795
I wasn't asking you.

560
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,423
Why did they break up in the first place?

561
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,633
They looked so good together.

562
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:24,678
Don't you agree?

563
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:25,804
As if.

564
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,976
It's a wonder you can still eat.

565
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,653
You got food on your chin.

566
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,662
What's going on with Captain Oh
of the Seobu Station?

567
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,125
Damn, food here tastes like crap.

568
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,295
How can you act as if nothing happened
after ruining others' careers?

569
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:02,132
Thanks to your report,
two of my team members got suspended.

570
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,094
There's another one over there
who got disciplined because of you.

571
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,433
He can't get promoted, thanks to you.

572
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,768
Are you satisfied?

573
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,187
Of course, you are.

574
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,065
You used your colleagues
to secure a special promotion to get here.

575
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:19,483
I just did my job, sir.

576
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,445
Your job? You got this job
because you handle a sword.

577
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,989
You should be out there
taking down gangsters

578
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,533
instead of stabbing
innocent colleagues in the back.

579
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:32,496
What is it? You can't confront me
without your mask and metal skewer?

580
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,039
You've never even been out in the field,

581
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,541
so who do you think you are
making your colleagues look bad?

582
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,627
If you know the field so well,
why did you accept bribes?

583
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,505
- You bastard.
- Isn't that what makes them look bad?

584
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,562
Hey, quit while you're still ahead.

585
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:58,980
I'm saying this for your sake.

586
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,777
If you keep this up,
you'll get bitten by a snake.

587
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:08,740
I didn't catch that.

588
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:26,424
Are you okay?

589
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:28,844
Yeah.

590
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,097
I'm used to people not liking
Inspection Division personnel.

591
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,182
I still wish you hadn't seen that.

592
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,818
I went to see you yesterday
to tell you about my appointment.

593
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,612
I already knew.

594
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:49,030
PERSONNEL FILE
NAME: KIM JONG-HYEON

595
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,541
Why didn't you say anything?

596
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:01,918
Aren't you curious why I'm here?

597
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:03,795
Why would I be?

598
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,422
There's nothing between us anymore.

599
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:08,216
You don't have to tell me
because it's none of my business.

600
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:10,594
Let's pretend we're strangers.

601
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,598
I don't want people
gossiping about me anymore.

602
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,902
Dae-yong, that bastard.

603
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,738
I can't believe he has us on a stakeout
where there's no shade.

604
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,574
Nobody's going to come by here.
Not even a mouse.

605
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,709
I'm hot.

606
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:43,835
I'm hot too.

607
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:46,213
Then let's turn it on.

608
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:49,257
- It'll use up the gas.
- It won't use up that much.

609
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,343
I have a higher body temperature
than most people.

610
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,386
Same here.

611
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,597
Then let me take off my jacket.

612
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,432
No, you have to keep it on.

613
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,601
- Nobody will pass by here.
- Put it back on.

614
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,771
- Nobody's going to come.
- We're on a stakeout.

615
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,273
- We're on a stakeout!
- But I'm hot!

616
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,651
Who's that?

617
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:16,576
The remaining gas is only enough for 5 km.

618
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,204
Where are you going?

619
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:21,581
Where are you…

620
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,208
Where are you going?

621
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,793
I'm cleaning up your mess, you punk.

622
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:26,586
When will you be back?

623
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,964
When will you be back? What about dinner?

624
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:30,507
What about dinner?

625
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,759
How many damn meals do you have to eat?

626
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:35,637
What about dinner?

627
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:38,431
My dinner!

628
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:42,310
<i>I can't come like the wind</i>

629
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:45,063
<i>And leave like the morning dew</i>

630
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:49,818
<i>I have to leave traces of my life behind</i>

631
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:55,699
<i>Even if I disappear</i>

632
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:58,952
<i>Like a trail of smoke</i>

633
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:02,747
<i>I have to rise up again
Like a burning flame</i>

634
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:05,375
Come on, make a circle!

635
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,920
<i>Man-sik.</i>

636
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:11,548
<i>You have to face the consequences
of the trouble you caused.</i>

637
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,675
<i>Don't you agree? Now, assume position.</i>

638
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,969
It's <i>par terre</i> time. Assume position!

639
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:16,970
<i>Par terre!</i>

640
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,514
<i>Go Man-sik is doing his best.</i>

641
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,225
Now he needs to perform a side roll.

642
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,896
Unfortunately, he's having trouble
flipping his opponent.

643
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,606
Oh, no. He's ordered <i>par terre</i>.

644
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,526
It looks like Go Man-sik
has reached his limit.

645
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:38,199
MAN-SIK, JEONG-A, JAE-GYEONG

646
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,635
Go Man-sik must hold out.

647
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:59,596
He can't allow himself to be lifted.

648
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,473
<i>He needs to stay on the mat.</i>

649
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:04,642
He has to hold on! He's crawling!

650
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:07,729
Go Man-sik is giving it everything he has!

651
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,190
Hold on, Mr. Go! You're almost there!

652
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:22,786
It's so hot.

653
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,516
Why isn't this working?

654
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:49,354
Come on. Why doesn't he fill up his tank?

655
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:57,112
It's 2 a.m. Why isn't he back yet?

656
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:07,205
<i>- Your call cannot be connected…</i>
- Why won't he answer?

657
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:09,165
Where did he go?

658
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:52,834
I thought I was done for.

659
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:56,629
Hey, mister. Where did you learn to drive?

660
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:58,965
Get out of the car.

661
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,301
Hey, mister.

662
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,599
Look, I'm a police officer.

663
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,851
Officer Yoon Dong-ju
of the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency.

664
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,020
There's a reason why I look like this,

665
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,730
but I really am a police officer.

666
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,773
So get out of the car now.

667
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,526
I'm serious!

668
00:46:21,738 --> 00:46:22,864
Hey, get out of the car.

669
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:26,451
Lower the window and stop the car!

670
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,536
Hold on a second.

671
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,954
Damn it!

672
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:32,040
What are you doing, you crazy bastard?

673
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,418
Stop the car!

674
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:36,753
Hold on!

675
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:40,298
Hey, stop the car.

676
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:41,883
You'd better stop the car.

677
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,471
Come on!

678
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,224
Hey, you crazy bastard!

679
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,683
Stop the damn car!

680
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,435
Damn it!

681
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,229
Hey!

682
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:58,900
Stop!

683
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,360
Hey!

684
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:02,445
Stop the car.

685
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,614
Please let me off!

686
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:08,952
Please let me off!

687
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:41,985
Is that it?

688
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,778
- Hey.
- Who keeps their tank almost empty?

689
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,113
- Hey!
- Damn it.

690
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,156
What are you doing to my car?

691
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:55,707
Bring it.

692
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:56,958
What the hell?

693
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,960
Hey, put some clothes on!

694
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,588
Hey, stop!

695
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:03,339
- Stop!
- Thanks for the car!

696
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,592
Hey!

697
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:19,480
My phone…

698
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,197
Damn it.

699
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:30,426
{\an8}4-PART TRANSFORMING ROBOT
POWER KING

700
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:04,544
One of my guys is here.
His name is Yoon Dong-ju.

701
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,671
Yes, sir. There was a hit-and-run.

702
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:07,964
A hit-and-run?

703
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,007
The victim is Lee Jin-su
of Korea Customs Service.

704
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,926
He was on his way home when it happened.

705
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:15,221
Officer Yoon got injured
while going after the hit-and-run suspect.

706
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:17,807
Hey.

707
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:20,560
Your face…

708
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:31,904
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

709
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:37,243
Stop acting weak, you punk.
You just have some bruises.

710
00:50:39,996 --> 00:50:42,582
Jeez, this man.
The commissioner wants to see us.

711
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:44,751
- Hey.
- Yes?

712
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:47,170
You'd better pay me back
for your medical bills, or else.

713
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,212
I will.

714
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,884
- Hey.
- Yes?

715
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,343
Come with me. I'll drop you off.

716
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:59,307
Forget it. You can't drive after drinking!

717
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,683
I didn't drink.

718
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:02,477
Just get in the car
while the offer stands.

719
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,687
- Where's my car?
- I'll just take a taxi.

720
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:06,481
Give me my car keys. Where are they?

721
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,191
Probably in your car.

722
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,610
- Where's my car?
- Probably in the parking lot.

723
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:11,652
Where in the parking lot?

724
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,571
Probably over there somewhere.

725
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,451
I don't see my car.

726
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:19,744
It's way over there!

727
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,288
Way over where?
Is there another parking lot up there?

728
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,332
- I'm sorry!
- Dung-ju, where's my car?

729
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,958
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

730
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:27,001
Dong-ju?

731
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:31,672
Dong-ju.

732
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:36,302
Yoon Dong-ju!

733
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,658
What on earth…

734
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,163
Seriously…

735
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,167
GYEONG-IL'S MOTHER

736
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,002
Hello, ma'am?

737
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:15,383
Gyeong-il hasn't come home yet?

738
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:21,347
I'll look into it,
so don't worry too much.

739
00:52:23,683 --> 00:52:26,519
What's going on?
He should've called in advance at least.

740
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:36,529
<i>Your call cannot be connected
and will go to voice...</i>

741
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,531
<i>Where's Gyeong-il?</i>

742
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,534
Coach Oh referred him
to some security company.

743
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,202
<i>It's been a couple of weeks.</i>

744
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:52,003
FROM CEO OH JONG-GU OF J9 SECURITY

745
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:56,215
{\an8}LOCATION: CONVENTION HALL
AT INSUNG GRAND HOTEL

746
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:59,510
<i>Let me introduce
the sponsor of Korean Athletes' Night.</i>

747
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:01,262
He was the former
national boxers' head coach

748
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,306
and Korean Sport Committee's secretary.

749
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,099
Please welcome
CEO Oh Jong-gu of J9 Security,

750
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,643
the nation's leading candidate
for the International Sport Committee!

751
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:09,562
Please give him a round of applause.

752
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:17,862
PROUD OF YOU
WHO HAVE BROUGHT GLORY TO KOREA

753
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,196
Thank you, sir.

754
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:23,159
Have a good time. Please enjoy your meal.

755
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:27,997
Hey, I didn't get to toast. Cheers.

756
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:54,023
Why is that punk here?

757
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,068
Unbelievable.

758
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:05,117
It's been a while.

759
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,453
I guess you also got an invitation.

760
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:10,289
My people messed up big time.

761
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:13,751
So how is it being a cop?

762
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,379
Let's skip the formalities.
It doesn't suit you.

763
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,132
Where's Gyeong-il?

764
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:21,759
Gyeong-il?

765
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:24,595
Why are you asking me?

766
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:27,390
You gave him work.

767
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,141
That little punk.

768
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,687
I gave him a job
because I felt sorry for him,

769
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,855
but he took a pay advance
and went off the grid.

770
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:36,607
He won't even answer my calls.

771
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,943
That damned junkie bastard.

772
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:41,821
He must've conked out somewhere
after getting high.

773
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:42,947
Watch your mouth.

774
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:46,200
You're the one who made him that way.

775
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:49,286
Is it a crime to give painkillers
to someone in pain?

776
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,831
Try answering this then.

777
00:54:52,707 --> 00:54:56,168
Whose fault is it that he ended up
taking those drugs in the first place?

778
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:57,962
It's yours, isn't it?

779
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:00,631
You're the one who made him a cripple

780
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:03,175
and then decided to become a cop
to pay for his medical bills.

781
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:05,594
You're a hypocrite, you know that?

782
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,557
Just tell me…

783
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:12,810
where he is.

784
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,316
Jeez, you need to wear a proper suit

785
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,404
when you attend events like this.

786
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,072
I mean…

787
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:27,908
It's embarrassing
to be seen in public like this.

788
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,245
It's been years
since you were on the national team.

789
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,913
Look at you.

790
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,249
Jeez, aren't you embarrassed?

791
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,793
Why would I be embarrassed? What for?

792
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:39,170
This is an amazing set.

793
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,380
You never got to wear it.

794
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:45,968
You're the same as always, Dung-ju.

795
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:51,348
Do you think you deserve
to wear this emblem?

796
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:56,896
We've already received the investment.
We can't back out of the contract now.

797
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,356
Look, they keep calling me.

798
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,193
How many times do I have to tell you
that I'm not interested?

799
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,196
I'm going to win a gold medal here

800
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:07,073
and then retire.

801
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:10,201
Dong-ju, if you become
an MMA fighter with your skills,

802
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:11,786
you'll be rolling in money.

803
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:14,413
All you get for a gold medal
is a lousy pension.

804
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:15,623
You can't live off that.

805
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:19,251
You can't pay Gyeong-il's medical bills
with that money.

806
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,051
It's my decision.

807
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:28,969
Forget about the contract, okay?

808
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:41,524
Gyeong-il. Ma'am.

809
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:42,900
I hope you're watching.

810
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,276
I won the gold!

811
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,697
See?

812
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:51,283
I promised to bring home the gold.

813
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,331
Just count on me from now on.

814
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,834
I'll do everything for you, okay?

815
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,213
I'll be there soon.
Let's have beef tonight!

816
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,048
Is your injured right hand better now?

817
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:06,966
Yes, it's fine.

818
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,969
There's a rumor saying
you're joining MMA. Is it true?

819
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:15,599
Nothing's been decided yet.

820
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:18,018
How do you feel
about winning the gold medal?

821
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,271
I still can't quite believe it,

822
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,940
- Yes.
- But I think I was able to win it

823
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:24,692
thanks to everyone's support.

824
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,527
Are you enjoying your fame
as the new medalist?

825
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,863
No more interviews today. Thank you.

826
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:31,699
- One more question, please.
- Just one more.

827
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,708
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

828
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:43,544
- You did great!
- Great job!

Mr. Yoon Dong-ju!

832
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:11,906
Were you aware of the test results?

833
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:17,036
ARE THE DETECTED PAINKILLERS NARCOTIC?

834

MAY COST FORMER "GOOD BOY" YOON'S MEDAL

840
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:34,220
Are you proud of the medal
you won through doping?

841
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:39,767
The painkillers were approved.

842
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,311
You know better than anyone
that I won the gold with my skills.

843
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,271
That's not important.

844
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:47,149
What's important
is how people remember you.

845
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:49,526
Did you spend two years on that lawsuit

846
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,362
just to get people to recognize that?

847
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:52,696
Oh, man.

848
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:55,491
Why did you do that?

849
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:59,662
You would've been better off
buying a new suit.

850
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:02,414
Not a single person here knows

851
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:03,666
that you won the lawsuit.

852
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,168
Oh, boy.

853
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:12,299
You punk.

854
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:16,553
This right here

855
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:20,266
is more important to me…

856
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:23,310
than some money.

857
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:32,069
You little bastard.

858
00:59:58,053 --> 00:59:59,513
Please don't mind what just happened.

859
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,764
Enjoy your meal.

860
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:11,066
I'm leaving.

861
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:13,652
Already?

862
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:16,947
I only came as a favor
to the chair of the committee.

863
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:18,991
I've said my greetings, so that's enough.
See you later.

{\an8}2025 KOREAN ATHLETES' NIGHT

866
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:36,633
Hey.

867
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:38,427
You bastard.

868
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,432
How did you actually win that gold medal?

869
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:47,978
Is that what you think too?

870
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,026
What do you mean?

871
01:00:57,488 --> 01:00:58,697
My gold medal.

872
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:01,533
Do you also think
I didn't win it with my skills?

873
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:03,619
- Am I wrong?
- You're wrong!

874
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:04,787
If I'm wrong, then prove it.

875
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:07,081
Don't take it out elsewhere like a fool.

876
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:11,418
You're such an idiot.

877

<i>You're the same as always, Dung-ju.</i>

878
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:33,482
Do you think you deserve
to wear this emblem?

879
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:37,694
<i>You came through the backdoor.
Don't act like you're one of us.</i>

880
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,596
<i>If I'm wrong, then prove it.</i>

881
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,640
<i>Don't take it out elsewhere like a fool.</i>

882
01:02:08,267 --> 01:02:09,768
You're such an idiot.

883
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:13,564
<i>An idiot?</i>

884
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:17,651
Fine, I'll prove it.

885
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,071
I'll prove what kind of person
Yoon Dong-ju really is.

886
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:25,784
<i>How many times do I have to tell you?</i>

887
01:02:25,868 --> 01:02:27,161
It was an imported car...

888
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,079
I know. The steering wheel
was on the right...

889
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:30,289

892
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:40,257
I asked the Korea Customs Service.

893
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,842
It wasn't imported
through normal channels,

894
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,385
and the plate number wasn't registered.

895
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:45,721
The nearby security cameras
didn't record a clear shot either.

896
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:48,765
So?

897
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:50,851
<i>It's a smuggled vehicle with a fake plate.</i>

898
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,020
<i>It's too hard to track it down.</i>

899
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:57,733
I know I've seen that car
somewhere before.

900
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:06,074

There's no proof it's the same car.

944
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,349
I have the proof right here.

945
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:40,354
- Why are you doing this to me?
- What do you mean? Look closely here.

947
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:50,906
It's clear, isn't it?

948
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:54,785
The car that did this to me
is the same one in that file.

949
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:02,542
This is the only car of its kind
in the entire country.

950
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:04,670
The grille marks on this car…

951
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,715
match my bruises exactly, right?

952
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:12,260
That bastard committed the hit-and-run
and messed up my butt in that very car!

953
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:14,888
Okay, I got it.

954
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:17,391
So what?

955
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,768
Have you not been listening?
Let's catch him.

956
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:25,732
Who knows? We might catch
Golden Bunny in the process.

957
01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:31,405
This is the list of smuggled goods
Golden Bunny traded.

958

Look. Everyone else's name is on the list

- What else could it mean?
- Tell me.

961
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,789
I don't know,
but they probably know each other.

962
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:43,583
All right, Dong-ju.

963
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:48,255
Let's assume
they have a very close relationship.

964
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,507
But the car's unregistered,
and there were no CCTVs.

965
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:53,427
So how are we supposed to find him?
Just the two of us at that.

966
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:56,722
And why would Golden Bunny
still be in Korea?

967
01:06:56,805 --> 01:07:00,016
He's had enough time to fly to the moon.

968

Then why don't you hurry up?

986
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:10,504
These need to go to the local precinct.

987
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:14,174
They're the victim's belongings,
but he can't collect them himself.

988
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,510
So hand them over directly to the family.

- Yes?

1021
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,081
- Here you are.
- Hi there.

1022
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:35,417
I need to ask you something.

1023
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,751
What is it?

1024
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,587
Over here, please.

1025
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:42,966
When you were in the field
during the Golden Bunny operation,

1026
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:44,843
did you notice anything strange?

1027
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:47,429
Anything strange?
Why? Did you find something?

1028
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:50,306
The fire that broke out during the op

1029
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,766
turned out to be arson.

1030
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:56,646
But someone had already reported it to 119
five minutes before the fire.

1031
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:58,356
The caller ID was restricted.

1032
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,443
That means the operation was leaked.

1033
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:03,653
Probably from the inside.

1034
01:12:03,737 --> 01:12:04,779
Most likely, yes.

1035
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,698
Before the RIU took over,

1036
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:08,908
the Golden Bunny case was yours, right?

1037
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:10,452
Yeah.

1038
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:13,329
Then do you know who Lee Jin-su is?

1039
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:15,457
He reported Golden Bunny's smuggled goods.

1040
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:16,583
Lee Jin-su?

1041
01:12:17,876 --> 01:12:19,878
- The Korea Customs Service guy?
- Yes. Do you know him?

1042
01:12:20,462 --> 01:12:22,213
I can't say that I know him,

1043
01:12:22,756 --> 01:12:25,800
but he was involved in a hit-and-run
and passed away just now.

1044
01:12:25,884 --> 01:12:28,720
You're saying he was the informant?

1045
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,598
What is it, sir?

1046
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:32,932
Something's bothering me.

1047
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,351
I'll look into it and let you know.

<i>This is the Investigation Support Team.</i>

1051
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:54,287
This is Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon
from the Office of Audits and Inspections.

1052
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,499
I'd like to see the personal effects
of Mr. Lee Jin-su, the hit-and-run victim.

1053
01:12:59,501 --> 01:13:00,585
They left work?

1054
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:02,962
Who's the person in charge?

1055
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:43,169
JONG-HYEON

1056
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:52,011
Dung-ju, that darned bastard!

1057
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:53,388
Why isn't this punk answering?

1058
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:56,766

I'm busy. I'll call you back.

1061
01:14:01,813 --> 01:14:04,190
You wanted to know
if Silver Bunny made any moves.

1062
01:14:04,274 --> 01:14:05,984
<i>- Is something up?</i>
- I don't know what it is,

1063
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:08,069
but he rounded up everyone
to go on a business trip.

1064
01:14:08,153 --> 01:14:08,987
Where to?

1065
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:12,198
<i>The paint factory in Gihyeon-dong.
The address is…</i>

1066
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:13,324
<i>It's 28 Gihyeon-dong!</i>

1067
01:14:13,408 --> 01:14:14,701
It's 28 Gihyeon-dong.

1068
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,452

Who is it?

1071
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:55,742
<i>Hello, I'm from the Korea Customs Service.</i>

1072
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,660
<i>Is this Senior Officer Ji Han-na?</i>

1073
01:14:57,744 --> 01:14:59,412
You're from the Korea Customs Service?

1074
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,538
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

1075
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:04,334
<i>Mr. Lee Jin-su had some documents
belonging to the Korea Customs Service.</i>

1076
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:07,629
<i>I heard that his effects
were handed over to you.</i>

1077
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:11,507
<i>That's why I'm here at such a late hour.</i>

1078
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:12,967
<i>I'm very sorry to intrude.</i>

1079
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:14,344
Okay.

1080
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:21,559
What is it?

1081
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:26,231
You bitch!

1082
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:29,317
Open the door right now!

1083
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,194
- Open it or else!
<i>- Han-na. Ji Han-na!</i>

1084
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:50,505
Where did she run off to?

1085
01:15:52,507 --> 01:15:54,842
- Find those documents first.
- Okay.

28 GIHYEON-DONG

1087
01:16:11,276 --> 01:16:12,277
Hello?

1088
01:16:42,724 --> 01:16:43,891
Dae-yong!

1089
01:16:46,436 --> 01:16:48,438
- Dae-yong, I need a favor.
- No way.

1090
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:49,480
- Listen to me first.
- No way.

1091
01:16:49,564 --> 01:16:50,982
- Yes way!
- No way!

1092
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:54,569
I don't have time for this.
Just listen for a second...

1093
01:16:54,652 --> 01:16:56,863
How could you ask for favors
after stealing my file?

1094
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,406
Did you think I wouldn't know?

1095
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:01,326
Look, I'll apologize for that.

1096
01:17:01,409 --> 01:17:04,078
But your team is the only backup
available at the agency.

1097
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:07,498
I'm begging you.
Dong-ju is in real danger.

1098
01:17:07,582 --> 01:17:08,916
All right.

1099
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,626
- Thanks.
- I'll consider it if you beat me.

1100
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:19,344
Did you find them?

1101
01:17:20,345 --> 01:17:21,929
Damn it, I can't find them!

1102
01:17:35,026 --> 01:17:35,860
<i>Five.</i>

1103
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:40,698
<i>Four.</i>

1104
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:44,786
<i>Three.</i>

1105
01:18:14,649 --> 01:18:17,360
Hey, you're good at driving. You okay?

1106
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:19,362
Hey, Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon!

1107
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:22,365
Salute.

1108
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:25,118
If you keep this up,
you'll get bitten by a snake.

1109
01:18:29,122 --> 01:18:30,998
So? Did I damage your car badly?

1110
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:45,388
What are you waiting for? Take him down.

1111
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:46,848
- Hey!
- Hey!

1112
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:54,397
Hey!

1113
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,690
Get out of the car, you bastard!

1114
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:02,155
You're still here.

1115
01:19:03,406 --> 01:19:05,241
I thought you'd run off right away.

1116
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,201
I'm glad you didn't.

1117
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:11,414
Someone told me to take care of you
before I leave.

1118
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:15,585
Did you have to be such a nuisance?

1119
01:19:18,588 --> 01:19:19,630
Is that someone

1120
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:21,090
this bastard here?

1121
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:23,176
Is this him?

1122
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:27,305
Are you Silver Bunny?

1123
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:29,640
Why mess with your teeth like that?

1124
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:31,476
Just tell me.

1125
01:19:32,477 --> 01:19:33,478
Who bought this car?

1126
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:39,859
Those gold teeth.

1127
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:42,820
They're starting to annoy me.
Show them again, and I'll yank them out.

1128
01:19:49,911 --> 01:19:51,412
I won't ask again.

1129
01:19:54,499 --> 01:19:55,958
- Who is it?
- Jeez.

1130
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,294
He's as dumb as he looks.

1131
01:20:00,046 --> 01:20:03,216
Do you really think I'll tell you?

1132
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,345
Seriously, what an idiot.

1133
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:11,265
Do you know why my name is Yoon Dong-ju?

1134
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:16,229
"I long to feel no shame
as I look up at the sky."

1135
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,982
"A mere breeze stirring the leaves
pained my heart."

1136
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:23,694
My mom wanted me
to live like the poet, Yoon Dong-ju.

1137
01:20:23,778 --> 01:20:27,198
She wanted to keep me
from going down the wrong path.

1138
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:29,325
That's why

1139
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:31,494
I was named after him.

1140
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:36,541
You guys should look up at the sky
and feel some shame.

1141
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:38,793
You little assholes.

1142
01:20:40,211 --> 01:20:41,629
Teach him a lesson.

1143
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:09,782
Damn you!

1144
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,753
I said stop!

1145
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:27,800
Stop, you bastard!

1146
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:29,552
That damned cop.

1147
01:21:30,553 --> 01:21:31,554
He's so damn fast.

1148
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:34,724
You bastard.

1149
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:37,727
What's he doing?

1150
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:45,818
Get him!

1151
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,153
You bastard!

1152
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:53,993
Hey.

1153
01:22:13,346 --> 01:22:14,472
Are you hiding in here?

1154
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,715
- Hey!
- Hey!

1155
01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:11,570
You little shit!

1156
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:30,548
Get out.

1157
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:33,718
I said get…

1158
01:23:46,731 --> 01:23:48,482
- Where are they?
- Not over there.

1159
01:23:48,566 --> 01:23:50,151
We're dead if we don't find those papers.

1160
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:51,610
Damn it. What now?

1161
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,363
What's that?

1162
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,368
She has a gun!

1163
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:30,316
