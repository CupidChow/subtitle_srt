[Jung Kook, in Korean] We conclude
our eight-month journey like this.

16
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,918
At first, I wasn't sure
if I'd be able to get through

17
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:28,088
this tour without any big issues.

18
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,384
I just took it step by step,
and then I suddenly realized,

19
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,262
"Wow, I can't believe
I already made it this far. [gasps]

20
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,722
Wait, I'm already here?

21
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,892
I'm almost done?"
I think that kept running through my mind.

22
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,561
[no audible dialogue]

23
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,152
I guess I was feeling a lot of pressure.

24
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,198
But I think the results were
beyond my imagination.

25
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,033
So I'm relieved.

[no audible dialogue]

27
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:34,320
[Jung Kook] I'm very grateful to ARMY,
but sometimes I feel like I'm a joke.

28
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,075
But I don't want to feel like that.
That's the last thing I want.

29
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,751
[sucks teeth] It isn't enough for the job,

30
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:54,549
the projects, and the people I like…
[sniffles]

31
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,595
…to just be liked by me.

32
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:03,641
I think they should also be acknowledged
by others and feel proud of themselves.

33
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:06,978
It's the same.

34
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,608
My job is to be in the public eye,
and I'm a public figure.

35
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,528
Anyone could listen to our songs…

36
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,407
or my songs.

37
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,118
I can't let them think I'm a joke.

38
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,040
That's all that matters to me.

39
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,687
After BTS went on hiatus,

40
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:54,234
my work and time came to a halt

41
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,277
for a brief moment.

42
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,281
And it resumed when "Seven" came out.

43
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,451
It felt as if a timer was on.

44
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,455
I kept pushing forward.

[humming stops]

48
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,876
For one, I was very worried about
whether I'd be able to get through

49
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,838
this hectic schedule without any issues.

50
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,426
And I was worried about
how the public would react.

51
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,769
I need to master straw phonation
as soon as possible.

52
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,107
I researched
all sorts of vocalization techniques.

53
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,818
[sniffles] Once,
I completely lost my voice.

54
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,574
And while I was trying to figure out
what I should do,

55
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:30,288
I saw Sam Smith
rehab their voice with a straw.

56
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,665
I became curious and then…

57
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,670
I guess you could call it
straw vocalization?

58
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,798
I found a video about the research on it.

59
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,634
And the video said… [sniffles]

60
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,097
…just using the straw like this

61
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,310
helps balance out the vocal cords.

62
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:56,272
And I was like,
"Wait, I should definitely try this."

63
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,568
So I gave it a go,
but I noticed a sound I couldn't make

64
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,988
while doing this straw phonation.

65
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,742
So I'm trying to master that sound now.

66
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,995
[sighs]

67
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,081
Today's recording session must go well.

68
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,545
I'm worried about
the recording environment though.

69
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,261
[Jung Kook, in English] Ah.

70
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,596

[Jung Kook, in Korean]
I was really worried.

82
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,767
Honestly, I wasn't confident, either.

83
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,563
I mean, I'm the main vocalist of BTS.

84
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,982
And I came here to record a song.

85
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,152
I was really worried
about disappointing the producer.

86
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,321
But I was also determined
to show them what I've got.

-Why?
-[interpreter] He's nervous.

-[Cirkut] No.
-[Andrew] What are you nervous about?

94

-[Jung Kook] Mmm.

98
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:56,767
I think the biggest stars that,
in my experience, that I've seen,

99
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,520
that I've read about,
that last the test of time,

100
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,939
are people that work the hardest

101
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,609
and that can check their ego at the door.

102
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,154
And he has that. A million percent.

103
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,657
He was willing to sing a line
until it sounded right.

104
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,743
Over and over until everyone was happy.

105
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,454
And then he pushed himself
in his own time.

106
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,581
And a lot of people would just be like,

107
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,583
"I'm Jung Kook. That's it!" You know?

108
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,084
Like, "That's all you get."

109
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,005
And he was just willing to go and go
and go and go until it was right.

110
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,174
As a producer, what more can you ask for

111
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,967
when you're working
with an artist, you know?

112
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,637

compared to playing the track and…

171
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,537
Lyrics… [babbles]

172
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,539
-[chuckling] Record.
-[director chuckles]

173
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,209
It took like an hour
or an hour and a half?

174
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,961
Recording was done just like that,

175
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,713
and the IEM mix was done too.

176
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,340
It was like,
"Oh, this will work. This is it."

177
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,468
Anyway, it was a new experience for me.

178
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,596
I'm having a lot
of good experiences in the US.

179
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,347
It was really nice.

180
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,142
-[object thuds]
-[huffs] Gosh. I'm so happy.

181
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,867
[Jung Kook] Since my debut until now,

182
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,745
I've learned about myself
and earned many titles.

183
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,332
And these accomplishments
have given me confidence.

184
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:16,337
This album is the culmination
of so many things.

185
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,839
This is just impossible.

186
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:30,017
Of course, being a member of my group
has been a very important part of my life,

187
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,522
but I believe this moment is
just as important.

188
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,567
I will be following my inner compass.

189
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,541
I think treating this like a debut

190
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,045
is the right way to go about this.
[chuckles]

191
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,925
Up until the World Cup,
I was "Jung Kook of BTS."

192
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,301
Anyhow, this will be…

193
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,931
me showing up
to the whole world as myself.

194
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,434
Mmm.

195
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,062
And I'm not really feeling well.

196
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,732
So I'm really concerned.

197
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,824
I think my biggest worry right now is
about how tomorrow will go.

198
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,219
-[interpreter] How are you feeling?
-I think it felt a bit drier than before.

199
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,473
[interpreter, in English] H-He felt…
Everything felt really dry last time.

200
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,391
-Mmm.
-[doctor] Okay.

201
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,104
Just a little red.
It's a little red along the back…

202
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,983
[interpreter] So you think it's, like,
just mild irritation? Just inflammation?

203
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,278
[doctor] But-But you know what I wanna do?
Let me listen to your lungs.

204
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,363
[breathes deeply]

205
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,998
-[machine whirring]
-[doctor] Stick your tongue out.

206
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,757
[doctor] Some point,
when he's feeling a hundred percent,

207
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,885
-and his voice feels a hundred percent…
-[interpreter] Mm-hmm.

208
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,720
…it should be relooked at.

209
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,513
I think the treatment will work for now.

210
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,016
-[interpreter] Yeah? Okay.
-Yeah, for sure. For the show.

211

212
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,448
[Jung Kook, in Korean]
I was so scared back then.

213
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,158
There was still so much left
on the schedule.

214
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,662
I was scared.
I wanted to run away at one point.

215
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,124

216
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,086

That took forever.

223
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,752
It took an hour to get here.

224
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,796
Everyone, Jimin is here.

225
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,632
-I heard you saw a doctor.
-Yeah.

226
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,384
-Why?
-Sore throat.

227
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,677
-Sore throat?
-Mmm.

228
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,470
But I know you'll do well.

229
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,055
I got a shot in the butt today.

230
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,182
-In your butt?
-And in the shoulder yesterday.

231
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,684
-In the shoulder?
-Yeah.

232
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,811
-Did it hurt a lot?
-Uh-uh.

233
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,396

-Uh-uh.

00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,191
-Your voice is a bit hoarse.
-Try this. And that too.

236
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,820
I don't have that anymore.

237
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,114

No. Stop that.

00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,167
-I'm a lot better now.
-No.

242
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,461
You'll be even better
if you don't do that.

243
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,087
Stop talking.

You will.

00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,643
-Of course, I must do well.
-Right. No doubt.

makes you sweat when you're sick.

If I'm being honest,
I'm worried about my voice

The vocal range isn't as wide.
But "Euphoria"--

00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,640
[staff] You can sing it with such ease.

00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:10,727

that I have yet to try,

363
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,387
