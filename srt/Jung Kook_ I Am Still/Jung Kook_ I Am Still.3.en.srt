00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,226
[in Korean] Let me adjust this a bit
for a better angle.

00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:19,352

3
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,437
Let's see here.

4
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,023
Let's just lower it a bit.

5
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,028
Let's see. Okay.

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,196
[sighs]

7
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,075
I met you in high school,
and now you're off to military service.

8
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,829
When did we first meet?

9
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,123
-Grade 10? Grade 11?
-I was in grade 10.

10
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,625
What was I doing back then?

11
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,339
It was when you were doing "N.O."

12
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,134
-Wow. We've known each other since "N.O."
-Right.

13
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,136
[sighs]

14
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,220
Let's go.

15
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,890
-[clippers buzzing]
-[Nae Joo] Let's go, Jung Kook.

16
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,860

17
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,160
[clears throat]

18
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,912
[David, in English] Hi, guys.

19
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,624
Um, so I guess I wanted to
talk to you about two things.

20
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,877
One, the Justin Timberlake record.
And one, the Usher record.

21
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,214
You know, obviously,
we're on to a new single.

22
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,341
Um, "3D" is still huge.

23
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:36,387
I think a video with Usher is
important if we can.

24
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,141
Because I think people seeing
you both dance together would be…

25
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,019
would be also an amazing stamp.

26
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,275
I'm excited for when you come back

27
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,820
because I think
you're just getting started.

28
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,825
[Usher] JK, you're special, man.

29
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,034
Keep rising.

30
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,410
Keep reaching for the stars, man.

31
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,629
[Jung Kook, in Korean] Now… [sighs]

32
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,966
We're on our way…

33
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,552
to see someone

34
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,931
who I watched a lot
to study the art of performance…

35
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,892
when I was young.

36
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,269
Someone I enjoyed watching.

37
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,021
We have Usher…

38
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,441
for the "Standing Next to You" remix.

39
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,110
The Usher Remix.

40
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,822
We're on our way to shoot the music video.

41
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,448
But the music video shoot…

42
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,160
isn't…

43
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,164
being shot like a normal music video.

44
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,666
It's more like a performance video.

45
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,626
Like what we did with "Seven."

46
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,965
I think we'll end up
with something similar.

47
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,183
[in English] "Thanks for…

48
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,102
for…"

49
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,898
-Nice to meet you. Good to see you.
-You too, man.

50
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,192
-Wow.
-[interpreter laughs]

51
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,361
[in Korean] I was a really big fan of him
when I was young.

52
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,573
[in English] He was a big fan of…
I mean, he still is a big fan

53
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,074
-from his young ages.
-Thank you, man.

54
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,203
-It's an honor.
-Thank you very much. What an honor.

55
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,495
-It's for you.
-Yeah.

56
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,580
Thank you, bro.

57
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,748
[interpreter laughs]

58
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,083
We're gonna have a lot of fun today.

59
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,168
Yeah.

60
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,847
[Usher] You know, I feel a lot like, um…

61
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,142
You know,
how Michael probably felt about me.

62
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,771
You know, how James Brown
probably felt about me.

63
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,190
What I do love about what I see

64
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:57,528
in him as an artist is that
he's very committed to his choreography.

65
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:02,325
You know, the more he does this,
I think the better.

66
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,246
And when he comes out, you know,
I'm really excited to see him once again.

67
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:11,167
I'm happy that we got a chance to do this
before he went into the service.

68
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,710
[dancer 1, in Korean] Hello.

00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,308
I have to go to the military.

00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,272

-[Brian] Ah, okay, 12th.

-[Brian] Two weeks.

"Am I great?"
That thought crossed my mind.

93
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,641
It's also an honor.

[Jung Kook, in Korean] We saw
the grand image "Standing Next to You"

104

would create,

105
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,680
and we thought that it was
the best choice as the title track,

106
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,391
so we chose it.

107
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,768
It's a song I have great affection for.

108
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,813

He can kind of do it all,
and he can, you know…

193
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:47,957
He's not afraid to try any different style
or to try singing it in a different way.

194
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,920
He's a chameleon. He can kind of
mold into any different kind of song.

195
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,798
And I also like that we didn't
set out to make this song.

a K-pop song."

It's just a great song,
and then he gets involved

198
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,597
and it creates something special.
You know?

199
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,767
Yeah, it's a marriage
of both worlds coming together
