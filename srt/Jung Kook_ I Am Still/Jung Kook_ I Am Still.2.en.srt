00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,527
[Sungdeuk]
For every concert, Jung Kook was

8
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,947
always the last to leave rehearsals,
practicing his solo performances.

9
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,201
He'd practice his vocals
even more for group songs.

10
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:21,206
When we were done
and preparing to go home,

11
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,874
we'd ask the members

12
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:27,545
if any of them wanted to practice
something more before calling it a day.

13
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,840
Without fail,
Jung Kook would have his hand up.

14
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,383
And it was always at the end.

15
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:36,387
Because at the end, he could do
as much as he wanted without pressure.

16
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,183
That shows how much
of a perfectionist he is.

17
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,148
He's the scariest person in the world

18
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,193
because he's a genius
that puts in the work.

For me,

21
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:08,837
"3D" has completely different overtones
from "Seven."

00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,612
Uh, good.

178
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,447
-Pleasure. How's things?
-Good to see you.

179
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,032
-Yes.
-How you feeling?

180
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,034
-I'm great.
-It looks great out there.

182
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,120
[interpreter, in Korean]
Yeah. How are you?

183
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,705
-[Jung Kook, in English] Good.
-Tired?

184
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,040
-[Jung Kook] Perfect.
-Yeah?

185
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:28,336
[interpreter, in Korean] He said
he sang in a really high key already,

186
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,256
but he was always surprised to hear
you sang in an even higher key

187
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,050
than his demo every time.

188
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,302
-It wasn't my choice.
-[interpreter laughs]

189
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:40,306
[in English] Every time, you're higher
than me. Unbelievable. Amazing.

190
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,434
[interpreter, in Korean] You know
he has a "Dynamite" tattoo, right?

191
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,602
[Jung Kook] Yeah.

192
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,480
He says he'll get one for "3D"
if it tops the charts.

193
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,857
-I hope so. [in English] Please.
-[David] There you go.

194
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,942
This is the Jung Kook arm.

195
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,819
-[all laugh]
-[interpreter] "Jung Kook arm."

196
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,366
Now… I think now
he's probably more seasoned

197
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,620
in the kind of more
Western-sounding, uh, vocals.

198
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,498
And his accent,
he's probably just more natural with it.

199
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,418
Because it was, um… I believe
it was their first full English song.

200
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,212
-[interviewer] It was. Yeah.
-"Dynamite"?

201
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:15,257
So, it was more work then
because it was a new thing to them.

202
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:19,136
But now, he's a pro.
He's got great feel. You know?

203
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,429
Feel you can't teach.

204
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,431
Feel, you either have it or don't have it.

205
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,975
If an artist is great at that thing,

206
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,353
often, they're not quite
as good at that thing,

207
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,564
but with him, it's like,
"Oh, he's great at that thing,

208
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,317
he's great at that thing,
and he's great at that thing as well."

209
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,527
So that's quite nice.

[♪ "3D" playing]

211
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,036
[Pdogg, in Korean] Fundamentally,
I believe that he's a genius.

212
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,125
Because this all started with his voice.

213
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,086
The power of his voice.

214
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,963
That's how we got started.

215
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,548
So I believe he's a genius.

216
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:59,260
And he's so quick when it comes
to catching the essence of a song.

217
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:04,765
He's so good at pulling it off
in his own style.

218
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,643
The way I see it,

219
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,272
Jung Kook is the embodiment of pop music.

I would never think of myself as one.

I'm at that point in my life where
I can so clearly see my shortcomings.

225

I work hard to hide those shortcomings,

226
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,339
but I also work hard to just be better.

I'm scared.

244
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,967
It's all because I'm not good enough.

245

If I was, I wouldn't be scared.

246
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,514
I was just born a fast learner.

247
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,643
And I think I use that to my advantage.

00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,727
Rather than

249
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,730
that I was born a genius.

I look for ways to maximize what I've got.

251
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,488
I just do it over and over again.

252
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,575
I need to familiarize myself with it
for me to be natural.

253
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,244
That way, if I miss something

254
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,539
or get distracted

00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,460

374
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,426
[Jung Kook, in Korean] Since I hadn't
learned one specific genre of dance,

375
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,261
I started with choreography.

376
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,848
And after just doing choreo for a while,

377
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,101
I felt like I was
neither getting better nor worse.

378
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,229
I didn't have my own style.

379
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,149
I felt like I didn't have
my own unique dancing style

380
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,234
in the past.

381
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:42,238
I tend to learn a lot of things
without realizing it.

382
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,492
Whether it's dancing, singing,
personality, or a way of speaking…

383
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,786
I was a skilled dancer
before I even realized it.

384
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,122

-[laughs]
-[Jimin, j-hope laughing]

386
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:01,758
Before his debut,
Jung Kook's personality was, uh…

387
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,345
He was quite introverted in my eyes.

388
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:08,056
-He was quite shy…
-One, two, three…

389
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,225
…but there was so much inside.

390
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:14,771
All this energy and potential were
barely contained inside him.

391
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,899
But he wasn't able to bring
that out during rehearsals.

392
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,235
His head kept telling him to show it,

393
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,363
but physically, he fell short,
and it frustrated him so much.

394
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:29,327
But he nurtured that egg of potential
and got it to hatch.

395
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,580
He started growing,
and his potential exploded.

396
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,042
When his growth was steep.

397
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,712
So I was very surprised,
and I'm sure he was too.

398
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,894
It feels like it's being
received well by a lot of people.

399
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,732
But…

400
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,819
I've only done two songs.

401
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,947
We'll only know for sure
at the finish line.

402
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,158
When I was working with the group,

403
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:14,789
I never thought to myself,
"Oh, I have this sort of personality."

404
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,041
It just never crossed my mind.

405
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,587
At most, I thought, "Oh, I'm me."

406
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,382
But I realized many new things
while working as a solo artist.

407
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,758
I realized…

408
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,054
the role I had been playing in the team.

409
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:36,811
Also, I realized I missed my team
more than I thought

410
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,064
and how fun it was performing with them.

411
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,985
And I realized…

412
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,156
[sighs] …how I was feeling
when I was around them.

413
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:49,908
I found

414
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:55,705
clarity on a lot of things
after spending some time alone.

415
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:01,544
I think being away from them
let me feel all these feelings.

416
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,886
I think that also makes me work harder.

417
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,890
When we're together,

418
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,810
we are very much
each other's support system.

419
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:23,858
We would make up
for each other's shortcomings.

420
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,196
But now that I'm alone,

421
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,950
I've realized how much I need them,

422
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:37,789
and on the flip side,
I've also grown to see…

423
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,586
that when I'm a solo artist,

424
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:48,841
I should contribute positively
and not cause trouble for them.

425
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,386
I've been thinking about that too.

426
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,058

448

I hit the ground running with "Seven"

449
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:36,115
and didn't slow down for "3D,"
but I still have a long way to go.

will really enjoy it.

can dance like this too?"

[♪ "Standing Next to You" playing]

487
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,582
[Ian] Really, what JK brings
to the table for us

488
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,292
is that level of inspiration.

489
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:56,672
Usually, most artists will have
natural talent or really hard work ethic,

490
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:01,344
but it's super rare to have someone have
both of those things at such a high level.

491
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:08,059
And to just feel like, in general,
like we're appreciated amongst JK is

492
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,937
also just a fulfilling feeling to have.

493
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,941
Because, normally, in a commercial space,

494
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:18,361
I feel like the style of dance we do,

495
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,488
it tends to be underappreciated.

496
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:24,784
Maybe it's looked at as like too intricate
or too detailed or too specific.

497
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,744
But to have that be acknowledged

498
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,665

499
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,334

I really admired his dance moves.

00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,436
[Ian] Put, "My baby, I love you."

518
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,146
[all laughing]

519
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,607
-[Ian] Yay.
-"My baby."

520
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,947
-[Ian] Gold!
-[all laugh]

521
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,616
All right, bro. Get some rest.

522
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,288
[in Korean] It's 6:37 p.m. now.

523
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,625
So let's practice
until 7:00 p.m. on the dot.

524

[♪ huffing rhythmically]

526
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,758
Ian Eastwood is the reason

527
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,303
why I started breathing heavily
while I dance.

528
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,763
When he dances, he goes…

529
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,599
[exhaling rhythmically]

530
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,767
He does it like that.

531
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,269
I was like, "Oh, that's cool."

532
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,439
You can really see that when I perform.

533
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:22,401
[♪ singing "Standing Next To You"]

534
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,486
Hey!

535
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,446
[exhales] I'm doing all that.

536
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,201
[exhaling]

537
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,577
[chuckles]

538
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,995
I really do.

539

[groans]

542
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,260
What time is it?

543
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,679
[staff] It's 7:47 p.m.

544
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,056

[♪ singing in English]

548
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:18,040
[Sungdeuk, in Korean] You could tell that
this was him putting his name on the line

549
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,836
and presenting the culmination
of everything he'd gone through.

550
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,382
There was this sense of upgraded coolness.

551
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,678
Forget he's our youngest. He's just cool.
I watched him as a real fan.

552
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,472
I could see how hard he prepared

553
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:40,479
and how he agonized over the details
during all those performances.

554
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,284

[David, in English] You know,
obviously, we're on to a new single.

582
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,606
Um, "3D" is still huge.

583
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:44,152
And now we have the biggest song
to a billion streams in history.

584
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,489
I think you're just getting started.
