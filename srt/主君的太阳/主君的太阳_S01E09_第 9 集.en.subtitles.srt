1
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,360
Shall I get you some water?

2
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,155
No, I don't need it.

3
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,202
I've been watching,

4
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,247
but Cha Hui-ju isn't around you.

5
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,001
She must have gone
to whoever she needs to protect.

6
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,211
For 15 years,

7
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,881
she was worried I would find the culprit.

8
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,801
She just came sometimes
to keep an eye on me.

9
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,722
Why didn't you tell other people
that Cha Hui-ju was one of them?

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,975
I would have if she had been alive.

11
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,186
I would have tried to find her.

12
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,814
And I would have just hated her.

13
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,108
But...

14
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,070
she died right in front of me.

15
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:15,075
Thinking that she was just used
and then abandoned by someone...

16
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,952
made me feel bad for her.

17
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,622
But...

18
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,916
she said that the kidnapper

19
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,752
is someone that she needed to protect.

20
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:31,049
Now I know that I was fooled perfectly.

21
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,637
I didn't come to my senses
after what happened 15 years ago.

22
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,974
I feel like I was hit once more today,
and now I've come to my senses.

23
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,353
It must have been hard.

24
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,732
You said I can worry about you
and console you.

25
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,319
It must have been so hard for you.

26
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,321
You couldn't even tell anyone.

27
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,325
It hurts more when you just
cover up a wound.

28
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,954
You still can't read because of your fear.

29
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,497
What a bitch.

30
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,795
I will tell that to her.

31
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,465
If I meet Hui-ju again,
I'm going to swear at her.

32
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,759
"You evil bitch."

33
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,097
My ten billion won radar

34
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,057
is useful in many ways.

35
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,435
I'm not worth ten billion won anymore.

36
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,772
I can't even find where your money is.

37
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,483
The kidnapper must have the necklace.

38
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,822
Did you really...

39
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,533
pay my ransom?

40
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,079
Believe what you want to.

41
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,957
I may have been

42
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,335
completely fooled by that, too.

43
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:59,512
He won't talk about Cha Hui-ju
unless he finds the necklace.

44
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,141
It looks like he doesn't want
to believe me anymore.

45
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,476
I should have been more careful.

46
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,186
I am sorry.

47
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,398
I was thinking of returning
to Korea soon, anyway.

48
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,069
When he sees this, things will change.

49
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,573
I will stop working at Kingdom, then.

50
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:22,076
No, stay there until I return to Korea.

51
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,121
I won't be able to stay
since Mr. Joo knows about this.

52
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,458
No, I'm the one who provoked him.

53
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,503
If he's my son,
he won't get mad and fire you.

54
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,381
He will just ignore you.

55
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:40,178
He probably knows
that I will just keep Mr. Kang here.

56
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,307
When I become anxious,

57
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,393
my father will provoke me more
and run away.

58
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,480
If I ignore him,

59
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,900
he will come and tell me what he wants.

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,072
I think playing games is important,
whether it's with women or my son.

61
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:04,077
I have to celebrate
Maria's birthday in Spain before I go.

62
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,329
See you then, Kang Woo.

63
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,886
Are the friends

64
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,597
who traveled with you on this trip
coming as well?

65
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,979
Then, there might be someone
who remembers this woman.

66
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,990
Appear before me again.

67
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,908
Come and explain properly.

68
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,869
He's having a hard time.

69
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,672
He probably didn't want to hear that.

70
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:03,303
What will happen to Ms. Tae if it turns
out that your father has the necklace?

71
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,392
She will no longer...

72
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,353
be useful to me.

73
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,691
It's been noisy since she came,

74
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,152
but it will become quiet again.

75
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,756
Did you hear about me from Mr. Joo?

76
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:41,716
Yes.

77
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:46,220
I was investigating
whether you were involved with Cha Hui-ju.

78
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,933
So that is why you kept asking
about Mr. Joo and I.

79
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,187
I thought you were being jealous.

80
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,481
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,815
If that was the case,

82
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:02,612
I could have simply told you
if you had just asked.

83
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,117
Woo, I will tell you everything.

84
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,829
Let's go to that dark place over there.

85
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,637
It seems like Mr. Kang
approached Ms. Tae with a purpose.

86
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,348
But she doesn't seem angry about it.

87
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,602
She doesn't get offended easily.

88
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,688
But she must be upset.

89
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,859
What are you looking for?

90
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,071
You can't see it.

91
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,827
I am worried that you might think
Mr. Joo and I are crazy if I talk rashly.

92
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,037
So, I'm looking for something appropriate.

93
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:03,881
Woo.

94
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,677
I see things that other people can't see.

95
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,179
I...

96
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,265
see ghosts.

97
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:18,312
Other people would think
it's the wind or a draft.

98
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,148
But I can see and hear them.

99
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,274
Gong-sil.

100
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,153
Are you punishing me
by telling me a scary story?

101
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,701
You seemed to really hate ghosts
so I tried not to tell you.

102
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,370
But I can't explain
my relationship with Mr. Joo

103
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,621
without telling you.

104
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,126
I was working with Mr. Joo
so that I could talk

105
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,587
to Cha Hui-ju's ghost.

106
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:48,342
You see dead people
and talk to them as well?

107
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,728
That lady's cat must have died.

108
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,611
A pretty white cat is sitting next to her.

109
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,238
I don't see any cat.

110
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,992
I can see it.

111
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,254
Excuse me.

112
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,175
Did you use to have a cat?

113
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,385
I used to. But...

114
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,514
it died recently.

115
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,807
My cat...

116
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,020
was white as snow.

117
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:55,076
SPECIAL CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER

118
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,747
She's not useful,

119
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,832
so she should leave.

120
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,553
Is she crying?

121
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,100
She was sleeping.

122
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,811
I thought she was crying.

123
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,772
She must not be upset at all.

124
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,869
Is something here?

125
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,165
Don't wake her.

126
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,836
She needs to sleep to see ghosts
and talk to them.

127
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,171
Leave her alone when she's sleeping.

128
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,515
This is a shelter.

129
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,100
Where is it?

130
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,519
Get lost!

131
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:31,005
I just wanted to give you
some room to breathe, too.

132
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,385
I guess...

133
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,679
she is somewhat useful.

134
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,129
Happy?

135
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,562
I slept so well.

136
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:30,940
My gosh.

137
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,818
You're here again?

138
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,903
Why didn't you wake me?

139
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,656
Okay.

140
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,537
It looks good. Here.

141
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,958
Is he making you deliver coffee now?

142
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,503
Ghosts like me so much.

143
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,131
The psychic said

144
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,300
that the ghosts see a bright light
when they see me.

145
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,343
Hey!

146
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,971
What's so good
about being popular with ghosts?

147
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:06,058
You're right.
The lady told me to be careful.

148
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,772
Be careful not to get eaten up.

149
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,775
What does she mean by that?

150
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,863
She said dead people want to
use my body to return to life.

151
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:26,912
What?

152
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,874
Did you follow me here
because I told you off?

153
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,128
It's no use. I can't see or hear you.

154
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,212
I'm not scared at all.

155
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:52,813
If they want to borrow my body
to say what they need to,

156
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,649
do you think I should let them borrow it?

157
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,651
Are you crazy?

158
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,989
I try my best not to call you crazy.

159
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,241
But that's crazy.

160
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,201
Right?

161
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,078
I would die if they
fully take over my body.

162
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,580
I don't want that.

163
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:35,773
Honey.

164
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:37,733
It's me.

165
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,070
I'll play you the song I practiced today.

166
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,447
I don't know if you'll like it.

167
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,406
PIANO PRACTICE RECORDING

168
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,206
It's been a month, right?

169
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,795
I think he believes that his wife
can come back to life.

170
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,603
It will be my recital soon.

171
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,106
I need you.

172
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,733
Please come back.

173
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,382
The press is very interested
in the pianist Ruyi Jang's concert.

174
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,429
Kingdom will have a more luxurious image
through these cultural events.

175
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,680
It was my idea.

176
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,434
I heard his fingers don't move
since his wife died.

177
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,895
Did you meet Ruyi Bang in person to check?

178
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,273
It's Ruyi Jang, not Bang.

179
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,901
And I saw that his fingers
are working just fine.

180
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,362
Jung-won is busy working on
business with China.

181
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,448
You should concentrate on Ruyi Bang.

182
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,910
I'm going to get rid of Bang-sil
while Jung-won is gone.

183
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,872
It's not Bang...

184
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,048
I thought about your worth, Gong-sil.

185
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,675
Do you want the radar to move out?

186
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,011
Why do you think I want to get rid of you?

187
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,765
If I can't find your money,
then I'm worth nothing to you.

188
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,100
And you said you would throw me out
when that happens.

189
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,518
Yes, I did.

190
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,066
So, how much do you think you're worth?

191
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:48,614
If I say I get paid as much
as other customer service employees

192
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,202
and deduct the shelter usage fee,
it would be a negative value.

193
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,829
You're calculating
your worth in monetary terms.

194
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,165
You did learn something from me.

195
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,293
Have you checked your account?

196
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,087
Your salary has been banked in.

197
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,007
Your account balance is...

198
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,890
Mr. Joo.

199
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,060
I paid you for what you did.

200
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,187
You helped us get Ms. Wang's investment.

201
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,649
And I also paid you for working out
the problem at the hotel.

202
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,860
There's a lot left even after
deducting the shelter fees, right?

203
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,991
You are still worth something to me.

204
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,703
I will get rid of you
when it goes down to zero.

205
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,208
Thank you.

206
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,919
If I catch a few more ghosts,

207
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,007
I could soon buy a house.

208
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:53,053
Were you going to leave quietly
if I told you to leave?

209
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,307
I don't get hurt
when you tell me to get lost.

210
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,145
So I could have just clung to you,
but if you

211
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:07,317
-told me to get lost this time--
-You would have clung onto me again.

212
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,778
I have to say it three times
to get rid of you.

213
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,113
That's right.

214
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:17,161
But if you sincerely want me
to get out of your life,

215
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,163
I will do so when you say it once.

216
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,669
Are you saying that
you ignored what I said until now?

217
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,090
Get lost.

218
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,550
Thank you.

219
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,312
Mr. Kim, I won the lottery today.

220
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:49,068
-Did you know?
-Mr. Joo was even luckier thanks to you.

221
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,696
It's all thanks to you.

222
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,701
Please tell me if you have any bad dreams.

223
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,827
I will help you out.

224
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,329
Thank you.

225
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,210
Hello.

226
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:19,348
Why are you keeping that loser Ms. Tae
when you're seeing Tae I-ryeong?

227
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,308
I think you're mistaken about something.

228
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,854
Tae I-ryeong is Little Sun,
and Tae Gong-sil is Big Sun.

229
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,357
Are you taking her side right now?

230
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,568
If it bothers you, make dinner
arrangements with anyone you like.

231
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,028
I will go and meet them.

232
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,115
Then, when you go to China,

233
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,785
you should meet Sejin Construction's
Park Seo-hyun, who studies there.

234
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:44,039
You two had plans of getting married,
but it got canceled when she hurt her leg.

235
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,375
-Do you remember?
-I will meet her.

236
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,628
-Will you feel better, then?
-Yes.

237
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,006
Big Sun isn't going with you
to China, right?

238
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,677
According to the weather report,
there's going to be a typhoon.

239
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,472
Then you won't see any sun.
I heard heavy rain is due here, too.

240
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,391
That's hot.

241
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,020
Woo.

242
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,273
Are you having a hard time?

243
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:13,152
The dead cat was really a white one.

244
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,697
I couldn't sleep at all thinking about it.

245
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,407
I am sorry.

246
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,495
I didn't want to scare you,
so I wasn't going to tell you.

247
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,164
Is there one here, too?

248
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,710
Are there always...

249
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,590
ghosts around you?

250
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,967
Yes, kind of.

251
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:43,348
But not all of them look so scary.

252
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,435
Not all of them are bleeding badly.

253
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,105
And not all of them
have empty eye sockets.

254
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,023
Stop.

255
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,400
I got it.

256
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,988
-Please don't talk about it.
-Okay, I won't.

257
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,660
If it's too hard, ignore what I told you.

258
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:09,791
Just think that I am living
in a different world.

259
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,502
How does Mr. Joo believe you?

260
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:17,049
Because he is a very special person to me.

261
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,675
If I pretend not to know,

262
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,303
I will never find out about your world.

263
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,847
I can't force you to believe me.

264
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,266
I was trying to see Hui-ju's ghost.

265
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,352
I have nothing to do with the kidnapper.

266
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:29,937
I will keep watching you.

267
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,607
I will think the scary part
is punishment for lying to you.

268
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,359
And endure it.

269
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:00,217
He is so scared.
I can't just tell him to believe me.

270
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,178
What should I do?

271
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,856
Hey, what is it this time?

272
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,858
You're human.

273
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,739
I'm not human.

274
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,659
I'm a goddess.

275
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,541
Hey, salaryman.

276
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,128
You don't look good.

277
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:40,299
I bet you couldn't sleep
because a goddess asked you out.

278
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:44,594
A goddess is a ghost, too.
I really hate those things.

279
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,013
Go.

280
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,473
If it's overwhelming for you,

281
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,892
I can be a normal person.

282
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,230
Aren't you investigating
Tae Gong-sil today?

283
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,274
I don't need to.

284
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,609
I found out all about her.

285
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,195
Is it over? I was having fun.

286
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,657
Let's go eat to celebrate
our first day as a couple.

287
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,869
I'm not going out with you. I said no.

288
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,830
You might say no now,
but you will be mine in the end.

289
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:16,877
When you look back later,
today will be our first day together.

290
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,253
Really?

291
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,881
Then, let's say we're going out.

292
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,260
Let's break up.

293
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,432
Tae I-ryeong, it was one day...

294
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,434
No.

295
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,813
It was a minute and thirty seconds,
but thanks for the good memories we had.

296
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,191
I wish you happiness.

297
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,659
It's so hard to date a salaryman.

298
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,219
Did you hear that?

299
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,680
Yes, I heard a sound.
Maybe someone's using the piano.

300
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,140
We should check it out.

301
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,854
Mr. Kang.

302
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,107
Didn't you feel something cold just now?

303
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,155
Check that area.
I'll check inside the theater.

304
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,073
Okay.

305
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,211
I can't believe this.

306
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,719
What was that?

307
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,646
Who's there?

308
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,238
My hand!

309
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,742
Mr. Kang!

310
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,328
My hand!

311
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,956
Isn't he the pianist
who is going to perform here?

312
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:03,919
My hand!

313
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,968
I came to check the piano
I was to perform with.

314
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,512
But your security team
charged right at me.

315
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,016
And did this to my hand.

316
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,685
We are very sorry about it.

317
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,187
However...

318
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:29,361
the head of our security team said
he didn't use so much force on you.

319
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,739
This hand has to perform sensitive music.

320
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,243
But it won't move.

321
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,663
I cannot perform.

322
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,876
I can't believe this.

323
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,047
I heard he is in a slump
after his wife died.

324
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,632
It must be a lie.

325
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,926
I think Mr. Kang is being framed.

326
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,679
How did he get involved in that?

327
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:59,683
It was really spooky that night.

328
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:05,188
For some reason,
Mr. Kang seemed more nervous than normal.

329
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:15,699
I'm...

330
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:21,496
Tae Gong-sil of the Special Customer
Service Center in Kingdom.

331
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,874
Do you mind talking with me for a while?

332
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,377
I have nothing to say.

333
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,717
I can see you.

334
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,639
You're Ruyi Jang's wife, right?

335
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,777
GIVE LOVE THAT SHINES LIKE THE SUN

336
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,572
-It's a sun.
-What?

337
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,449
This one.

338
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,411
Ms. Tae would feel better
if she had this as a charm.

339
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:02,787
A charm?

340
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,833
Ms. Tae came to me and told me something.

341
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,962
Is this the pen that Mr. Joo
uses all the time?

342
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:15,175
Could I keep it
while he's away on business?

343
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:20,055
I think I would feel better if I kept
something of his like a charm with me.

344
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:24,267
She said she was fine,
but she must be worried.

345
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:28,438
Ms. Tae would be very happy
if you gave her this instead of the pen.

346
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,690
In ancient times,
the sun symbolized the king.

347
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,109
It also represented the master.

348
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,736
Let's go.

349
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,414
Why did I buy this?

350
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,793
This isn't something I would profit from.

351
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,971
Why did you come here?

352
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,432
Didn't Mr. Kim tell you?

353
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,351
What?

354
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,104
I asked Mr. Kim,

355
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,649
and he said you would have it,
so I should come here.

356
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,443
I'm sure Mr. Kim didn't see it.

357
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,654
I bought it by myself.

358
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,740
But you have it, right? Excuse me.

359
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,620
I didn't buy it for you.

360
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,081
I'm not giving it to you.

361
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,251
What are you talking about?

362
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,673
-The charm.
-Charm?

363
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,343
Did you buy one
because you're scared of ghosts?

364
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,972
I have a few at home.
You could have just asked me.

365
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,268
Why did you come, then?

366
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,812
I am trying to solve the Ruyi Jang matter.

367
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:52,772
Right.

368
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,067
I met his wife.

369
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,530
She's with me right now.

370
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,327
Why did you bring her here?

371
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,831
I need to make something with her,
but I don't have an oven.

372
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,167
Mr. Kim said I should come ask you.

373
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,544
I thought you had already talked to him
since you let me in.

374
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,337
Was that it?

375
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:22,135
How much was the charm?

376
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,304
I don't know.

377
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,014
The oven is over there. Use it.

378
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,307
Okay.

379
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,695
Okay. This one?

380
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,580
I thought she came for this,
and I ended up letting her in the kitchen.

381
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,791
Did you crack the walnuts?

382
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,417
I'm doing it.

383
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,466
You don't know how lucky you are.

384
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,302
This is really expensive.

385
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,474
She said Ruyi Jang
is a very sensitive person.

386
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,228
He always followed a specific routine
before a performance.

387
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,314
And his wife was the one
who helped him with everything.

388
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:25,615
He doesn't like the smell of food
when he's performing,

389
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:29,244
so he only eats pie
that has a lot of cinnamon in it.

390
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:36,125
The wife looked after her picky husband,
just like a shadow.

391
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,463
If we bring him a pie that is made
according to her recipe,

392
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:43,633
we should be able to resolve
the misunderstanding with Woo.

393
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:47,846
So, you are doing all this
for your Sweet Kang?

394
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:52,600
He was really shocked
after I told him about the ghosts.

395
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,437
Sweet Kang turned out to be a spy,
not a sweet guy.

396
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,772
Do you still want to help him?

397
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,984
Woo apologized to me,

398
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,988
and I feel bad for telling him something
he didn't want to know.

399
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,366
And won't you lose money
if the performance is canceled?

400
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,869
That's why I cracked the walnuts.

401
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,874
Is this sheet thin enough?

402
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,001
Thinner?

403
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,836
Why is he so picky?

404
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,719
Why did you touch me? She was talking,
but she just disappeared.

405
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,471
Did you just get annoyed at me?

406
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,559
You used to touch me,
begging me to get rid of the ghosts,

407
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,436
but now you are telling me off.

408
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:37,854
I'm sorry,

409
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,732
I was surprised because
she suddenly disappeared.

410
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,987
She said he's so picky that if there's
the slightest difference in taste,

411
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,780
it won't work.

412
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,698
I'm sorry.

413
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:58,666
Have a drink and tell the lady
to come in and make it herself.

414
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,172
I heard it could be dangerous.

415
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:10,011
A ghost could take control
of my body for good.

416
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,770
You should never drink.

417
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,814
If it's so dangerous,
you should never do it.

418
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,524
Okay.

419
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,072
She's back.

420
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,449
What next? Okay.

421
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,786
Please be careful.

422
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,413
Honey and cinnamon?

423
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,170
Just a bit?

424
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,522
Kang Woo.

425
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,863
I heard you got into trouble.
Are you worried you'll get fired?

426
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,532
I'm not in a good mood. Go away.

427
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,119
You should get fired.

428
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,830
I want you to be my personal bodyguard.

429
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,420
How can you just say what you want
without thinking about the other person?

430
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,007
I really can't understand your world.

431
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:34,012
I thought you were worried
that you would be jobless.

432
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,430
I was trying to cheer you up.

433
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,015
Did I offend you?

434
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:42,061
I really can't understand
the world of a salaryman.

435
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,524
If you start to like someone
who lives in a different world,

436
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,568
what would you do?

437
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,445
I would try not to like him.

438
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,530
-What if that doesn't work?
-Then I'll try to jump in.

439
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,658
But something really scary could jump out.

440
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,494
Could you handle it?

441
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:02,498
I will like that person more.
They say that love is blind.

442
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:06,794
If I'm blind with love,
would I see the scary thing?

443
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:07,920
You're right.

444
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,507
I just have to like her more.

445
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,637
It's simple.

446
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,100
I don't like you enough to be blinded yet.

447
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,227
That's a relief.

448
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,692
I came because I was worried.
How can you leave like that?

449
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,987
If I go after him,
it means that I'm blinded.

450
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,656
I don't like you that much.

451
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,617
I don't.

452
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:39,827
I really don't.

453
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,296
Do you think he will come?

454
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,591
He will get very mad
if we call him at this hour.

455
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,720
If this doesn't work,
there will be no performance.

456
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,977
Because he is a very special person to me.

457
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,065
It will be okay.

458
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,157
Was he talking about Big Sun?

459
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,786
Oh, my gosh.

460
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,831
I told him to like her more.

461
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:44,100
I don't think I can perform without you.

462
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,533
Why did you want to see me at this hour?

463
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,175
There are the same number

464
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,595
of walnuts in this pie
as the black keys on a piano.

465
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:24,974
And there are the same number of creases
as the white keys.

466
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:30,396
You have to eat this
to avoid making mistakes, right?

467
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:33,900
How did you know that?

468
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,487
It's a rule that only my wife and I know.

469
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,239
Your wife told me.

470
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,494
When you were trying to hurt your fingers
on purpose,

471
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,288
your wife asked for help,

472
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:51,292
and that's how Woo ended up stopping you.

473
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,673
So,

474
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,051
you mean that my wife...

475
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,180
was watching me?

476
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,475
You didn't hurt your fingers.

477
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,685
They can move normally, right?

478
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,574
Can you see my wife?

479
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,954
Let me see her, too.

480
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,915
Let me at least talk to her.

481
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,714
You said that she's here.

482
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,634
But I can't see or feel her.

483
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,097
Just once. Please.

484
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,766
Please let me meet her.

485
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,728
She left so suddenly.

486
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,315
I wasn't even able to say goodbye to her.

487
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,773
You never hurt my hand.

488
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:40,943
I'm sorry.

489
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:46,574
I'm glad you're not hurt.
But why did you come to tell me that?

490
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,368
The person who gave me
my wife's message...

491
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,248
asked me to come and apologize to you.

492
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,460
I thought your wife had passed away.

493
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,466
My wife was always by my side.

494
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,429
I am sure of that now.

495
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,058
I will make a perfect performance.

496
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,102
Because my wife is with me.

497
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:22,568
When someone dies suddenly,
it's hard for people to accept it.

498
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,571
I think that's how it is for Ruyi Jang.

499
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,615
You made him a pie,

500
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,617
and he said he would do the performance.

501
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,161
You don't have to worry about him.

502
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,541
Is it okay for you to hold
and touch anyone like that?

503
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,584
That man...

504
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,629
kept clinging onto you.

505
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,465
He was crying so sadly. What was I to do?

506
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:48,260
You would have held him all night
if I didn't stop you.

507
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,432
You worry about others.
Don't you worry about yourself?

508
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:55,976
Me?

509
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:59,897
I won't be in your world
for a week starting tomorrow.

510
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,148
Aren't you worried?

511
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,026
The person you need to touch
and hold you will be gone.

512
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,820
Aren't you anxious?

513
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:11,200
I don't feel the same way
about the ghosts these days.

514
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,204
I used to be so scared
when I was swamped with them.

515
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,832
But now that I have some room to breathe,

516
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:20,960
they aren't so bad.

517
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:25,589
Really?

518
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:32,096
So, why did you take
my favorite pen, then?

519
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:43,023
Give me my pen.

520
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,821
I thought Mr. Kim wouldn't tell you.

521
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:57,872
Is it not in here?

522
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,041
I think I lost it.

523
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,753
Take it out of my salary.

524
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:17,391
Okay, Tae Gong-sil.
Just take the pen and go.

525
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,059
Go away!

526
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,733
Mr. Jang?

527
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,902
I was waiting for you.

528
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,697
I have to choose an outfit.
My wife will choose it for me.

529
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:36,368
I can't see or hear her.
You have to help me.

530
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,790
What are you doing? I have to get ready.

531
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,460
-Let's go.
-What? Okay.

532
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,132
My wife always evaluated
my last rehearsals before the recitals.

533
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,384
Please tell me what she says about it.

534
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,182
The person who gave me
my wife's message...

535
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,102
asked me to come and apologize to you.

536
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:09,068
Can Tae Gong-sil see
Ruyi Jang's late wife?

537
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,611
Yes.

538
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,532
Thanks to her,
you were able to get out of trouble.

539
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,116
I saw you two together yesterday.

540
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,079
Do you understand and believe
everything about her world?

541
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:24,041
Tae Gong-sil has a special radar,
and I'm making use of it.

542
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,044
If you can't accept it,
you should pretend not to know.

543
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,295
Do you mean that...

544
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,423
you'll make her find Cha Hui-ju?

545
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,178
Yes.

546
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:41,976
So it's just like the pianist
who is using Tae Gong-sil to see his wife.

547
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,603
And that's why you kept her close.

548
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,817
Tae Gong-sil isn't special to you.

549
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:54,405
You're using her
to see someone special to you, right?

550
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,954
Yes.

551
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,999
I should get going, then.

552
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,718
A ten billion won radar.
She's worth that much.

553
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,306
But it feels bad to be on the same level
as the pianist.

554
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,268
But he's right.

555
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,608
This one? Okay.

556
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,071
She says you should wear this.

557
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,365
It's exactly my wife's taste.

558
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,124
I'm not your wife.

559
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,003
I don't think I can help you get changed.

560
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,422
You're right.

561
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:57,760
I wish I could meet her
without having to go through you.

562
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,512
I'll go get changed.

563
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,683
Your husband is really picky.

564
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,812
-Gong-sil, I brought cinnamon tea.
-Good.

565
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,903
Is the cinnamon scent strong enough?

566
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,031
He takes it very strong.

567
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:23,661
What is this? Is someone here again?

568
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,873
It's the wife of the pianist
who will be performing today.

569
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,376
I'm taking care of him in her place.

570
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,671
-My gosh.
-I have to use those cups?

571
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,547
Okay.

572
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,925
What are you doing?

573
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,887
He can only perform
if his wife is by his side.

574
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,390
But he's so picky

575
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,101
that I would rather let the wife come
inside and do it herself.

576
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,728
How can you even say that?

577
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,816
You said that ghosts
could come in and not leave.

578
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:58,821
As long as I don't lose consciousness,
that won't happen.

579
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:01,865
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

580
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:05,953
Gong-sil, tell him to drink this
and let's get out of here.

581
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,998
But there's something I need to do
right before the concert.

582
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,042
Hold this.

583
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,551
Oh, no. The business trip.

584
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:21,927
What?

585
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:26,181
-Hold on, Gong-ri.
-Hey!

586
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,983
Mr. Joo. You have to leave now.

587
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,528
Okay.

588
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,542
There's a guy who always
goes through the trash bin.

589
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,253
Hold on.

590
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,849
Hey there.

591
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,810
Are you close to Tae Gong-sil?

592
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,775
I'm going to leave this here.

593
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:23,363
You can tell her to take it or not.

594
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,416
Shall we sit here and get some rest?

595
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,460
What's wrong with that?

596
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,421
Let's just go.

597
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,107
He's already gone.

598
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:11,203
The pills I took to sleep without you
will be able to bring you back.

599
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:19,086
I will able to see you in this dress soon.

600
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,260
Where have you been?

601
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,054
I went to see someone
that I needed to meet.

602
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:32,849
Drink some tea.

603
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:34,518
Me?

604
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,688
You can drink the tea
instead of her, right?

605
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,445
The cinnamon is really strong.

606
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,559
GET LOST

607
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,918
MR. JOO

608
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,087
This woman is ready.

609
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,467
When are you coming?

610
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,367
You're checked in. You should go now.

611
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,584
Check his fingers one more time
before the performance.

612
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,044
They looked fine.

613
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:26,755
Okay.

614
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,475
We came to see how you are feeling.

615
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,976
I am perfectly fine,

616
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:42,979
because she is here with me now.

617
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,399
Who is she?

618
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,281
Bang-sil?

619
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,033
Bang-sil...

620
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,203
Bang-sil?

621
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:02,124
She's my muse,
who allows me to make music.

622
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,376
We won't be able to say goodbye later.

623
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,129
We're going to leave for France
right away.

624
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,008
You have to watch me perform. Let's go.

625
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:26,732
I can't believe Bang-sil
is Ruyi Jang's muse.

626
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,859
Since when?

627
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,569
Who on earth is she?

628
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,155
That's funny, right?

629
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,034
Isn't that Tae Gong-sil?

630
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,871
She seems like
a totally different person like that.

631
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,914
You're right.

632
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,255
What is it?

633
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,175
Did you break up with Tae Gong-sil?

634
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,595
Did you call to ask me that?
I'm leaving for a business trip.

635
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,347
Tae Gong-sil is with Ruyi Jang right now.

636
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:00,432
Really?

637
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,226
I guess she couldn't refuse.

638
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,644
Did you know about it?

639
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:09,065
Is Tae Gong-sil really Ruyi Jang's muse?

640
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:11,526
What?

641
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,153
She seems like a totally different person.

642
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,990
Did you know
they're leaving for France together?

643
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,116
Go where?

644
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,993
She's going with Ruyi Jang.

645
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,661
Right after the performance.

646
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,461
I'm so happy that you're back.

647
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,672
If we leave like this,
we'll be able to live like before.

648
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,636
Someone might recognize us
and try to stop us.

649
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:41,556
I'll perform alone.
You should go hide at home.

650
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,275
I'll perform alone. You should get going.

651
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,319
Ruyi.

652
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:57,280
You can do it alone. You don't need me.

653
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,950
That's because
this is a special situation.

654
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:00,867
Yes.

655
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,079
People can change
when circumstances change.

656
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,749
I'm not here anymore.
So you need to change.

657
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,293
You're right here.

658
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,087
I just borrowed her body for a moment.

659
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,715
I want you to come back to your senses.

660
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,931
I was a little happy to see that
you couldn't do anything without me.

661
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,934
I always lived like a shadow next to you.

662
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,480
I would have felt bad
if you went on well without me.

663
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,485
Did you leave me because I suffocated you?

664
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,153
Is that it?

665
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:44,035
I couldn't bear to think
that your heart stopped because of me.

666
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:47,455
I couldn't send you away
without finding another reason.

667
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,500
I lived for you
while my heart was beating.

668
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,711
Now that it has stopped,

669
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,379
please let me go.

670
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,466
You made me prepare everything for you.

671
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:02,345
But you went
into the spotlight by yourself.

672
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,890
You should do all of that by yourself now.

673
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,643
You're not a very sensitive person.

674
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,062
You're just very lazy.

675
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,814
Fix that.

676
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,212
Honey.

677
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,133
Honey.

678
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,378
I thought Mr. Joo went to China.

679
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:27,806
Tae Gong-sil.

680
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,240
You came, Joo Jung-won.

681
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:48,576
Are you the wife
who made me crack walnuts?

682
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,580
Did you come to save Ms. Tae?

683
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:56,126
I'm here now. You should leave.

684
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,628
If I leave now,

685
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,214
I can't tell you the secret.

686
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,636
Aren't you curious what she thinks of you?

687
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,076
This is good.

688
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,378
Do I like him?

689
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,715
Is it obvious?

690
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,803
But he has someone that he really likes.

691
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,948
So, how I feel is a secret.

692
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,001
I could tell you a secret I know.

693
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,045
-I don't want to know.
-Why?

694
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,964
Because you won't be able
to calculate her worth?

695
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,222
Why do you keep her by your side
when you already can't?

696
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:39,020
I'm curious about your secret, too.
I don't want to leave her body.

697
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,481
Watch this and get lost.

698
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,861
Gong-sil.

699
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,491
Are you okay?

700
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,788
I guess I fell asleep here.

701
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,290
Didn't Mr. Joo come here?

702
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,458
Mr. Joo?

703
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,335
He's on a business trip.

704
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,467
My gosh. What is this?

705
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,594
Why am I wearing this?

706
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:20,682
Don't you remember being with Ruyi Jang?

707
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,645
I think something went wrong.

708
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,483
What was I doing?

709
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,111
Are you really okay?

710
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:35,863
Let's go home together.

711
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,626
Is Ms. Tae okay?

712
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,963
I am not okay.

713
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:58,177
You tried really hard
to keep her by my side.

714
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:00,805
Did you know that?

715
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,349
Why did you do it?

716
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:05,435
It was nice

717
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:07,979
to see you change.

718
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:15,153
So I will keep changing
if I keep her by my side.

719
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:19,240
I...

720
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,326
don't want to change.

721
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:35,214
ONE WEEK LATER

722
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,507
He should be back today.

723
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,927
A week is so long.
He didn't even answer his phone.

724
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:40,887
My gosh.

725
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,226
What's the occasion?
You never talked to me before.

726
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:49,520
What?

727
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,356
There's something there?

728
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,400
What?

729
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,326
What is this?

730
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,705
Mr. Joo? Really?

731
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:14,796
It's a sun.

732
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,506
It's so pretty.

733
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,550
Gong-sil.

734
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,471
-Did you hear?
-Hear what?

735
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:27,100
Oh, you don't know yet.
Well, it did happen really suddenly.

736
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,478
-What?
-Mr. Joo just came back from China.

737
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,231
-Really?
-Wait, listen!

738
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:38,027
She will be shocked.
This is going to be a disaster.

739
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:43,783
Mr. Kim!

740
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,702
Is Mr. Joo back?

741
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,870
Yes, he's coming.

742
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,290
-Was it a good trip?
-Well, the thing is...

743
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,169
Hello.

744
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,340
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

745
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:03,094
-Did you tell her, too?
-No, not yet.

746
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,179
Ms. Tae.

747
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,015
You should congratulate Jung-won.

748
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,434
Jung-won...

749
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:12,729
I mean, Mr. Joo is going to get married.

750
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,406
There he comes.

751
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,993
That's the woman
who is going to marry Mr. Joo.

752
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,626
