1
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,369
Tae Gong-sil.

2
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:40,999
I love you.

3
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,838
This happened while he was with you.

4
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,091
I knew you were bad luck.

5
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,094
-I told you to get away from him!
-Honey.

6
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,429
Ms. Joo.

7
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,310
How is my Jung-won?

8
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,230
His heart stopped for a while
during the surgery,

9
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:31,025
but his vitals returned to normal
and we're doing the surgery.

10
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,278
Honey.

11
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,779
So, he's not dead?

12
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,823
Is Mr. Joo still alive?

13
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,201
Thankfully, the weapon
didn't go through his heart.

14
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,996
The surgery should end well.

15
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,584
So, he's not dead.

16
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,796
Maybe he just came out for a while
like the hotel lady.

17
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,757
I should go.

18
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,343
He thought he was dead.

19
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,554
I have to see if he returns safely.

20
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,349
Dead?

21
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,977
How can you even say that?

22
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,439
Don't ever...

23
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,317
Don't ever stay near Jung-won again.

24
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,241
-Ms. Tae.
-How is Mr. Joo?

25
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,202
The surgery was successful.

26
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,329
Is he awake?

27
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,586
His aunt isn't here right now.
You should go and see him.

28
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,216
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

29
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,055
It's dangerous to get too involved
in the world you see.

30
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,182
I've...

31
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,145
already come too far.

32
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,023
I just kept looking at you.

33
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,527
And now I'm totally possessed.

34
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,050
I'm sorry.

35
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,388
I'm sorry.

36
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,439
How is Mr. Joo?

37
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,235
Is Tae Gong-sil still here?

38
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,320
I saw Mr. Joo.

39
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,075
He thought he was dead and said goodbye.

40
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,537
What if he doesn't return?

41
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,627
I can see ghosts, but I can't summon them.

42
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,051
The darkness will eat up the light,

43
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,888
and death will eat up life.

44
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,977
I should meet that lady.

45
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:28,030
He met the sun that shines in death.

46
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,328
So, his spirit will think that he is dead.

47
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:40,710
He won't know that he's still alive
and that he has to go back.

48
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,005
He's not coming back because he saw me?

49
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,131
He's probably...

50
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:50,428
getting ready to disappear forever.

51
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,571
Jung-won.

52
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,751
Can you read now?

53
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,336
I...

54
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,129
am dead now.

55
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,507
You can finally see me.

56
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,719
We are finally together.

57
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,353
Please call his spirit for me.

58
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,940
I have to tell him that he's alive
and that he should return.

59
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:48,152
I cannot see spirits like you do.

60
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,572
But I can handle them.

61
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,449
You have to call him soon.

62
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,619
If it's too late,
he might not be able to return.

63
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,331
If I help you, what can you do for me?

64
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,459
I need your ability.

65
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,795
Can you give yourself to me?

66
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,384
If I do that, what will happen?

67
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,303
You won't be able to live as you wish.

68
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,682
Why?

69
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,600
Do you need to think about it?

70
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,230
I don't think you have time.

71
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,487
I will be whatever you want me to.

72
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,739
Please make him return.

73
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,992
The deal has been made.

74
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,077
Okay.

75
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,205
I will call upon your man now.

76
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,711
I need an item to call upon that man.

77
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,130
Something he can recognize.

78
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:59,056
Does it represent that you are his sun?

79
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,726
That would be good.

80
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,320
Like I said, because he has met you,

81
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,698
he will believe that he is dead.

82
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,076
So, I know this will be heartbreaking.

83
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,079
But in order to make him come back,

84
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,458
we have to erase all the moments
that made you seem bright

85
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,210
in his eyes.

86
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,256
Are you saying he won't be able
to remember visiting me?

87
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,385
I love you.

88
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,016
I said all the moments.

89
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:49,774
Ms. Tae, all the moments
he saw the brightness in you.

90
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,986
All the meaning that this necklace holds

91
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,864
will be erased.

92
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,911
He won't remember anything?

93
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,205
It's a choice you have to make

94
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,916
to make him come back.

95
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,668
Will that be okay?

96
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,594
I don't care.

97
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:24,392
I was going to get out of his life anyway.

98
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:25,851
Okay.

99
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,145
Then...

100
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:33,109
Joo Jung-won. Where are you right now?

101
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,916
You are not dead.

102
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,168
You have to go back.

103
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,629
It's the light...

104
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,715
that will disappear.

105
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,774
BLOOD PRESSURE

106
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:46,617
Do not forget about the deal
you made with me.

107
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,205
He has probably returned safely by now.

108
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,272
Joo Jung-won.

109
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,567
Get up.

110
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,654
I waited 15 years
for the statute of limitations to end

111
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,948
so I could meet you.

112
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:29,910
Get up.

113
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,045
Mr. Joo, please.

114
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,006
Please wake up.

115
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,860
Are you awake?

116
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,494
You're awake.

117
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,497
Joo Jung-won.

118
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,253
Your aunt is outside. I'll go get her.

119
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,756
She will be very happy.

120
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,973
The patient has woken up.

121
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,155
Jung-won is awake.

122
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,450
What a relief.

123
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:56,121
Tae Gong-sil, I am asking you sincerely.

124
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,915
This can't go on anymore.

125
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,926
I am so glad, Mr. Kim.

126
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,386
Wait.

127
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,223
You'll be able to see him
after Ms. Joo leaves.

128
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,684
It's okay.

129
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,229
This is it. I'm going to stop.

130
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,858
But Mr. Joo will probably want
to see you first.

131
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,654
He won't.

132
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,992
I will no longer exist in his life now.

133
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,424
Jung-won.

134
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,719
I thought you were going to die.

135
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,848
What happened to me?

136
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,224
What do you think?

137
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,601
I told you to get rid of her.

138
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,230
You almost died
because you followed that girl.

139
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,648
Go after whom?

140
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,692
Who do you mean?

141
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,573
-Mr. Kim.
-You're awake. I'm so glad.

142
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,951
What happened to me?

143
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,454
Did I really...

144
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,999
get hit by lightning?

145
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,128
What...

146
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,801
He won't be able to remember you?

147
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,095
That's what she said.

148
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,890
He will forget that he got hurt

149
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,810
next to a woman who sees ghosts
and that he appeared as a ghost.

150
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:48,567
I remember going to the man
who refused to move

151
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:52,071
out of his house that was
in the middle of my golf course.

152
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,405
I...

153
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,783
will be hit by thunder.

154
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:03,457
Did I really get hit
by lightning that day?

155
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,586
That's all I remember.

156
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,714
That was a long time ago.

157
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,885
Jung-won, don't you remember anything?

158
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,641
My whole body aches.

159
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,602
I guess I really was stabbed in the back.

160
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:24,853
But...

161
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,523
why did that happen to me?

162
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,903
You were with Tae Gong--

163
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,657
You should get well first.

164
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,450
Get your health back first.

165
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,328
Then let's sort this out.

166
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,249
But...

167
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,335
who is that woman?

168
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:55,968
I'll introduce her later.
You should rest first.

169
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,429
Doctor, please keep
a close eye on Jung-won.

170
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,515
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

171
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,558
-Honey.
-Yes?

172
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,684
Let's leave.

173
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,150
How is your breathing?

174
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,318
It hurts. A lot.

175
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,029
Let's do some more tests tomorrow.

176
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:26,748
We'll know once we get the results,
but it's probably temporary memory loss.

177
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,383
Something...

178
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,805
flashed and then disappeared.

179
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,572
I promised.

180
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:05,078
But if you sincerely want me
to get out of your life,

181
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,955
I will do so when you say it once.

182
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,607
I guess this is it.

183
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,299
If Jung-won can't remember,
it's all for the best.

184
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:04,721
No one should ever talk about her
in front of him.

185
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,809
Okay, I got it.

186
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,938
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

187
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,523
Please.

188
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,234
Okay.

189
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:25,367
There's a rumor that Mr. Joo almost died
while he was with Gong-sil.

190
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,538
Mr. Joo and Gong-sil
went to find a kid who was missing,

191
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,915
and they met the killer.

192
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,876
And Mr. Joo saved Gong-sil.

193
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,798
How did Tae Gong-sil know
the dead kid was there?

194
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,633
Don't try to find out.

195
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:48,015
Ms. Joo ordered us not to talk about her,
so I can't talk loudly anyway.

196
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:53,228
Then, you shouldn't talk about it
in whispers, either.

197
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,647
Okay.

198
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:56,898
Eat this.

199
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:01,069
You should stay in the hospital.
Why did you leave already?

200
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,156
I can breathe now.
And I'm more comfortable here.

201
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,326
Will you be okay on your own?

202
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,246
Come stay at our place.
I prepared food that you like.

203
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,707
Bring it here, then.
I'm really hungry right now.

204
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,667
Really? Wait a moment.

205
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:18,879
You should rest.

206
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,349
Why?

207
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,143
Is there something you want to say?

208
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:37,439
What happened to me?
My aunt is trying to hide something.

209
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,233
You should give me
a brief report about it.

210
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,155
There's nothing for me to say.

211
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,908
You were doing well at work.

212
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,660
And the Shanghai project is going well.

213
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:55,415
You went to the car center with
an employee who found the killer.

214
00:22:55,874 --> 00:23:00,128
Something very important
seems to be missing.

215
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,423
You know what that is, right?

216
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:12,808
I think you're dying to tell me
what it is right now.

217
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,644
Tell me while my aunt isn't here.

218
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,979
You're being ridiculous.

219
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,983
ONE STORMY NIGHT

220
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,280
What is this?

221
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,449
I don't know. Why do you keep asking me?

222
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,745
They are storybooks.
Why are these at my place?

223
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,790
I know. You can't even read.

224
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:49,261
ONE STORMY NIGHT

225
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,559
I don't know anything,
and I don't have anything to say.

226
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,690
-What's wrong with me?
-How would I know?

227
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,442
I really have nothing to say.

228
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,575
What's going on?

229
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,244
I can...

230
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,414
read.

231
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,089
Mr. Joo.

232
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:27,841
Can you really

233
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,468
read that book?

234
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,345
Did I really get hit by lightning?

235
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,432
What happened to me?

236
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,576
He won't recognize it,
so I can wear it now.

237
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,333
Charm on.

238
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:07,714
All I need is this.
I'll be fine with this.

239
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,927
Tae Gong-sil.
You have a shelter around your neck.

240
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,393
My gosh.

241
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,582
Jung-won.

242
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,632
Why did you come to work?
I told you to rest at home.

243
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:36,636
You said my back was stabbed
by a huge screwdriver, right?

244
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,847
It must have worked magic.

245
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,184
I can now read with ease. Everything.

246
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,732
"Kingdom. We make
your special dreams come true."

247
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,943
I went past it all the time,
but I can finally read it.

248
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:59,242
But who wrote that phrase?
That is so tacky.

249
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,327
We should change it.

250
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,663
That is Mr. Do's style. Cover that up.

251
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:20,764
Gong-sil.

252
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,184
He can read now.

253
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,145
The trash bin man said he heard it.

254
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,646
Isn't that good?

255
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,483
It's such a relief.

256
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,111
You should come with me.

257
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:44,454
Mr. Kim, I can read
the documents myself now.

258
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,998
Your work will be reduced

259
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,751
to half, no, a tenth
of what you used to do.

260
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,169
I thought so.

261
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,381
You tried very hard to change.

262
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,091
-I did?
-Yes.

263
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:58,968
What is that?

264
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,596
GET WELL SOON
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF GIANT MALL

265
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,892
The president of Giant Mall sent it
to congratulate your recovery.

266
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:13,316
I don't get what's going on.

267
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:23,410
Is the president of Giant Mall and I
close enough to exchange flowers?

268
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,746
You recently played golf together.

269
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,705
Golf?

270
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,833
I can't believe this.

271
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,252
Since you're here,

272
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:37,715
tell me what to do
about your personal affairs.

273
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:41,970
What personal affairs?

274
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,932
The police would like
to give you an award.

275
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:46,850
To me?

276
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,518
Why?

277
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:54,607
Is it because I got hurt
trying to find the dead kid?

278
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:55,817
That's not all.

279
00:28:56,067 --> 00:29:00,780
You also persuaded an armed deserter
to give himself up.

280
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,323
They would like to thank you.

281
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,075
An armed deserter?

282
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,702
Yes, you did that.

283
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,913
That can't be me. Something must be wrong.

284
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,416
It must be Joo Jung-two or Joo Jung-three.

285
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,045
It's so not funny that it makes me laugh.

286
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,970
It was an awful joke, right?

287
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,890
It really was you. Joo Jung-won.

288
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,939
And you were planning to provide funds
to build a shelter for abused children.

289
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,649
We need your approval.

290
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:39,778
Hold on.

291
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,404
Did I say...

292
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,783
I would build a children's shelter?

293
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,037
Not an annex or a parking lot for Kingdom?

294
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,790
But a children's shelter?

295
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,083
Yes, that's what you said.

296
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,634
My aunt must be giving me
some kind of medication.

297
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,302
I must ask her what it is.

298
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,807
No, I should get my brain checked again.

299
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,267
Gosh.

300
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:18,983
Didn't you think it was strange
that I was doing such things?

301
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,612
Did the sun rise from the west

302
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,032
during the time I have no memory of?

303
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,116
I don't know.

304
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,538
Maybe a special sun
had been up around you.

305
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,550
That's strange.

306
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,011
Does Mr. Joo really not remember you?

307
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,806
No, he doesn't. Isn't it amazing?

308
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:55,228
I thought the lady was a fraud.
But she's really good.

309
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,021
Shouldn't you talk to him?

310
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,316
Mr. Joo is totally fine now.

311
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,945
It was unlucky he got hurt,
but it wasn't your fault.

312
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,157
Yes, I know what you mean.

313
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,702
But it made me come to my senses.

314
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:15,832
He said people who he can see
are scarier than ghosts he can't.

315
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:20,628
I was too scared of the things
that only I could see.

316
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,547
And then I met him.

317
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,677
I was so happy that I had a place to hide.

318
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,182
But I dragged him in
too deeply into my world.

319
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,895
I wasn't careful enough,

320
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,188
and I put him in danger.

321
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,610
I realized that I should be more careful.

322
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,989
I guess you have to lose something
to come to your senses.

323
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,824
That's not what I mean.

324
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,701
I know you really liked him.

325
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,121
What about your feelings?

326
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,333
I've sealed it up.

327
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:03,004
I still have my feelings,
so they are not gone.

328
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,007
So, I am okay.

329
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,385
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

330
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,435
I should go that way.

331
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,607
Why do I feel like I should go this way?

332
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,197
What?

333
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,123
SPECIAL CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER

334
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,710
This was just a storage room.

335
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:55,848
Who are you?

336
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,726
When did this become an office?

337
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,396
It's the Special Customer Service Center.

338
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,731
You made this office.

339
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,025
"Special Customer Service Center"?

340
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,572
Did I make such a useless thing?

341
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:18,997
Who are you?

342
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:20,790
"Kang Woo"?

343
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,126
You're the new head of security, right?

344
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,920
Mr. Do hired you
for your impressive work experience.

345
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:26,838
Right?

346
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:27,755
Yes.

347
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,133
And you are?

348
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,105
She's the employee
who works in this office.

349
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,692
She's quitting today,
so we're clearing her things.

350
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,486
Really?

351
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,411
Is there anything you want me to do?

352
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,455
No.

353
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,559
Did I keep something there?

354
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:23,895
My back hurts.

355
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,905
Leave your things.
I will bring them for you.

356
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,282
No, let's go home together.

357
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,117
It's okay.

358
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,119
There isn't much.

359
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,039
What kind of seal is so easy to open?

360
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,125
I know.

361
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:50,838
I can't let you go alone
when you look like you're going to cry.

362
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,424
I have Gong-sil.

363
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,054
Gong-sil gives me a lot of comfort.

364
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,984
I can read now.

365
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,571
So why do I have this stuffy feeling
in my chest?

366
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,665
Mr. Joo gave me this photo
before the incident.

367
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,211
Did his father meet him because of this?

368
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,295
Yes.

369
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:36,300
This photo was taken
a year after Cha Hui-ju died.

370
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,262
He asked me to find out
if Cha Hui-ju had a twin.

371
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,808
What do you think he wanted to do
by finding her?

372
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,936
After he met Ms. Tae,

373
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,772
I thought he was trying
to forget Cha Hui-ju.

374
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:51,607
Why...

375
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,319
was he trying to find Cha Hui-ju's twin?

376
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,947
There's something
that you don't know about.

377
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,116
Cha Hui-ju...

378
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,287
was the culprit of Mr. Joo's kidnap case.

379
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:07,832
What?

380
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,042
There's a high possibility

381
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,296
that the twin was an accomplice.

382
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:14,797
What?

383
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:17,675
"Accomplice"?

384
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,597
Are you okay?

385
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,643
You must be shocked.

386
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,565
Then...

387
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,737
Did Mr. Joo keep this from everyone
when he knew it?

388
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:41,532
He knew Cha Hui-ju was the culprit
from the beginning.

389
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,579
But he learned through this photo
about the twin

390
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,415
and that she might be an accomplice.

391
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,046
This woman could appear
before Mr. Joo again.

392
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,799
We must find this woman.

393
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,823
Hui-ju is the culprit,

394
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,702
and Hanna was the accomplice?

395
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:40,967
This can't be true.

396
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,179
Hanna was such a bright and kind child.

397
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,353
Congratulations on getting
into university.

398
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,272
Thank you, Uncle.

399
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,733
-Are your foster parents happy?
-Of course.

400
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,360
Right.

401
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,405
-I'm going to Korea.
-Korea?

402
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,491
You said that I have a twin sister.

403
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,910
I'm going to go and find my twin.

404
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,205
I've tried to find her
ever since I met you,

405
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,332
but I haven't been able to.

406
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,752
They say twins have a connection.

407
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,714
I might be able to find her if I go.

408
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,757
I'm going to find her.

409
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,135
Okay.

410
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,106
My sister died.

411
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,109
Why didn't you find her?
Why did you leave her all alone?

412
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,820
-Hanna...
-I hate you.

413
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,034
The dead girl's name is Cha Hui-ju.

414
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,910
Cha Hui-ju.

415
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,913
Unlike me,
who lived happily here in the UK,

416
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,791
she lived a miserable life.

417
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,879
Remember the name Cha Hui-ju.

418
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,132
And you should...

419
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,719
repent your whole life for her.

420
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,856
I must find Hanna.

421
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,408
It's an alarm that connects directly
to the police station.

422
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,871
If you press it when you're in danger,
the police will come.

423
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:38,167
You have to be careful
until they catch Mr. Joo's attacker.

424
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,045
I'll call often. You must answer my calls.

425
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,799
I will be careful.
I said I came to my senses.

426
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,968
I am going to protect you from now on.

427
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,183
Woo, I am really grateful.

428
00:39:55,851 --> 00:40:02,316
But I don't think
I should cling to other people anymore.

429
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,239
Not clinging is the way to protect others.

430
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:35,766
Why did you come here?

431
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,853
I didn't come to see you.
I came to see Tae Gong-sil.

432
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,980
I heard she doesn't work
at Kingdom anymore.

433
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,190
What did you come to say?

434
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,401
If you're here to tease her
about Mr. Joo, leave.

435
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,154
She's already in enough pain.

436
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,449
Mr. Joo really doesn't
remember anything about her?

437
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:57,037
His aunt asked me
not to mention Gong-sil to him.

438
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,915
That's why I came. Is it true, then?

439
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,759
You're ecstatic. I can't let you go.

440
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,845
Let me go!

441
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:17,433
I need to see others in pain
to feel better when I'm depressed.

442
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,979
Why do you hate her so much?

443
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,149
I used to hate her,
but I hate her more because you like her.

444
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,817
Stop liking her.

445
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,820
If you don't, I will follow her around
and keep bullying her.

446
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:34,158
If you don't want that,
you should stop liking her.

447
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,160
You're really something.

448
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,871
You're really like that whale.
Something that doesn't exist.

449
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:40,789
What?

450
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,125
There are no black-whiskered whales?

451
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,795
There are whales with white whiskers,
but there are no black-whiskered whales.

452
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,255
Really?

453
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:52,551
I'm sure I saw a whale
that had black whiskers.

454
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,304
Was it a seal, then?

455
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,516
Wait.

456
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,560
Did you remember
what I said and look it up?

457
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:05,314
Yes, I looked it up to figure out
how to understand you.

458
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,273
But it didn't exist.

459
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:07,983
Why?

460
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,444
Are you thinking of keeping the whale?

461
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,821
I told you. I don't do things like that.

462
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,407
You don't have to take care
of the whale at all.

463
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:19,787
You don't have to feed me
or provide me with oxygen.

464
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,705
I will do well on my own.

465
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:25,376
And I'm going to become so big
that you can't get rid of me.

466
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,880
I wonder if I look like you to her.

467
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,302
Why? Do you think it's unsightly?

468
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:36,971
No.

469
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:38,639
It's amazing.

470
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,517
Amazing?

471
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,477
You're being confident, and not begging.

472
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,647
-I really respect that.
-Really?

473
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,485
Yes, you gave me some encouragement.

474
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,363
Until now, I was feeling sorry for myself.

475
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,615
I should become more like you.

476
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:00,995
Are you saying you'll do
the same thing I did to Tae Gong-sil?

477
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,706
Yes, thank you.
I learned another thing from you.

478
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,002
Hey!

479
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,051
Did I just encourage Woo?

480
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:22,641
I can't let Woo cling to Gong-sil
like I did to him.

481
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,313
I am Dooly.

482
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,940
I do not exist on Earth.

483
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:31,692
Dooly?

484
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:38,490
I am so special that I can grow up well,
even without your attention.

485
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:43,370
And I am going to grow
into a big dinosaur one day.

486
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,623
Woo.

487
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,541
Gong-sil.

488
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,319
I can't let Gong-sil have Dooly.

489
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,365
What should I do?

490
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,582
I told you I would introduce you. This is
Hanna, the girl you saw at the hospital.

491
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,668
She helped me that day.

492
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:36,340
I don't think Mr. Joo
likes having strangers in his house.

493
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:47,643
Aunt.

494
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,480
These books were here. Were they mine?

495
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,775
If they were here, they must be yours.

496
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:58,195
It was this book that made you realize
you can read.

497
00:44:58,862 --> 00:44:59,822
Try to remember.

498
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,535
It's something connected
to someone special to you...

499
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,705
"Someone special"?

500
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,166
Was there someone special to me?

501
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:12,418
These...

502
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,129
are my books.

503
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,551
I was introduced to your cleaning lady.

504
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,262
I think I left them here that day.

505
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:27,349
That's right. Hanna brought them here.

506
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,893
They are storybooks for kids,
but I like the story,

507
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,439
and the illustrations are pretty.
I really treasure these books.

508
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,777
Are these the first books you read
after you woke up?

509
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,321
That makes me feel happy.

510
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,287
You said Hanna
was the first person you saw

511
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,746
when you woke up.

512
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,916
You two must have some sort of connection.

513
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,343
ONE STORMY NIGHT

514
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,267
I'm even reading books these days.

515
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,979
There are a total of six books.
My brain is getting fried because of them.

516
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,483
They said he can read now.

517
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,527
What a relief.

518
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,533
ONE STORMY NIGHT

519
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,584
TAE I-RYEONG

520
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,464
Hi, is that you?

521
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,884
Yes, there's something I need to tell you.

522
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,970
Remember the restaurant
we had the reunion at?

523
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,223
Yes, meet me there.

524
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,021
They had that cheesy moment there.

525
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,233
He will probably remember something
if he sees her there.

526
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,155
I don't want things to work out well
between Gong-sil and Mr. Joo, though.

527
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,493
What's so important
that I must come out so late?

528
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,875
You have important information
about Giant Mall?

529
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,003
Wait. I'll be right there.

530
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,134
Tae I-ryeong.

531
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,428
Tae...

532
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,181
Something comes after the Tae.

533
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,954
ONE STORMY NIGHT

534
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:02,796
Oh, my gosh.

535
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:10,470
Are you okay?

536
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,859
Don't take this the wrong way.
I was just stopping you from falling.

537
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,823
I was standing here because of the book.

538
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,826
It's the same book I'm reading.
That's why I noticed it.

539
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,373
I know it's strange to say this.

540
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:42,002
Didn't you feel a tingle just now?
A really strong one.

541
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:45,839
No.

542
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,565
Did it seem like I was hitting on her?

543
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,493
You lost your memory,

544
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,621
but you're still my shelter.

545
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,721
I'm sure I felt a tingle.

546
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,348
What was that?

547
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:59,746
I feel like something like this
happened before.

548
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:10,799
Mr. Joo.

549
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,095
I have some personal matters to attend to.

550
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,264
I would like to take a few days off.

551
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,143
It's the first time in 15 years

552
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,521
you're taking time off.

553
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:29,276
You can read now,
so I don't have to be with you.

554
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:33,155
You no longer need
a recorder or a decoder.

555
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,908
You're not a recorder or a decoder.

556
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,327
Those are what you requested of me
in the beginning.

557
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:43,248
"Just be my recorder and decoder."

558
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,376
You still remember
what a 19-year-old told you?

559
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:51,423
You have to continue
to stay by my side, Mr. Kim.

560
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:58,513
Ms. Ahn, who works under Mr. Do,
will help you out while I am away.

561
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,559
Okay. Go get some rest.

562
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:03,935
Where are you going?

563
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,270
I'm going to the UK.

564
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,648
I'm going to find my niece
that I haven't seen in a long time.

565
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,401
Mr. Joo.

566
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,906
There's something I must tell you
when I get back.

567
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:20,410
I hope you're not going to try
to run away from me.

568
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,622
Like I told you, I won't let that happen.

569
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:24,915
Okay.

570
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,917
Get some rest while you're there.

571
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,684
Cheer up, Gong-sil.

572
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:48,688
Han-ju said he'll recommend you
for a much better job.

573
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,774
You are not someone

574
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:54,194
who should be rotting away
in a storage room.

575
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,739
-You're right.
-You went to a good school.

576
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,950
And you're a great tennis player.

577
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,160
You even won various art and music awards.

578
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,454
And I heard you can speak French.

579
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,873
You're pretty and cute.

580
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,794
You're tall, too. There's just so much.
Anyway, you're a great person.

581
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:11,878
Well...

582
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,173
But how do you know so much about me?

583
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,758
I know.

584
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,261
I never told him stuff like that.

585
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,391
The big mouth at work
told everyone about it.

586
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,350
"Big mouth"?

587
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,520
There's someone
who keeps talking about you.

588
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:32,858
Han-ju's going to find who it is.
And I'm going to kill that person.

589
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,359
Yes, we're going to kill that person.

590
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,239
Could you give me your résumé first?

591
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,619
Let me take a look.

592
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,789
RÉSUMÉ

593
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:52,586
There's a part for medical history.

594
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,254
You have to write it in detail.

595
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,464
I heard you were in an accident before.

596
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:02,220
Please write the cause of the accident
and the after-effects in detail.

597
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,848
If they're so picky,
she won't apply there.

598
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,100
I agree with her.

599
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,936
I can't lie about it,
so I shouldn't apply.

600
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,648
Thanks for the offer. I should go.

601
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,566
Go.

602
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,694
You could just write it briefly.

603
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:22,866
Gong-sil has some things
she can't really talk about.

604
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,785
If she causes any trouble at her new job,

605
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,622
you could be in an awkward position
for recommending her.

606
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:33,919
Let's forget about this.
I'll buy you dinner tonight.

607
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,337
-Okay.
-See you.

608
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,802
I have to get that information
to get expense reimbursement.

609
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,138
I am in so much trouble.

610
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,062
Oh, my. I am sorry.

611
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,398
Your necklace is very pretty.

612
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,444
Your nephew's girlfriend
isn't Tae I-ryeong

613
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,363
but Tae Gong-sil?

614
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:04,074
Tae Gong-sil. Tae, as in the sun.

615
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,201
Is it the shape of the sun?

616
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,787
Yes. Thank you.

617
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:12,832
Oh, my.

618
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:14,960
Cha Hui-ju.

619
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,851
I'm sure it was Cha Hui-ju.

620
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,608
That woman...

621
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,195
Why did she suddenly
call out Cha Hui-ju's name?

622
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,753
About Hanna, the woman
we introduced to you...

623
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,090
-It hurts there.
-I'm sorry.

624
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,427
It turns out that she's a famous curator.

625
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:11,307
She said she can plan the exhibition
of a famous artist this fall.

626
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,684
So I told her to come.

627
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,520
Did you say she came from the UK?

628
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,230
She was born and raised in the UK.

629
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:20,567
And she lived in LA,
New York, and Beijing.

630
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:24,029
Her family is very rich,
and she's very smart, too.

631
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,908
Ms. Hanna is here to see you.

632
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,455
Welcome.

633
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,087
This is Ms. Hanna.

634
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:50,889
What's wrong?

635
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,975
It's nothing. Please come sit.

636
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:03,359
So, Cha Hui-ju
is still lingering around Mr. Joo?

637
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:05,278
Yes, I saw her.

638
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,365
I heard he's looking
into Cha Hui-ju again.

639
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,409
Do you know how it's going?

640
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,660
Tae Gong-sil.

641
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:17,373
Are you still worried about Mr. Joo?

642
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,626
I can see Hui-ju.

643
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:23,296
So I want to take care
of this matter for him.

644
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:28,551
We have some information
about Cha Hui-ju's accomplice.

645
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,346
We might be able to catch the accomplice.

646
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:32,680
Really?

647
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,850
Once the kidnapper is caught,
everything will be solved.

648
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:41,314
Mr. Joo doesn't remember you at all,

649
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:44,567
so he doesn't know
that you can see spirits.

650
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:50,115
Even if you see Hui-ju,
you won't be able to tell him.

651
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,743
He won't believe you.

652
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:56,996
I guess so.

653
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,797
It's been 15 years.

654
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:09,008
I thought you would never return
to the UK.

655
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,887
I came because there's someone
I need to find.

656
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,891
Do you remember my niece?

657
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,060
Hanna.

658
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,104
Hanna Brown.

659
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:25,066
My father is British,
and my mother is Korean.

660
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,193
Actually...

661
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,904
I was adopted.

662
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,368
I was adopted,
but I know who my parents were

663
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:40,707
and why I had to be adopted
instead of getting raised by them.

664
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,877
I met my uncle.

665
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,211
Really?

666
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,881
My parents were poor artists.

667
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,049
They died in an accident.

668
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:55,013
And I was adopted
because I had no relatives to go to.

669
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:58,600
I found Hanna, who was adopted in the UK.

670
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,519
But I couldn't find her twin.

671
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,107
Hanna had grown up well
in a wealthy family.

672
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:10,570
But Hui-ju, who was left in Korea,
wasn't able to have that.

673
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,369
I thought she grew up in loneliness
and died in pain.

674
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,705
Hanna and Hui-ju.

675
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,291
I don't know what happened

676
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,711
when the two girls met together.

677
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,217
These are the kids.

678
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:36,387
They tried to take toys
in exchange for your business cards.

679
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,185
KINGDOM
JOO JUNG-WON

680
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,521
These are mine.

681
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,403
They said I was funding
a children's shelter.

682
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,197
Are you from there?

683
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:58,117
You came to the building we live in
and gave those to us.

684
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:03,540
You said we can take anything from Kingdom
if we bring those.

685
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:06,042
I'm not one to give
my business cards to you.

686
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,800
Let them take the toys they are holding.

687
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:14,717
But...

688
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,762
make sure you give them
financial education before they go.

689
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,684
We read for you.

690
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,311
You said you were someone special.

691
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:31,693
"Someone special"?

692
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:36,906
You said you were someone special
to Gong-sil.

693
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,202
I'm special to who?

694
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,704
Gong-sil.

695
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:46,583
Tae Gong-sil, who lives in our building.

696
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,086
Tae Gong-sil...

697
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,839
who lives in your building?

698
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,599
Who is it?

699
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:11,816
Cha Hui-ju?

700
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,199
You love Jung-won, right?

701
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:27,248
If you care for him,
please lend me your body.

702
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:42,847
Mr. Kang.

703
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:48,936
That woman is the one Ms. Joo
is trying to get Mr. Joo to marry.

704
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,147
This time it seems quite serious.

705
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,192
I heard she lives in the same
apartment complex as Mr. Joo.

706
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:56,736
In the same apartment complex?

707
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,073
She lives alone in such a big house.
She must be really rich.

708
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,449
And her parents live in the UK.

709
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:05,745
Have dinner with us. I'll call Jung-won.

710
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:06,954
Shall I?

711
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:13,419
I think my nephew looks at you
differently from other women.

712
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,380
What do you think?

713
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,924
I like him, too.

714
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:23,429
Then, can I be straightforward and ask you
about something that's bothering me?

715
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:29,102
What was Tae Gong-sil's
relationship with Mr. Joo?

716
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:33,064
It's true that she was
quite close to Jung-won.

717
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:37,985
She got close to him by using his weakness
about a dead girl.

718
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,487
The girl called Hui-ju?

719
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:44,242
Did Tae Gong-sil know Hui-ju?

720
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,035
Of course not.

721
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:52,166
She said she has to call on the ghost
of Hui-ju to heal his wound or something.

722
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,128
She is someone who talks rubbish.

723
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,170
You're right.

724
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,715
How can she call on the dead?

725
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:03,052
It doesn't make any sense at all.

726
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:04,846
Let's go.

727
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:14,897
Are you...

728
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:18,651
asking me to let you use my body?

729
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,406
Can't I tell him instead of you?

730
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:30,496
Then...

731
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,999
can you catch the kidnapper?

732
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,184
"One stormy night."

733
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,436
It's the code they say
to recognize each other.

734
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,480
You know me, right? Who are you?

735
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,443
Are you Tae Gong-sil?

736
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,917
