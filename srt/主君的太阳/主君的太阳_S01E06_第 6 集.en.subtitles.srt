1
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,438
I'll muster up my courage.

2
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,815
So you should cheer up.

3
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,447
Woo!

4
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,039
Woo!

5
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:46,838
I found the strength to come tell you
about my secret.

6
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,883
Tell me. I'll be brave and listen.

7
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,217
I...

8
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,346
I can see ghosts.

9
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,768
Ghosts here, ghosts there, and there.

10
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,353
Ghosts come out from all directions.

11
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,398
That's why I was running away
from things like a crazy woman.

12
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,443
Is that okay with you?

13
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,370
Even if you say
that you were abducted by aliens...

14
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,415
I don't care

15
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,088
Woo!

16
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,958
Maybe something
as amazing can really happen.

17
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:27,438
You must realize
that the chance of success is very low.

18
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,233
It's not totally impossible.

19
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,698
I saw a crazy man who said he had been
abducted by aliens at a hospital.

20
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:42,120
He met a woman who understands him
and lives in a fort on a mountain.

21
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,834
Are you looking down on someone
who sees aliens when you see ghosts?

22
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,169
He called me crazy first.

23
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,423
I listened to all
of his alien stories at first.

24
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,968
And I was going to go
with him to take UFO photos.

25
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,639
I thought we became friends, so I told
him I see ghosts and he called me crazy.

26
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,394
You must feel so wronged.
I feel very sorry.

27
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,064
If you had gone with him
and got abducted by aliens,

28
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,984
you wouldn't be in front of me right now.

29
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:17,739
I guess if there are ghosts,
then there could be aliens, too.

30
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,075
It could have been very dangerous, right?

31
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,161
No, this isn't right.

32
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,999
This should be a joke, but with you
it gets serious, and I feel foolish.

33
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,751
Why am I listening to this?

34
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,045
Do you think he'll listen, too?

35
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,048
Will he listen to me, just like you?

36
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,805
I don't want to lose this chance
that was so hard to get.

37
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,768
I never thought that I would find romance.

38
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,187
I'm so happy that this is happening.

39
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,981
Don't say you see them.
Start by asking if he believes in them.

40
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,483
What?

41
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,610
Don't scare him by telling him
about the ghosts.

42
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,529
Ask if he believes in them.
Make him curious about it.

43
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,867
Then the chance of your dream
coming true will increase.

44
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,454
I'll keep that in mind.
Thank you, Mr. Joo.

45
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:10,166
In the future,
talk about the crazy stuff with Mr. Kang.

46
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,003
Go and make it work out with Sweet Kang.

47
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,923
-Get lost.
-Okay.

48
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,304
She must be excited.

49
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,517
She usually leaves only after
I tell her to get lost three times.

50
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,770
Mr. Joo.

51
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,566
What? I told you to leave. What is it?

52
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,237
Thanks for hearing me out
and not mocking me.

53
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,947
I didn't try to hear you out.

54
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,199
I just heard because I have ears.

55
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,369
You can tell me things
you can't tell other people, too.

56
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,621
I will listen to them.

57
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,958
I have nothing to tell you.
I'm going to work. Get lost.

58
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,626
Okay.

59
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,879
Mr. Joo.

60
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,924
What?

61
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,261
Are you listening to music while you work?

62
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,098
-No.
-What is it, then?

63
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:11,561
I have nothing to say to you.
Please get lost!

64
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,229
Okay.

65
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,110
I always have to tell her
to get lost three times.

66
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,907
If she sticks close
to the sticky, sweet Kang...

67
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,994
she won't bother me.

68
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,624
What should I start with? Ghosts? No.

69
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,835
Spirits? Apparitions?

70
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:37,962
What would be the best?

71
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,010
My gosh.

72
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,554
Oh, my gosh.

73
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,723
It was a prank.

74
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:53,603
-Are you okay?
-I told you not to surprise her.

75
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,022
My gosh.

76
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,950
Why did you suddenly want to come here
and why did you have to startle her?

77
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,535
I was startled, too.

78
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,287
I'm really sorry.

79
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,457
You suddenly appeared,
so I thought you weren't human.

80
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,751
Did you think I was a ghost, then?

81
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:21,005
It's not like that. She's always anxious
because she has a stalker.

82
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,425
So, that's why she looked
like she saw a ghost.

83
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,803
My gosh. A ghost?

84
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:31,140
-Who sees such things?
-Why? I have.

85
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,935
Shall I tell you
about the ghosts I've seen?

86
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:34,977
Don't.

87
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,481
Why are you doing it
to someone who's scared?

88
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,484
No. It's okay.

89
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,363
Please tell us.
What ghosts have you seen before?

90
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,073
Hey, what are you doing?

91
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,117
What should I start with?

92
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:53,996
Elevator ghosts, bathroom ghosts
and ghosts I saw in the military.

93
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:02,171
Mr. Do, just like Lee Han-ju said, she
is living in the same place as Mr. Kang.

94
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,926
And this is a really rundown place.

95
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,888
Keep an eye on them. Okay.

96
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:17,145
A rundown place?
So, Mr. Joo opened up his body,

97
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,188
but not his wallet?

98
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:22,942
If that's true, it means
he doesn't have feelings for her.

99
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:27,488
I hope he's not opening up
to Tae I-ryeong.

100
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:33,119
The highest building in Garosu-gil
belongs to my grandfather.

101
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,998
You said your mother
is the only daughter, right?

102
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,751
Yes, and I'm an only daughter, too.

103
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,714
So, that means the building
is going to be yours, right?

104
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,805
I was going to keep it short,
but let's have a full course meal.

105
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,975
Let's have a very long meal.

106
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,394
Excuse me!

107
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:05,067
The worst ghost was the ghost
with only a head that moves like this.

108
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,738
The worst ghost I heard about
was the one that hops around.

109
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,740
There's nothing worse than that.

110
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,369
The school statue that sheds tears
of blood at midnight is the worst.

111
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,873
I couldn't study at night
after school because of that.

112
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,960
-We had one at our school, too.
-Did you have a mirror ghost, too?

113
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:28,090
The ghost of a kid
who was always in second place.

114
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:33,012
There was a kid who was always
in second place at piano competitions.

115
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,972
She'd always play...

116
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,891
-"Für Elise!"
-"Für Elise!"

117
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:47,068
Don't you like
these kinds of stories, Woo?

118
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,156
-No, it's no fun for me.
-Aren't you just scared?

119
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,992
Look at how his lettuce is shaking.

120
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:01,958
I heard that if you talk about ghosts,
a ghost nearby will come and listen.

121
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,334
-No.
-What?

122
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,546
There is one here already.

123
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,010
Over there. Behind you, Han-ju.

124
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,267
-Hey.
-Please stop.

125
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,771
I hate these kinds of stories.
Why are you being so foolish?

126
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,651
We're just having fun.
Are you scared they might be true?

127
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,319
I don't think such things exist.

128
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,491
I hate it when people
scare others with these talks.

129
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,829
People who say
that they have seen ghosts...

130
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,623
are so pathetic and I hate them.

131
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:53,801
He hates it.

132
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,679
Don't ever tell him.

133
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,440
Oh, my gosh.

134
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,697
Why do they keep talking
about ghosts? It's scary.

135
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,993
Let me call my husband for a minute.

136
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,790
Please eat.

137
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,877
Meeting me here must have been
a surprise for you.

138
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:28,836
Not at all.

139
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,590
My aunt prepares these things
and I attend them when I can.

140
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,010
Isn't it a little uncomfortable
to be here with me?

141
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,929
-I'm Gong-sil's friend.
-Not at all.

142
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:44,310
You two seemed quite close,
so I was hesitant to come.

143
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,980
I feel better
since you say you don't mind.

144
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,940
You shouldn't have worried about that.

145
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,861
If that's the case,
let me tell you something.

146
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,573
I heard Gong-sil
is a little sick in the head.

147
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,660
You don't know
what she was like in the past.

148
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,953
She used to be normal.

149
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:07,458
She must have gone through
something bad to have changed like that.

150
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:11,504
-Isn't it bad luck to have--
-Tae I-ryeong.

151
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,131
Did you come here to...

152
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:20,054
put Tae Gong-sil on a plate...

153
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,099
and slice her into pieces?

154
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:25,976
No.

155
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,979
Then let's keep talking
about the property you mentioned.

156
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,400
I was interested in the resort
your uncle is working on.

157
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,403
Oh, yes. The land belongs to my father.

158
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,613
So, it's sort of a family business.

159
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,115
Where shall we go next?

160
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,743
I should arrive
before the last course. All right.

161
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,833
Mr. Joo is spending
a lot of time with Tae I-ryeong.

162
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,553
What is that?

163
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,190
SPECIAL CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER

164
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,233
Is it coming from there?

165
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,696
GHOST ROOM

166
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:43,929
What was that?

167
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,720
There was a dog. A dog.

168
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,722
There's a huge dog in Kingdom right now.

169
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,557
Are you okay, honey?

170
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,518
How is there a dog inside this building?

171
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,562
I alerted the security team,
so they should find what was there.

172
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,190
I told you, it was a dog. I heard it, too.

173
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,787
We have to catch it
before the mall opens tomorrow.

174
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,581
Partner up in pairs
and check out your assigned areas.

175
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:53,707
Yes, sir!

176
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,310
Was there really a dog in here?

177
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,730
I don't keep dogs in here.

178
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:20,860
Mr. Do was bitten in here.
Gosh, we were enjoying the food.

179
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,612
-Look if anything is missing.
-Okay.

180
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,493
Who did this?
Was there really a dog in here?

181
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,453
Did you bring it in?

182
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,373
Mr. Joo.

183
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:39,169
You bring in ghosts.
Did you bring in a dog this time?

184
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,713
No.

185
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,050
What is this smell?
Do you keep meat in here?

186
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,344
Is that why the dog came in here?

187
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,931
You really have a good nose.

188
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,309
I was having a barbecue with Woo.

189
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,813
My lollipop. Where did it go?

190
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,733
Did the dog eat it?

191
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,153
Here it is.

192
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,488
I found it.

193
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,992
It's broken.

194
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,036
Oh, no.

195
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,298
Isn't this a dog collar?

196
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,928
There really must be a dog in here.

197
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,473
I was having dinner with Mr. Joo
and came because I was curious.

198
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,516
Things must be going as planned.

199
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,563
I had a long talk
about what you're interested in.

200
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,651
But Tae Gong-sil
doesn't seem to mean much to him.

201
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,278
I mentioned her and he cut me off.

202
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,199
There must be a reason
he gave her a job to keep her close.

203
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,036
Why are you so interested
in Mr. Joo and Tae Gong-sil?

204
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,877
Are you asking because
you really have feelings for Gong-sil?

205
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,213
Let's say that I am.

206
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,676
I think things will work out for me, too.
I'll let you know if I need help.

207
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,095
You'll have to work late
to catch that dog.

208
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,639
Do you get extra pay? How much?

209
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,685
Your car's in the basement parking lot,
right? You can take that elevator.

210
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,355
What are you talking about?
You should escort me to my car.

211
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,898
I have to catch the dog to get extra pay.

212
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,608
You should go.

213
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,531
He has no manners.

214
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,713
The dog bit a man, so it'd be dangerous
to let it wander around.

215
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,799
If we can't find it tonight,
we can't open the mall tomorrow.

216
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,969
Then the summer festival I invested in
will have to be canceled, too.

217
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,847
I made it so people
would come and spend money.

218
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,808
This wretched dog
is going to keep people away.

219
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,271
He ate my snacks
and the kimbap that I left.

220
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,440
I think it must be hungry.

221
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,735
Right.

222
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,321
What are you going to do?

223
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:16,326
Mr. Joo, do you think Pilseung
on that tag is the name of the dog?

224
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,954
PILSEUNG

225
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,497
I think so.

226
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,834
Mr. Joo, let's catch the dog,
so you can have the summer festival.

227
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,462
I will find him for you. This Pilseung!

228
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,633
Pilseung.

229
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,970
Where are you, Pilseung?

230
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:36,930
What are you doing?

231
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:42,227
I thought you had a great plan.
Are you luring it with two sausages?

232
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,315
This is what dogs like the most.

233
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,983
Never mind. Just go home.

234
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,860
Let me try a little, Mr. Joo.

235
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,447
Excuse me,

236
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,951
did you happen to see a dog?

237
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,079
Okay.

238
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,499
What did you just do?

239
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,044
There's a man who always sits there
and goes through the garbage.

240
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:11,215
-There's something over there?
-He looks really scary.

241
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,300
His mouth is ripped like this
and his eyes are--

242
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,594
What if he hears you?
How can you say that?

243
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,848
I have you, so it's okay.

244
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:28,232
And there's a lady who always stays
in the bathroom over there.

245
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,942
Shall I go ask her, too?

246
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,903
You've made a lot
of ghost friends in here.

247
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:37,199
There are ghosts who stay
in one spot and don't leave.

248
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,286
I was really scared at first
but I feel bad for them, too.

249
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,373
And now that I'm used to them,
they sort of feel like colleagues.

250
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,292
So, do you have team dinners as well?

251
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,003
How can you make such a scary joke?

252
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,047
It would be scary if they were together.

253
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:57,302
Team dinners should be done
with people, like today.

254
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,763
And it's about talking and laughing.

255
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,726
But it was ruined
because we started talking about ghosts.

256
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,271
Tae Gong-sil.

257
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,024
I smell something.

258
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:15,028
You weren't able to tell
Sweet Kang about the ghosts, right?

259
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,909
Woo said he hates ghosts
the most in the world.

260
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,664
And he hates people who say there
are ghosts. What should I do?

261
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,709
Why are you asking me? I hate them, too.

262
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,670
I'm only keeping you by my side
because you're useful.

263
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:38,260
Okay, I should make myself useful
and help Woo find the dog.

264
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,096
I will try the bathroom.

265
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,348
Please stay here. Wait for me.

266
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,230
I'm not a dog waiting for his owner.
I'm not going to wait.

267
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,695
If it has a leash, it must have an owner.

268
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,822
Is the owner here, too?

269
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,580
There's a man running away towards Area A.

270
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,799
The bathroom lady said she didn't see it.

271
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,093
Should I ask the storage man?

272
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,659
-Did you lose him?
-He went outside.

273
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,746
-That was strange.
-Why? What is it?

274
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,625
Didn't Hyeong-cheol
from the service center join the military?

275
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,252
Hyeong-cheol? Yes. Why?

276
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,339
No, I must be mistaken.

277
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,718
Are you okay? Can you get up?

278
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,392
I have no strength in my legs.

279
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,395
I think I hurt my back, too.

280
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,577
Let's go see a doctor. Get up.

281
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,782
We had one of our men
take Tae I-ryeong to a hospital.

282
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,826
We also contacted the police.

283
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,121
Check if any stores were affected
before tomorrow.

284
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,581
What about the dog? Was there no dog?

285
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,375
Did the thief bring the dog?

286
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,212
We checked the security feed
and he came alone, without a dog.

287
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:46,508
You must have been
bitten by the thief, not a dog.

288
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,344
Isn't that a relief, honey?

289
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,972
You won't have to get a rabies shot.

290
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,266
It hurts.

291
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,271
Mr. Joo. You should come with me.

292
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,448
-What is it?
-There's a dog here, Mr. Joo.

293
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,909
-It was a thief.
-There was a dog, too.

294
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,744
It's here.

295
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,292
-There's a dog here?
-Yes.

296
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,089
There really is a dog.

297
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,722
It's a good-looking German Shepherd.

298
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,349
Stay down.

299
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,269
You understand what I'm saying.

300
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:40,937
Hand.

301
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,524
He's so smart. He understands everything.

302
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:49,905
Did that dog come in
with the thief to steal something?

303
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,326
I don't know.
I think he was with the thief.

304
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:58,371
He saw me when the thief
ran away and followed me.

305
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,124
So, is this his dog collar?

306
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,667
Pilseung.

307
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,547
It must be right.
He's answering to the name.

308
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,715
He's barking.

309
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,762
PILSEUNG

310
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,139
There's the same collar around his neck.

311
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:21,061
If he brought this around with him,
he must have been fond of the dog.

312
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:25,148
The whereabouts of the soldier
who ran away two days ago is unknown.

313
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,317
Yoo Jun-gun will report more on this.

314
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,616
Pilseung. What am I going to do?

315
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,291
I think the dog wants me to come with him.

316
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,001
I should follow him.

317
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:53,426
If you hold me, he disappears.
I have to go after him.

318
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,970
Where do you think you're going?

319
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,138
Tae I-ryeong is at the hospital
because he harmed her.

320
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,266
You might get hurt. How can you go there?

321
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,685
We reported it to the police.
They will catch him soon.

322
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,271
Take the dog to him when he's caught.

323
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:08,233
Don't you think there's a reason
Pilseung followed me, not him?

324
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,111
It would help if I catch the thief, right?

325
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,823
You must have lost your mind
trying to impress Sweet Kang.

326
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,118
He's a criminal.
You can't go. It's dangerous.

327
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,957
Don't look at me like that. I said no.

328
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,209
Just do as I tell you to.

329
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,463
I think I was mistaken about you.

330
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,593
I thought you'd tell me to go
after the dog and catch the thief.

331
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:43,727
Did you say you'd catch the thief
to get on my good side?

332
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,356
Thank you for worrying about me.

333
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,487
That's 100,000 won.

334
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,991
Nothing is for free.
I'll take it out of your salary.

335
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,952
You said you'd give me a discount.

336
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,205
Okay, 50,000 won.

337
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,886
I looked again,
but no dog is on the videos.

338
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,722
Mr. Do must be mistaken.
He was bitten by the thief.

339
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,683
-So, there is no dog?
-No.

340
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,358
Gong-sil.

341
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,198
What is that?

342
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:39,991
What?

343
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,329
I heard I-ryeong was hurt.

344
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,624
No, she was just in shock, not hurt.

345
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,753
But what did you see, Gong-sil?

346
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,964
-What?
-I saw you talking to Mr. Joo.

347
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,342
Didn't you say you saw a dog?

348
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,470
No one else saw it and it wasn't
on the security footage, either.

349
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,348
So, what did you see?

350
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,184
Well, actually...

351
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,063
People who say
that they have seen ghosts...

352
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,899
are so pathetic and I hate them.

353
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,404
Did you really see a dog?

354
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,701
No, I couldn't have seen
what no one else did.

355
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,538
So, what were you telling Mr. Joo you saw?

356
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,585
Mr. Joo asked me to find someone for him.

357
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:37,298
I was saying that I think
I saw that person in here.

358
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:43,304
I was just telling him
that I saw someone here, not a dog.

359
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,056
You must have heard wrong.

360
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,393
Let's say I'm mistaken.

361
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,770
What did you just hide from me?

362
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,897
Am I mistaken about that, too?

363
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,693
What story are you going to make up
about that?

364
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,119
It was broken. I'm sorry.

365
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,456
You gave this to me.

366
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,584
I am so sorry.

367
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,726
He was hiding in Tae Gong-sil's office,
but he wasn't after Mr. Joo.

368
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,272
Yes, I'll keep watching.

369
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,365
Sweet love...

370
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,427
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

371
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,180
I'm sorry, Woo.

372
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,934
I'm sorry for getting mad
when you were talking about ghosts.

373
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,978
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you hated them.

374
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,606
I'm sorry for talking about ghosts.

375
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:17,690
I don't hate them.

376
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,860
I'm scared of them.

377
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,531
Are you that scared of ghosts?

378
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,493
I saw a lot of people
die horribly in the army.

379
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:33,706
I even got counseling
because I had nightmares.

380
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,085
I see.

381
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,294
So

382
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,130
it's hard to endure it if I think

383
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,925
such things are around me.

384
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,553
There aren't any.

385
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,597
There is nothing next to you.

386
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,641
There is nothing at all.

387
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,269
You can trust me. I am sure about it.

388
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,480
I'll trust you.

389
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,193
Don't put too much meaning
in the broken lollipop.

390
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,862
That's how you're supposed to eat it.

391
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,406
Since it's broken, let's eat it now.

392
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,324
Shall we?

393
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,164
It's broken in half. Let's have half each.

394
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,598
It's sweet.

395
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,513
Are you Pilseung?

396
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:38,498
Why am I seeing a dancing dog ghost?

397
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,089
What? Is this a dream?

398
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,353
I had a silly dream.

399
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,157
Is it because of this?

400
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,327
I don't want to think
about Pilseung anymore.

401
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,539
I might see things that others can't see.

402
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:24,043
But if I pretend I don't,
I can live a normal life.

403
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,504
I don't care how you live.

404
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,715
But that dog appeared in my dream.

405
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,300
Maybe it was just a silly dream.

406
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,107
Oh, my gosh. That's amazing.

407
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,485
Pilseung is dancing
and he's wagging his tail.

408
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,404
I think he really likes this song.

409
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,530
That's right.

410
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,615
It must be the dog from my dream.

411
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,286
I never want to dream
of a dancing dog again.

412
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,041
Here. Give it back to the dog's owner.

413
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,461
And send the dog away.

414
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,006
You said it was dangerous and stopped me.

415
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,300
I want to pretend I didn't see it.
I don't want to see it.

416
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:25,813
Go after the dog. I will come with you.

417
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,941
You're close to that dog.

418
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,834
They're tickets for a musical.

419
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:51,214
They're VVIP seats
that no salary man could afford.

420
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,966
It's a reward for yesterday.

421
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,468
It's for today.

422
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,596
It begins at nine,
so having dinner at eight would be good.

423
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,223
And then some coffee will be nice.

424
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:01,933
Okay.

425
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,228
Hey. We have to decide where to meet.

426
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,730
-Why should I do that with you?
-I said it's a reward.

427
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:11,984
Not the tickets.
Me going with you is the reward.

428
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,822
If I refuse to go with you,
are you going to take them back?

429
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:22,203
It didn't seem right to just give you
tickets, so I was offering to go with you.

430
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,747
This is enough.
I'll go with whoever I want to.

431
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,499
Thanks.

432
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,085
Sure, bye.

433
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,589
He has such bad manners.

434
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,345
Let's go, Pilseung.

435
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,765
Why did you appear in that dream?

436
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,683
What do you mean?

437
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,895
What appeared a dream?

438
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:54,694
A scene in a movie that I saw
keeps appearing in my dreams.

439
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,070
Do you like movies?

440
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,614
Then, do you like musicals, too?

441
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,910
I get off early today.
Let's watch a musical together.

442
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,871
I'd love to.

443
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,500
But I can't stay for long in dark places.

444
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:14,088
I could scream
and suddenly run out of there.

445
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,299
This isn't a scary musical.

446
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,302
And if you're scared,
you can always hold me.

447
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,723
I'll try. I will try it.

448
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,185
It starts at nine.
Meet me in front of the building at eight.

449
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,360
Let's go.

450
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,866
It's so hot but we can't take the car.

451
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,827
Why do I have to follow a dog
I can't even see?

452
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,997
You said you're scared he'll appear again.
Shall we just give up?

453
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:50,875
Let's go.

454
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,795
Mr. Joo, Pilseung's going that way.
Where are you going?

455
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,589
Do you think I can I see it?

456
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,091
I can't see it.
Why are you getting mad at me?

457
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,888
Let's just go, I have to get ready
to get there by eight.

458
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,224
You said you're watching
a musical with Sweet Kang.

459
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:10,019
Can you even watch the whole thing?
You don't know what could be there.

460
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,521
I'm going to stay there
even if I have to close my eyes.

461
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,941
Let's just go. It's that way. Hurry.

462
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:18,194
I don't care. It's too hot.
I need to get a cold drink.

463
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,446
Hey, Mr. Joo!

464
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,366
Let's make this quick.

465
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,368
I'll have a red bean ice dessert.

466
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,619
What about you?

467
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:31,249
I don't look at those things.
Two long blacks.

468
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,335
Hold on. I don't want that.

469
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,003
I only drink what I always drink.

470
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,632
And I don't like people drinking
something that looks nicer.

471
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,217
-You should--
-Hands off.

472
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,136
I don't read menus.

473
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,932
Two long blacks.

474
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,064
Mr. Joo, did Hui-ju
ever appear in your dreams?

475
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:01,654
It would be nice if she talked to you
in your dreams like Pilseung.

476
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,283
It never happened before.

477
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,410
I don't see Hui-ju around you since then.

478
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,706
Ghosts come when they are talked about
or thought about.

479
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,250
Tell me about Hui-ju. I'll listen.

480
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,960
I have nothing to tell you.

481
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,005
Don't you trust me?

482
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,216
Do you think I will take the money
after hearing your story and run?

483
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,135
I don't trust you.

484
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,972
The more you talk about yourself,
the weaker you become.

485
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,057
I don't want you to know my weakness.

486
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,767
So, you don't trust me.

487
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,774
The dog's leaving. Shall we go after it?

488
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:41,777
Okay, let's go.

489
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,030
Mr. Joo.

490
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:49,160
Coming with me when you can't see it
means you trust me.

491
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,704
That way. Let's go.

492
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:01,589
I see, so this is a dog tag
for military dogs.

493
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,259
Then please find out
about a military dog called Pilseung.

494
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,931
He must be here.

495
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,808
Once we find him,

496
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,436
tell him about the dog
and give this to him.

497
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,563
Don't aggravate him
by trying to preach to him.

498
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,898
We're not the police.

499
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:23,235
But it's scary to meet someone
who is a thief.

500
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:29,575
What?

501
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,371
The dog just put its front paw
on me like this.

502
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,834
I think it's telling me that
it's going to be okay.

503
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,753
It's taking its owner's side.

504
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,050
I think he's over there.

505
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,891
Yes, Mr. Kim.

506
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:58,854
The dog collar is a dog tag
of a military dog who was put to sleep.

507
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,231
A military dog?

508
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,317
Pilseung, were you a military dog?

509
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:10,199
And the soldier in charge
of that dog is AWOL and is armed.

510
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,705
I think he's the one
who came into Kingdom yesterday.

511
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,209
Over here. Have a look.

512
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,612
Pilseung, I'm going to follow you.

513
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,048
A soldier should have
at least one girl group he likes.

514
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,442
What's wrong with you?

515
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:31,322
Are you an idiot?
Can't you even do a single thing properly?

516
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,200
I lost the reward vacation because of you!

517
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,497
Why do I have to go through this
because of you?

518
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,584
Go away!

519
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,300
Go run in full kit
until I tell you to stop, okay?

520
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,843
-Yes, sir.
-Louder!

521
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:53,761
Yes, sir!

522
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:24,458
Pilseung, without you,
I would never have completed my service.

523
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,422
Are you telling me it's going to be okay?

524
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,550
You're the only one I can rely on.

525
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,931
Pilseung can no longer
do his role as a military dog.

526
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,100
We've decided to put him to sleep.

527
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:51,485
If you let him live, I'll take care of him
and take him with me.

528
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,530
Can't you do that? Please let him live.

529
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:59,410
Corporal Kim, you're in charge.
You will put him to sleep.

530
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,693
Kim Hyeong-cheol. What is wrong with you?

531
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,320
Can't you do it properly?

532
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,531
Get up at once!

533
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,580
Lower your eyes.

534
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,085
Why are you glaring at me?

535
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,880
Hey!

536
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,382
-Hey!
-Stop it!

537
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,927
Damn it!

538
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,930
My nose!

539
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,950
Pilseung. I am so scared.

540
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:34,588
He came to stop his friend
from doing something dangerous.

541
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,966
Mr. Kim reported to the military
and police that he is here.

542
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,053
If he is armed, we shouldn't go after him.

543
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:43,931
Let's get out of here.

544
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,732
They'll be here soon.

545
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,777
Shouldn't we persuade him
before they get here?

546
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,822
You must have no sense of reality
because you only see dead people.

547
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,490
He has a gun. A gun.

548
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,701
If you get involved, you could die here.

549
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,500
Pilseung is crying.

550
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,669
He is crying.

551
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,423
The man must be crying, too.

552
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:50,622
Tae Gong-sil.

553
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,669
You said you can pretend
you don't see things.

554
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,880
I'm trying but it's not that easy.

555
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,047
There is a way.

556
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,341
Hold me.

557
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,729
You said you have plans at eight, right?

558
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:18,692
You should go home, wash your hair,
get dressed, and put on makeup.

559
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,487
Go on your date
looking like a normal woman.

560
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,948
Isn't that why you keep
asking me to hold your hand?

561
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,993
I'll hold it. So, take my hand.

562
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:29,995
Let's go.

563
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,589
I guess I can't help being a crazy woman.

564
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,716
I'll be right back.

565
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:47,095
Tae Gong-sil! Why won't you listen to me?

566
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:48,889
Tae Gong-sil!

567
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,523
Pilseung!

568
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,780
-He has a gun!
-Run!

569
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,912
-Stop.
-There's a man with a gun.

570
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,914
-You have to leave.
-Hurry up.

571
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:56,832
Hurry.

572
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,335
-Please get out of here. Hurry.
-Get out, hurry.

573
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:03,922
Tae Gong-sil!

574
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,010
Tae Gong-sil.

575
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,304
Tae Gong-sil!

576
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,182
Tae Gong-sil.

577
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,185
-Tae Gong-sil, Tae--
-Don't come any closer.

578
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,693
I don't intend to get

579
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:26,945
any closer.

580
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,701
Oh, my gosh!

581
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,245
Police officer, he has a gun!

582
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,331
-Go!
-He has a gun!

583
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,124
Oh, my gosh!

584
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:47,090
I know you have
no intention of shooting me.

585
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:52,679
If you were thinking of shooting me,
then change your mind.

586
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,476
You have to realize
you don't intend to shoot me.

587
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:14,201
Okay. Now put the gun down.

588
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,245
It would be better if you threw it aside.

589
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,248
I had no intention of hurting anyone.

590
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,376
Please leave.

591
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:57,869
Hey, AWOL.

592
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,498
Why don't you come with me?

593
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,083
I'm going to end things here.

594
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,501
Please leave.

595
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,217
You know Pilseung, right?

596
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,928
How do you know Pilseung?

597
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,557
That's...

598
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,189
-This is Pilseung's.
-Yes.

599
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,694
Pilseung is next to you right now.

600
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,156
-What? Pilseung is--
-I know.

601
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,451
It's dead.

602
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,955
I see that dead dog.

603
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,916
Pilseung is next to me?

604
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,464
Yes.

605
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,508
He's a good-looking
and smart German Shepherd.

606
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,220
Does he like "Nobody"
because of your taste?

607
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,475
I played it for him every day.

608
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,519
We're fans of Wonder Girls.

609
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:10,692
He was always by your side.

610
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,781
He wants to protect you,
so you don't do anything dangerous.

611
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,992
Pilseung died because I was a fool.

612
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,205
He was protecting me,
when I'm so pathetic?

613
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,419
The dog...

614
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:34,841
just put its front paw on you like this.

615
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,683
Are you telling me it's going to be okay?

616
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,852
You're the only one I can rely on.

617
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,357
Pilseung.

618
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,195
Are you saying it's okay?

619
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,308
Get on the ground!

620
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,934
Corporal Kim disarmed himself
and surrendered.

621
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,854
The situation ended
without any casualties.

622
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:19,571
He did sneak into Kingdom,
so I will report it to the police.

623
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,615
It's a relief that nothing bad happened.

624
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,951
I heard that he used to be
a military dog trainer.

625
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,496
Does that mean a dog was with him?

626
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:33,501
I'm not sure about that.
I'm just relieved everyone is okay.

627
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,423
-There he is.
-I can't believe this.

628
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,883
Oh, my gosh.

629
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,426
He's coming out.

630
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,011
Did he plan on...

631
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,727
Why did he do that?

632
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,452
Thank you.

633
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,541
I'm sorry for the shock
you must have been through.

634
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:16,920
We're okay.

635
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,298
Why did you come down here yourself,
Mr. Joo?

636
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,177
We were going to come meet you
about the new store in Kingdom.

637
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:25,845
I came to get a sofa.

638
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,974
You must have liked the furniture
we sent to your house last time.

639
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,977
Are the reporters still outside?
Until they're gone...

640
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:35,689
I'm going to sit here.

641
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,651
Sure, please do so.
If you want to look at beds...

642
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:43,029
-they are that way.
-It's okay. You can go now.

643
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,447
Sure.

644
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,999
You were really good.
It was like you could see the dog.

645
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,710
I've seen you do it a few times.

646
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:02,298
Are you going to keep
your promise to that soldier?

647
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:05,760
Hold on.

648
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,974
The comfort of the ghost dog
will not set your life right again.

649
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,851
I'm the president of Kingdom.

650
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:16,062
When you finish your service,
I will give you a job there.

651
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,440
Don't forget Pilseung.

652
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,320
That ghost dog was really smart.

653
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:29,701
He brought me as well as you,
and provided his owner with a job.

654
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,037
I'm glad that I didn't pretend
I didn't see him.

655
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,378
From now on,
leave when I tell you to get lost.

656
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,756
And don't go if I tell you not to.

657
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:44,883
Okay.

658
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,635
It's cramped in here. Go over there.

659
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,643
Mr. Joo, you should read this.

660
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:56,936
What is it?

661
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:02,442
It says we weren't injured and that
we have no intention of suing this store.

662
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,110
I think they want us to sign it.

663
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,323
I don't mind. But you check
these kinds of things thoroughly.

664
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,991
You should read it and then sign it.

665
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:13,078
They're trying not to take
any responsibility for this.

666
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,954
Read it.

667
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,791
I've read it. You should read and sign it.

668
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,043
Do you know how valuable my signature is?

669
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,503
I can't just sign anything.

670
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,838
You should read every line.

671
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,966
It's not like you can't read.
You should read it yourself.

672
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,513
Never mind. I'll tell Mr. Kim to do it.

673
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:38,269
Mr. Joo, can't you read?

674
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:48,321
I don't read. I can't read letters.

675
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:49,781
It just happened.

676
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,704
Why? Are you happy you know my weakness?

677
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,547
It happened after that incident.

678
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,677
They made me read a book
while I was captured.

679
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,346
"Some crazy man..."

680
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:19,144
It was a book about a story
in which people kept dying.

681
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,354
I read it line by line.

682
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:26,526
I thought, "Who will die next?
Who will die after that?"

683
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,778
Once the book was over...

684
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,114
I felt like I would be

685
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,117
the one to die in the end.

686
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:47,755
Well, I survived, but since then,
I feel nauseated when I read.

687
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,509
I am scared of reading.

688
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:58,725
What can we do?
How can we make it not scary?

689
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:02,312
What's there to do?
There's nothing you can do.

690
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:03,938
I know.

691
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:08,151
I wish I could tell you
to hold me if you're scared.

692
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,992
Mr. Joo, you never know.
Why don't you try touching me?

693
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:16,993
No.

694
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:23,833
Then I will help you with the reading.

695
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,002
There's no need. Mr. Kim does that.

696
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:30,215
So that's what you were listening to
all the time.

697
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,800
I'll read this for you.

698
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,347
"Confirmation."

699
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,350
Being unable to read
doesn't mean I can't hear.

700
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:41,392
Okay.

701
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:42,894
"Confirmation.

702
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:46,981
-The incident that occurred in--"
-Are you reading a storybook?

703
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,319
"Confirmation.

704
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,655
-The incident that--"
-That's too fast.

705
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,909
"Confirmation."

706
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,202
That's too low.

707
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,663
Do, re, mi. Keep your pitch at "mi."

708
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:07,669
"Confirmation." Do, re, mi.

709
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,128
Why can't you do that?

710
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:12,215
I'll try it. "Confirmation."

711
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,517
What is it?

712
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,523
No one has taken that doll yet.

713
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:32,360
It must have been thrown out.
Let's take it with us.

714
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:51,504
Hello. You're our friend now.

715
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,673
Come play with us.

716
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:01,973
Am I too early?

717
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,058
Why did you buy more tickets?

718
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:08,062
I wanted to see
who he comes to see it with.

719
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,900
MUSICAL SENSE

720
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,487
Excuse me.

721
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:19,949
INTERNATIONAL CALL

722
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,411
Yes.

723
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,289
I'm out on a personal matter.

724
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,460
It has nothing to do
with president Joo Jung-won.

725
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:31,669
Joo Jung-won?

726
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:37,008
I will continue to report to you
about president Joo Jung-won.

727
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:37,925
However...

728
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:43,014
I will stop gathering information
on Tae Gong-sil.

729
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,978
It's too uncomfortable
to keep lying to her.

730
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,939
Please understand. All right.

731
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,707
Are you investigating
Mr. Joo behind his back?

732
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,086
What are you lying about to Tae Gong-sil?

733
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,050
Yes, Mr. Kim. Please come right away.

734
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:37,193
CONFIRMATION

735
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:44,117
Just like I can't see ghosts
when I touch you...

736
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:48,454
I wish you could see letters properly
when you touch me.

737
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:52,083
Just try it. You have nothing to lose.

738
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:59,507
JOO JUNG-WON
TAE GONG-SIL

739
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,478
