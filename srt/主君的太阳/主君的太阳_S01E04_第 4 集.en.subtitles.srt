1
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,826
I must have wanted to sleep with him
so much that I'm dreaming this.

2
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:42,167
Even my dream is quiet
since I'm holding his hand.

3
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:48,339
It would be better if this was erotic,
so I can get some male energy.

4
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,219
Are you awake, Jung-won?

5
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,807
"Jung-won"?

6
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:02,020
Let's sleep some more.
I don't want to wake up yet.

7
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,609
Who are you right now?

8
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,945
-What?
-Are you Tae Gong-sil?

9
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,280
Yes.

10
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,741
Isn't this a dream?

11
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:23,500
It must seem like a dream to you.
It seems like a nightmare to me.

12
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,087
Don't yell or make
a fuss of checking your body.

13
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,673
You and I only held hands
and slept, that's all.

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,008
Where am I?

15
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,468
My place.

16
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,430
Your place?

17
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:42,936
It's really nice.

18
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,814
"Nice"? You might not make a fuss, but...

19
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,317
"What am I doing here?"

20
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,153
Isn't it normal to have such a reaction?

21
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,740
It's not often but sometimes this happens.

22
00:01:56,658 --> 00:02:00,286
I once woke up in a cemetery in Mangwoori.

23
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,085
I know that you are
unusually dark, Ms. Tae.

24
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,629
But is it okay to wander around
anywhere like that?

25
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:14,384
The ghosts are kind of scary
but they do help me sometimes.

26
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,264
They let me know if bad people
approach me or scare them away.

27
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:25,061
Were you just worried about me?

28
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:30,108
Not you. I'm worried about the people
who'd be shocked by you.

29
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,404
Imagine seeing a face like that
at a cemetery.

30
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,639
They were very shocked.

31
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:09,063
My gosh. Were you okay?

32
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,276
Now you're worrying about me?
I was very shocked, too.

33
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,822
I woke up on this bed
without causing trouble, right?

34
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:22,452
Thanks to you, a lot of guests
came by my house.

35
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:26,164
Sir. Where is my mom?

36
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,542
-Please find my mom.
-Get a hold of yourself.

37
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,045
Where is my mom?

38
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,131
-Get up!
-Please find my mom.

39
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,300
Get a hold of yourself!

40
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,765
Water. Please give me some water.

41
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,974
Water.

42
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,687
Where did she go?

43
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,283
I feel like dancing. I want to dance.

44
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,244
-What is it this time?
-I want to dance.

45
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,708
I can't believe this.

46
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,391
Bite it.

47
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,576
-You got drunk and became a dog.
-A dog?

48
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,121
I became a dog?

49
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,457
Judging by how you tore at that,
it wasn't a small kind of dog.

50
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,335
You were a big one,
probably as big as a Siberian Husky.

51
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,714
I wasn't drunk yesterday.
I wonder why I became a dog.

52
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,800
Maybe I was too sleepy.

53
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,636
I held your hand because
that was the only way you stayed quiet.

54
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,269
But I'm curious.

55
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,772
You don't just see and hear them?
They even come in and out of your body?

56
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:19,402
It happens when I lose control of my mind.

57
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,530
That's why I can't sleep.

58
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,074
I try to be careful.

59
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,412
Is that why you always
look so tired all the time?

60
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,039
Yes.

61
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:38,379
But last night I slept really well,
probably because I slept with you.

62
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,552
It was so good last night.

63
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:49,932
It wasn't for me.
You were a dog last night. A dog.

64
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,227
Right. I don't know what happened.

65
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:59,525
I went to a team dinner
and left because I had a headache.

66
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,119
Cha Hui-ju.

67
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,581
I saw her next to you.

68
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,833
And I think I lost control of myself then.

69
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,674
Did you meet Cha Hui-ju last night?

70
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,516
Did I come to you as Cha Hui-ju?

71
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,064
It's me.

72
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,067
The evil bitch you hate.

73
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,028
Cha Hui-ju?

74
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,824
It must have been hard for you
to hate me for such a long time.

75
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,743
You liked me so much.

76
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,375
You must have felt so betrayed by me.

77
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,294
You probably couldn't forget
how terrible I was.

78
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,216
Jung-won. I am sorry.

79
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:06,884
Joo Jung-won.

80
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,761
Hui-ju!

81
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,727
You just died
and I couldn't get my revenge.

82
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,648
I was too embarrassed
to say that I got fooled by you.

83
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,360
You're remembered
as the sad curse of my first love.

84
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,989
You should relieve me of that curse.

85
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,408
I didn't fool you, Jung-won.

86
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,453
I really liked you.

87
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,623
I want you to return
to the guy you used to be.

88
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,751
I want to find the person
who planned it with you.

89
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,503
And I want to find my money.

90
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,505
Where is my money?

91
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:50,303
I think the curse will be gone
once I find it and forget everything.

92
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,074
I love you.

93
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,279
She disappeared
after saying useless things to me.

94
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,658
In any case, you met the person
you wanted to meet the most.

95
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,454
You said you want
to stay close to me, right?

96
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,706
I will let you stay by my side.

97
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,292
I think you have enough worth.

98
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,670
Really? How much?

99
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:07,880
Ten billion won.

100
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,344
Tae Gong-sil.

101
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,138
Tae Gong-sil.

102
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,966
Only Hui-ju knows
where the ten billion won went.

103
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,928
And you're the only one who can
talk to her, so I'll keep you close.

104
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,266
So, you'll give me access
to your body because of money?

105
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,436
I'll provide what you want,
so I can get what I want.

106
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,940
You said I'm your shelter.
You are my radar.

107
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,902
If you work as the radar to find
my money by talking to Hui-ju,

108
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,740
I will open up the shelter.

109
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,117
Does that mean I can touch you if I want?

110
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,952
Okay, I'll do it. I'll be your radar.

111
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,750
I should decide
where to install this radar.

112
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,628
It should be close by.

113
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,632
There is a place I want to be installed.

114
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,052
Your secretary is always by your side.

115
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,930
Could you install me by Mr. Kim's side?

116
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,851
Secretary? My secretary represents me.

117
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,479
You think you can be
my secretary with that dirty hair?

118
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,147
I'll wash my hair.

119
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,816
That's not enough.
You'd have to use your brain.

120
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,028
Do you know
how important Mr. Kim's role is?

121
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,450
I was a really good student
before I got into the accident.

122
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,120
And even afterwards, I couldn't sleep
so had to do something.

123
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,123
I studied foreign languages to spend
the time, so I'm pretty good.

124
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,002
I think a French woman came last night.
I heard you speak French.

125
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,839
Don't dream of being a secretary.
Just keep working as a cleaner.

126
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,384
I'll think about where to install you.

127
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,347
He doesn't believe me.
I really was pretty good.

128
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,769
Did she go to Hankook University?

129
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,116
Tae I-ryeong?

130
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,326
Did they go to school together?

131
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,791
She went to a good school
and used to have lots of friends.

132
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,669
And she used to be good
at a lot of things.

133
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,296
Why is she living like this?

134
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,425
MR. JOO

135
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,053
I don't mean that I am going to call you.

136
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,807
I think just having your number
would comfort me.

137
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,562
Yes, just be comforted and don't call me.

138
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,856
Can I text you?

139
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,482
No, don't. I won't read them.

140
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,276
Okay.

141
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:21,490
Was the ransom for you
really ten billion won?

142
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,701
Why? Do you think it's too much?

143
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,786
No, but it's such a big amount.

144
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,332
It was exaggerated by the press
back then, but the current value...

145
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,460
is over ten billion won now.

146
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,799
Actually, I am worth over 100 billion won.

147
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,595
I said I was in an accident, right?

148
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:49,768
My sister used her savings
for her marriage to save my life.

149
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,606
It was worth over 100 billion won to her.

150
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,987
That's how I came back to life
but I became like this.

151
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,531
I feel so bad towards my sister.

152
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,537
And I feel pathetic
about living hidden in my small room.

153
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:15,753
I'm scared of ghosts but more
of myself living like a ghost.

154
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,175
It's a relief that I met you.

155
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,844
It's such a big comfort.

156
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,271
Save my number again.
The one I told you was Mr. Kim's.

157
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,357
Really?

158
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,989
ADD TO CONTACTS

159
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,205
Just have it for comfort
and don't use it to call me.

160
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,041
And don't text me. I really don't read.

161
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,303
-Honey.
-Yes, honey.

162
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,974
What was the name of the girl
who ruined I-ryeong's wedding?

163
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,978
It was Bang-sil or Sang-sil.
Or something like that.

164
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,522
I forgot the name
and couldn't tell I-ryeong.

165
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,733
It is Gong-sil. Tae Gong-sil.

166
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,070
Maybe it's because you're getting old.
You keep forgetting things.

167
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,029
Honey.

168
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,324
Look into my eyes and tell me.

169
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,452
Are you worried
that I might go senile one day?

170
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,164
I thought it was a nuisance
but I didn't worry about that.

171
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,333
I like that you're honest.

172
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:40,713
I would be really sad
if you tried to flatter me.

173
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,257
Honey.

174
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,386
Can I be honest about your nephew?

175
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:48,971
What about Jung-won?

176
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,391
There's a rumor that he's taking
special care of that girl.

177
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,227
They said the dead girl
is still by his side.

178
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,812
Is it Bang-sil this time?

179
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,899
Please don't make such absurd accusations.

180
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,735
It's not Bang-sil. It's Gong...

181
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,904
Gong-sil!

182
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,784
Honey, over there!

183
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,788
Look over there. Where did she go?

184
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,876
-What is it?
-Jung-won's place...

185
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,878
What about it?

186
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,174
It's nothing. Let's go inside.

187
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:39,980
I am going to say hello
when I meet Tae Gong-sil again.

188
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,400
Does she bother you that much?

189
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,279
In high school, she was the Big Sun
and I was the Small Sun.

190
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,407
I was so offended through all three years.

191
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,701
You're the Big Sun now.

192
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,829
Don't bother yourself about old complexes.

193
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,998
Complexes? I have no such thing.

194
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,541
Mirror.

195
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,466
Isn't it the actress
Kim Hui-jin over there?

196
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,119
I'm going to be
the prettiest in the world.

197
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,665
Something has changed about her.
She must have had plastic surgery.

198
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,959
What's the use of that?

199
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,878
I'm still prettier than her.

200
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:25,794
You're the prettiest of them all now.

201
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,974
Yes.

202
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,686
I'm the prettiest of them all.

203
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,208
This the manager's room, right?

204
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,837
I came to ask about changing a bulb
on the fourth floor, but she's not here.

205
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,806
Do you like ice cream?

206
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,938
Did your mom come home early today?

207
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,649
Why do you have so much ice cream?

208
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,318
The guy from room 404 bought it for us.

209
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,278
-Kang Woo?
-Yes.

210
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,865
He seems like a good guy.
You should date him.

211
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:37,783
What?

212
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,285
He said he likes you.

213
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:41,995
What?

214
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,803
He said that he did it
because he likes her.

215
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,680
Let's help him out.

216
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,477
We should be able to have
ice cream all summer long.

217
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,860
What did the kids tell you?

218
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,154
What about them? I didn't meet them.

219
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,324
I think I bought that ice cream for them.

220
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,913
Did you hear why I bought it for them?

221
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,292
Yes.

222
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,753
How is it?

223
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,342
-Is it good?
-The ice cream?

224
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,513
It hasn't melted yet, so I don't know.

225
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,816
You disappeared last night,
so I was worried.

226
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,902
I'm glad you look okay.

227
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,031
It should melt soon.

228
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,077
You're right.

229
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,915
It's really melting.

230
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,963
It's too hot. I should go inside.

231
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,095
She must believe the kids.

232
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,021
There's someone who says he likes me.

233
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,276
A handsome guy, not a ghost,
says he likes me.

234
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,325
I e-mailed you the information
I found about Tae Gong-sil.

235
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,869
There isn't anything fishy about her.

236
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,875
I'm in an awkward position.
I don't think I should approach her.

237
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,090
So, she's not connected
to Cha Hui-ju, right?

238
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:04,263
Okay, I heard that there's
a woman lingering around Jung-won.

239
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,515
You should look into that.

240
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,767
Yes, sir.

241
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,949
The exterior work on Giant Mall
seems to be done.

242
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,909
Haven't they decided
on an opening date yet?

243
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,452
You should ask them yourself.

244
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:32,457
The president of Giant Mall
is going to attend our charity event.

245
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,837
-Our charity event?
-Yes.

246
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,508
It seems like he's looking down
on us and also has some plan.

247
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:42,926
I'm not sure.

248
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,305
Here are the details of the event
and the list of guests.

249
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,181
It's all recorded here.

250
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,894
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

251
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,063
Please make a job position.

252
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,818
It has to be physically close to me
but not where I can see that person.

253
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:03,905
Something that isn't important
and doesn't attract attention.

254
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,574
Find such a position.

255
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,409
Understood.

256
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:16,251
I think the bags under my eyes improved
after I slept well that night.

257
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,919
Ms. Tae Gong-sil?

258
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,505
Hello.

259
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,383
Please have this.

260
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,637
Ms. Tae, I'm Lee Han-ju. Lee Han-ju.

261
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:28,805
All right.

262
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,276
-Was coffee not enough?
-It was fine.

263
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,278
We don't know what will happen
between her and Mr. Joo.

264
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,782
You have to line up
behind the king's concubine.

265
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,954
Mr. Do wants to see you.

266
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,414
Me?

267
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:04,216
I never spread groundless rumors
about Mr. Joo.

268
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,801
You can tell me everything.

269
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:11,264
What's going on
between Mr. Joo and Tae Gong-sil?

270
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,810
I will tell you everything.

271
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:20,107
I was there when Ms. Tae
first came to see Mr. Joo.

272
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,068
Don't you remember
telling me off for touching you?

273
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,321
We had that tingling thing
in the car, too.

274
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,281
I left my clothes in there.

275
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,619
The second time I saw her,
I was asked to escort her.

276
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:41,294
And then Tae Gong-sil
suddenly joined the cleaning crew.

277
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,631
And then one night,
I saw them while on duty.

278
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,386
That's Mr. Joo. What...

279
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,972
Oh, my gosh.

280
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,057
I didn't add anything to the story.

281
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:59,938
I only told people I'm close to
about what I saw. Just the facts.

282
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,233
So, that means I wasn't mistaken.

283
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:09,614
I will never talk
about the secrets of the royal family.

284
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,325
No.

285
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,911
Your mouth is for speaking.

286
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,665
You shouldn't close it.

287
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,295
You are good at observing
and have very good memory.

288
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:26,798
Are you quick-witted, too?

289
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,344
I get what you mean.

290
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:38,351
I will become your eyes,
ears, and loudspeaker.

291
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,899
You're really good. I like you.

292
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,070
Mr. Joo and a member of the cleaning crew.

293
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,490
This is interesting.

294
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:56,328
I am quite creative.
I made a name for them.

295
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,164
"The Master's cleaner."

296
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,962
That's funny. "The Master's cleaner."

297
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,553
I have to look the prettiest at Kingdom.

298
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:18,767
I have to shine, and be fancy
and dazzling like the sun.

299
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:23,980
It's a charity event.
Shouldn't you keep it simple?

300
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,240
This should do it.

301
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:45,502
I hate you. Why are you the Big Sun
while I am the Small Sun?

302
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,630
Get lost! I hate you!

303
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,675
Is it such a big deal to have
good scores and be popular?

304
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,302
What are you doing in there?

305
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,941
Who are you?

306
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,402
I'm you.

307
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,215
-What is it? Did you have a dream?
-Yes.

308
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,385
It felt really bad.

309
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,596
Why is it so cold in here?

310
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,056
It's not cold at all.

311
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,309
Are you going to wear this?

312
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,729
What?

313
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:02,162
You are prettier than her now.

314
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,043
Am I still thinking of her
like in high school?

315
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,128
What?

316
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,590
Let's go to Kingdom.

317
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,426
I have to meet Tae Gong-sil.

318
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,721
You always used to stay inside your room.

319
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,557
I'm so happy to see you out like this.

320
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,559
I know.

321
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,021
They say you should give a rat
space to run away when you're catching it.

322
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,232
Until now, I had nowhere to run away to.

323
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,443
But now that I have a small hole,

324
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,403
I think I can breathe better.

325
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,116
Does that mean you don't see
those things these days?

326
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,576
Not really.

327
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,414
He must really like the coffee here.

328
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,214
Why are you doing that?
I thought you were feeling better.

329
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,385
Okay. He wants some more syrup.

330
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,345
I should go. Bye.

331
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,056
Take him with you!

332
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,788
Tae Gong-sil.

333
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:30,959
Hi.

334
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,128
Tae Gong-sil.

335
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,005
You're Tae Gong-sil, right?

336
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,800
-Yes.
-It's been a long time.

337
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,470
You work here, right?
I saw you working here before.

338
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,431
Yes.

339
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,058
I came to see you.
Aren't you happy to see me?

340
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,269
Look at me.

341
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,232
Do you clean here?

342
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,447
What's wrong?

343
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,409
Hey, Tae Gong-sil. Tae Gong-sil!

344
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,495
Tae Gong-sil.

345
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,124
Is she running away from embarrassment?

346
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,463
The security guy? We meet again.

347
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,923
What is it? Why did she take off?

348
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,467
I don't know.

349
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,136
-Do you know Tae Gong-sil?
-Yes.

350
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,392
We went to high school together.

351
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,394
I know.

352
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,898
Are you close to her?
Then let's go talk somewhere.

353
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,858
I'm really curious about how she's been.

354
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,443
-I don't want to.
-What?

355
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,655
I don't want to talk to
someone my friend doesn't like.

356
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,616
But it's me.

357
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,578
Do you think you'll get another chance
to be with someone as pretty as me?

358
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:52,081
I'd consider it if you were pretty.

359
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,918
But you're not pretty at all.

360
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,715
What? You jerk.

361
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,760
No wonder they're friends.

362
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,102
I-ryeong saw me acting strangely.

363
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,398
If Woo saw it too,
he probably won't like me anymore.

364
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,401
I can't believe this.

365
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,446
Who? A ghost?

366
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,031
Mr. Joo.

367
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:32,956
I met I-ryeong and saw something
scary next to her, so I ran away.

368
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,667
Were you sitting down there
because you're scared?

369
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,919
I was down there
because I was embarrassed.

370
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,045
Embarrassed?

371
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,799
You're not embarrassed
of waking up in a cemetery.

372
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,470
Does it have anything to do with me?

373
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,723
-No.
-So, why did you come here?

374
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,308
Go.

375
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:59,023
Mr. Joo, you're right, I haven't
been embarrassed in a long time.

376
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:03,152
I was never embarrassed
when I saw ghosts and was scared.

377
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:07,490
I guess now that I have room
to breathe, I can feel embarrassed.

378
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,578
I'm really embarrassed right now.

379
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,416
Congratulations for
finding your humiliation.

380
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,626
But why are you telling me about it?

381
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,171
Because you helped me
find room to breathe.

382
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,887
This is where Mr. Kim works, right?

383
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,057
It looks nice.

384
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,643
I do not plan to install my radar here.

385
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,395
Get out.

386
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,022
-Mr. Joo.
-What?

387
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:45,528
I will make sure I find Hui-ju,
the person you want to see so much.

388
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,364
You should clean as well.
You're still on the cleaning crew.

389
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,784
And only stray dogs keep clinging on
when people tell them to go away.

390
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:57,248
If you've found your humiliation,
you should go when I tell you to leave.

391
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,042
Get out.

392
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,376
Okay.

393
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,808
She must be in charge of cleaning
Mr. Joo's room.

394
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,519
Are you curious about
who cleans Mr. Joo's room?

395
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,314
You have a lot of interest in Mr. Joo.

396
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,941
He's my family.

397
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,612
He never calls me uncle.
But I'm still his uncle.

398
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,696
All right.

399
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,993
I should fire him.

400
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,540
If someone like her were to join
our family, Mr. Joo would lose power.

401
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,659
JEIL BIG MART

402
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,553
She seems to be going home.
But why is she taking the long way?

403
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,681
MANAGER'S OFFICE

404
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,981
Is that you, Ms. Tae?

405
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,693
Did the old lady from the supermarket die?

406
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,529
Yes, she passed away this morning.

407
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,573
I see.

408
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:58,619
Hey, it's recycling collection day.
Empty out the trash bins.

409
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,289
I'll be right back down.

410
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,258
PAPER, CANS AND BOTTLES, GENERAL WASTE

411
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:38,367
I don't think she's having trouble because
of the cleaning. I wonder what it is.

412
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,756
I can't do anything about a convenience
store opening up next to the mart.

413
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,092
Please.

414
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,195
Where are you?

415
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,157
You're Small Sun, right?

416
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,954
Why are you crying? It's annoying.

417
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,833
You're Small Sun, right?

418
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,003
Where are you?

419
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,144
You're Small Sun.

420
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,577
It's too cold. I told you
to keep the air conditioning low!

421
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,870
I didn't turn it on.

422
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,956
Do you have a cold?
Why do you keep saying you're cold?

423
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,833
Never mind.

424
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:19,010
You have to become prettier.

425
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,516
Do you think I should see a doctor?

426
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,644
Do you really have a cold?

427
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,563
Not that kind of doctor.

428
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,108
Do you want to get plastic surgery?

429
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:39,280
I think I'll become prettier
if I have a little work done.

430
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,794
Are you asking to sleep with me in here?

431
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,839
I will only hold your hand.

432
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,091
Just for a moment on the sofa over there.

433
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:06,432
The dead lady from the supermarket
came and pestered me all night.

434
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,267
Do you think a shelter is a motel?

435
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:12,688
I only allowed you to touch me
when you're in an emergency.

436
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,775
I have no intention
of becoming your teddy bear.

437
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,820
It was so nice that night.

438
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:26,285
If you want that again, find Hui-ju
and find where my money is.

439
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,134
Then I'll let you sleep with me once.

440
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,805
I want to see her
but she's not turning up.

441
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,850
Usually, they appear
at the place they died.

442
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,936
Shall I go there?

443
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,610
Mr. Kim knows where it is.
Ask him and go there.

444
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,459
Mr. Joo was there
when Cha Hui-ju's accident happened.

445
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,880
It's probably painful for him to go there.

446
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:24,552
They were kidnapped together
but only Cha Hui-ju died, right?

447
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,930
At that time,
the kidnapper locked up Mr. Joo,

448
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,933
and used Cha Hui-ju to get the ransom.

449
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:48,409
The kidnappers asked for jewels as ransom.

450
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:55,374
They belonged to Mr. Joo's mother,
who had passed away.

451
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,209
JOO JUNG-WON

452
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:11,640
"We have been invited here
by some crazy person.

453
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,812
He might...

454
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,365
be a horrible murderer."

455
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:37,124
The kidnappers let Mr. Joo's father
hear his voice every thirty minutes.

456
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:44,090
That incident is still
a big trauma for Mr. Joo.

457
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:48,219
If they gave them the ransom,
why did Cha Hui-ju die?

458
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,269
Get closer!

459
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,314
Mr. Joo was released
once they got the ransom.

460
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:05,694
But Cha Hui-ju was taken
hostage when they ran away.

461
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,830
-It's dangerous.
-Let go!

462
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,876
Get out, Cha Hui-ju!

463
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:05,129
No!

464
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:25,065
He probably doesn't want
to go back there after that.

465
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,695
It must be hard for him to think about it.

466
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,165
I heard Giant Mall will be completed
earlier than planned.

467
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,083
They will open sooner as well.

468
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,669
Are you gloomy because of that?

469
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,129
I don't have time to be gloomy.

470
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:52,968
I should go around the mall
and smile until my mouth hurts.

471
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,266
All right.

472
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,062
-My gosh. It's Tae I-ryeong.
-Really?

473
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,022
Oh, my gosh. You're so pretty.

474
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,149
-Oh, my gosh.
-Tae I-ryeong.

475
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,614
That woman with hair like a poodle
and a flower in her hair,

476
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,991
wearing some kind of weird red cloth...

477
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,868
She's our model Tae I-ryeong, right?

478
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,036
Yes, it is.

479
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,789
She seems like a different person.

480
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:25,960
You're so pretty.

481
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:32,258
I met I-ryeong and saw something
scary next to her, so I ran away.

482
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,304
Has she become a dog, too?

483
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,933
Thank you. That's all for today.

484
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,851
Thank you.

485
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,563
-Let's go.
-Did you find a hospital?

486
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:50,317
You have a public event soon.
Let's think about it after that.

487
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,069
-Oh, that's right.
-Yes.

488
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,197
My dress is too plain.
Let's go find another one.

489
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,783
This way. Let's go this way.

490
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,290
I invited Minister Kim's daughter

491
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:07,585
and the daughter of Seokyeong Group's
president to the charity event.

492
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,087
You should talk to them
for over ten minutes.

493
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,755
You shouldn't try to set him up.

494
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,883
Mr. Joo has someone special.

495
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:21,599
Are you talking about that Bang-sil girl
who cleans again?

496
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,186
-It's not Bang-sil.
-It's Gong-sil, Tae Gong-sil.

497
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,482
She's an employee
that I'm keeping close to me.

498
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,193
Why are you keeping a member
of the cleaning crew close to you?

499
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:37,906
He's very neat, so he makes her
clean his car and office.

500
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,327
And he makes her clean his house, too.

501
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,038
Is that true?

502
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:45,873
Yes.

503
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,834
She rode my car,
came to my office and my house.

504
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,545
But I didn't make her clean any of them.

505
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,506
What's your relationship?

506
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:59,470
I know what you're imagining
but it's more surprising than that.

507
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,474
And I plan on keeping her
even closer to me.

508
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,815
By "plan," do you mean
that you're going to marry her?

509
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,692
Neither of us wants that.

510
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,821
All she wants from me is my body.

511
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,450
We agreed to only exchange
meaningless physical contact.

512
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,704
Are you saying you'll just
have a physical relationship?

513
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,998
There are many people
watching you at work.

514
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,458
I'll move her somewhere discreet.

515
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,629
You should stop the rumors. You're
the one who sees and hears everything.

516
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,093
You should find out which daughters
are coming to the event.

517
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,763
I can't have a marriage like you, right?

518
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,737
Please leave.

519
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,574
I'm only exchanging
meaningless physical contact

520
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,743
with that woman?

521
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:12,751
No, stop thinking about it.
She will get my money back.

522
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,337
She's a ten-billion-won radar.
Ten billion won.

523
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,884
That's right. That radar is worth a lot.

524
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,095
It's okay.

525
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,272
Mr. Joo.

526
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,524
Hello, my ten-billion-won radar.

527
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,735
I have to call you that
to feel less cheated.

528
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,737
Why did you come see me?

529
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,282
I haven't seen Cha Hui-ju.

530
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,242
You said there's something
next to Tae I-ryeong.

531
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,578
She's our model and she's acting weird.

532
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,205
Go find out if it's because of that thing.

533
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,957
You want me to meet her?

534
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,335
There's something very scary next to her.

535
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,172
I'll be nearby. You can come to me
if it chases you.

536
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:05,137
You're not scared of the ghost.
You're embarrassed of yourself, right?

537
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:09,725
I-ryeong came here to make fun of me.

538
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,979
I don't need to go to her on purpose
just to get made fun of.

539
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,814
Fine. Don't do it, then.

540
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:20,194
You might not believe me
but I used to be pretty great.

541
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,322
I was the Big Sun
and she was the Small Sun.

542
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:28,660
To me, you look like a shriveled up sun
that is making excuses not to see her.

543
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,580
Get lost.

544
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,718
Kang Woo.

545
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,889
Do you take the long way home
because you have a lot on your mind?

546
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,809
Why did you do that
when you met Tae I-ryeong?

547
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,270
I must have looked really weird.

548
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,399
You avoided her
and couldn't look into her eyes.

549
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,860
I avoided her because of another reason.

550
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,113
But I'm avoiding her now
because I am embarrassed.

551
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,284
I am so worthless compared to her.

552
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,120
You're not comparing
yourself to Tae I-ryeong.

553
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:15,499
Aren't you comparing
yourself to your old self?

554
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,507
I got information about you
by buying the kids ice cream.

555
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,717
I see.

556
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,973
Don't compare yourself to your past.

557
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,725
Someone I respect once told me this.

558
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:38,564
"Don't compare yourself to your past.
Anticipate your future.

559
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:41,275
And love your present self."

560
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,363
It must be a really great person.

561
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:53,245
I might be saying this
but your past was pretty intimidating.

562
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:58,917
I should still love my present
and anticipate my future, right?

563
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:07,050
It's a green light.
Let's take the short route today.

564
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,023
Hello. Thank you for coming.

565
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,067
Please help us out. Thank you.

566
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,654
DONATION BOX

567
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,307
My gosh.

568
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,540
I-ryeong is in a serious state.

569
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,674
Tae Gong-sil.

570
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,185
Excuse me.

571
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,774
-You're on the cleaning crew, right?
-Yes.

572
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:50,946
That's good. We're short on staff here.
Could you help with the event?

573
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:52,864
Me?

574
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:58,745
Aren't you coming in?

575
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,548
Mr. Do said you were
to stand at that table.

576
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,468
Is that all I have to do?

577
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:14,803
Yes.

578
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,238
Hold on.

579
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,037
I-ryeong.

580
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:43,832
Tae Gong-sil?

581
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:49,337
I-ryeong, I don't think
I should just ignore this.

582
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,631
Please don't be offended.

583
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:52,966
About what?

584
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:00,182
"You're the prettiest of them all."
Don't listen to that.

585
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,309
What?

586
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:10,233
If you listen to those words,
you'll become more hideous.

587
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:13,028
So, don't listen to what others say.

588
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:16,448
Look at yourself.
Then you won't be cold anymore.

589
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:17,657
Okay?

590
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,035
I should go.

591
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,039
What was that?

592
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,459
Did Gong-sil just tell me I'm hideous?

593
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,837
I am so perfect today.

594
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,050
Look at Tae I-ryeong. She's the worst.

595
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,470
Shouldn't they stop using
her as the model for Kingdom?

596
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,890
I am much more prettier than her.

597
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,675
Why am I wearing this when it's so hot?

598
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:35,986
You're the prettiest of them all now.

599
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,082
My gosh.

600
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,587
What are you doing here?

601
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,339
This is my Kingdom and my event.
Of course, I should be here.

602
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,757
You're the one who shouldn't be here.

603
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,635
Are you here wearing that
because of Tae I-ryeong?

604
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:05,307
I was told to work here
and I talked to her since she was here.

605
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,185
I would have asked you to stay
by my side if I knew you were here.

606
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,228
It was so scary.

607
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:13,231
Why did you help her?
Didn't you say you hate her?

608
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:18,945
I see ghosts, have no shame
and don't have any pride, either.

609
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,239
But I've decided to love the current me.

610
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,825
I should go work now.

611
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,160
Ms. Tae.

612
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:27,996
Put up your radar.

613
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,627
The president of Giant Mall will come.
He is not an honest guy.

614
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,796
There must be corruption
related to the early opening.

615
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,715
Find out what it is
if there's something next to him.

616
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,969
Ghosts don't answer questions that I ask.

617
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,057
What is it?

618
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,310
There's one over there.

619
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:56,149
-Minister Kim's daughter?
-Let me tell you what it is.

620
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,236
Is there such a thing?

621
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,280
I could have gotten into trouble.

622
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,407
I just wasted 20 minutes talking to her.

623
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,077
Good job.

624
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,414
Do you want one? This is expensive.

625
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:15,335
No, you know what happens if I drink.

626
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,380
That's right.

627
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,925
-You can't become a dog in here.
-Right.

628
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:28,223
Ms. Tae, there's someone
I wanted to meet but he's dead.

629
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,350
Who?

630
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,061
Do you know Steve Jobs?

631
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,229
Yes.

632
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:39,526
If you drink at his home,
would I be able to talk to him?

633
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:40,568
I don't know.

634
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,240
-Am I going to the US, then?
-Let me think about it.

635
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,743
My expensive radar
is going to be quite useful.

636
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,912
Let's walk round to see if there's more.

637
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,248
The US...

638
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,002
-Put more men over there.
-Yes. What about over there?

639
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:02,716
Mr. Kang?

640
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,301
-Yes?
-Over there?

641
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:07,721
Sure.

642
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,391
There's one there.

643
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:20,233
The president of Giant Mall wants to see
you before he attends the event.

644
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,193
What is he up to?

645
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:28,283
He wouldn't know
that I have a ten-billion-won radar.

646
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,452
Where would you like to meet him?

647
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,662
Bring him to my office when he arrives.

648
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,041
Ms. Tae. Come with me.

649
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,348
Is there something here?
You said those are signs.

650
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,728
There's nothing here.
I think it just fell off.

651
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,611
Did you wonder if Hui-ju is here?

652
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:07,405
Yes.

653
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:14,913
You call me an expensive radar.
I'm sorry I can't see Hui-ju.

654
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:22,337
Do the things you see just
say what they want and disappear?

655
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,379
Sometimes.

656
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:28,176
Then she could have disappeared
after saying what she wanted to.

657
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,388
I can't forgive her
if she just disappeared like that.

658
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,020
Mr. Joo.

659
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,732
There's something I just remembered.

660
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:44,901
What is it?

661
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:49,697
I lost consciousness after seeing Hui-ju.

662
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,951
I just remembered
what she said before that.

663
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,204
Did she say something?

664
00:56:56,496 --> 00:57:00,667
I didn't hear clearly
because I wasn't in my right mind.

665
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:05,505
Hui-ju said that she doesn't resent you.

666
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:08,883
What?

667
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,428
She said it's okay
and it wasn't your fault.

668
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,099
I think she said
you shouldn't be tortured by it.

669
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,269
Is that what you really heard?

670
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,480
Yes, it was.

671
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,986
You can't anticipate your future
if you're clinging to your past.

672
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,363
She said you should treasure
your present self.

673
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:35,493
So, you should stop
torturing yourself about the past.

674
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:41,583
Cha Hui-ju said
that she doesn't resent me.

675
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:46,296
Jung-won. I am sorry.

676
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,007
Joo Jung-won.

677
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,053
Tae Gong-sil. Don't you lie to me.

678
00:57:57,056 --> 00:58:02,020
You couldn't have heard that.
She would never have said that.

679
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:10,153
Did you just comfort me,
just like you helped your friend?

680
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,948
I just...

681
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:15,575
Get out.

682
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,203
Get out!

683
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,664
You should do as your told. Get out!

684
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,711
I am sorry.

685
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:33,259
I just wanted to give you
some room to breathe, too.

686
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:35,470
I am sorry.

687
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:37,323
The president of Giant Mall
says he's going to be late.

688
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,161
I brought your phone
you left at the event.

689
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,497
How long does he want me to wait?

690
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,499
So, when is he going to arrive?

691
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:50,962
A big accident happened nearby
and he can't get here because of it.

692
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:54,048
-An accident?
-Yes, there was a news flash.

693
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,592
BUS COLLISION RESULTS IN HEAVY CASUALTIES

694
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:59,721
There are a lot of victims.
It must have been a big accident.

695
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,947
A lot of people died near here?

696
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:19,407
Yes.

697
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,995
Were there any calls
to my phone before you came in here?

698
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:24,954
No, there weren't.

699
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,626
Shall I call him?

700
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,962
I will call the president of Giant Mall.

701
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:34,255
Why?

702
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,218
Weren't you concerned about him?

703
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,814
Hurry.

704
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,831
Help me!

705
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,125
Over here!

706
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,089
Hurry!
