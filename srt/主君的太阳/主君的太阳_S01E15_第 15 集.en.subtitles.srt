1
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,226
I am someone special to you.

2
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,146
I will feel better
if you cannot live without me.

3
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:23,940
Well, too bad.

4
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,736
I only feel a little sorry
that I don't have you.

5
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,029
"A little sorry"?

6
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,493
I wasn't waiting for you to remember me.

7
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,621
Your memory would have returned
if I showed this to you.

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,915
But I didn't return it to you.

9
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,335
You kept it and didn't return it to me?

10
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,672
Yes, I thought we were better off
without each other.

11
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,592
I picked up what you threw away,
so I was going to throw it away again.

12
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,469
You can have it.

13
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,345
Were you really...

14
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,057
going to throw it away?

15
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,349
Yes.

16
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,436
If I hadn't gotten my memory back
on my own,

17
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:05,607
you would have thrown it away,
and I never would have found it.

18
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,524
Yes.

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,485
In any case, I threw it away.

20
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,362
Shall I throw it away, too?

21
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,282
It's yours. Do whatever you want to.

22
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:17,577
Okay, I'll throw it away then.

23
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,675
Are you in pain?

24
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,053
Yes, I'm in pain.

25
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,222
It feels like my back is breaking.

26
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,350
I thought you were all healed.

27
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,352
Have you been stabbed in the back?

28
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,522
My heart could have been stabbed.

29
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,487
Does it still hurt?

30
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:58,076
When my memory returned,
I remembered being stabbed, too.

31
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,453
Let's go home.

32
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,622
Okay, let's go home.

33
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,084
-Go to the parking lot.
-I'll go get someone.

34
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,964
I got hurt because of you.
Can't you help me?

35
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,632
That's so cold.

36
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,803
Let's go.

37
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,643
You never came to the hospital
when I was hurt.

38
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,813
You didn't remember me.
There's no reason to be upset about that.

39
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,315
Do you know how much pain I was in?

40
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:33,194
To be honest,
it still hurts every time I breathe.

41
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,864
It must have been very painful.

42
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,701
Is that all?
You should sound more concerned.

43
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,121
Right. It must have been very painful.

44
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,456
Right there. It hurts.

45
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,586
You should drive.

46
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,672
-Me?
-Then, am I supposed to drive?

47
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,675
Open the door.

48
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,526
It will be dangerous if something appears
while you drive.

49
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,528
It's for my safety.

50
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,636
Concentrate on driving.
I'm enduring my pain.

51
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,721
Get going.

52
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,976
I'm sorry, Hanna. I guess Jung-won left
because he wasn't feeling well.

53
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,729
I think he went to find Tae Gong-sil.

54
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,897
He doesn't remember,

55
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,523
but he still seems
to feel attracted to her.

56
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:58,488
Mr. Joo liked her so much
that he almost died saving her.

57
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,948
It's not too surprising, then.

58
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,786
Mr. Joo got hurt trying to save her?

59
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,079
-No--
-Yes.

60
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,125
I see.

61
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,296
Is that how important Tae Gong-sil is
to Mr. Joo?

62
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,396
You and I might look the same,

63
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,732
but you aren't the one
that Jung-won really likes.

64
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,777
Jung-won thinks that
the one he likes is Cha Hui-ju.

65
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,823
I want to tell Jung-won...

66
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,451
who I really am.

67
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,538
I'm sorry, Hui-ju.

68
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,919
I wasn't able to take in my nieces
after my sister died.

69
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,924
Hanna is the one
who was adopted by a British family,

70
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,386
and Hui-ju grew up
in an orphanage in Korea.

71
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,139
You said that I have a twin sister.

72
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,641
I'm going to go and find my twin.

73
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,854
This is a photo that proves they met.

74
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,441
I tried to come to Korea to meet Hui-ju,

75
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:21,904
but Hanna returned and told me
Hui-ju died in an accident.

76
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,990
My sister is dead.

77
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,035
Why did you leave her all alone
without looking for her?

78
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,498
After that, I wasn't able to find Hanna.

79
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,667
So...

80
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,587
why, after 15 years,

81
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,340
has she reappeared before Mr. Joo?

82
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,385
There's a possibility
that she is the accomplice.

83
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,139
Hanna...

84
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,852
would never do that.

85
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,396
He will be surprised to know
that Hanna Brown

86
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,522
is Cha Hui-ju's twin sister.

87
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,901
But if he finds out
you're related to Cha Hui-ju,

88
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,862
Mr. Joo will be very shocked.

89
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,616
He might misunderstand
why you stayed with him.

90
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,284
The time

91
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,204
I spent assisting Mr. Joo...

92
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,667
may just end up as a misunderstanding.

93
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,593
Get some rest. I should go.

94
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,763
What do you want to drink?

95
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,350
I'll have a beer. You can drink some soda.

96
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,522
I don't have soda.
Have some sparkling water.

97
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,984
You said you were in pain.

98
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,029
Do you think I brought you here
just because my back hurts?

99
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,908
You came all this way
even though you knew otherwise.

100
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,458
Let's cancel our agreement
to forget everything.

101
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,919
Let's go over everything again.

102
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,763
Okay, since we're here,
let's talk about some things.

103
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:15,059
I understand you want to run away
because you feel guilty.

104
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:20,189
You may think it's your fault,
but I am also at fault.

105
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,192
Okay, that's it.
I will be more careful from now on.

106
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:28,030
I wanted to keep a distance
to make sure we could end things.

107
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:33,453
But having really experienced death,

108
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,455
I am sure now.

109
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,542
I don't want to end things with you.
I won't do that.

110
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,379
Stay by my side. I'll cope with the rest.

111
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,841
Are you saying you've decided to do that?

112
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:52,805
Yes, so you just have to fall for me
when I seduce you.

113
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,723
Drink.

114
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,977
I don't think I will fall for you
when you seduce me.

115
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,192
You're no longer someone

116
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:09,405
I desperately need, like before.

117
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,993
But I'm your shelter. Did I lose
that ability after I got stabbed?

118
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,204
No, it's not like that.

119
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:21,209
I'm not that scared of ghosts anymore,
so the shelter doesn't have much use now.

120
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:26,088
You are still rich and a really great guy,

121
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:32,345
but the one important thing
that attracted me to you is gone.

122
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:39,227
You said I was a shelter
made from the best marble.

123
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:44,941
But now that you're not scared of ghosts,
I am not attractive anymore?

124
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,067
No.

125
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:50,321
It's as if I liked someone
because he had a lot of money,

126
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:54,283
but he lost all his money,
so I lost interest in him.

127
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:58,162
I thought I lowered myself
as much as I could to match you.

128
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:04,502
But you're saying my value has decreased
so we have to negotiate again.

129
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,714
Don't come down
or lower yourself because of me.

130
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,217
I told you I don't want it.

131
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,803
I should go.

132
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,638
Okay, you can go.

133
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:20,685
I'll look in the mirror
and find new attractive points for you.

134
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,270
Then I'll come to negotiate again.

135
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,105
Sure.

136
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,948
She said you're not attractive.
Did you ever hear that before?

137
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,493
Don't shake.

138
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,161
Don't get angry.

139
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,497
I have to go back to negotiate.

140
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:43,791
Hold it in.

141
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:45,835
Unclench your fist!

142
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,006
This is no fun.

143
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,341
I'm not attractive?

144
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,402
You're very good
at measuring up the situation.

145
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,446
Tell me how much you want.
I'll give you the money.

146
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,117
You seem to have come
to an accurate conclusion.

147
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,829
If I pay you,
your deal with Tae Gong-sil is over.

148
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:27,668
If you drag her in again,
I will make you have a ghost wedding.

149
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,921
In order to do that,
you would have to die first.

150
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:36,761
I won't ever come
between you and your Ms. Tae.

151
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,269
I will talk to Ms. Go about it.

152
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,313
Looks come first?

153
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,191
You're dead. Why does that matter so much?

154
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,525
My gosh.

155
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,695
What?

156
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,281
He's exactly what you want?

157
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,910
But he's alive.

158
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,079
He's not for you to choose. Get lost.

159
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,333
It's going to rain tonight.
Are you going to another GT?

160
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,376
What is GT?

161
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,920
The things Ms. Go asks you to do.
Ghost Training.

162
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,716
Are you less scared of ghosts
because you got used to them?

163
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,139
-I have a deal with her.
-That deal is over now.

164
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,101
I settled that matter with her.

165
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,144
You don't have to thank me.

166
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:31,107
Just give me more points
on my attractiveness.

167
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,444
Oh, you've negotiated my terms with her?

168
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,447
That's good.

169
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,411
You must have heard
I made that deal to save you.

170
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:47,081
I thought it was good
that you woke up safely,

171
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,794
but I felt it was unfair
that I had to pay for it all by myself.

172
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,629
"Pay for it"?

173
00:11:54,213 --> 00:12:00,010
"Sacrifice, devotion, love."
It would be nicer to say words like that.

174
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,639
Such nice feelings
only exist in storybooks.

175
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:08,477
The wolf and goat who met
on the stormy night have nice feelings.

176
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,645
But it's just a storybook.

177
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,691
But you know that a wolf and a goat
can't be together in reality.

178
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,072
When I woke up after nearly dying,
I decided to enter a storybook.

179
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,158
But you must have crawled out of yours.

180
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,910
Mine was a cruel story.

181
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,622
One became a ghost
and visited the other character.

182
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,211
I got scared so I crawled out.
You should return to your world, too.

183
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,381
You told me to get lost three times today.

184
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,800
It means I've endured that three times.

185
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:44,555
Didn't you say so before
that only street dogs cling to people?

186
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,433
You don't seem to understand.

187
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,978
My ears are open so I can hear well,
but I can't understand.

188
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,607
Why did you come again?

189
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,568
We're in a conversation.
Tell her to come back later.

190
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,988
Is your son doing that again?

191
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,283
That's really dangerous.

192
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,203
Let's go.

193
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,079
Where are you going?

194
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,626
Don't touch me.
The shelter shouldn't appear right now.

195
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,085
Please go home.

196
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,964
That's the fourth time
she told me to get lost.

197
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,717
I'm counting!

198
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,389
Don't worry. Is it that way?

199
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,184
It's going to rain.
Aren't you scared at all?

200
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,894
It's bearable.

201
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,104
Is your son in a bad state?

202
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,400
It's no wonder that you can't leave.

203
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,444
Who are you talking to?
Tell me what's going on.

204
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,698
You can't even see her.
You don't have to know.

205
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,785
Right?

206
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,162
Why are you laughing?

207
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,708
You can't even hear her.
You don't have to mind.

208
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,336
You're right. He is like that.

209
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,089
Are you talking about me with that ghost?

210
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,508
I don't have to hear to know that you did.

211
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,012
There he is.

212
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,600
Sir!

213
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,270
Sir!

214
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,063
Sir!

215
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,856
Sir!

216
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,443
I can see this man.

217
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,072
How much has he drunk?

218
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,701
Excuse me! Sir!

219
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,872
Should I wake him like I did before?

220
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,587
The National Song Contest!

221
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,852
I won first place in that show.

222
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,690
That's right. You won first place then.

223
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,859
You shouldn't be lying here.

224
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,694
It's really dangerous lying under a truck.

225
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,119
Let's go now.

226
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,217
You could have just explained this to me.

227
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,474
If that man was dangerous
and had swung a weapon at us,

228
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,851
would you have tried
to save me like before?

229
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,313
What if he had a gun?
You could have gotten shot.

230
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,442
I want to stop dragging you into this.

231
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,487
Are you saying that
I should let you be in danger alone?

232
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,864
It's more dangerous
if you and I are together.

233
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,117
We can't see or hear the same things.

234
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,415
You can hold me
and not see or hear those things.

235
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,628
How can I hold you all the time?

236
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,421
I have my world, too.

237
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,804
So, it's true that it's bearable
without me.

238
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,265
I clung to you so hard
that you were taken by me.

239
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,062
No woman could cling to you
the way that I did.

240
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,190
You held me by my hair,
but I still reappeared.

241
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,026
You told me to get lost so many times,
but I returned.

242
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,822
I'm sorry, Mr. Joo.

243
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,158
You have no reason to keep me
by your side.

244
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,329
Yes, I was taken by you and lost my mind.

245
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,791
You're saying all the right things,
but I still can't understand.

246
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,544
I think I've become a clingy street dog.

247
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,424
If you get away from me and think calmly,
you'll come to your senses.

248
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,844
I won't let you tell me to get lost again.
I'm going to leave.

249
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,013
It's dark, so be careful
on your way home with the ghosts.

250
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,741
You're still here?

251
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,038
What? Someone wants to see me?

252
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,540
Right now?

253
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,667
Who?

254
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,512
Hello.

255
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,977
I asked Jun-seok to bring you here
so I could meet you.

256
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:48,609
Oh, the kid who always asked you
to buy him coffee is Jun-seok.

257
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,488
Gong-sil.

258
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,241
Do you remember me?

259
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,996
I know you.

260
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,831
I am sure...

261
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,543
I saw you in my dreams.

262
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,838
It wasn't any dream.

263
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,216
It was a long dream
you had for three years,

264
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,510
and you were with me.

265
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,113
The sun will rise,
and I will go to your side.

266
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,157
Because you are here.

267
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,161
Meeting you was like
seeing a ray of light.

268
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,624
I'm so happy there's a shelter I can go to
when I'm too scared.

269
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,130
Are you awake, Jung-won?

270
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,394
How can I hold you all the time?

271
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,146
I have my world, too.

272
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,293
Someone who can see and hear
the same things as I do?

273
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,431
I was the one who first found you
in the mountains.

274
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,766
Your spirit came
and told me where you were.

275
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,728
While you were in the hospital,

276
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,522
your spirit didn't go back to you.

277
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,276
We were together for three years.

278
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,321
So, I lived as a ghost for three years?

279
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,535
Is that why I see ghosts now?

280
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,829
I am not sure why we see ghosts.

281
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,791
I don't know why
this happened to me either.

282
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,336
Where did we go?

283
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:18,926
Here.

284
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,057
You were at all the places
that I took photographs of.

285
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,235
I was at these places?

286
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,529
Do you want to go back there?

287
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,033
You will remember the times
you spent with me.

288
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:51,667
So, there's someone who can see and hear
the same things as I do.

289
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,324
You must have
finally recognized me, Uncle.

290
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,828
You changed so much
that I didn't recognize you, Hanna.

291
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:32,291
I heard you went all the way
to the UK to find me.

292
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,209
Why did you do that?

293
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,628
Did something happen
between you and Hui-ju?

294
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,257
Were you involved...

295
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,635
with Hui-ju's death?

296
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,902
Mr. Kim!

297
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,030
When did you get back?

298
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,199
My memory returned while you were gone.

299
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,576
Let's talk.

300
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,995
I have been going crazy
because I had no one to talk to.

301
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,664
-Come in.
-Mr. Joo, before that...

302
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,209
there's something I need to tell you.

303
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,003
What is it?

304
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,380
It's about Cha Hui-ju.

305
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,509
Did you find her twin?

306
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,137
Yes, and the twins...

307
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,931
are my nieces.

308
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:48,158
Mr. Kim is Cha Hui-ju's uncle?

309
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,451
Yes.

310
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,454
The twin sister,
who we think is the kidnapper,

311
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,581
was hanging around near Mr. Joo.

312
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,833
Cha Hui-ju's sister?

313
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:05,967
That's interesting.

314
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,887
You think I was the kidnapper?

315
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,227
These are postcards that you sent.

316
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:16,937
You're right.

317
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,231
I sent them to my friend.

318
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,983
You were wherever I was.

319
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,529
Did you follow me around?

320
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,782
Is that what it looks like?

321
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,662
I guess my uncle was always with you,

322
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,580
so it might look that way.

323
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,835
Uncle.

324
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,130
You always sent me e-mails.

325
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,133
Of course, I never replied.

326
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,261
You told me where you were

327
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,848
and that those places
might help with my education.

328
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:58,562
I only listened to his advice
because he was my only living relative.

329
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,400
She's right.

330
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:08,155
I sent her e-mails once a month.

331
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,407
I thought she might be reading them,

332
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,535
so I didn't let go of that tie with her.

333
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,413
Uncle.

334
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,208
I'm surprised that Hui-ju was the culprit,

335
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,211
but you know I wouldn't do that.

336
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:33,180
Hanna grew up in a very wealthy family.

337
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,350
She wouldn't have any reason to do it,

338
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,769
especially for money.

339
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,899
The Hanna I knew was so bright and kind.

340
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,277
She wouldn't do something like that.

341
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,239
Hui-ju was a little gloomy.

342
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,617
She was greedy, too.

343
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:59,706
Why were you hanging around me
while hiding that you're her twin?

344
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,920
I heard about you when I met with Hui-ju.

345
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,812
He is Joo Jung-won.

346
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,149
Every Christmas,

347
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,362
he would bring presents
to the orphanage I grew up in.

348
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,948
He was like a prince.

349
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,453
I liked him ever since I was a kid.

350
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:44,084
Hui-ju said she felt she was too lacking
to even talk to you.

351
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:50,006
I gave her courage to pursue you,
but her love became a tragedy.

352
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,471
I was interested in you
because Hui-ju liked you.

353
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,516
They say twins are connected.

354
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:06,022
I thought you were interested in me, too.

355
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,608
But you said I was a fake.

356
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,781
It's too bad.

357
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,576
Yes, you're a fake.

358
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,579
I will believe what you are saying...

359
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,667
because Mr. Kim

360
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,086
is guaranteeing that.

361
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,050
I'm returning to the UK soon.

362
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,513
Isn't the statute of limitations
on Hui-ju's case over soon?

363
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:44,853
I wanted to say goodbye to her
once it was over.

364
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,066
But everything has become a mess.

365
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,164
I'm sorry that I did not tell you earlier.

366
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:11,004
I came to you to find out
the person involved in my niece's death.

367
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,758
But that boy looked very hurt.

368
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:21,598
I thought taking care of him
was what I could do for my niece.

369
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,809
That's enough. Please stop.

370
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:31,858
I said you were a recorder and decoder
when we first met.

371
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,905
I guess I have told you way too much.

372
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,826
If it's uncomfortable for me to be around,

373
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,704
then I will leave.

374
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,752
You should do that.

375
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,235
Thanks to you,
he doesn't suspect me anymore.

376
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,871
You must have heard from Mr. Kang.

377
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,706
That I have been deceiving everyone.

378
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,086
You must think I am a bad person, too.

379
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:35,547
No.

380
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,299
I can see Cha Hui-ju.

381
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,679
Hui-ju wasn't looking at you, Mr. Kim.

382
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,519
I heard you see spirits.

383
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,479
Did you see Hui-ju?

384
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,231
Yes.

385
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,610
Hui-ju said she wanted
to protect the culprit.

386
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,416
It will be hard to catch the culprit
if a ghost is protecting that person.

387
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,806
She can't be the culprit, right?

388
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,852
Can you find the culprit?

389
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,274
I really don't want to do it,

390
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,860
but I guess I should do
what Hui-ju is asking.

391
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,075
Are you not suspecting Hanna Brown
because of Mr. Kim?

392
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,620
I'm not.

393
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,081
I'm sure that she is the accomplice.

394
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,083
Then you should find evidence
to catch her.

395
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,419
If she leaves, it will be over.

396
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,881
She came here and even tried to seduce me.

397
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,427
She wouldn't do that if she wasn't sure
there was no evidence.

398
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,349
But you can't just let her go like this.

399
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,268
I have learned everything I wanted to.

400
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,230
I wanted to know who the accomplice was,
and I found out.

401
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,693
She wanted to protect the culprit.
It was because it was her twin.

402
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,320
Is that all?

403
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,823
Cha Hui-ju is dead.

404
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:30,537
Shouldn't you at least try to understand
why she decided to do such a thing?

405
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,374
Don't do that in front of me.
Just do it behind my back with my dad.

406
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,291
You can go.

407
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,377
I will.

408
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,131
I will do it after I leave Kingdom.

409
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,769
Mr. Joo.

410
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,317
I don't want to tell you to get lost, too.

411
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,236
If you're going
to talk about Hui-ju, don't.

412
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,239
I put my ten billion won radar up.

413
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,450
Hui-ju keeps getting caught on it.

414
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,999
When I was dead, or something like that...

415
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,877
Anyway, I saw Hui-ju back then.

416
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,881
I read that book from before
in front of her and closed it.

417
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,634
And I felt at peace.
I could read well, too.

418
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,889
I don't hate Hui-ju anymore.

419
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,933
Doesn't that mean it's over?

420
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,686
I keep seeing Hui-ju.

421
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,813
She was next to that woman, Hanna.

422
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,150
She wanted to protect her accomplice.

423
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,527
Maybe that's why she's there.
Let her do that.

424
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,696
It doesn't look like
investigating the twin

425
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,907
will bring back my money.

426
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,410
I will only find out things
I don't want to know.

427
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,037
But still...

428
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,462
I want to end things here.

429
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,134
But...

430
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,098
She was a criminal, and I was the victim.

431
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,517
I am going to deal with everything.

432
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,562
I can't see or hear her.
Do I have to understand her?

433
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:34,202
So, you should stop seeing that dead girl.

434
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:40,917
Okay.

435
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:45,338
I won't ask you to understand
things that only I can hear and see.

436
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,758
You should live in peace.

437
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:52,011
I wanted to solve this for you,

438
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,138
but I guess the radar is useless now.

439
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,976
Tae Gong-sil.

440
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:03,356
At first, you clung to me because
you hated what you see and hear.

441
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,401
But why do you keep
trying to hear and see things?

442
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,568
Doing that

443
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,571
makes me become useless.

444
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,909
But I'm at peace now.

445
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:22,125
The more we're useless to each other,
the better we'll feel.

446
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:31,426
I thought you couldn't live without me,
so I came to find you.

447
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,013
But you really don't seem to need me.

448
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,056
It's unfair.

449
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,643
If I keep looking at you,
I might tell you to get lost.

450
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,894
You should go.

451
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:19,098
Are you really leaving, Mr. Kang?

452
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:20,975
Yes.

453
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,353
I heard Mr. Kim quit, too. Is that right?

454
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,106
I think so.

455
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,109
Thank you...

456
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,030
for everything.

457
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:46,209
Tae Gong-sil, Mr. Kim, and Mr. Kang
have all quit.

458
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,919
This is crazy.

459
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,755
Then the head of our team...

460
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,855
I've decided to go to the US.

461
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,691
I see. That's good.

462
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,194
-But I can't just leave.
-Why?

463
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,491
Let's have a meal together.

464
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,788
Do you know how many reservations
I canceled because of you?

465
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,458
Okay, let's go eat.

466
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,919
I'll buy. What do you want to eat?

467
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,011
I thought you would want
something expensive.

468
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,680
Is this what you want?

469
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,975
This is the place you almost brought me
to have dinner.

470
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,935
I wanted to see what it was like.

471
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,356
I borrowed the whole place for you.

472
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,816
Eat all you want.

473
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,236
Now that I'm here,
it doesn't seem like much.

474
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,320
It's a plain restaurant.

475
00:35:56,612 --> 00:36:00,199
It's a place suited for people like
friends who met briefly in high school.

476
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,869
So let's eat here and part normally
like old friends.

477
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:04,871
That's enough.

478
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,206
Go get some more pickled radishes.

479
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,224
I'm not a high school student.
I won't just part with you like this.

480
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,450
Cheers. Bottoms up.

481
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,536
You have to drink it in one go.

482
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,079
Okay.

483
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:08,935
That's strange.

484
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,979
I feel like I've been drinking.

485
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,068
Kang Woo, I don't want
to part with you like this.

486
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:22,198
If I ask you out for drinks,
you won't even drink that much.

487
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,741
Have I been drinking?

488
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,247
I don't avoid drinking.

489
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,250
I'm just not good at drinking.

490
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,962
Am I not pretty at all?

491
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,632
Don't I look prettier
now that you're drunk?

492
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,217
You're pretty.

493
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,927
You're very pretty.

494
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:47,974
I thought you were really pretty
when you would suddenly appear before me.

495
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,019
So, why don't you like me?

496
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,147
There's someone
that I really want to protect.

497
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,696
I'm not sure if I'm protecting her at all.

498
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,782
You're not Tae Gong-sil's bodyguard.

499
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,119
I am.

500
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,999
If she just calls out my name,

501
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,918
I can appear right before her.

502
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,756
But she won't call me.

503
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,259
So, I'm...

504
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,346
I'm just watching her.

505
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:32,643
I want her to stop being scared

506
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,604
and to be safe.

507
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,358
That's when...

508
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,405
I can leave my position as her bodyguard.

509
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,878
I don't want to protect you.

510
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,713
That's why I made you drink.

511
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,722
You're making me feel bad for you

512
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,933
because you want to be safe, right?

513
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,490
Where are you going?

514
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:28,991
Here.

515
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,703
Isn't this overseas? Are you going abroad?

516
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,999
There's someone
who can see dead people like me.

517
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,919
-He asked me to come with him.
-Is there such a person?

518
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,922
-Is he really like you?
-Yes.

519
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,093
I don't remember him,
but he knows me very well.

520
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:53,182
My spirit was with him
while I was unconscious for three years.

521
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:59,397
Do you think Gong-sil will come with me?

522
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,482
If she does,

523
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,319
it will be easier to abandon that man.

524
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,281
You saw them from the beginning, right?

525
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,617
What do you think?

526
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,871
If you see the same thing,
he might understand you.

527
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:20,000
But can you leave
the person you like behind?

528
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:27,383
He only sees and hears things he wants to.

529
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,678
And I only hear and see
things that are useless.

530
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,763
He won't be comfortable with it.

531
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,761
You're leaving earlier than I thought.

532
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,305
I almost missed you.

533
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,391
You said you would let me leave.
Did you come to get me?

534
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,186
Do you think I'll just let you go?

535
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,314
You said you believed me
in front of my uncle.

536
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:27,526
If I catch you as the culprit,
Mr. Kim would be hurt.

537
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:32,114
The bodyguard my father sent
wants to hand you over to the police.

538
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,532
But I won't do that.

539
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,827
You and I. Let's end things here.

540
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,957
Give me my necklace and...

541
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,251
get lost.

542
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,462
You're confident that I am the culprit.

543
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:52,009
Did Tae Gong-sil
hear something from Hui-ju?

544
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,844
Don't get her involved.

545
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,138
Do you want to die
and meet Hui-ju yourself?

546
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,850
-Do so if you want to.
-She must be special to you.

547
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,187
Have you totally erased
Cha Hui-ju from your life now?

548
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,857
I waited in vain for 15 years to meet you.

549
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:11,904
Did you approach me again,
as you've done with Hui-ju before?

550
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,240
Seducing me must not have been your part.

551
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:19,203
Even if you're twins,
I was never attracted to you.

552
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,792
Then, I will tell you the truth,
Joo Jung-won.

553
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,797
The woman you loved was not Cha Hui-ju.

554
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,758
It was her twin sister,

555
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,052
Hanna.

556
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,125
I'm leaving.

557
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,586
Please help me. I am sorry.

558
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,887
My first love wasn't Cha Hui-ju...

559
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:20,973
but you?

560
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:26,103
Hui-ju wouldn't approach you,
so Hanna pretended to be Hui-ju.

561
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,617
Are you Joo Jung-won?

562
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:42,828
I'm Cha Hui-ju.

563
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:57,009
Hanna shined as if she owned
everything in the world.

564
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,470
And she ended up having you, too.

565
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:05,225
It was what dark and unhappy Hui-ju
had wanted so much.

566
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,853
But it was taken from her.

567
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,359
Hui-ju got really mad.

568
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,778
That's why she did that.

569
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,573
I'm sorry,

570
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:21,742
Joo Jung-won.

571
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,913
Hui-ju and Hanna.
The twins did it together.

572
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,748
Cha Hui-ju did it alone.

573
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:32,086
Hanna wouldn't do such a thing,
she was like an angel.

574
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,214
Try to remember the girl you liked.

575
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:47,017
One of them died. You saw it, right?

576
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,353
The moment she died.

577
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,532
Which one do you think died?

578
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,119
Was it Hanna or Hui-ju?

579
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:08,622
Who are you?

580
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,001
-Are you Cha Hui-ju?
-I'm Hanna, the good one.

581
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,379
Cha Hui-ju, the bad one, died.

582
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,674
That's what you thought
for 15 years, right?

583
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,342
That the one who died is an evil bitch.

584
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,471
If the good one died,
that would be a tragedy.

585
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,474
You...

586
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:29,768
are Cha Hui-ju, right?

587
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,560
Cha Hui-ju will die here.

588
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,355
If not, I will kill Joo Jung-won.

589
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:17,900
Please...

590
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,903
die as Cha Hui-ju.

591
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,094
I am alive.

592
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,059
I am Hanna, the good one.

593
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:58,690
I'm Hanna, the one you loved.
That's why I returned to you.

594
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,944
I thought you would love me
if I returned to you,

595
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,321
but another woman was in my way.

596
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:06,907
It's not you.

597
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:08,992
You're a fake.

598
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,369
Why are you doing this now?

599
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,913
You were hurt

600
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:17,292
and never tried to understand
why the dead girl did that.

601
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,422
If you just believed what you knew,
you could have lived in peace.

602
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:26,802
Did she really die...

603
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,429
because of me?

604
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,600
Yes, she died because of you.

605
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,033
I am Hanna. Don't you believe me?

606
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,788
But you have no way of proving I'm wrong.

607
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,130
In any case...

608
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,883
-I am sorry.
-I am sorry.

609
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,885
-Joo Jung-won.
-Joo Jung-won.

610
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:03,857
Cha Hui-ju.

611
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,115
What did you just call me?

612
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,241
Cha Hui-ju.

613
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:15,952
Hui-ju, it's me.

614
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,164
The only person
who knows you're Cha Hui-ju.

615
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,794
Did you like living as Hanna Brown
instead of me?

616
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,255
What are you doing?

617
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,967
I borrowed her body because
I wanted to talk to you in person.

618
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,386
I don't believe that.

619
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:34,680
Go away.

620
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:36,598
You don't believe me?

621
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,102
Shall I tell you
the last words you told me?

622
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,605
"Cha Hui-ju will die here.

623
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,524
If not, I will kill Joo Jung-won.

624
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,734
Please die as Cha Hui-ju."

625
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,574
I died as you and let you live as me.

626
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,119
Why did you return, Hui-ju?

627
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,456
Are you really Hanna?

628
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,131
I stole this woman's body to meet you.

629
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,801
Hui-ju, shall we leave together?

630
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,234
Cha Hui-ju stole Hanna Brown's life,

631
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:32,571
and I will steal this woman's life.

632
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,032
I died because of you, right?

633
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,994
You can make me live again.

634
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,663
Help me. We're twins.

635
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,087
Okay, let's leave together.

636
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,090
Just like Cha Hui-ju lived as Hanna Brown,

637
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,092
you can live as Tae Gong-sil.

638
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,094
I will help you.

639
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,849
And let's never return to Joo Jung-won.

640
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,602
This is good.

641
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,856
I really didn't want this woman
to be with him.

642
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:12,861
If this woman disappears,
Joo Jung-won will be alone again.

643
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:18,533
I really liked the story about
Joo Jung-won being cursed by Cha Hui-ju.

644
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,371
I will leave another curse with him.

645
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:37,052
Don't run away when you're scared.
It's embarrassing.

646
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,365
You could have chosen not to return,

647
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:02,077
and you could have left
without saying anything.

648
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,287
Why did you tell him?

649
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,706
Did you want him in pain again?

650
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,210
I thought I could have him
if I returned as Hanna.

651
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,879
But he called me a fake.

652
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,644
He knew that you're not the one he loved.

653
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,857
Yes, I'm not the Hanna he loved.

654
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,406
What?

655
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,241
She's working.

656
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,583
Jung-won doesn't know the real you.

657
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:55,380
Yes, he never really met
the real Cha Hui-ju.

658
00:52:56,381 --> 00:53:01,177
But it's me, Cha Hui-ju,
who will remain in his heart as a curse.

659
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,598
That must be the real you.

660
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,100
Yes, because I'm Cha Hui-ju.

661
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:12,397
I heard you said
you wanted to protect me, Hanna.

662
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,192
Let's go, Hanna. I will protect you.

663
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:24,492
The ghost of Hanna said
she wanted to protect Hui-ju.

664
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,913
And she took all the blame.

665
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:33,168
In other words,
it's sacrifice, devotion, and love.

666
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,217
But you didn't realize that
until the end, Cha Hui-ju.

667
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:48,224
You are not Hanna.

668
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,603
Did you fool me?

669
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,689
Cha Hui-ju, you're the one
who made Hanna die

670
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:56,900
and fooled everyone.

671
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,531
There's nothing left to prove that.

672
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,327
Hui-ju.

673
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,881
You left this

674
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,801
by your sister.

675
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,931
Luckily, there are two days left
before the statute of limitations expires.

676
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:43,548
What I really stole was Hanna's life,
not this necklace.

677
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,051
But no one knows it.

678
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,522
I'm sorry, Hanna.

679
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:02,942
My dear sister.

680
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:15,246
Hui-ju.

681
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,794
I am going to be here for you.

682
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:44,943
It's over, Gong-sil.

683
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,612
It's really over now.

684
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,400
Hui-ju...

685
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:29,571
No, Hanna wants to say something to you
before she leaves.

686
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,614
You must want to talk to her too, right?

687
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,834
Jung-won.

688
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:47,797
I don't want you to be hurt because of me.

689
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:54,512
I'm sorry.

690
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,641
I hated you without knowing anything.

691
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,186
I'm sorry.

692
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,311
Why are you crying?

693
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:29,107
I'm crying instead of you
because you can't cry.

694
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:48,084
My 10 billion won radar.
You did a great job.

695
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,086
Let's go. I'll buy you something nice.

696
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,799
I am leaving.

697
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:02,265
I feel good that I solved
the Cha Hui-ju case before leaving.

698
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,729
It's a relief
that I wasn't totally useless.

699
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,731
Where are you going?

700
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,026
I met someone who can see and hear
the same things as I do.

701
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,194
I'm going somewhere with that person.

702
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,459
When you came to see me as a spirit,

703
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,671
you said I was as bright as the sun.

704
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,466
I think...

705
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,512
I'm a sun that should only shine
for dead people.

706
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:50,772
I just want to be a sun
who is popular with ghosts.

707
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:58,321
But when I see you,
I feel like I'm someone with bad luck

708
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,491
who makes people die.

709
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,952
So, I get scared of myself
and hate myself.

710
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,918
So, you won't even feel bad without me.

711
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:16,798
I only make you be scared
and hate yourself?

712
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,926
I don't want to be that kind of sun
by your side.

713
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,390
Please, just tell me to get lost now.

714
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,895
Until now,

715
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,524
I was able to tell you to get lost...

716
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:43,741
because I probably knew
that you would come back to me again.

717
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:52,667
I will do as you ask.

718
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:57,547
Get lost,

719
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,382
Tae Gong-sil.

720
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:52,602
If she really disappears like this,

721
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,605
I...

722
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,941
am going to be destroyed.

723
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,039
