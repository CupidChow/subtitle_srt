1
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,036
PAPER, CANS AND BOTTLES

2
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,080
Ms. Tae.

3
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,626
Yes?

4
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,379
Room 404 moved out today. Clean it up.

5
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,424
Room 404?

6
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,385
I don't know why
people keep leaving that room.

7
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,679
Maybe the drawer I put in there
brings bad luck.

8
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,058
Ms. Tae, throw out
the drawer in that room.

9
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,226
Okay.

10
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,828
Oh, my!

11
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:18,972
Gosh.

12
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,815
I have to pretend I can't see it.

13
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:30,900
Gosh!

14
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,177
Go away!

15
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,724
Go away!

16
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,028
FUNERAL

17
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,266
Excuse me.

18
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,020
Yes.

19
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,027
The old lady asked me to give you this.

20
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,490
SAVINGS BANKBOOK

21
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,369
My mother?

22
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:35,960
This is...

23
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,921
It's over ten million won.

24
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,385
-It's for real.
-Oh, my gosh.

25
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:49,682
She wants you to use it for the funeral
and the rest to pay your debts.

26
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,646
-Mother.
-She wanted me to tell you something.

27
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:57,899
Tell me.

28
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,657
"You fool, if you gamble again,
I'll come and cut off your wrist.

29
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,076
Don't gamble, you fool!"

30
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,790
That's what she said.

31
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,668
Let me see.

32
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,171
It really is Mom's account book.

33
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,633
How did she have over ten million won?

34
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,675
Give it to me.

35
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,053
It's not all yours.
Half of the money is mine.

36
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,181
Why is it yours?
Mother asked her to give it to me.

37
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:34,102
You already used up everything.
Half of this is mine.

38
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,897
What did you ever do for Mom?
Why would half of this be yours?

39
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,440
What did you do?

40
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:44,654
You sold all the land to gamble
and I got divorced because of you.

41
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,739
Did you get divorced because of me?

42
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,699
Of course it's because of you, who else?

43
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,702
My finger got cut off
because you couldn't pay off the debt!

44
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,540
Why is that my fault?
Okay, hit me with that hand!

45
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,166
-You!
-Go on!

46
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,627
Why are you yelling at your brother?

47
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,964
You shouldn't do this to me.
You asked me to be the guarantor.

48
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,676
What else could I have done?
I couldn't have just let him die!

49
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,555
I can't stand this!
I can't stand this anymore.

50
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,224
-Shut it!
-Don't say that to me!

51
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,727
Your brother was so good to you!

52
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,190
-Give me my money!
-This is so ridiculous.

53
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,696
Are you saying there is a ghost here?

54
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,489
Yes.

55
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,077
My late wife is still in this house.

56
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,373
I thought about selling
this house for my children.

57
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,752
But my late wife doesn't want that.

58
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,548
So, you'll stay right in the middle
of my golf course site?

59
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,636
Okay. Let's negotiate.

60
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,432
My wife is still here.
How can I let this house get demolished?

61
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,767
So, your late wife is here...

62
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,231
Okay. If she's really here,
let's negotiate together.

63
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,486
What does she say?

64
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,030
I can tell by looking at that flower.

65
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,909
My wife was very fond of that flower.

66
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:18,581
When I decided to sell this house,
that flower started to wither away.

67
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,876
But when I decided not to sell it,

68
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,630
it blossomed again, as you can see.

69
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,635
Are you saying your wife
gave her opinion through that flower?

70
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,677
Yes.

71
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,014
Then I should negotiate with that flower.

72
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,743
Please listen carefully
and tell me your opinion.

73
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,747
You don't want to sell
this house but I must buy it.

74
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,082
Can't you sell it?

75
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,001
If you'll sell it,
please nod with the flower.

76
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,506
If not, I will cut off the flower.

77
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,551
What are you doing?

78
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,761
I'm negotiating.

79
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,141
I'll give you three seconds.

80
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:25,022
One, two, three.

81
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,698
Are you crazy?

82
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,200
You're the crazy one.

83
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:41,038
You're trying to change a decision
we made because of a dead person.

84
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,707
Isn't that crazy?

85
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,673
I cut off your late wife's opinion.

86
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,175
You should go
with your children's opinion.

87
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,595
Please sign this.

88
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,443
You're so cruel!
Whatever you say, my wife is here!

89
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,155
No, she's not.
Please get a hold of yourself.

90
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,825
If you take a person's heart lightly
because you can't see it,

91
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,077
you'll be struck by lightning!

92
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:25,833
I'm going to continue to wisely ignore
things that I cannot see.

93
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,631
If I am wrong,
let me be struck by lightning.

94
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,107
I wasn't struck by lightning.

95
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,444
But your family struck it rich today.

96
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:54,862
Congratulations.

97
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,788
If there are ghosts,
they will come after you.

98
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,464
Are you really not scared of ghosts?

99
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,134
Why would I be scared of the dead?
It's the living that's scary.

100
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,306
I need to check the contract again.
Give me the recording.

101
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,769
Yes, I read the whole thing
and recorded in file number four.

102
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,983
Kingdom Golf Course Site
Purchase Agreement.

103
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,278
The seller is Kim Han-yeong.
Hereafter known as the seller.

104
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,448
The buyer is Kingdom.
Hereafter known as the buyer.

105
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:43,494
The buyer and seller
will agree to the following.

106
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,927
What is that? Is it a person?

107
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,515
I think she's waving at us. Shall I stop?

108
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,808
Just ignore her.

109
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,158
-What is it?
-A light suddenly flashed.

110
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,951
Was it lightning?

111
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,288
-Oh, my gosh. What is this?
-Thank you.

112
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,623
Oh, my.

113
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,044
What?

114
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,423
I thought you didn't see me.
But I guess you did.

115
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,176
What shall I do?

116
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,019
-Keep going.
-Yes, sir.

117
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,610
Why were you standing there?
You could have had to wait all night.

118
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,739
Some lady told me
that a car would come if I stood there.

119
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,909
That lady must be some kind of a ghost
to know that.

120
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,078
Yes, she's a ghost.

121
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,708
She said you could avoid
lightning but not me.

122
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,502
She was right.

123
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:23,052
Are you going to Seoul by any chance?

124
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,011
-Yes.
-No.

125
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,807
-Let her off somewhere nearby.
-Yes, Mr. Joo.

126
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,185
KINGDOM GOLF COURSE SITE
PURCHASE AGREEMENT

127
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,231
Are you the president of Kingdom?

128
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,445
-Did you feel that tingle?
-No.

129
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,281
I just felt a really strong tingle.

130
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,700
-It was really strong, right?
-No.

131
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,911
Oh, okay.

132
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,754
Isn't Kingdom...

133
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:02,841
the really big shopping mall? Right?

134
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,263
I live really nearby.
If you're going there--

135
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,308
I think the intersection looks fine.
You should get off there.

136
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,727
Okay, I will.

137
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,531
Just keep going.
Please get away from here.

138
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:27,867
Miss.

139
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,568
Are you okay, miss?

140
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,778
I am. Thank you.

141
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,784
Excuse me.

142
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,833
RESTROOM

143
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,836
We had no choice but to bring her here
because she screamed.

144
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,756
Maybe she just made a scene
because I told her to get off.

145
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,382
It didn't seem like that.

146
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,677
I wonder what scared her so much.

147
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,343
What is she doing?

148
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,764
You said you got
into an accident after drinking.

149
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,642
I can't understand
why you still want to drink.

150
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,480
No, I'm okay.
I can't drink right now. Sorry.

151
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,324
Happy now?

152
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,035
I'm not married yet.

153
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,417
I'm pretty? Really?

154
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,714
What?

155
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,383
Hold on. Wait.

156
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,928
Stop following me. Go away.

157
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,181
I said, stop following me.

158
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,565
It's not coming after me. It's gone.

159
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,990
There are two things I hate.

160
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,534
One is people touching my money
and the other is people touching me.

161
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,537
I cut off the flower
that tampered with my money.

162
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,498
What shall I do
with the hand that touched me?

163
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,667
I'm sorry if I offended you.

164
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,504
I was scared
because the man kept following me.

165
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,340
I can't see anything.

166
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,428
He was there. He came after me.

167
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,264
But when I touched you, he disappeared.

168
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,684
I'm glad I listened to her
and got in your car.

169
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,854
That lady who's like a ghost?

170
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,565
Is she friends with the guy following you?

171
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,403
You should go have
another drink with them.

172
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,739
They're not here now.

173
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,617
I think it's because of you.

174
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,626
I do have a special ability
for fending off tiresome people.

175
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:07,920
Do you want to see it?

176
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,763
Let go and stay here.

177
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,057
Don't be startled. Watch carefully.

178
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,317
Excuse me!

179
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,739
She's coming after us.

180
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,909
She's crazy. Just leave her there.

181
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:12,109
She said you could avoid
lightning but not me. She was right.

182
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,438
It's not here.

183
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:51,899
Why isn't it here?

184
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,612
Where is it?

185
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,049
I wish the rain would stop
and the sun would come out.

186
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,849
Soccer player Yoo Hye-seong
is getting married

187
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,684
to the top star Tae I-ryeong.

188
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:32,898
We will report about where
and how their wedding will take place.

189
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,193
Did you see this morning's news?

190
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,197
It was reported that Tae I-ryeong
will be getting married at Kingdom.

191
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,741
Kingdom was mentioned for only 15 seconds.

192
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,286
It's Tae I-ryeong's wedding announcement,
not our advertisement.

193
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,712
I'm paying her to be our model,
so it is our advertisement.

194
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,174
Make sure you get
enough publicity out of the event.

195
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,010
I'll get ten times
the publicity out of it.

196
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,053
By the way,

197
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,514
there's something you should see.

198
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,393
An anonymous letter
was sent to the wedding hall.

199
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,777
-This is Yoo Hye-seong.
-Yes.

200
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,904
But...

201
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:25,200
Doesn't it look like
the two in the photo are getting married?

202
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:35,669
If this isn't fabricated, Yoo Hye-seong
will have to pay for his past.

203
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,257
Send her an invitation.

204
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,260
Don't send one to her.

205
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,679
Tae Gong-sil?

206
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,018
-Well...
-Tae Gong-sil. She's...

207
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,520
She has the same surname as you.

208
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,939
She's pretty. Were you close?

209
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,067
No, we weren't. Still, invite her.

210
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,199
Oh, my gosh.

211
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:19,796
If you just opened the cans for us,
we could eat on our own.

212
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,549
No, let's just eat together.

213
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,052
Didn't your mom come home yesterday?

214
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:29,181
My mom is busy making money.
That's why she couldn't come.

215
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:34,936
The lady from Room 202
said that you're weird.

216
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,191
-She said you're a crazy jobless person.
-No, I'm not.

217
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,820
I became a little different
after I was in a big accident.

218
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,408
I tried working,
so that I could have a normal life.

219
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,495
-Here's your coffee.
-All right.

220
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,956
-Oh, my!
-Hey!

221
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,168
What are you doing?

222
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,797
I didn't last long
because scary people came to my office.

223
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,759
I even had a guy who liked me.

224
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,606
Oh, my gosh!

225
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,734
But someone kept interfering.

226
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,613
I tried all sorts of jobs
to make a living.

227
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,201
Hello.

228
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,288
Where to?

229
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:57,477
I'm always scared because of the people
who might turn up any second.

230
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,647
It's hard for me to keep my head up.

231
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,528
I wish there was just one place
in this world where I could go and hide.

232
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,990
Get a boyfriend.

233
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:15,453
My mom says she meets guys
because she's lonely and stressed.

234
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,497
You should do it, too.

235
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,875
Guys?

236
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,297
I said, stop following me.

237
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,722
Would he meet me?

238
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,528
She was my girlfriend
when I wasn't famous.

239
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,072
But she dumped me.

240
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,411
I didn't know she'd send this
to the wedding hall.

241
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,207
Make sure the press doesn't know.
She is a really bad person.

242
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,958
Then you should cut her off.

243
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,544
Why do you keep that on?

244
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,466
I'm keeping it on as a reminder.

245
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:15,055
The hatred for the woman who left me
gave me a reason to work hard.

246
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,974
You worked hard
and now you're getting married.

247
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,894
Then she'll come to see it.

248
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,732
Please make sure the security is tight.

249
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:31,446
I will charge you
with all the extra expenses for security.

250
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,708
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

251
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,436
This wedding is also big news overseas.

252
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,982
Reporters from all over the world
will come that day.

253
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,943
You'll get publicity across the world.

254
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:14,823
Kingdom will become a landmark
for tourists after this event.

255
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:19,786
If we can attract
Chinese tourists through Chinese fans,

256
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,914
it will hugely affect Kingdom's sales.

257
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,503
He's a famous soccer player.

258
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,092
Oh, my gosh!

259
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:46,855
Who are you?

260
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,401
Why are you doing this to me?

261
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:15,342
I just have to tell him about the thing
you buried under the tree, right?

262
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:25,060
I think I might be able to talk
to him if I get on the elevator with him.

263
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,614
Mr. Yoo Hye-seong!

264
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,116
Hold on!

265
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,286
What are you doing here? Who are you?

266
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,164
Well...

267
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,920
It's me.

268
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,966
What's wrong, Mr. Joo?

269
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,219
She seems suspicious. Get her out of here.

270
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,055
-Let's go.
-Sir, it's me. Sir!

271
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,807
Hold on.

272
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,143
We met on that rainy day, remember?

273
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,105
Don't you remember
telling me off for touching you?

274
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,192
We had that tingling thing
in the car, too.

275
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,195
I left my clothes in there.
Do you remember?

276
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,412
I came to meet you,

277
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,623
but then I had a reason
to meet Yoo Hye-seong.

278
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,836
You have to meet me
and a famous star, too.

279
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:33,920
You're really busy.

280
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,465
I'm not meeting
Yoo Hye-seong because I want to.

281
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,135
You're the one who is special to me.

282
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,639
If you stay by my side,
I won't have to meet him...

283
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,352
Are you a gold-digger
who is trying to fool with me?

284
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:54,315
Or are you a crazy person
who should be at home but keeps escaping?

285
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,069
I'll call a police car
or an ambulance for you.

286
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,363
Which car would you like to ride?

287
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,743
I've been in a police car.

288
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,537
And I've been
in an ambulance several times.

289
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,832
But I don't ever want to ride either.

290
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,209
Then just leave quietly.

291
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,547
If you keep clinging to me, I'll use
a more violent way to get rid of you.

292
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:18,798
Okay?

293
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,968
It's not nice to have
someone to cling to you, right?

294
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,723
All you did was look into one's eyes
and they keep following you.

295
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,642
And they ask for favors
that don't concern you.

296
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,980
A lot of people do it to me,
so I know how hard it is.

297
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,441
I'll leave now.

298
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,084
My brother is in Spain.

299
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,755
His new girlfriend is even younger.
She's pretty.

300
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:07,222
Mr. Joo isn't like your brother.
He doesn't have women around him.

301
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,141
Maybe it's because that
dead girl's ghost is haunting him.

302
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,101
Maybe he needs an exorcism.

303
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,355
I should find him someone to marry.

304
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,023
That would be hard.

305
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,859
Haven't you heard that rumors
are going around

306
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,820
about Mr. Joo being cursed
by his first love?

307
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,782
Every time he tried to get married,
the woman's family would fall apart.

308
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:30,078
There's a rumor about the curse,
so it will be hard to get married.

309
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,371
Curse?

310
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,374
How can you say that about your nephew?

311
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,089
I know. How can they say that?

312
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:46,803
He just has a bad personality.
He has never even called me uncle.

313
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:52,267
That's because you're so young, honey.

314
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,187
I guess so.

315
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:02,902
"Stars are falling down.

316
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,243
The sun is...

317
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,831
shining.

318
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,210
It seems...

319
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,382
It seems like

320
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,635
it will get colder

321
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,764
tomorrow."

322
00:31:56,497 --> 00:32:00,168
RÉSUMÉ, KANG WOO

323
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,505
This is the best room that we have here.

324
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,842
Are you only going to stay for a month?

325
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,135
Yes.

326
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,347
You can hang out your laundry
and work out on the rooftop.

327
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,140
The view is amazing, too.

328
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,649
Go away!

329
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,568
Go away!

330
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:13,950
Are you human?

331
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,455
Yes.

332
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,333
You're human.

333
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,088
So, you moved into Room 404.

334
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:32,301
The old lady isn't there anymore,
so you will be able to sleep well.

335
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,263
Did an old lady use to live there?

336
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,183
She didn't live there.
She was just there for a while.

337
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:48,151
I'm the night-time manager,
so tell me if you need anything.

338
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,865
I'm sorry for startling you earlier.

339
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,326
I was startled
and thought you weren't human.

340
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,537
You didn't seem human, either.

341
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,541
You were like a cat.

342
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,172
A cat that was
sleeping happily in the sun.

343
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,633
I see.

344
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,221
So, why did you wake a sleeping cat?

345
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,155
He's handsome.

346
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,255
Please...

347
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,135
meet him.

348
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,393
All right, pose together.

349
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,189
Okay, good. Lean on his shoulder.

350
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:09,857
All right.

351
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:14,612
Are you not going to join
the European league after you marry?

352
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,199
No, I'm going to contact a new agency.

353
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,829
You said you wouldn't go to Europe.

354
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,249
You were injured
and you're not that young anymore.

355
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,127
If you go back now,
you'll just lose your star value.

356
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,878
You'll lose your popularity.

357
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,464
I'm a soccer player.

358
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,050
Not a star.

359
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,554
And I want to keep playing
in a bigger stage.

360
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:42,890
Hye-seong.

361
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:49,021
People call us the Beckham
and Victoria of Korea.

362
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:52,817
Victoria doesn't want to see Beckham...

363
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,069
ruin his career.

364
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,905
You're not confident, either.

365
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,505
Let's talk about this later.

366
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,801
I heard there aren't
any teams that want you.

367
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,389
Didn't your manager tell you?

368
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,912
You said you'd keep looking.

369
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,413
Give up.

370
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,585
Choosing to live here as Tae I-ryeong's
husband is better than going to Europe.

371
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,338
Never mind. I'll go find out for myself.

372
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,423
That's not what you should be focusing on.

373
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,426
This came again.

374
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,645
YOO HYE-SEONG, I KNOW EVERYTHING

375
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,862
What's in here?

376
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:25,701
It's what I'll use to blackmail you
when you abandon me.

377
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,162
Why would I abandon you?

378
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,748
You should keep the key.

379
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,003
I was at my worst

380
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,339
when Mi-gyeong was with me.

381
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,928
I did a lot of things
that people would criticize me for.

382
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:49,100
My ugly past is probably all in there.

383
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,436
Did you find it? Where is it?

384
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,482
It wasn't there.
Mi-gyeong must have taken it.

385
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,653
Is she blackmailing me
with what was in there?

386
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,864
Don't worry. Just trust me.

387
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,743
If you stay with me,
I'll take care of everything.

388
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,422
You startled me.

389
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,300
I have a favor to ask you.

390
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,887
Will the president
meet with Yoo Hye-seong?

391
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,223
I believe they're meeting today.

392
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,560
-I can't take you there.
-I guess you can't.

393
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:38,941
Then could you hand this to Yoo Hye-seong?

394
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,903
He'll come to see me
once he sees that note.

395
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,906
Please give it to him.

396
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,451
What...

397
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,588
I'm so sleepy.

398
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,258
I wish this would be over, so I can sleep.

399
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,355
YOO HYE-SEONG IS CHEERING YOU ON!

400
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,276
She must have been watching him from here.

401
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,407
Watch what?

402
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,290
Darn, I thought he was a good guy.

403
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,502
What is this?

404
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,673
I will wait beneath the tree
in the Central Square of Sky Park.

405
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,135
Who is this? Is she Kim Mi-gyeong?

406
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,429
How do you know her?

407
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,390
She's blackmailing Yoo Hye-seong.

408
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,767
Blackmail? It's not like that.

409
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,435
Where is she?

410
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,605
She's not with me right now.

411
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:01,982
Where did she go?

412
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:04,985
She is...

413
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,030
dead.

414
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,282
She's dead?

415
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,332
So you're the one blackmailing him?

416
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,375
No.

417
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,587
I am just trying to tell him
how she feels for him.

418
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,978
YOO HYE-SEONG, I KNOW EVERYTHING

419
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:45,609
She said she always wants
to protect and support him.

420
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,903
Please give this to Yoo Hye-seong,

421
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,906
so he'll know how she feels.

422
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:02,877
No!

423
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,674
She's dead and it's over.
Don't bother the living.

424
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,613
NEW STAR GAMELAND

425
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,697
All right.

426
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,660
Mother.

427
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,455
Okay!

428
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,043
Excuse me.

429
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,338
You're the girl from before.

430
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,465
Thank you.

431
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,967
Isn't this a gambling place?

432
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,347
The old lady told you not to gamble.

433
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,807
Stay out of my business.

434
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,144
How can you do this?

435
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:06,482
She asked you not to do this.
That's why I brought you the money.

436
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,692
What do you have to do
with my late mother?

437
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,903
Let go! You're bringing bad luck!

438
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,447
Gosh.

439
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:34,009
Right, what I'm doing
is all going to waste.

440
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,971
Dead people's words aren't important.

441
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,682
No one listens to them.

442
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,122
Gosh.

443
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,250
Gosh.

444
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,964
Please go! Don't follow me!

445
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:16,176
Stop bothering me!
People think I'm crazy because of you!

446
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,013
Please leave me alone!

447
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,524
Are you sure Kim Mi-gyeong
is the one blackmailing you?

448
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,443
I think there's a mistake.

449
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,821
No, I'm sure it's her.

450
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:40,159
I saw her hanging around our office.

451
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,453
You saw her yourself?

452
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:48,500
She is...

453
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,670
dead.

454
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,425
I will stop her. Don't worry too much.

455
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,219
If I'm with you, everything will work out.

456
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,430
We loved each other.

457
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,061
-I don't know why she's doing this.
-It's because of money.

458
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,273
What else would the living want?

459
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,778
Aren't you scared
that you'll lose what you have?

460
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:17,738
I'm...

461
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,991
scared of Mi-gyeong's heart.

462
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,079
You can't see it. Why are you scared?

463
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,289
You should be scared of what you can see.

464
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,711
In any case, you'll be able
to get through this.

465
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,930
I have joined Joo Jung-won's security team
at Kingdom.

466
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,892
Yes, I will keep watching him.

467
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,734
FROM: YOO HYE-SEONG, TAE I-RYEONG
TO: TAE GONG-SIL

468
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,620
WEDDING INVITATION

469
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:10,833
Wow, I'll be able to meet
Yoo Hye-seong thanks to I-ryeong.

470
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:36,817
This is not Tae I-ryeong's wedding.
It's Kingdom's advertisement day.

471
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:41,780
I made sure they see our logo
if they take shots of the couple.

472
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:44,741
Make sure it's big,
so that people can see it.

473
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,453
Big, so we can get our money's worth.

474
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,790
-Big.
-Yes, big.

475
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:18,233
THE LATE KIM MI-GYEONG

476
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,950
You should come with me.

477
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,956
It might not work.

478
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:37,544
But I feel bad about letting him
be mistaken about you.

479
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,646
She came all the way here.

480
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,107
Why is she trying so hard
to meet Yoo Hye-seong?

481
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,069
She said she has a message
from a dead person.

482
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,697
Get the security team to stop her.

483
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,366
Yes, sir.

484
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,326
Yes, sir.

485
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:15,249
Mr. Kang, there's a lady
who was caught on camera 4 of Area A.

486
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,501
We were told to follow her.

487
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,966
Lee Han-ju, please keep an eye
on the woman who's passing by you.

488
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:34,518
Cat?

489
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,855
You can take photos and tell people
you're friends with me.

490
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,651
-Thank you.
-You're so pretty.

491
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,070
Didn't Tae Gong-sil come?

492
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,656
Gong-sil? Big Sun? Is she coming, too?

493
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:53,203
That's right, she was called Big Sun
and you were called Little Sun, right?

494
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:57,666
That's right. I wonder how she turned out.

495
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,460
I heard that she become a little weird.

496
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,713
-Why?
-She did?

497
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:06,717
I'm a friend of the bride.

498
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:10,846
TAE GONG-SIL

499
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,349
You're on the list. Please go inside.

500
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,069
-Go and check.
-Yes, sir.

501
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,953
She was invited by Tae I-ryeong.

502
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,163
She was?

503
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,959
Is she on the list? Did you check?

504
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,712
Yes, she's a high school friend
of Tae I-ryeong's.

505
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,797
And her name is Tae Gong-sil.

506
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,884
Tae Gong-sil...

507
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,971
So, did they let her in?

508
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:04,816
Excuse me.

509
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:06,860
Who are you?

510
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:13,200
Why do you have this?

511
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:18,330
Are you the one
who's been blackmailing me?

512
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,168
What about Mi-gyeong? Where is Mi-gyeong?

513
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,170
Did she come with you?

514
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,589
Where is she?

515
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,806
Is she trying to blackmail me for money?

516
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,853
Okay. I'll give you all the money.

517
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:44,981
Where is Mi-gyeong?

518
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,318
Where is she?

519
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,335
Mi-gyeong...

520
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,172
is dead.

521
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:12,676
What?

522
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,348
She said she was already sick
when she left you.

523
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,935
And she was sick
for a while before she died.

524
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,900
But you had a misunderstanding about her.

525
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,489
So, I came to tell you
how she really felt.

526
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,418
Why isn't Hye-seong here?

527
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:50,839
Where's Hye-seong?

528
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:52,966
I-ryeong...

529
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,969
Yoo Hye-seong disappeared.

530
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:58,972
What?

531
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:04,227
He drove out in his car. Has he run away?

532
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,980
Maybe he met the blackmailer.

533
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,066
She couldn't have come.
That woman is dead.

534
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,236
I mean...

535
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,280
I know you're the one
who was blackmailing him.

536
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:18,200
You should have kept an eye on him
if you were doing that to keep him.

537
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,746
If you ruin my event,
you'll see what real blackmail is like.

538
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,832
-But...
-What are you looking at?

539
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,505
Tae Gong-sil.

540
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,427
I guess I didn't do a good job.

541
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:47,479
I wonder how you felt up here alone

542
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,065
with all your memories.

543
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,280
YOO HYE-SEONG IS CHEERING YOU ON!

544
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:04,871
Hye-seong.

545
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,626
I miss you.

546
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,468
I miss you so much.

547
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,150
That's enough.

548
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:35,902
We're done.

549
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:41,449
Mi-gyeong. What are you talking about?

550
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,702
I can't keep taking care of you.

551
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,121
Go to Europe alone.

552
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:50,625
Mi-gyeong.

553
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,386
Mi-gyeong!

554
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:16,234
Mi-gyeong wanted you to know
how she feels.

555
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,381
Just go.

556
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,050
My life is over now.

557
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,639
It's not over.

558
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:48,808
You have to keep playing soccer.

559
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,105
I'll make money and buy you soccer shoes.

560
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,945
They're good ones.

561
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:07,494
Those shoes were the first ones
that Mi-gyeong gave you.

562
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,094
Mi-gyeong.

563
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:51,598
I miss you.

564
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,225
I miss you.

565
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:19,602
Leaving you was the last thing
she could do for you.

566
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,295
Tae I-ryeong!

567
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:52,260
Is the wedding delayed or canceled?

568
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,097
-Tell us what's going on.
-Hye-seong!

569
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,481
What's going on?

570
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,236
What was that?

571
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,163
-Hye-seong!
-Yoo Hye-seong!

572
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,416
I waited for you without ruining things.

573
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:25,668
Tell me why.

574
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,086
I...

575
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,717
I know it's reckless.
But I want to keep playing soccer.

576
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,725
The woman in my heart...

577
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,437
is still supporting me.

578
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:07,001
I will pay for the damages.

579
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:11,047
My manager will pay for it,
since he's been blackmailing me.

580
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:15,301
You ruined an event of the living
because of the dead.

581
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:21,933
I know your event was ruined.
But I still saved my wedding.

582
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:23,977
This...

583
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,730
was my real wedding.

584
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:35,154
You won't be able to do well
on a big stage at your age.

585
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:39,534
You are going to keep regretting
this moment later on.

586
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:42,370
I might.

587
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,250
You will.

588
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:51,337
The love of a dead person
might give you courage.

589
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,965
But it won't give you skills.

590
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,804
I will enjoy watching you
crumble at each game.

591
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,891
I'm going to enjoy watching soccer.

592
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:07,145
-Are you cursing me?
-Yes.

593
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:11,357
You should use that grudge
to do your best, for me to see.

594
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,276
You should go.

595
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:22,785
Right.

596
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,541
Tae Gong-sil asked me
to tell you something.

597
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:35,173
EUNHA DORMITORY

598
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:52,440
Please leave me alone today.

599
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:56,069
I'm really tired.

600
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:02,575
I want to run away to somewhere
I can sleep in peace.

601
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,352
Don't come here.

602
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:32,897
Go away.

603
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,861
Tae Gong-sil said what?

604
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:43,282
She said the dead have no power
but their feelings remain.

605
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:48,204
She said there are
such feelings next to you, too.

606
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:54,544
Joo Jung-won, is there someone who is dead

607
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,963
that you can't forget?

608
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,343
Hui-ju!

609
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,221
Cha Hui-ju!

610
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,098
Hui-ju!

611
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:18,609
Tae Gong-sil.

612
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:26,492
Tae Gong-sil.

613
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:30,455
What is next to me?

614
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,582
What can you see next to me?

615
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:34,709
I'm so tired.

616
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:40,298
Tell me. What is next to me?

617
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,218
I want to sleep next to you.

618
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,796
