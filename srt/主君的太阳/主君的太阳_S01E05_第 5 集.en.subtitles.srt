1
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:24,899
Thank you.

2
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:36,870
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,456
I feel safe when I'm holding you.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,834
Let's go.

5
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,811
-Are we far away enough?
-Yes.

6
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,900
Will you be okay here?

7
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,612
I don't think any ghosts followed me.

8
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:14,949
There aren't any.

9
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,661
So why are you holding me again?

10
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,663
Right...

11
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,920
I can't help reaching out to your body.

12
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,841
I'm not some snack
you can keep reaching out for.

13
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,636
I know. You're really expensive.

14
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,515
I thought you were so mad

15
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,934
that you would never let me
touch you again.

16
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,770
Thank you so much for helping me, Mr. Joo.

17
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,982
You have high value to me.

18
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,110
I don't ignore expensive things.

19
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,027
That's right.

20
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,197
I'm a ten-billion-won radar
that sees ghosts.

21
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,574
It's ten billion won
when you're an honest radar.

22
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,410
But if you go overboard again,
your value will be zero.

23
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,539
If that happens,
you will be abandoned miserably.

24
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,040
Yes. I'm sorry.

25
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,545
I wanted you to feel better.

26
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,921
Don't try to comfort me.

27
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,008
All I want is your sixth sense
that can find Cha Hui-ju.

28
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,468
Okay.

29
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,637
I went overboard.

30
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,641
I will only use my sixth sense
and will not try anything else.

31
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,311
Come to my office tomorrow.
I have found a place to install you.

32
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,604
Really?

33
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,440
I was always fired because of the ghosts.

34
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,985
I never imagined
that I would get a job like this.

35
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,528
Thank you so much, Mr. Joo.

36
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,115
I will do my best
to see ghosts from now on.

37
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:40,076
You have a shelter nearby,
so show me what you can do.

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,744
Yes, I'll do my best.

39
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,917
But you're really not
going to give me a separate salary

40
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,294
besides letting me touch you?

41
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,214
That's a hundred thousand won for holding
my hand, and a million won for a hug.

42
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,758
Your monthly salary
has been used up already.

43
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,177
Hold on. That's too much.

44
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,638
That's a hundred thousand won.

45
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,807
Okay.

46
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,976
I won't touch you thoughtlessly.

47
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,561
I want you to be careful.

48
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:11,983
If you keep touching me,
you will never get to see your salary.

49
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:16,237
Be prudent and only touch me
when you're really scared.

50
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,363
Okay.

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,826
You're being so difficult.

52
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,411
It's no use complaining.

53
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,581
I'm the one and only person that you need.

54
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:31,210
I'm a complete monopoly you cannot refuse,
no matter the price.

55
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,421
You're right.

56
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,425
But I'm also the only person
who can get what you want.

57
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,138
I'm the only one who can connect you
to Cha Hui-ju.

58
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,933
Yes. You're the only one.

59
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,643
Yes.

60
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,729
You would be scared to death without me.

61
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,315
Without you...

62
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,904
I would only be a bit sad.

63
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,575
If that's the case, let me off a little.

64
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,493
Get lost.

65
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,329
You're joking about the salary, right?

66
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,165
A joke would be funny.
You'll be crying soon.

67
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,723
A hundred thousand won.

68
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,686
That's less than a bottle of champagne.

69
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,608
And a million won.

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,570
I hugged her for less than
half the price of a fridge.

71
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,698
That was too cheap.

72
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,119
"Your shelter is here. Hide."

73
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,876
He was so amazing earlier.

74
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,300
Get a hold of yourself.

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,137
He didn't hug you because he likes you.
He just fended off the ghosts.

76
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,516
If you keep thinking like that,
you could lose your shelter.

77
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,646
Right.

78
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:18,860
You're only human, so it's natural
to get butterflies in such situations.

79
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:19,777
Right?

80
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,490
You see ghosts.
But you're not a ghost, right?

81
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,872
Okay, I will give you a hug
worth ten million won today.

82
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834
That's a million won.

83
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,254
And two million won. Three million won.

84
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,300
Go away, ghost!

85
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:43,926
Do you like that?

86
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:29,430
I have found a bride
who would suit your grandson.

87
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,352
How old is she?

88
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:39,732
Is she around Ji-woo's age?

89
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,277
She's the same age as Ji-woo.

90
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,657
And she died at the same age as Ji-woo.

91
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,136
I prepared these
for Ji-woo's ghost wedding.

92
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,637
GHOST WEDDING
A WEDDING BETWEEN SOULS

93
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,145
I set an appropriate date

94
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,441
for their wedding according to
their birth dates and fate.

95
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,999
I...

96
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,419
can feel

97
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,006
that his spirit is present with us.

98
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:52,555
He can leave in peace if I find him
a good match.

99
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:54,932
Ji-woo.

100
00:07:55,892 --> 00:08:00,104
Will you find peace if I do this for you?

101
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,247
Ji-woo doesn't seem to like
this young girl.

102
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,250
I will go find a bride

103
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:27,006
that Ji-woo will be satisfied with.

104
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,864
Your milk was delivered.
Will you have it now?

105
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,075
-You should have it.
-Thanks.

106
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:59,247
Gong-sil said she got a job
at the same company you work at.

107
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,040
She just left.

108
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,458
A job?

109
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,503
I hope she doesn't get fired this time.

110
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,922
You should protect her.

111
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:13,678
She said scary people
follow her around and harass her.

112
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,179
What kind of people?

113
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,431
You'll find out soon.

114
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,685
You're brave, right? Don't run away.

115
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,895
Please protect Gong-sil.

116
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,231
You said you like her.

117
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,942
I do like her.

118
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,944
But I don't like milk.

119
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,363
You should keep drinking it for me.

120
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:41,330
If he's brave and doesn't run away,
we'll be able to keep drinking milk.

121
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,040
Drink up.

122
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,637
Go! Don't follow me.

123
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,643
Let me live my life. Stop harassing me.

124
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,897
What is it? Who was it?

125
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,400
-Did he go that way?
-No...

126
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,031
I'll buy you coffee later. Come later.

127
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,741
Kang Woo!

128
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,994
Kang Woo!

129
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,165
I lost him. Who was it?

130
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,334
A molester? A pickpocket?

131
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,252
It was nothing. It's fine.

132
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,214
Seung-mo said
some people keep following you around.

133
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,301
Well, there is something like that.

134
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,887
I did think that something was strange.

135
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,973
You always look around
and look very nervous.

136
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,435
You took the long way home
on purpose, right?

137
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,520
Well...

138
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,772
Gong-sil...

139
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,483
did you borrow money?

140
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,488
The ones that keep following you around,
are they creditors?

141
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,114
No.

142
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,116
What is it, then?

143
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:01,911
Well...

144
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,416
the things that follow me around...

145
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,754
They're ghosts.

146
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,590
Right now...

147
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,343
There's one next to you, too.

148
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:24,892
Woo!

149
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,231
What's harassing you?

150
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,360
Well...

151
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,530
Ghosts...

152
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,658
It's a stalker
that follows me like a ghost.

153
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,326
A stalker?

154
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,162
He follows me night and day
and harasses me.

155
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,624
Did you report it?
Do you want to go to the police right now?

156
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,542
No.

157
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,877
I don't want to go to the police station.

158
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,383
I recently found a way to avoid him.
So you really don't have to worry.

159
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:58,759
Then...

160
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,137
shall I help you?

161
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,559
I was a personal bodyguard,
so I know how to handle stalkers.

162
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:13,065
Are you saying that
you'll be my bodyguard?

163
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,485
I am grateful.

164
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,821
But you can't do it.

165
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,073
I'm a pretty good bodyguard.

166
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,119
I won't ask you to pay me.

167
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,833
Then, will you do it for me?

168
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,422
It's Ms. Tae.

169
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,800
And that looks like Mr. Kang
of the security team.

170
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,887
Ms. Tae is really bright
on her first day to work.

171
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:48,184
The sun is so bright
that I'm hot and irritated.

172
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,358
Mr. Joo gave you a job.
I guess he doesn't think you're crazy now.

173
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,487
He trusts me now
and gave me an important job.

174
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,573
Are you helping him
with something personal?

175
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,868
-What is it?
-Well, that is...

176
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,455
That's Mr. Joo's car.

177
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,207
I'm late. I should get going.

178
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,844
Good morning, Mr. Joo.

179
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,263
What?

180
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,557
Tae Gong-sil, you're as fast as a ghost.

181
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,977
I'm your secretary,
so I should get to work before you do.

182
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:32,895
"Secretary"?

183
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,980
Who? You?

184
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,273
Who said so?

185
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,818
-Did you?
-I haven't told her anything yet.

186
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,989
Aren't I going to work as your secretary?

187
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,951
This isn't where you're going to be.

188
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,827
Then, where?

189
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,830
SPECIAL CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER

190
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,376
VIP ROOM

191
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,671
This is it.

192
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,807
But this is a storage room.

193
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:14,937
We first made this
as a space for VIP customers.

194
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,230
But we don't need it now.

195
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,400
So we just use it as a storage room.

196
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,153
What is my position then?

197
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:28,242
You'll be registered as an employee
of the Customer Service Center.

198
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,285
But actually...

199
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,413
you're the manager of the storage room.

200
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,179
I think Ms. Tae is quite disappointed
about her position.

201
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:50,848
Really?

202
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,311
Too bad.
It's the perfect position for her.

203
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,233
"Special Customer Service Center."

204
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,572
Do special customers even come here?

205
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,056
GHOST ROOM

206
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,516
Why is my first customer a ghost?

207
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,560
I'll buy you coffee, okay?

208
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,793
Do you know her?

209
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,711
She's Chinese.

210
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,425
She's a famous matchmaker
that all rich people know about.

211
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,263
She only arranges marriages for the dead.

212
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,057
It's hot!

213
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,602
The dead?

214
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,021
She's a matchmaker for ghost weddings.

215
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,610
People believe that children
who die unmarried might bring bad luck,

216
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,029
so they hold ghost marriages for them.

217
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:33,283
She's a ghost wedding planner,
so she's called Madam Go.

218
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,702
My gosh.

219
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,038
Rich people do all sorts of things.

220
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,210
I heard he got Bang-sil a room.

221
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,045
Where is it?

222
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,714
It's an office, not a room.

223
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,716
And it's Gong-sil, not Bang-sil.

224
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,601
I love you.

225
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,648
"Special Customer Service Center?"

226
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,985
-Was there such a thing at Kingdom?
-Yes.

227
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,155
You can't really see it
on the way to Mr. Joo's office.

228
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,866
It's a department that's in
a place sort of like a storage room.

229
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,744
Anyway, I'm happy for you.

230
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,164
I hope strange things
don't come to you there.

231
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,417
One already did.

232
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,420
Really?

233
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,342
One is for you.

234
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,387
And one is for him.

235
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,058
He must like the coffee here.
He keeps clinging to me.

236
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,020
He's my first special customer.

237
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,983
If he's your customer,
take him to your office.

238
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,526
He likes it here.

239
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,071
I should go. Come visit me.

240
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,822
Hey.

241
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,533
What is it now?

242
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,954
Why don't you ever talk about anything
other than coffee?

243
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,252
Tell me, why did you die
at such a young age?

244
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,798
Tell me.

245
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,382
Come on.

246
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,365
GHOST ROOM

247
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,952
A person...

248
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:46,917
who is living,
yet has one foot in the grave.

249
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,424
She will be perfect.

250
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,888
I talked to the president of Giant Mall
instead of you yesterday.

251
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,059
I hope you didn't just say hello
to our future competitor.

252
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,769
We shared information, too.

253
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,439
The president of Giant Mall
has big plans for his business.

254
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,650
You know Ms. Wang,

255
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,695
the chairwoman
of Shanghai Distribution, right?

256
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,822
He said he's going to work with her.

257
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,699
Ms. Wang of Shanghai Distribution?

258
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,162
She recently lost
the grandson she doted on.

259
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,956
I heard that she hasn't been
managing her business.

260
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,086
The president of Giant Mall
is bluffing about his relationships.

261
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,798
Is he expanding his business with lies?

262
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,969
But if it goes well, over 100 billion won
could go back and forth.

263
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,264
It's not bad to have such information.

264
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,974
In any case,

265
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:49,313
Ms. Wang is a special customer,
a VIP at Kingdom.

266
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,735
That's right,

267
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,237
about the Special Customer Service Center
you made.

268
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,116
Your aunt just went to visit it.

269
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,203
It's pretty good that I'm giving you
such information, right?

270
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,171
She did come here.

271
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,049
But she ordered me to do something.

272
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,425
"Do something"?

273
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:22,304
She told me to go to Ms. Wang's house,
a special customer.

274
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,436
I heard Ms. Wang's grandson
recently passed away.

275
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,148
You might see him if you go there.

276
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,650
Really?

277
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,403
Then I can't go.

278
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,410
No, you should go
and meet him if he's there.

279
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,371
What?

280
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,791
Ask if Shanghai Distribution
wants to work with Giant Mall.

281
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,585
Ask him about his grandmother's
business plans.

282
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,004
But I'm scared.

283
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:03,053
Is Ms. Wang very important to you?

284
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,346
Very important.

285
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,807
Go find out anything, any little detail.

286
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,519
I'll go since you say
it's important to you.

287
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:16,733
But if something scary chases me,
I won't be able to sleep.

288
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,739
You have a shelter.
Go and find out something.

289
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,409
I'll hug you for free if you're scared.

290
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,201
Ms. Wang, this is the girl.

291
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,595
Could you change into these clothes?

292
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,931
You want me to wear this?

293
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:31,975
Yes.

294
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,896
Please, miss.

295
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,572
I am not saying anything about her

296
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,992
because I think it's better
than hanging onto Hui-ju.

297
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:55,040
She does look quite poor,
but at least she's normal.

298
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,085
She is not a normal person.

299
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:04,049
And I gave her work to do,
so don't try to order her around.

300
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,593
I didn't do it on purpose.

301
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,222
I sent her because Ms. Go
asked me to send her there.

302
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,015
Ms. Go?

303
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,560
Ms. Go is a psychic
who does ghost weddings.

304
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,690
If she's really visiting Ms. Wang's,
then the rumors must be true.

305
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,526
What rumor?

306
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:27,864
I heard she's looking for a bride
for her grandson's ghost wedding.

307
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,993
That's a ridiculous thing to be doing.

308
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,373
I wonder why she asked specifically
for Bang-sil.

309
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:57,853
Mr. Joo.

310
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,897
I was a little scared,

311
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,567
but I feel better
talking to you on the phone.

312
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,027
Are you okay?

313
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:07,988
What did you see there?

314
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,490
Yes. I saw the late grandson.

315
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,411
I think he's in this house.

316
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,915
I saw his picture,
and he's very young and handsome.

317
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,003
He was sick since he was young
and never even got to date anyone,

318
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,088
so his grandmother is really sad.

319
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,340
What are you doing there?

320
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,801
I tried on a dress
because they asked me to.

321
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,553
A dress?

322
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,890
-Why did they ask you to do that?
-I don't know.

323
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,727
It's a pretty dress
that you see in Chinese movies.

324
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,730
I think they said
it's a Chinese wedding dress.

325
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,648
What dress?

326
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,319
Why did you put that on?

327
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,070
Take it off
and get out of there right now.

328
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,197
Why?

329
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,865
Get out right now!

330
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,076
You said it's important.

331
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,412
I'll find out as much as I can.

332
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:00,790
Ms. Tae.

333
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,584
Ms. Tae!

334
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,009
Whatever. She went there herself.

335
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:16,348
I'll go since you say
it's important to you.

336
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,311
If she can see ghosts,
she should know if something is wrong.

337
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,355
Why is she doing everything as she's told?

338
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,691
Whatever.

339
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,276
Whatever.

340
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,116
I think he was here.

341
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,687
Is this the grandson's room?

342
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,944
It's locked.

343
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,780
Please open the door.

344
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,366
Please open the door.

345
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,329
Please spend a night in there.

346
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,414
Who are you? Please open the door.

347
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,376
You are not dead,
but you should be able to do it.

348
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,420
Help the boy leave in peace.

349
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,548
Please stay one night with him.

350
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,468
No.

351
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,767
No.

352
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,620
Ms. Wang.

353
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,872
A guest has come to see you.

354
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,753
What are you doing here?

355
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,798
I came to find my employee. Where is she?

356
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,676
I can't believe you came in person
just for an employee.

357
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,097
If she was just an employee,
you wouldn't have called her here.

358
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:45,682
Right.

359
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,477
I invited her
because I had a favor to ask.

360
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:54,566
I'm treating her well as a guest,
so you should just leave.

361
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,192
Who's taking care of her?

362
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,987
Is it your late grandson?

363
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,866
It's important to my family.
Stay out of this!

364
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,201
She's a very important employee to me.
I won't stay out of this.

365
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,298
Where is she?

366
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:19,632
What?

367
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,050
Where is she?

368
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,783
Open the door.

369
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,368
I said, open it.

370
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,454
Open it for him.

371
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,541
Open it for him.

372
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,757
You'll regret opening that door.

373
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,927
Your competitor came to see me.

374
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,889
I could partner up with your competitor.

375
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,728
It's up to you. What will it be?

376
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,574
Then, of course, I will--

377
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,368
-Mr. Joo.
-Go inside.

378
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,038
I didn't open it.

379
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,832
You came, Mr. Joo.

380
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,668
She opened it. It wasn't me.

381
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,505
It has been ruined, Ms. Wang.

382
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,346
Your grandson asked me
to tell you something.

383
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,933
My Ji-woo?

384
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,518
I'll tell you exactly as he told me.

385
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,942
"Are you going senile? Stop this.

386
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,443
And tell that lady

387
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,405
to stop bringing those disgusting dolls
and get lost!"

388
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,087
That really is my Ji-woo.

389
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:37,270
I should do something
before Jung-won falls for Bang-sil.

390
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:42,984
I won't tear them apart
but put someone better by his side.

391
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,320
Who?

392
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,530
There is someone.

393
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:01,753
Jump up as if you are oil
splattering from a frying pan.

394
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,299
Okay, hold it up. Fly.

395
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,926
Fly up high.

396
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:12,221
Strong like a flame.
As if your whole body is burning.

397
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,891
Shrivel up!

398
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,518
"Shrivel up"?

399
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,771
-Shrivel up and jump up.
-What?

400
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,940
Lie down now. You're a flame.

401
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:23,775
Like this.

402
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,819
The flame is dying.

403
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,738
And now jump up.

404
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,740
-Now die down.
-I'm not doing this!

405
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,370
One moment, please.

406
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,373
We'll start after I-ryeong
drinks some water.

407
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,379
-How many are left?
-There's only the big pot left.

408
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,090
Can't you see that my arms are hurting?

409
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,218
-Tell them I'll only hold the lid.
-Okay.

410
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,304
I-ryeong?

411
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,897
The original concept was a newly-wed.

412
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,857
But it changed because my wedding
got canceled.

413
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,527
You must be in a lot of pain
because of the cancelation.

414
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:12,073
This wouldn't have happened
if your friend didn't ruin the wedding.

415
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,742
My friend?

416
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,955
Oh, I didn't tell you.
I meant to tell you.

417
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:23,292
The woman who came
and talked to your groom that day

418
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,586
is your high school friend.

419
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,089
She works at Kingdom right now.

420
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,466
Is it Tae Gong-sil?

421
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,886
Was it Tae Gong-sil?

422
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:49,527
Recently, a business failed
and someone got sick in the family.

423
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,448
They said that it's all Ji-woo's fault.

424
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,617
The business failed
because of the global recession.

425
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,162
And every family has a few sick people.

426
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,497
Why did it become a ghost's fault?

427
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:02,957
Because...

428
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,626
of that.

429
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,422
It's because of that.

430
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,426
It's been over 100 days
since Ji-woo passed away.

431
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,887
But they are still fresh.

432
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,432
As time passed,

433
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,935
we couldn't throw it away
and became scared.

434
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,189
He said he's waiting
for the person he likes.

435
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,651
I didn't even imagine it could be
something like that.

436
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,072
He was sick since he was a child.

437
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:39,285
He was always at home or at a hospital,
so he had no friends.

438
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,204
He was very sensitive.

439
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,082
So no one would get close to him, either.

440
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,793
It's too hot!

441
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,171
He was so mean that everyone avoided him.

442
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,549
But I guess...

443
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,804
there was a girl that he liked.

444
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:01,766
I would...

445
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,435
really like to see that girl.

446
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,898
You will be able to meet her.

447
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,610
Right?

448
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,365
I don't know. This is all he does.

449
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:24,789
My employee will come here often
to talk to your grandson

450
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,208
and find out who it is.

451
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,503
Didn't you say she's important
and that you have to take her back?

452
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,421
Not at all.

453
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,550
You're the only one
who is important to me.

454
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,635
Let me tell you again.

455
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,553
I...

456
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,139
didn't open that door.

457
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,272
How much do you plan to invest?

458
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,190
I don't know.

459
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,402
I need to learn more about Kingdom.

460
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,571
Then I'll think about it.

461
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,782
What about Giant Mall?

462
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,634
Miss.

463
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,804
I think she saw something.

464
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,316
Excuse me. Who is the kid
who just passed by here?

465
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,817
The milk boy?

466
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,822
Was the milk boy
friends with the grandson?

467
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,199
I don't think he knew him.

468
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,703
The previous milk boy

469
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,790
used to talk to him
and play games with him.

470
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,593
Did you find out?

471
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,011
I think so.

472
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,224
So, who is this girl
that the grandson is waiting for?

473
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,225
Well...

474
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,810
It's not a girl.

475
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,230
It's a boy.

476
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,694
I think he's waiting for the milk boy.

477
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:23,950
A boy?

478
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,327
Miss.

479
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,373
-Did you find something?
-Yes, well...

480
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,919
No, she's not sure yet.
We'll come back tomorrow.

481
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,504
Let's go.

482
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,726
You can't just leave like this, Mr. Joo.

483
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,604
He's longing to see him.
We should help them meet.

484
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:57,400
She's looking forward to seeing
her grandson's first love.

485
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,528
Do you want to blow up
a nuclear bomb in her face?

486
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,739
No, I'm not trying to find
the ghost's first love.

487
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,160
Making her feel better
is what's important to me.

488
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,037
What are you going to do?

489
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:15,209
His first love should be a pretty nurse
from the hospital

490
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,378
or a teacher who taught him
to play the piano.

491
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,006
You should settle it like that
with the ghost.

492
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,340
But that's a lie.

493
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,468
You said that you don't like lies.

494
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:29,223
Didn't you say you didn't like it
when I lied about Hui-ju?

495
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,059
I feel so bad for him.

496
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,688
He has no one and is waiting
for the only person he liked.

497
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,189
I want to help them meet.

498
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,906
I am going to do whatever you say.

499
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,995
We can just leave or go back and tell her.

500
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,621
It's your call.

501
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,553
Go. Find the milk boy.

502
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,641
But just say it was friendship,

503
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,102
not love.

504
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,108
Tae Gong-sil, hurry home.

505
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,487
I am going to squash you.

506
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,492
-Are you the stalker?
-What is this?

507
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:36,040
-Tae I-ryeong? It's you again?
-Let me go, you jerk.

508
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,052
You're lucky that I shot
that advertisement today.

509
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,220
If not, I would have sued you.

510
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,430
It won't leave a scar.

511
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,391
It might swell a little.

512
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,727
So why did you come to blame your friend
for your wedding?

513
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,979
I'm not here to blame her.
I'm here to get revenge.

514
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,399
You have no weapon.
You didn't mean to hurt her.

515
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,608
What were you going to do?

516
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,945
I'm going to steal her man.

517
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,405
"Her man"?

518
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:08,948
President Joo Jung-won.

519
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:13,661
I came to tell her that I'm going to
steal him away and make her cry.

520
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,124
You think I won't be able to?
I am Tae I-ryeong.

521
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,085
So, you want to have war.

522
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,504
Secret weapons are important in a battle.

523
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,297
Shall I be yours?

524
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,882
Are you saying you'll help?

525
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,634
I have one condition.

526
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:34,056
Find out why Mr. Joo
is interested in Tae Gong-sil.

527
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,766
Why are you curious?

528
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,562
Do you like Tae Gong-sil, too?

529
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,022
Let's say I do.

530
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,236
I think it's turning blue.

531
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,206
You look younger than me.
Why are you treating me like a kid?

532
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,084
You do look older than me.

533
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,669
Shall I treat you accordingly?

534
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,797
Just continue as you did.

535
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,635
Shall we have a drink
to celebrate being on the same side?

536
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,596
Drink by yourself.

537
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,731
MILK

538
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,155
That's the kid from before.

539
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,242
Excuse me. Could I ask you something?

540
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,786
Do you deliver milk
to the upper neighborhood?

541
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,582
Do you know
who delivered there before you?

542
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,250
Oh, over there.

543
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,547
That must be him.

544
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:51,884
He looks sturdy.

545
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,427
Excuse me.

546
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:55,971
Yes?

547
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,182
Do you know Ji-woo?

548
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,268
Ji-woo?

549
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:07,733
Which of you used to deliver to his house?

550
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,776
That's me.

551
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,529
I used to deliver milk there.

552
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,405
I heard it was a boy.

553
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,742
I got mistaken a lot
before I grew my hair.

554
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,621
She may look like a girl,
but she's actually a guy.

555
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,335
Is that her?

556
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,213
You must be the one Ji-woo is waiting for.

557
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,933
Hey, delivery.

558
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:45,604
Can't you do it properly?
The milk packs are always dented.

559
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,649
It still tastes the same.

560
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,860
It might taste the same but
I don't like ugly things. Just like you.

561
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,906
I hate mean things. Just like you.

562
00:42:58,784 --> 00:42:59,618
What?

563
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,747
What are you doing?

564
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,375
Delivery. So you are a girl.

565
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:07,710
An ugly girl.

566
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,177
It's a relief.

567
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,180
In any case, she's a girl. What a relief.

568
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,891
I heard about Ji-woo.

569
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,938
Please leave.
I don't want to talk about him.

570
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,067
There's something
that he wanted to show you.

571
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,361
I would like you to go see it.

572
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,033
It's very pretty. They are green roses.

573
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,337
There are many kinds of roses
with different colors.

574
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,465
Are there green roses? I like green.

575
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,843
-There are green roses.
-Awesome, they must be so pretty.

576
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,804
They're not pretty at all.
They look like cabbages, like you.

577
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,516
Hey, I look okay if I grow my hair long
and dress up.

578
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,352
Why do you keep saying that I'm ugly?

579
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,271
You are ugly.

580
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,523
No one can tell if you're a boy or a girl.

581
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,194
You're so skinny.

582
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,196
You look like a girl.

583
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:45,766
It doesn't feel good to kiss someone
who isn't like a girl.

584
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,940
Hey. Don't cry.

585
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,942
You'll look uglier if you do.

586
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:01,407
I don't like weak guys like you
who just grow flowers.

587
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,619
I hate guys like you.

588
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:26,765
Ji-woo.

589
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,811
Ji-woo.

590
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,403
Ji-woo.

591
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:53,792
They're really pretty.

592
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,464
He lied that they were ugly.

593
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,932
I grew my hair long so I could show you.

594
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,650
But you just died.

595
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,782
Goodbye.

596
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,868
Goodbye, my child.

597
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,913
Goodbye.

598
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,801
Green roses mean noble love
that only exists in heaven.

599
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:32,724
Aren't you glad that things went well
for Ji-woo, the girl, and Ms. Wang?

600
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,018
We had a big harvest today.

601
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:40,691
Since you contributed,
I will take you home today.

602
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:44,778
No, it's okay. Please don't go
all the way to the dormitory.

603
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:51,618
There's someone I don't want
to see me get off this car.

604
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,455
Mr. Kang? I heard you live together.

605
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,251
Yes, Woo has a lot of interest in me.

606
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:04,548
He is so curious
about what I do for Mr. Joo.

607
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,009
But I can't tell him, right?

608
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:12,806
You must be hiding your special radar
from Kang Woo.

609
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,057
Yes.

610
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:18,270
He keeps asking
about what I am so scared of.

611
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,689
I told him it's a stalker.

612
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:24,776
And he said that he would be my bodyguard.

613
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,530
Are you showing off?

614
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,283
It's all thanks to you.

615
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:34,494
I got a job and met someone nice.

616
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,580
Stop the car.

617
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,498
It's okay to go a bit more.

618
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,500
No, I don't want to take you any further.

619
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,836
I should take you just as far
as how much you contributed.

620
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,713
Get lost here.

621
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,506
Okay.

622
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,219
Goodbye.

623
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:08,945
What are you doing?

624
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,740
You said it's free.
It would be a waste to just leave.

625
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,288
Goodbye.

626
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,552
Let's go.

627
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:40,352
Just holding his hand makes me feel safer.

628
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,062
I wonder why.

629
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,736
I don't think they're ghosts.
Why are they following me?

630
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,784
Miss, please come with us.

631
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,619
-Who are you? What are you doing?
-Come with us.

632
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,002
Who is this guy?

633
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,983
Let's go.

634
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,528
Are you okay, Woo?

635
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,823
Are those the people
who kept following you?

636
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,368
They're human. Why did they follow me?

637
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,831
Hey!

638
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:44,207
Stop it.

639
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,014
I came because I wanted to see you
one more time.

640
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,682
I think there was a misunderstanding.

641
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,978
You shine very brightly.

642
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:10,734
That's why the people from the dark
keep coming to you.

643
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,653
Did you say I shine?

644
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,824
They might whine and ask you for favors.

645
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:23,079
You must stay alert.

646
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,462
Some of them...

647
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:35,425
may be quietly looking for a chance.

648
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,554
A chance to return

649
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,098
by using you.

650
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,318
The darkness will eat up the light.

651
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:57,030
And death will eat up human life.

652
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,748
Be careful not to get eaten up.

653
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,233
Mom said she's coming now.

654
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,011
Aren't you sleepy, Seung-jun?

655
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,015
Hey! Seung-jun!

656
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,571
Seung-jun!

657
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,616
Seung-jun!

658
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,951
Where are you, Seung-jun?

659
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,870
Seung-jun!

660
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,417
Seung-jun!

661
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,088
You should tell me
before you go somewhere.

662
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,052
It's a doll.

663
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,262
No.

664
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,557
Someone could have dropped it here.

665
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:52,062
If it's still here tomorrow,
we can take it home then.

666
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,274
Let's go.

667
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,845
How did you meet that swindler?

668
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,015
I was doing work.

669
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:32,602
You're not giving any details to me again.

670
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,064
In any case,
I'm glad that I was waiting for you.

671
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,825
Do you really like me?

672
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:53,373
Do you want to know about me
because you like me?

673
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,045
I can't tell you

674
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:05,176
everything about myself because
I'm so happy that someone likes me.

675
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,347
I'm scared you'll run away
if you find out.

676
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:15,478
You must wonder
what big secret I have to keep.

677
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:20,108
"Is she a spy? Is she a criminal?

678
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,068
Did she used to be a man?"

679
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,196
You must be imagining all sorts of things.

680
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:32,871
But whatever you're thinking,
you'll be more surprised by the truth.

681
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,416
I warned you.

682
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,044
So don't come closer.

683
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,298
Thank you for today.

684
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,176
Don't thank me.

685
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,722
I feel bad.

686
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,477
You're not the only one with secrets.

687
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,440
I could be holding back
something from you.

688
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:06,029
I am a little scared
after hearing your warning.

689
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,449
I'm scared that I might disappoint you.

690
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:15,955
Goodnight.

691
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:28,676
He likes me so much.
Shall I just tell him?

692
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:34,015
Woo, I can see ghosts.

693
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,019
How can I tell him that?

694
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:48,404
Ms. Wang is going to work with Kingdom
and not Giant Mall.

695
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,906
It's a good choice.

696
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,158
She wants to work with me, too.

697
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,327
She asked me to go to China with her.

698
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,915
So, are you going to go?

699
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,458
I can't go.

700
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,919
You're right here.

701
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,256
It's a shame, but I refused the offer.

702
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,549
Is that why you're down?

703
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,927
Do you feel that bad
about turning the job down?

704
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,471
I refused something else, too.

705
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,434
I feel really bad about that.

706
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,269
What is that?

707
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,689
There's someone who says he likes me.

708
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,111
Thank you.

709
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,072
Thank you.

710
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,032
Make sure to hold on to your mom.

711
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:35,326
Thank you.

712
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:36,703
Please come this way.

713
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,800
I can't tell him that I see ghosts.

714
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,971
I can't do it because he says he likes me.

715
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:58,892
If I can't be with him,
I want to pretend I'm normal.

716
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,771
But I'm so depressed.

717
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,732
Why do I see ghosts?

718
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,108
Tae Gong-sil.

719
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:13,990
You look much more normal
than when I first saw you.

720
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,702
He'll just think you are arrogant.

721
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,913
I'm a mess, right?

722
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:25,585
Now that I have room to breathe,
there's a lot to think about.

723
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,879
And I'm getting greedy.

724
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,507
People always want more than they have.

725
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:31,966
It can happen.

726
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,552
Thank you, Mr. Joo.

727
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:38,473
You became my shelter.

728
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,433
And you even became my counselor.

729
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,856
You brought in Ms. Wang,
and you lost a chance to date.

730
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,984
So, I'll give you a discount.

731
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:51,736
Thank you.

732
00:58:55,657 --> 00:59:00,453
But I am feeling kind of depressed today.

733
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,455
I really don't want to see ghosts.

734
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,207
Could you...

735
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,501
take me home after work?

736
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:10,171
All humans do not fail
to jump at opportunities.

737
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:11,798
I won't take you home.

738
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:14,968
Okay.

739
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,196
-What's the occasion?
-Thank you.

740
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,991
Tae Gong-sil used to work with you, right?

741
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:38,908
Yes.

742
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:42,537
I heard she got transferred
because Mr. Joo likes her.

743
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,830
The president?

744
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,124
-Are they dating?
-There's a lot of evidence.

745
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:48,918
A lot of people saw them,
so it's not just a rumor.

746
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:53,047
Lee Han-ju has such a big mouth
that the rumor is spreading fast.

747
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:57,051
Mr. Joo must have heard about it by now.

748
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,513
-We have to make them a couple.
-Yes!

749
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,182
But didn't she have a boyfriend?

750
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,268
-Right. I saw him.
-A boyfriend?

751
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,187
She lives with the guy
from the security team.

752
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,607
They used to go home together.

753
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,608
So it's a love triangle?

754
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,484
Who could it be?

755
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:15,320
The security team?

756
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,495
Mr. Kang. I have big news.

757
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:30,543
There's a guy who lives with Tae Gong-sil
on our team.

758
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,131
He asked her to go home together.
Who could it be?

759
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,259
They also came to work together.

760
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,927
He also offered to be her bodyguard.

761
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,722
Really? She must be a huge flirt.

762
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:45,642
How does she seduce men
with such a tired-looking face?

763
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,143
I know.

764
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,104
He was just watching her,

765
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,732
but somehow he got very close to her.

766
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:55,109
That's what you call getting bewitched.

767
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:59,030
Didn't you hear about the men
who used to jump off Lorelei hill?

768
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:01,658
Anyway, so who is the fool
who got bewitched by her?

769
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,368
Me.

770
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:05,411
What?

771
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,706
I'm the one waiting
to jump off Lorelei hill.

772
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,252
It's not easy to jump.

773
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,546
I will need courage.

774
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:24,138
And you need to control yourself.

775
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,100
Don't call her a flirt.

776
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,602
I'm sorry.

777
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:39,028
There aren't any customers,
just things being delivered.

778
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,698
It's really just a storage.

779
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:43,574
Gong-sil.

780
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:56,879
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, sir.

781
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:02,301
We're going to take Tae Gong-sil
when we leave.

782
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,053
Okay.

783
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:16,649
I want to get to know you more.

784
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,403
I'll muster up my courage.

785
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,654
So you should...

786
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:23,823
cheer up.

787
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,196
Mr. Joo.

788
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:10,286
The guy who likes me says
he'll muster up courage for me.

789
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:11,954
He told me to cheer up, too.

790
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:16,584
So, are you going to cheer up
and go to him?

791
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:19,378
Yes, I want to go.

792
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:20,546
I'm going to go.

793
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,266
