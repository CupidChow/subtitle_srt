1
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,798
If the bad ghost is gone

2
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,093
and Tae Gong-sil is left alone,
listen carefully.

3
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,932
You used the ghost as an excuse
to tell me how you feel.

4
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:03,938
I believe that you don't really
want me to get lost yet.

5
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,527
We started this
because you said you can handle it.

6
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,866
If you say it's too hard for you,
this will be the end.

7
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,994
What will you do now?

8
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,681
I think something came into me and left.

9
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,601
Thank you for sending it away.

10
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,188
It's a relief that you are back safely.

11
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,364
Why did you come here?

12
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,243
You said you decided to come here.

13
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,162
Did you decide to come here
for our first date?

14
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,207
You're bolder than I thought.

15
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,963
Where are you going?

16
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,926
I said I was going home.
I didn't invite you here.

17
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,804
I don't remember inviting you
into my home when you came.

18
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,724
You even slept with me the first time
you came. I don't need an invitation.

19
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,311
Where am I supposed to sit?

20
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,522
Don't sit down. Just go.

21
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,151
There isn't anywhere to sit, anyway.

22
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,487
Is this all the space you have?

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,948
There isn't anywhere for ghosts to hide.

24
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,255
Is this okay?

25
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,009
I understood what you said perfectly.

26
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,553
I want to be safe, too. So please leave.

27
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,680
I didn't come in to be in danger.

28
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,099
Should I have prepared myself?

29
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,019
I'm not ready yet.

30
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,646
You're the one
who put us in danger before.

31
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,815
-Remember that?
-I did that...

32
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,153
to send away the ghost that had come.

33
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,070
Really?

34
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:20,950
It doesn't matter
which part of me you touch.

35
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,704
It would have been
the same if you slapped me.

36
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,208
I have no pride to reject it
and I won't feel upset, either.

37
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,128
I feel so scared.
How could I feel anything else?

38
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,672
I feel the same way.

39
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,301
I feel upset that I have feelings for you.

40
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,137
And my pride is hurt
because I can't control it.

41
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,557
So I am really scared, too.

42
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,187
But I still came. So, don't send me away.

43
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,398
It's strange to say this
when I came in already.

44
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,693
But please invite me in.

45
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:01,616
You served coffee to the ghosts
in your office.

46
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,660
I want some, too.

47
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,498
Okay.

48
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,960
I'll give you the bitter kind,
just the way you like it.

49
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,670
It won't be sweet at all.

50
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,756
Thank you for accommodating my tastes.

51
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,351
I was invited in.
It's too cramped, so get lost.

52
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,024
She said she's not in love with him.

53
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,319
Why is she staying by Jung-won's side?

54
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:43,783
People say the incident regarding
Cha Hui-ju is a curse on Mr. Joo.

55
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,036
Ms. Tae called it his wound.

56
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,834
I think Ms. Tae is someone
who can cure it.

57
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,963
Who is she to cure Jung-won's wound?

58
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,632
One has to get close to cure the wound.

59
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,802
But Mr. Joo doesn't let anyone near him.

60
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,595
She comes back again and again,

61
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,264
even though he keeps driving her away.

62
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,683
Not everyone can do that.

63
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,229
Are you saying she came at Jung-won
with such determination?

64
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,355
"Wound"?

65
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,650
I think she knows his weakness.

66
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,402
She has his heart.

67
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,407
He is trying his best
to secure a way out of it.

68
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,493
So, he is thinking
about getting out of this, right?

69
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,580
I think he went in
thinking there is an exit.

70
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,292
But it is probably getting harder for him.

71
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,678
Were you hiding in this small place
before you met me?

72
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,557
Yes, it's the place
that I felt the safest in.

73
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,313
There's beer.

74
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,317
-You're not supposed to drink.
-It's Woo's. It's not mine.

75
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,321
Why is Mr. Kang's beer
in your refrigerator?

76
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,699
He sometimes drinks a beer
out on the rooftop.

77
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,243
He leaves it there,
so it's easier to get some.

78
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,455
Mr. Kang sometimes
has a beer out on the rooftop?

79
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,208
What do you do, then?

80
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,627
I can't drink, so I just have some soda.

81
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,547
Your fridge is so small.
You don't have room for Kang's beer.

82
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,638
I have enough room for that.
So, just leave it in there.

83
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,857
I put a lot of money in your account.

84
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,902
You should move
to a better place than this.

85
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,988
I told you, I feel the safest in here.

86
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,245
Mr. Kang gets paid a lot.
Why does he live here?

87
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,789
He said he's going to get an apartment.

88
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:56,707
Really?

89
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,221
-Excuse me for a moment.
-Where are you going? I'm your guest.

90
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,516
Have some of the coffee and fruit
while I'm out.

91
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,984
The name of the caller had two characters.

92
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,653
"Kang Woo"?

93
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,073
MESSAGES

94
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,079
KANG WOO

95
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,961
Why is it so long?

96
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,173
What am I doing?

97
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,511
Read out the last message.

98
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,685
One toy for each sentence.

99
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:02,023
I'll tell the kids' mall.
Take this and get what you want.

100
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,109
KINGDOM
JOO JUNG-WON

101
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,569
Thank you.

102
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:11,365
But you're an adult. Can't you read?

103
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,578
I can speak English, Japanese,
Chinese, Spanish, and Korean.

104
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,829
I don't read...

105
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,416
because I have a reason.

106
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,418
Read it.

107
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,171
Okay.

108
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,218
"Tae Gong-sil.

109
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,429
I have a favor to ask.

110
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,183
I heard it's going to rain tonight.

111
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:42,772
Please take down the blankets
that I hung out on the roof.

112
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,485
Don't take out the trash alone.

113
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,862
I love you."

114
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,199
What?

115
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,245
Wait. It's "Do it with me."

116
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,830
You gave me a shock.

117
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,505
Does Gong-sil take care
of the blankets Sweet Kang uses?

118
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,591
Should I just buy this whole building?

119
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,720
Are you the president of Kingdom?

120
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:19,350
Why, did Tae Gong-sil
tell you anything about me?

121
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,685
Yes.

122
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:25,356
She said that you're the most
special person in the world to her.

123
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:27,900
Really?

124
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,614
You're young,
so you must be genuine and honest.

125
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:38,119
I won't think you're saying that
just to get more toys.

126
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,167
Use it for anything you want,
even if it's not toys.

127
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,094
Didn't you see how the photo went viral?

128
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,097
I'll get in trouble if the reporters
see you come here.

129
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,600
Did you do it on purpose?

130
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,101
I told you before.

131
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,813
That reporters could write
about the photo from the subway.

132
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,191
Don't worry, a different story
will be released tomorrow.

133
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,526
What different story?

134
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,864
Is it going to be on one of those
entertainment shows?

135
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,325
The person involved in the scandal
with me might.

136
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,827
But don't worry. It won't be you.

137
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,537
What?

138
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,580
Tomorrow,

139
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,167
there's going to be an article
about me and Mr. Joo.

140
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,461
Mr. Joo?

141
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,713
There was no other way to stop our story.

142
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,425
Why, are you worried
that Tae Gong-sil might be hurt?

143
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,554
What about you?

144
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,598
Me?

145
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:45,353
Yes, is it okay for that story
to get out when it's not true?

146
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,104
You're a celebrity.

147
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,230
You!

148
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,024
Don't worry about me.

149
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,027
Are you trying to keep me clinging to you?

150
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,114
Don't look at me like that.

151
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,492
You should just glare
and yell at me instead.

152
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,371
What do you want me to do?

153
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,414
I don't want you to be hurt by this.

154
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,459
Never mind it.
It's not my first scandal anyway.

155
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,503
I'm going to take care of it.

156
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,338
I know what to do.

157
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:15,758
Go!

158
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,886
Call me if you need anything.

159
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,662
Why haven't you left yet?

160
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:51,585
I was invited in. I should leave
after the host says goodbye.

161
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,129
Goodbye.

162
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,424
Did you take the blankets in?

163
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,218
Did you leave the trash
for you two to take out together?

164
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,764
-Did you read it?
-Yes, I read it.

165
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,433
But you can't read.

166
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,811
I choose not to read.
I don't have to read it myself.

167
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,564
There are many ways to do it
if I want to read something.

168
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,859
You're right.
You can do anything you want.

169
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:19,405
You find out what you want to know
and ignore things you don't want to.

170
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:20,781
That must be nice.

171
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,741
You said you would handle that, too.

172
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,916
I thought about a way
to make you feel safe.

173
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,796
The story about the wolf and the goat.

174
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:42,386
Do you know why the goat felt safe,
even though the wolf could eat it?

175
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,391
It's because the goat knew
how much the wolf liked it.

176
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,978
The wolf likes the goat a lot.

177
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:56,275
It felt safe because it believed
that the wolf wouldn't eat it up.

178
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,404
You should feel safe, too.

179
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,532
I will protect you,
just like the wolf did.

180
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,244
Please believe me.

181
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,044
You should go now.

182
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:19,256
It's going to rain tonight.
You should go before it pours.

183
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,651
I really hate it when it rains.

184
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,903
I'm so scared. What should I do?

185
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,782
Oh, my gosh!

186
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,284
Why did you come back?

187
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,662
You said water ghosts scare you the most.

188
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,206
Water ghosts must come out when it rains.

189
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,042
Don't you need me more on such a day?

190
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,796
It is a lot scarier when it rains.

191
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,175
But I already told you to leave.

192
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,844
I can't ask you to stay.
I can't believe this.

193
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,305
You told me to believe you'll protect me.

194
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,766
So, I'll believe you
and stay a little longer.

195
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,602
It's really fine, though.

196
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,107
Go to sleep.

197
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,116
We're only going to hold hands.

198
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,368
You shouldn't think about anything else.

199
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:31,871
I trust you.

200
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,707
It's so hot in here.

201
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,046
What are you doing?

202
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,553
Go to sleep.

203
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,101
Lie down.

204
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,174
Because of that, she can't do anything
and is in a lot of pain.

205
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,509
She's in a lot of pain, you jerk.

206
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,726
I will pretend the ghost gave me
the message that you're in pain.

207
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:41,065
I don't intend to hug you
to lessen your pain.

208
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,572
But I can use ghosts
as an excuse to hug you.

209
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,496
I feel upset that I have feelings for you.

210
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,207
And my pride is hurt
because I can't control it.

211
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,626
So I am really scared, too.

212
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,798
He can't read because he's scared.

213
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,385
I shouldn't scare him as well.

214
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:36,096
TAE I-RYEONG'S NEXT SCANDAL!
WHO IS HER MAN?

215
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,976
You should admit that it's you.

216
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,354
You don't care
about your four broken engagements.

217
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:49,068
It would be better
for Tae I-ryeong as well.

218
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,946
I don't want to.
Your face is all over the Internet anyway.

219
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,449
Why not just let the people
think it's you?

220
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,326
You should admit it.

221
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,161
I don't want to, either.

222
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,540
If both of you deny this,

223
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,001
it might become awkward for Tae I-ryeong.

224
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,838
People might say
she got caught two-timing us.

225
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:13,967
She's Kingdom's model.
I can't let her image be tainted.

226
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,387
Okay.

227
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,682
Neither of us will deny it.

228
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,017
What do you think?

229
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:24,895
Okay.

230
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,564
Has Tae Gong-sil seen the article?

231
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,859
Yes. I went to her office.
I think she's seen it.

232
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,444
What did she say?

233
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,239
She didn't seem bothered at all.

234
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,701
What is she doing right now?

235
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,330
She went to find a ghost
that is wandering by the entrance.

236
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,838
Please look at this.

237
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,215
Please look at this.

238
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,967
LOOKING FOR A MISSING CHILD

239
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,261
Goodness.

240
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,765
Please look at this.

241
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,184
Gong-ri.

242
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,896
That lady must have lost her child.

243
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,608
She looks really upset.

244
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,694
She must be so anxious.

245
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,529
I feel so bad for her.

246
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,450
The child she lost
is standing next to her.

247
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,871
Please take a look. Please!

248
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,458
Do you see something?

249
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,004
Her child is already dead.

250
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,255
What?

251
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,175
Thank you.

252
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:42,681
She thinks he's alive
and she's desperately looking for him.

253
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,642
Do you think I should go tell her?

254
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,397
How could anyone
tell her that her child is dead?

255
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:54,193
She might faint if she hears that.
Don't do it.

256
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,239
Oh, my gosh.

257
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,117
-Are you okay?
-Thank you.

258
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,952
I will help you.

259
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,623
-Here.
-Thank you.

260
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,751
Please look at this.

261
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:17,716
If I don't tell her, she'll probably
look for her child the rest of her life.

262
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,468
Excuse me.

263
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,262
Where did he go?

264
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,770
-Hold on.
-Hey, Gong-sil! Hey!

265
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,442
You must be U-jin. Hi.

266
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,073
I heard you like this snack.

267
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,574
Come on out here.

268
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,035
Let's talk. Come here.

269
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,745
What is she doing?

270
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,957
Is her strangeness what appeals to them?

271
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,334
It's Tae I-ryeong.

272
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,090
Tae I-ryeong had two scandals.

273
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,133
I know the truth.

274
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:04,096
-What is it?
-Neither of them is dating her.

275
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,809
They're both interested in that one.

276
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,361
I should be careful of scandals.

277
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,708
In any case, I told the reporters
it's not true.

278
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,585
I only had dinner with you.

279
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,172
And I only had coffee with you.

280
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,258
Aren't you grateful?

281
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,178
Neither of you should offend me.

282
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,016
If you do, I will say
that you're my boyfriend.

283
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,645
My model contract is almost over.

284
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,605
I won't have to come here.

285
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,025
I'm going to renew your contract.

286
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,445
Really?

287
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:05,240
I don't want to look like I ended
the contract because of the scandal.

288
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:11,830
Then Mr. Kang will be her bodyguard
at the autumn Kingdom fan meeting.

289
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,375
That is my job.

290
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,757
If my contract is renewed,
I'll be coming here a lot.

291
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,431
Mr. Kim, tell Mr. Do
to lower her modeling fees.

292
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,352
It's okay.

293
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,854
Big Sun.

294
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,148
Did you see my article?

295
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,276
-Yes, I did.
-You're not affected at all, are you?

296
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,612
Are you okay?

297
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,657
I don't like salarymen
or men who are cursed.

298
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:52,704
Are you here because you want
to be the fifth victim of the curse?

299
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,543
You're right about my wanting
to be here, but I am not leaving.

300
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,253
So I won't get cursed.

301
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,214
If you don't, then Mr. Joo will be.

302
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:07,135
A curse isn't something
you can avoid because you want to.

303
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,895
I can avoid it if the curse
is by a dead person.

304
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,231
Because I see dead people.

305
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,900
Right? Let's go.

306
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,445
LOOKING FOR A MISSING CHILD

307
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,283
She's still looking for him.

308
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,624
I should burn this.

309
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,382
I have to get rid of what's in here.

310
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,686
A child is sitting here.

311
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:05,944
But the mother thinks he's still alive
and is looking for him.

312
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:11,533
It says he was lost, so I think
something scary happened to him.

313
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,786
He's so scared
he won't answer any questions.

314
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:20,250
Are you saying that we should soothe
a child we can't even see?

315
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,172
I know how startling
it must be the first time.

316
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,507
I even followed a dog I cannot see.

317
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,094
What should we do?

318
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,016
I heard you're scared
of such things, Mr. Kang.

319
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,976
If you don't like this, you can go.

320
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,478
I've decided not to avoid scary things.

321
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:45,108
And I feel bad for the child
and the mother.

322
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,443
Tae Gong-sil.

323
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,279
How can I help?

324
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,948
Thank you, Woo.

325
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,786
It says that the child
likes to sing children's songs.

326
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,164
Shall I sing him a song?

327
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,503
He's wearing a shirt with a teddy bear,
he must really like them.

328
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,423
Then I should sing "Three Bears."

329
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,634
I will sing it for you.

330
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:14,804
It will be embarrassing
to sing alone, Mr. Kang.

331
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,642
Why don't we sing a line each?

332
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,520
Did you say his name is U-jin?

333
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,901
U-jin, we're going to sing for you,
so listen carefully, okay?

334
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,153
Go, Mr. Kang.

335
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:38,453
There are three bears in a house

336
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:42,707
Daddy bear, mommy bear, baby bear

337
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,336
The daddy bear is fat

338
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,923
The mommy bear is thin

339
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:53,677
The baby bear is so cute

340
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,433
Shrug, shrug, you're doing well

341
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,315
He's smiling. One more time, please.

342
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:12,821
-There are three bears in a house
-There are three bears in a house

343
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:16,950
-Daddy bear, mommy bear, baby bear

344
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,037

347
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:33,216

348
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,426
Shrug...

349
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,561
Shrug, shrug, you're doing well

350
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,647
-Shrug--
-You should stop now.

351
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:54,779
Ms. Tae was at the height of her life
when she got into the accident.

352
00:26:55,155 --> 00:27:00,035
She got into a mysterious accident
when she was 24 years old.

353
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,912
She was in the hospital for three years.

354
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,790
And she got up when she was 27 years old.

355
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,418
Then she continued living as a loser.

356
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,503
And recently she joined Kingdom.

357
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,756
So, what was that accident?

358
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,383
I haven't been able
to find out what it is yet.

359
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:23,016
You took Tae Gong-sil's sister out
for dinner and used a lot of money.

360
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,060
What did you ask her during dinner?

361
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,063
We're going to meet
for pig trotters tonight.

362
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,608
I will make sure to find out
what accident she was in.

363
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,612
-Are you doing a food tour?
-I'm sorry. I like to eat.

364
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,367
Thank you for dinner last night.

365
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,870
I'll buy the pig trotters tonight.

366
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,996
It's okay.

367
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:49,292
We were talking
about your sister's accident.

368
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,879
And you started drinking
a lot and got really drunk.

369
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:56,591
We didn't get to finish it.
I was really curious about it.

370
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:00,929
Yes, I started drinking
while talking about it.

371
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,640
I'm sorry.

372
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,684
I won't talk about
such gloomy things again.

373
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,478
-It's okay--
-See you later.

374
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:15,568
I talked so much about the army
that I didn't get the answer.

375
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:21,032
Why did she like hearing about me
playing soccer in the army?

376
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,203
She'll probably think
that I have more fun stories today.

377
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,038
Why is my leg asleep?

378
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,011
Is this where it happened?

379
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,016
Why didn't anyone see your body?

380
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,561
Did someone hide it?

381
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,816
GIMPO EUNSUNG CAR CENTER

382
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,072
How come no one saw it?

383
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,785
-That's strange.
-Excuse me.

384
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,914
-Are you looking for something?
-Well, I...

385
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,293
Do you know if there was
a traffic accident here?

386
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,421
-I don't think so.
-Really?

387
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,132
That's strange.

388
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,968
Are you looking for him?

389
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,804
Yes. Thank you.

390
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,018
U-jin?

391
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,777
Did she see something?

392
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,589
Hey. Oh, my gosh.

393
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,485
No, no one was here.

394
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,821
She didn't recognize me.

395
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,700
This is my son. Please take a look.

396
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,871
Excuse me, this is my son.
He's my son. Please look at this.

397
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,084
Please look at this. This is my son.

398
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,670
This is my son.

399
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,006
Please look at this.

400
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,679
Please look at this.

401
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:52,433
Please look at this.
This is my son. Please.

402
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,021
-Please look at this.
-Okay.

403
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:14,706
The mother doesn't know he's dead.
Shall I just tell her?

404
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:19,085
If she doesn't know, it will be painful,
but it'll be a reason to keep living.

405
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:23,214
If she finds out,
she will want to die, too.

406
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:27,385
She'll have to live in pain
with her dead child by her side.

407
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,721
I feel so bad.

408
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,140
The mother can't see her dead son.

409
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:37,937
If you say you can see him,
she'll be horrified by you.

410
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,609
When you find the child,
just contact the police.

411
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:43,985
I should do that, right?

412
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,072
Did you feel that way, too?

413
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,119
When I said I saw Cha Hui-ju's ghost...

414
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,204
Were you horrified?

415
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:02,670
I didn't like it when you said
she had been by my side for so long.

416
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,738
Are you staying by Jung-won
to heal his wound?

417
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,910
You don't need to.
Jung-won's been doing fine.

418
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,496
But he can't read.

419
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,207
You really do know his weakness.

420
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,168
Okay.

421
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,712
What can you do for him?

422
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,298
Can you bring the ghost of Hui-ju here?

423
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,593
Do you think doing that
will heal his wounds?

424
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,348
I can't seem to make
conversation with you, Bang-sil.

425
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,809
I'll make it easy. Leave Jung-won alone.

426
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,144
He's kept it buried
and has been doing fine.

427
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,064
Once the statute of limitations is over,
he will forget everything.

428
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:07,443
You reminding him of Hui-ju
is just putting him in more pain.

429
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,611
So, stay away.

430
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:13,199
Ms. Joo, if I talk about Hui-ju...

431
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,869
am I making things worse?

432
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,788
You're finally making sense.

433
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,709
Yes, you're making things worse.
So, get away from him.

434
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,559
ONE STORMY NIGHT

435
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,611
Why are there so many words?

436
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,238
I'm so thirsty.

437
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,839
I wonder if Mr. Kang had a beer today.

438
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,009
Why are you here?

439
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,138
To keep my beer here.

440
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:23,311
-Why would you keep it here?
-My fridge is full.

441
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,771
That makes no sense.

442
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,940
Your fridge is as big as this room.
How can there be no space?

443
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:31,486
There isn't. Do you want to see?
Bring your soda and come, then.

444
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,820
No.

445
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,199
There's no space to keep
your beer in my tiny fridge.

446
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,576
-Take it back.
-Space can be made.

447
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,961
Look, there is space now.

448
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,383
But one can of beer is missing.
Has he had one?

449
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,180
How did you know? He just had one.

450
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,975
One of Woo's friends is a police officer,
and Woo said he'll ask him

451
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,353
to find out if there was
a traffic accident.

452
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,939
Why did you tell him?
You should have told me.

453
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,649
You said it was horrifying.

454
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:14,237
I totally understand. I will deal with it.

455
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,406
You don't have to deal
with stuff regarding Hui-ju.

456
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:21,744
You once met Hui-ju through me, right?

457
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,163
What did she tell you?

458
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,125
Did she say something horrible?

459
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,920
I didn't fool you, Jung-won.

460
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,174
I want you to return
to the guy you used to be.

461
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,135
I love you.

462
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,853
Yes, she said something very horrible.

463
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,773
She said I wasn't fooled, and that
she wanted me to return to my old self.

464
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:52,817
And that she loves me.

465
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,447
If she said that,
maybe something is wrong.

466
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:03,578
Woo said he found
something strange about her.

467
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,872
Did you ask him about it?

468
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,874
I didn't want to know, so I didn't ask.

469
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,500
Are you scared about that, too?

470
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:11,919
Yes.

471
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,756
Would you like to deal with it, then?

472
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:21,971
Come to think of it, you'll have
to deal with it to stay with me.

473
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:29,896
When we are together,
you'll see Hui-ju when she appears.

474
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:35,234
You must feel bad
when you see a ghost that loves me.

475
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,280
Don't tell me, even if you see her.

476
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,282
If you touch me, she will disappear.

477
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:45,411
And you'll feel even worse
for sending her away.

478
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:51,250
But wouldn't it be better
than the three of us being together?

479
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,129
Can you handle it? No, right?

480
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,423
Don't do anything
if you can't deal with it.

481
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,304
I will. Because that's what I'm good at.

482
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,226
Don't ignore it. You should find out.

483
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,979
You haven't been
able to read for 15 years.

484
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,106
Don't you think it's time you read again?

485
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,401
It's embarrassing to avoid something
because you're scared.

486
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,738
Let go. I'm going to leave.

487
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,159
It's embarrassing. So, let me go.

488
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,596
I haven't finished one book yet.
This is so embarrassing.

489
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,811
I started this,
so I'm going to read all of them.

490
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:56,941
How much does the wolf endure?
How shameless is the goat?

491
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,659
ONE STORMY NIGHT

492
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:46,157
Mr. Joo has still not asked
about Cha Hui-ju.

493
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,784
Yes, I am waiting.

494
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:54,623
Mr. Kang, did you hear
that Tae I-ryeong is in the hospital?

495
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,169
I did. It must be the timing to get sick.

496
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,091
He's so cold.

497
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,093
He's a cold Dooly.

498
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,306
Is she really sick?

499
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,155
Kang Woo.

500
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,407
How can you act like this?

501
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,997
-Like what?
-You must have seen the news.

502
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,125
Couldn't you have visited me
with soju and squid?

503
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,087
Didn't you criticize me
for trying to keep you clinging to me?

504
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,885
Do I look like I'd keep clinging to you
for just soju and squid?

505
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,389
I'm as famous as the black whale
in the Pacific Ocean.

506
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,682
Yes, you sure are.

507
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:58,270
Thanks to you, a friend who works
in China told me he saw me on the news.

508
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,355
You!

509
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:04,235
You don't have the ambition
to date someone as famous as me, do you?

510
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,488
No, I can't handle a whale like you.

511
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,449
What about a dolphin, then?

512
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:17,456
Even if you're an anchovy,
I have no intention of seeing you.

513
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,587
Why would I become an anchovy for you?
Are you crazy?

514
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,090
Mr. Kang.

515
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,137
Mr. Joo wants you
to report to him about Cha Hui-ju.

516
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:21,228
My father said you will explain
what he gave to me, so go ahead.

517
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,439
It took you long enough.

518
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,942
This is all my father asked you to do.

519
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,488
-Are you going to leave now?
-No, I won't.

520
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:34,617
You could work at the Blue House.
But you'll stay at a shopping mall.

521
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:40,080
You even got an apartment.
Why aren't you moving?

522
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:46,504
I'll wait until you end things
with Cha Hui-ju and don't need Gong-sil.

523
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,466
What's in here? Explain it.

524
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:59,141
It's a photo that the chairman
found in Europe.

525
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,233
Cha Hui-ju?

526
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:14,365
He thinks Cha Hui-ju is alive
and is somewhere near you.

527
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,492
Hui-ju is dead.

528
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,870
Who is this woman
that looks exactly like her?

529
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:23,415
The woman in the photo said
she's a big fan of Agatha Christie.

530
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:29,296
The name on the postcards is "Wargrave,"
a character from one of the novels.

531
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,257
Wargrave.

532
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,343
It's a name I cannot forget.

533
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,180
"You have been invited here
by some crazy person."

534
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,599
And Then There Were None.

535
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,268
"It could be a brutal murderer."

536
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,604
It's the name of the culprit
in the last novel that I read.

537
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,691
Hui-ju was an orphan.

538
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,026
Did she have a twin sister?

539
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:56,198
And is that the person
she wants to protect?

540
00:42:56,615 --> 00:43:00,703
THE LATE CHA HUI-JU

541
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,301
Hui-ju!

542
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,519
-Hui-ju! No!
-It's dangerous!

543
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:30,316
-Hui-ju! No!
-It's dangerous!

544
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,613
Which one of you died?

545
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,908
I am sorry, Joo Jung-won.

546
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,374
The person you want to protect.

547
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,252
I have to find that person.

548
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:14,336
Joo Jung-won, did you come here
to meet Cha Hui-ju?

549
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,339
Thank you.

550
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,974
If I knew where you are,
I could tell your mother.

551
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,446
Is the lost kid still here?

552
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,615
Yes. But he won't speak.

553
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:51,165
I got dragged into your world
and heard what you hear and see.

554
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:56,086
But I cannot hear or see any of it.

555
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:01,091
I just listen to you and look at you.

556
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,306
I just kept looking at you.

557
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,727
And now I'm totally possessed.

558
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,899
I guess so. It's all my fault.

559
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,776
Yes, it's your fault.

560
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,949
I am able to find out more about Hui-ju,
because of you.

561
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:27,659
Tae Gong-sil.

562
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,288
I went to see Hui-ju.

563
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:33,916
That's good.

564
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,251
I'm even reading books these days.

565
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,753
You can read again?

566
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,922
No, I'm not making progress.

567
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,466
But I keep looking at them.

568
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,551
What are you reading?

569
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,763
They're very sophisticated books.

570
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:51,725
There are a total of six books.
My brain is getting fried because of them.

571
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,979
They must be really great books.
You have to finish them.

572
00:46:56,688 --> 00:47:00,984
Okay. When I read all
of the books, then...

573
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,615
I will have enhanced my level
and I won't be embarrassed.

574
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,745
I have a meeting, so I'm going out.

575
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,165
Let's go tell the mother together.

576
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,294
Thank you for saying you'll do it with me.

577
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,307
I'll go alone to the Sejin meeting.

578
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,144
You should go to the orphanage
Hui-ju grew up in.

579
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,688
What is this about?

580
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:44,486
Please find out if Hui-ju had a twin.

581
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,116
I will tell you more when I get back.

582
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,784
Okay.

583
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,998
He must have found out.

584
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:03,922
Is that why he went to visit Hui-ju?

585
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,801
Who is this, then?

586
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:12,848
Could it be Hanna?

587
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:28,405
She takes care of my nephew's home.
She is the best.

588
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:32,826
My nephew likes everything neat,
and she satisfies his needs well.

589
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,373
I didn't mean to burden you. Thank you.

590
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,792
Please take good care of my place.

591
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,213
What are these?

592
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:48,467
They're Mr. Joo's.
He said not to touch them.

593
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,552
-Jung-won's?
-Yes.

594
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:54,848
-They're storybooks.
-But he can't read yet, can he?

595
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,564
How did you know he can't read?

596
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,865
I think your husband told me
when we had wine last time.

597
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,201
I can't believe this.

598
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:18,205
You can keep secrets, can't you, Hanna?

599
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:19,748
Yes.

600
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,001
Maybe he likes the illustrations.

601
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:26,463
What is this? "One Stormy Night?"

602
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,423
He's reading a fun book.

603
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:29,925
Do you know this book?

604
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,344
The writer is quite famous.

605
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,640
It's about a wolf and goat
who like each other and co-exist.

606
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,851
How can a wolf and goat be together?

607
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,936
I know.

608
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:44,231
They stay together,
even though they shouldn't.

609
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,151
And the one who likes the other more dies.

610
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:51,571
It's the wolf that likes the goat more.

611
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,623
The person I like was in pain
for a long time.

612
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,543
I don't want that
to happen to your mother.

613
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,547
Let's let her know where you are now.

614
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,135
It's someplace dark.

615
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,183
Let's go together. Let's go.

616
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,671
Where did she go?

617
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,092
Where are you going?

618
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:56,970
U-jin, is it this place?

619
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,521
Who's there?

620
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,733
You're the girl from before.

621
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,488
Are you looking for something?

622
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:18,784
Why did you come here?

623
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,328
Are you looking for something?

624
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,330
Yes, I've come to look for something.

625
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:27,375
What are you looking for
at a car repair center?

626
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:28,877
Well...

627
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,631
It's nothing. I should go.

628
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:33,548
Hold on.

629
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:39,346
I'm glad you came.
I wanted to ask you something.

630
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,433
Give me a minute, please wait here.

631
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,277
U-jin.

632
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,522
Tae Gong-sil. What is it?

633
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:34,067
Mr. Joo, I followed U-jin.

634
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,193
U-jin?

635
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,322
-The dead kid.
-I...

636
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,617
I think I've found him.

637
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,287
Yes, I'm at...

638
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,833
Where are you, Gong-sil?

639
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,798
Miss, are you here?

640
00:52:59,050 --> 00:52:59,885
Tae Gong-sil!

641
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,219
Tae Gong-sil!

642
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,264
Tae Gong-sil!

643
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,268
What is going on?

644
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,447
You came alone.

645
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,326
I guess you haven't told anyone yet.

646
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,086
I've found U-jin.

647
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,255
I'm at Gimpo Eunsung Car Center.

648
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,049
I think the owner killed U-jin.

649
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:41,635
U-jin is in that man's car trunk.

650
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,434
No!

651
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:57,525
What is this?

652
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,033
Why isn't she answering?

653
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,204
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

654
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,255
MESSAGE

655
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,020
You have to read this.

656
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:35,772
You have to.

657
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,942
You can read it. You will read it!

658
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,990
Where are you, Tae Gong-sil?

659
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,004
"Gimpo...

660
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,467
Eunsung...

661
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,762
GIMPO EUNSUNG CAR CENTER

662
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,517
...Car Center."

663
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,830
It rained a lot recently.
So, the reservoir

664
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,791
is filled with water.

665
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:42,547
You're the killer and you killed yourself
because of the guilt.

666
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,550
You didn't see U-jin, did you?

667
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,179
You cried after you hit U-jin.

668
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,307
Why didn't you take him to the hospital?

669
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,518
How did you know that?

670
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,687
Did you see it?

671
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,732
U-jin told me.

672
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,193
You're crazy.

673
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,322
Do you think it ends when someone dies?

674
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,868
He is watching you right now.

675
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:16,748
He's watching you,
just the way he was when he died.

676
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,752
He's watching you
from right in front of you.

677
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,018
Shut up!

678
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:55,703
Hello?

679
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,639
No one saw me.
I just have to get rid of her.

680
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,112
Come here.

681
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,072
Come here!

682
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,287
-Tae Gong-sil!
-Mr. Joo!

683
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,122
Tae Gong-sil!

684
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,574
Mr. Joo.

685
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,452
I told you to be careful.

686
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:20,872
You got hurt.

687
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,750
I'm okay. Did you call the police?

688
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:24,959
Yes.

689
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,587
It's a relief that you are okay.

690
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,550
What's wrong?
