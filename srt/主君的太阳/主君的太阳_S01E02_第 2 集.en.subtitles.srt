1
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,694
What are you doing?

2
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,490
I really want to sleep.

3
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,325
Get a hold of yourself and open your eyes.

4
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,288
-Please sleep with me.
-What?

5
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,749
Are you asking to sleep with me?

6
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,257
Are you trying to sleep
with me in this state?

7
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,427
Let's do it. I can sleep with you.

8
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,013
I can't sleep with you.

9
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,182
Stop dreaming.

10
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,897
Do you think touching me
and asking to sleep with me

11
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,441
will make me fall for you?

12
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,113
When did you last wash your hair?

13
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,286
Wash your hair
if you want to seduce someone.

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,748
You're not even going to sleep with me.

15
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,460
Why did you come here?

16
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,048
I heard you talked about me
to other people.

17
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:36,095
What did you hear about me?
Or do you really know something about her?

18
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,808
Did you know Hui-ju?

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,394
Oh, that girl's name is Hui-ju?

20
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:44,813
What?

21
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,649
How do you know her?

22
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,442
I saw her.

23
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,780
-I saw that girl.
-What?

24
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,785
-Are you still not awake? She is--
-Dead.

25
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:09,129
Yes, Hui-ju died a long time ago.
So, how and when did you see her?

26
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:14,926
I recently saw her next to you.

27
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,308
I see dead people.

28
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,399
Mr. Joo's woman is a ghost.

29
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,193
It's a famous story at Kingdom.

30
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,990
The president, Mr. Joo, can't get married
because of his first love who died.

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,244
Every time he tried to get married,
the ghost turned up and stopped it, right?

32
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:46,541
Do you mean the girl who died
in the case related to Mr. Joo?

33
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,376
Yes. It was a famous case.

34
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,296
I remember seeing it
on the news when I was young.

35
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:56,384
A rich kid and his girlfriend
had been kidnapped together.

36
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,387
They paid the ransom
but didn't catch the kidnappers, right?

37
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,974
It was about 10 billion won then.
It's the same as about 100 billion now.

38
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,810
-It would be about 100 billion.
-Wow.

39
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,772
The people who took that money
must be enjoying their lives now.

40
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:14,110
Do the employees call Mr. Joo "Master"?

41
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:18,239
Mr. Joo is the king of Kingdom.
So we call him the Master.

42
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:22,160
He's a mean tyrant.
He's living comfortably as the president.

43
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,788
It's no wonder the girl
who got killed became a ghost.

44
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,625
"Jung-won."

45
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,128
"Please get revenge for me!"

46
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,507
There's a rumor
that she wanders around Kingdom like that.

47
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,760
-Let's have a drink.
-Cheers!

48
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,179
Gosh, it's going to be scary
doing rounds at night.

49
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,558
I almost died once.

50
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,395
Since then, I see dead people.

51
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,485
So you're saying that you recently
saw Hui-ju, who died 15 years ago?

52
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,991
I saw her on the day
that you got mad at me.

53
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,203
She's dead and it's over.
Don't bother the living.

54
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:40,947
It was for a brief moment.

55
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,616
But I saw that girl.

56
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,618
You see ghosts?

57
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,998
Are there ghosts here right now?
How many are there?

58
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,211
See that chair?

59
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,090
It's rocking when there's no wind.

60
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,634
So?

61
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,720
There's a ghost there.

62
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,226
There is a ghost there?

63
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,148
Some come to see me
and I see some on the streets.

64
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,153
I try to ignore them
but they keep coming after me.

65
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,907
Some want to talk to me.

66
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,536
And sometimes they ask for favors.

67
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,416
They won't let me sleep.
It's so scary and I hate it.

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,169
But I have no choice
but to listen to them.

69
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,349
But when I touch you,
I can't see or hear them.

70
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,395
I've never met anyone like you.

71
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,774
That's why you're special to me.

72
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,568
I wonder what you are to me.

73
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,029
If I stay with you,

74
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:07,450
I might be able to sleep
and live a normal life, too.

75
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,870
I want to be by your side.

76
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,414
Do you really want to be by my side?

77
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,418
If this building is yours,
I will give you some attention.

78
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,253
The land is expensive here.

79
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:26,052
It's really painful.
You can't see or hear them.

80
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,303
But I'm so scared.

81
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,222
I'm not scared
of what I can't see or hear.

82
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,641
I'm scared of you, who I can see and hear.

83
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,984
Are you scared
because the chair is rocking?

84
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,866
Does this scare you more?

85
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:55,039
If you try anything funny again,
I will show you how scary I can be.

86
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:13,433
Whatever you do to me
won't be as scary as what I see now.

87
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,726
I just want to escape to your side.

88
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,188
So it's not because I'm rich
or because I'm really handsome.

89
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,898
It's because you're scared of ghosts?

90
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,651
This is a new pick-up line.

91
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,403
It's an act of desperation.

92
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,614
I'm so lonely and sad right now.

93
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,786
Look, Tae Gong-sil.

94
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,790
Even the comic book character Candy
tied up her hair neatly

95
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,417
when she hit on a rich guy.

96
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,254
Even if she was lonely and sad.

97
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,257
Wash your hair and get a hold of yourself.

98
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:52,346
You think I'm a poor girl
who's trying to seduce a rich man.

99
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,934
I'll do it.

100
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,896
Can I just be Candy?

101
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,315
Do you think you'll be able to seduce me?

102
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,360
Okay, try to bewitch me
with your ghost friends.

103
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,238
You smelly and gloomy Candy.

104
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,492
I'm the sun.

105
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,994
Tae Gong-sil.

106
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,079
Tae, like the sun.

107
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:18,873
The sun?

108
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,128
If you're the sun, I don't ever
want morning to come again.

109
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:31,052
The sun will rise
and I will go to your side.

110
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,888
I'll wash my hair next time.

111
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,523
Did you meet Ms. Tae, Mr. Joo?

112
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,067
Did you meet Tae Gong-sil?

113
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,077
I shouldn't have come here. Let's go.

114
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,620
All right.

115
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,637
Why did he come here?

116
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,655
He probably thinks I'm crazy.

117
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,408
I really saw the ghost.

118
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,372
Hui-ju...

119
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,293
I really saw that girl, too.

120
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,309
There's a ghost there.

121
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,617
If ghosts really exist,
I would like to summon her.

122
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,202
Cha Hui-ju.

123
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,626
Bunshinsaba.

124
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,254
Bunshinsaba. Please come here.

125
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:36,594
Bunshinsaba. Please come here.

126
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:42,850
Bunshinsaba. Please come here.

127
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:48,606
Bunshinsaba. Please come here.

128
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,149
What are they doing?

129
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,486
They're summoning the ghost of Eun-seol.

130
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,781
Bunshinsaba.

131
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,826
Are you here?

132
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,378
She's here.

133
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,897
Are you Lee Eun-seol?

134
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,612
It's Eun-seol.

135
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,573
It's a prank. Don't mind them.

136
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,409
Why did you die?

137
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,328
Is the person who killed you...

138
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:46,997
in this room?

139
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,668
Tell me.

140
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,503
Is she...

141
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,964
in here?

142
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,344
Is the person who killed you in this room?

143
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,696
What are you doing? Everyone sit down.

144
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,957
Do you think it was Eun-seol?

145
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,625
Don't react to such pranks.

146
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,752
Let's study.

147
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,940
LEE EUN-SEOL

148
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,775
-It's Eun-seol.
-What?

149
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,802
Was this photo taken
at the Kingdom fountain?

150
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,473
Yes, this photo is all over the Internet.

151
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,976
Isn't it just a bad photo?

152
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,854
Maybe the camera shook when they took it.

153
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,023
The other girls look fine.

154
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,818
Isn't her position weird? Look.

155
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,950
She had to have been standing here.

156
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:47,952
You're right.

157
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,205
She wouldn't have been in the water.

158
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,542
Then,

159
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,710
is it really a ghost?

160
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,713
If this photo is real,
it's a psychic photo.

161
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,926
A psychic photo? Are you kidding me?

162
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,178
I did an experiment myself.

163
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,682
It'd be hard to get a photo like that

164
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,643
if it weren't a ghost.

165
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,061
It must be a fake photo.

166
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,689
Our company image isn't good
after the wedding incident.

167
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,066
And now this?

168
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,070
Mr. Do. Are you doing your job?

169
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,283
I asked the portal sites
to delete the photos.

170
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:31,328
In any case, Kingdom is a popular
search word because of this photo.

171
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,706
"Kingdom psychic photo." "Kingdom ghost."

172
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,377
The employees say there's
a myth that ghosts bring good luck.

173
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,005
Is this funny to you?

174
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,676
Do you find this funny?

175
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,721
Well...

176
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,807
I am scared of ghosts.

177
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,267
But it's also interesting.

178
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,145
This is no time to be playing with ghosts.

179
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:06,572
The Giant Mall, which is 1.5 times
bigger than us, is being built right now.

180
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,032
It will open in two months.

181
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,492
A giant scarier than ghosts is growing.

182
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,328
Is it only two months away?

183
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,580
That was fast.

184
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,084
Get a hold of yourself if you don't want
to be crying in two months.

185
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,922
Tell the employees to possess the
customers, not get possessed by ghosts.

186
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,967
Make them open up their wallets
and spend their money!

187
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,935
My friend is a broadcast writer.
Shall I tell him about this?

188
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,895
I heard there's a reward
if your story gets chosen.

189
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:42,775
This is my photo. It's my ghost. Mine.

190
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,319
You do a lot of useless thinking.

191
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,906
Fine.

192
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,129
KINGDOM
PART-TIMERS WANTED

193
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,760
-Hey.
-Oh, my gosh.

194
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,387
Gong-sil.

195
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,848
Why are you out and not sleeping at home?

196
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,476
-Did you come to see me?
-No.

197
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:21,355
I got a job at Kingdom.

198
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:22,731
What?

199
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,445
Gong-sil, I just became
the manager of this store.

200
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:33,575
If you get arrested or get sent
to a hospital, I can't work here anymore.

201
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,953
That won't happen here.

202
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,622
There's something special here.

203
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,877
Don't you see those things here?

204
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,714
There's somewhere to run away to.
I won't see them there.

205
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,345
Why are you drinking two cups of coffee?

206
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,514
It's because you're trying to
stay awake, right?

207
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,854
Some kid keeps following me
and asking for some coffee.

208
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,148
So, I ordered one for him.

209
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,493
I should go.

210
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,830
Hey. Hey, Gong-sil!

211
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:31,508
This is the photo we took
on the day that Eun-seol died.

212
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,555
Right. But why is the ghost
of Eun-seol in the photo?

213
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,850
Do you think Eun-seol sent it to us?

214
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,436
To show us that she hates us?

215
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,899
It must be a prank.
Some think she died because of us.

216
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,485
It was a traffic accident.
It was not our fault.

217
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:53,280
I think that it was because of us.

218
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:58,911
She wouldn't have died
if we didn't do that to her that day.

219
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:05,918
I think Eun-seol hates us
and is lingering around us.

220
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,922
What is the rumor
about the ghost in the photo?

221
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,674
There's a rumor that it's the girl
that died because of Mr. Joo.

222
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,303
How can they say that?
Who said such a thing?

223
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,346
Not me.

224
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,390
I heard the employees talking about it.

225
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,520
Everyone knows about Mr. Joo's incident
because it was a famous case.

226
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:29,108
And they always said
that the ghost lingers around him.

227
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,318
She died a long time ago.

228
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,115
Is this the girl who died?

229
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,826
She did have long hair.

230
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,538
And she was probably
around this age when she died.

231
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,207
But I can't remember her face.

232
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,419
People your age don't have a good memory.

233
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,095
I heard that a ghost appeared here.

234
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,264
A ghost? Let's take a photo.

235
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,182
What are you doing?

236
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,225
Come on.

237
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,020
Go up there.

238
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,607
Are they still talking
about that psychic photo?

239
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:15,612
I think Mr. Do is taking care of it, but
it's hard to make such a rumor go away.

240
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,616
And an absurd rumor has been added to it.

241
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,952
What is the absurd rumor
that has been added?

242
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,288
Well, that is...

243
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,751
-Gosh! I'm all wet!
-Are you okay?

244
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,128
Come on, get out.

245
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,255
We shouldn't have come
to this ghost fountain.

246
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,464
I'm sorry.

247
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,675
"Ghost fountain."

248
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,891
This is an expensive fountain.
I bought four pricy goddesses.

249
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,977
Have the goddesses
been overpowered by a ghost?

250
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,606
Ghosts are more exciting
than beautiful goddesses.

251
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,443
Beauty makes people relax
but fear makes them nervous.

252
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,864
It makes people want
to come here and look at it.

253
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,576
That's why people
get possessed by such things.

254
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,670
This is so exciting that it is a nuance.

255
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,802
What are you doing? Why did you come here?

256
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,429
I'm cleaning here.

257
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,347
TAE GONG-SIL

258
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,348
I got a job.

259
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,731
There are many places to clean.
Why did you have to come here?

260
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,026
Because you are here.

261
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,906
You're taking the standard procedure.

262
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,826
Girls trying to seduce guys work at
a place where they can be noticed,

263
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,247
so that they can get close to them
and maybe even go on dates.

264
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,873
Is that what you expected?

265
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,543
I know you don't believe me.

266
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,838
But you know
that's not what I expect from you.

267
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,549
Right, you said
it's because of the ghosts.

268
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:01,843
Ghosts.

269
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,390
I heard there's one here.
Did you come to meet a friend?

270
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,766
There's a ghost here?

271
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:13,730
There aren't any.

272
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,148
Really?

273
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:19,278
Yes. There aren't any.
If there were, I would have...

274
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,364
touched you.

275
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,658
Are there really none? Are you sure?

276
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,412
Right?

277
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,291
This is too expensive
to be possessed by a ghost.

278
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,543
I'm sure there aren't any here.

279
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,213
That's a relief.

280
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,178
Are you saying that you believe me?

281
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,515
You believe me, right?

282
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,105
Of course not. There are no ghosts.

283
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,566
It's not because I believe you.
There are no such things as ghosts.

284
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,359
And you.

285
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:00,986
Don't work here.

286
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,571
Why not?

287
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,490
It's only natural
that I want to kick you out of here.

288
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,868
Get lost, Ms. Tae.

289
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,839
Mr. Joo.

290
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,300
Something has happened.

291
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,138
I don't know
when the station came to cover it.

292
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,849
But the psychic photo
will be broadcast on TV today.

293
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,394
Why is this childish prank
getting broadcast?

294
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,855
I think the rumor
has spread in a strange direction.

295
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,858
I think it got mixed
with the rumor about your past.

296
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:45,906
There is a photo that is a big issue
on the Internet.

297
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,872
An unidentified face
was photographed behind the girls.

298
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,752
When there are mysterious ghosts
seen in photos,

299
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,546
we call them "psychic photos."

300
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,759
So, who is this woman in the photo?

301
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,972
We were investigating
the mystery of this photo.

302
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:14,601
We found a connection between
the location of this photo

303
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,729
and a terrible incident
that happened in the past.

304
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,856
Do you remember

305
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,610
the 10 billion won
kidnapping case from 15 years ago?

306
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,364
The son of Mr. Joo, a wealthy man,
was kidnapped with his girlfriend.

307
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,741
And while confronting the kidnappers

308
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,284
who asked for a 10-billion-won ransom,

309
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:36,665
the girlfriend Ms. Cha was murdered
in this tragic incident.

310
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:41,086
Mr. Joo, who was kidnapped
together with the girl...

311
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,634
is the current president

312
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,887
of the shopping mall
where the photo was taken.

313
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:58,186
People say there have been
strange rumors about this place.

314
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:04,609
Everyone knows about the ghost
of the president's dead girlfriend.

315
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,321
So when I patrol...
I mean, when I come here at night

316
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:14,286
there's a strange feeling,
and some of the employees say they saw...

317
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:19,249
The ghost of the president's dead
girlfriend is said to appear here.

318
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,132
She's not the girl that I saw.

319
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:32,429
We found the detective
who had been in charge of that case.

320
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,141
The statute of limitations
will expire soon.

321
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,936
The case will be closed
without the kidnappers getting caught,

322
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,398
so the late victim must feel wronged.

323
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,277
Who is this woman in the photo?

324
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,155
Is it the spirit of the late Ms. Cha?

325
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:54,826
Or could the photo have been
manipulated as a prank?

326
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,786
One thing is for sure.

327
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,957
The place where the photo was taken...

328
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:06,588
holds the spirit of a young woman
who died unfairly.

329
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:14,971
Excuse me.

330
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,142
It's not her.

331
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:25,232
The woman in the photo isn't
Cha Hui-ju, the girl lingering around you.

332
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,067
It's wrong, right?

333
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:28,902
Shut it and move.

334
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,755
Did you see that on TV?

335
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:53,301
They said this was a ghost
that was always at Kingdom.

336
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,761
But this is Eun-seol.

337
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,889
We all know that.

338
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,434
Shall we go there?

339
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,565
Why did you agree
to do an interview with them?

340
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,402
The statute of limitations
will expire on that case soon.

341
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,947
I thought I might find some sort
of clue if it became viral.

342
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,867
Do you think they will give themselves up
because of a ghost?

343
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,912
If they see it, they will feel some guilt.

344
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,417
In a way, Cha Hui-ju
was sacrificed for your business.

345
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,377
Don't you feel sorry?

346
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:33,258
You're the president of Kingdom.
You seem to have a good life now.

347
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,387
But don't you think
you shouldn't forget her?

348
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:41,349
You seem to be upset
that I'm living a good life.

349
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,936
"Forget everything.
The living must go on living."

350
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,733
I didn't forget what you
said to me 15 years ago.

351
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,526
Did I say that?

352
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,073
In any case,
I'm not giving up on this case.

353
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,617
Then please find the money

354
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,245
that I lost.

355
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,916
Are you really better now?

356
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,297
You had post-traumatic
stress disorder after the incident.

357
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,550
Can you read now?

358
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,930
I am better now.

359
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:26,394
I guess you didn't really
get over everything.

360
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,032
I wonder who she is.

361
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,492
You said it's a ghost.

362
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,119
Maybe she's dead.

363
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,164
You said you can see them.

364
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,292
You should go find her.

365
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,251
Right?

366
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,254
If I find her, I will be helping him.

367
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,591
If I help him, he might let me
stay by his side, right?

368
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,388
Your mother's not coming home
tonight either?

369
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,849
No. I guess she's busy making money.

370
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:09,521
You should eat up
and sleep here if you're sleepy.

371
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,067
I'm going to go somewhere for a minute.

372
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,447
Even if she's weird,
you should pretend to believe her.

373
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,618
That way, she'll keep giving us food.

374
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,082
Eat.

375
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,869
I saw some ghosts while I was cleaning.

376
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,929
Can I see your face?

377
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:11,100
I'm sorry. I don't think it's you.

378
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,151
Gosh.

379
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,451
Oh, my gosh.

380
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,165
Excuse...

381
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,295
Have you seen a girl who looks like this?

382
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,343
Could...

383
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,847
Could you take a closer look at this?

384
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,392
She lingers around
the fountain over there.

385
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,487
Everyone ignores me
when I tell them to go away.

386
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,366
It's obvious
that they won't answer my questions.

387
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,953
I'm so sleepy.

388
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,591
Are you human?

389
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,687
What are you doing here,
acting like a stray cat?

390
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,566
You're from Room 404.

391
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,820
That's right. You said you work here.

392
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,491
I saw you walking around here
from the security office.

393
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,535
I clean here.

394
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,080
I started working here a few days ago.

395
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,793
The cleaning crew has already clocked out.

396
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:09,636
I lost something while cleaning,
so I was trying to find it.

397
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,728
I will look around a little more.

398
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,271
I will come with you.

399
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,731
It's okay.

400
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,400
It's scary to go around alone in the dark.

401
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,110
There's a rumor that there are ghosts.

402
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,571
I will come with you.

403
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,164
There's no one here. Let's go.

404
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,375
What if Eun-seol appears?

405
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,087
Then let's ask her
why she's tormenting us.

406
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,226
What are you looking for?

407
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,229
It's not something you can see.

408
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,524
I have good eyesight.

409
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,318
You still won't be able to see it.

410
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,696
I have a name, you know.

411
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,534
I'm Kang Woo.

412
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,537
I'm Tae Gong-sil.

413
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:19,706
Gosh.

414
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,006
You can hold me if you're scared.

415
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,675
Thank you.

416
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,899
Eun-seol. We came to meet you.

417
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,569
We have something to tell you.

418
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,655
Are you here?

419
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,954
What?

420
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,080
Over there.

421
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,833
They're people.

422
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,502
You're right. They seem like students.

423
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,963
What are those four doing there?

424
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,257
There are only three.

425
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,973
Hey, girls!

426
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,017
What are you doing there?

427
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:24,979
Hey, girls!

428
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,288
Is it you?

429
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,739
If we got caught,
we'd have been in trouble.

430
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,825
We shouldn't have come here.

431
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,624
This is you, right?

432
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,903
This place hasn't changed in 15 years.

433
00:35:56,445 --> 00:36:01,784
Did you come because
the statute of limitations is expiring?

434
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:33,191
Did you really not see
the kidnappers' faces when you were here?

435
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,226
JOO JUNG-WON

436
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,847
I didn't.

437
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,350
I guess if you did,

438
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,479
you would have died, just like Cha Hui-ju.

439
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,314
That's right.

440
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,693
She knew who the kidnappers were.

441
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,238
That's why she died.

442
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:07,201
-Is the curse of Kingdom true?
-Of course not.

443
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,788
They say my wedding was canceled
because of the curse.

444
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,792
That wasn't a curse.
He had a change of heart.

445
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,507
Yoo Hye-seong. I will curse you.

446
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,097
On the day of my wedding,

447
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:32,643
a woman came with Hye-seong's old things.
Do you find out who she is?

448
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,812
My husband said he saw her face.

449
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,316
If we find her, I will destroy her.

450
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,567
Let me know first.

451
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,194
I will destroy her myself.

452
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,555
Seeing the sun in the morning
is very unpleasant because of you.

453
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,601
Must I see your face
as soon as I get to work?

454
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,811
I told you to quit.

455
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,646
I found out.

456
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,524
-What?
-The ghost in the photo.

457
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,985
I found out who she is.

458
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,445
Who is it?

459
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:33,579
If I tell you, will you let me work here?

460
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,375
If you're wrong,

461
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,002
you will be cleaning a jail floor.

462
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,720
That's her seat.

463
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,515
Lee Eun-seol. She died a month ago.

464
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,017
And those three.

465
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:59,980
They're Lee Eun-seol's friends
who came to the fountain yesterday.

466
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,691
Then, they must be the ones who did this.

467
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,321
Did you really do this?

468
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,950
Eun-seol was your friend.
Why did you do this?

469
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,201
We didn't do it.

470
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,497
Eun-seol was photographed
in the photo that we took without her.

471
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,251
And Eun-seol sent it to us after she died.

472
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:24,213
-She's trying to torment us.
-Stop talking about ghosts.

473
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,006
Tell me what you did.

474
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,677
You tormented her when she was alive
and you're doing it again.

475
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,679
Isn't that why you did this?

476
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,347
We never tormented her.

477
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,476
Eun-seol was the one who gave us
a hard time by ruining everything.

478
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,603
-Hey!
-Hey!

479
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,230
You should have been careful!

480
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,523
What are we going to do?

481
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,984
This will affect our grades.
What are you doing to do?

482
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,864
I'm so sorry. What should I do?

483
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,911
She was slow and dim-witted.
She always ruined what we did.

484
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,039
You guys, I bought us drinks.

485
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,418
Are you trying to make it up
with drinks again?

486
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,962
I'm so sorry.
I don't have much pocket money.

487
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,174
Here. Apple, orange, lemon.

488
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,508
I got your favorites.

489
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,345
This looks good.

490
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:19,226
She always ate our food and
she just bought drinks once in a while.

491
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,228
But we didn't say anything.

492
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,608
Lee Eun-seol was
a nuisance and leeched off of us.

493
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,944
So did you kill her
and say that she's a ghost?

494
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,613
She didn't die because of us.

495
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,410
We were so irritated
that she ruined our cake that day.

496
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,079
So, we decided to hang out without her.

497
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,123
But she followed us.

498
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,752
We want to hang out without you today.

499
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,130
-What?
-We want to hang out by ourselves.

500
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,966
You should go if you had errands here.

501
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,179
Oh. That's right.

502
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,847
I had errands to run.

503
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,142
I'm busy, so I'll go. Have fun.

504
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,482
Ga-yeong, wasn't that too straightforward?

505
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,235
She's so dim-witted,
it's the only way she'd understand.

506
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,028
-Please take a photo of us.
-All right.

507
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,369
One, two, three.

508
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,415
This is the photo the three of us took.

509
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,793
But this one came to us from Eun-seol.

510
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:32,007
Eun-seol got into a traffic accident
on her way home.

511
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:39,139
I think that's why Eun-seol
cursed us and sent this photo.

512
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,892
Crying will not make me feel bad for you.

513
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,645
If it came by phone,

514
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,648
the person who has her phone
must have sent it.

515
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,650
It's Eun-seol's phone.

516
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,194
She must have sent it.

517
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:53,946
It wasn't Eun-seol.

518
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,451
Eun-seol isn't the one who cursed you.

519
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,136
You have Eun-seol's phone, right?

520
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,054
What?

521
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,516
You picked up the phone
that Eun-seol lost that day.

522
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,102
You have it. Give it to me.

523
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,660
It was you?

524
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,538
You're the one who did it?

525
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,999
How could you do that?

526
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,335
Do you know how scared we were?

527
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,088
I did it to scare you guys.

528
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,132
I hated you guys.

529
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,550
Who are you to do that?

530
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:01,388
I saw you with Eun-seol
on the day that she died.

531
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,519
Orange, apple, lemon.

532
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:26,955
Lee Eun-seol!

533
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,459
This is pretty.

534
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,045
Lee Eun-seol is dim-witted.

535
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,714
What if she comes back with drinks?

536
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,591
I bet she will.

537
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,427
I'm too weak-hearted
to tell her I don't like her.

538
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:44,682
Let's put up this photo
of the three of us on our profiles

539
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,350
so she'll get the idea.

540
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:47,935
Okay.

541
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,854
-Let's go.
-Okay.

542
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,056
Lee Eun-seol died on the way home.

543
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,602
Why is that our fault?
It was a traffic accident!

544
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:15,814
She used her bus fare
to buy drinks for you.

545
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,357
And she died while she walking home.

546
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,487
And I couldn't stand watching
how you acted after that.

547
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,032
Lee Ju-yeon.
You were in first place again.

548
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,243
Kim Ga-yeong. You got a boyfriend.

549
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,330
Ha Yeon-jin, you're going to a clinic,
so you can grow taller.

550
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,082
I wanted to give you a lesson,
because you were doing so well.

551
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:38,086
Since Eun-seol's ghost appeared,
your grades have dropped.

552
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,922
You broke up.

553
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,132
And you're getting shorter.

554
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,720
You must feel bad
because you did something wrong.

555
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:53,852
What are you doing? Stop that at once.

556
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,938
Stop it.

557
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,272
Let me go!

558
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,691
-Stop it!
-Hey!

559
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,287
This isn't what Eun-seol wanted.

560
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,876
Shut it.
They're just trying to survive this.

561
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,295
The dead should not interfere with it.

562
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,978
Did you check everything?

563
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,314
They were making a fuss
saying it wasn't their fault.

564
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,899
It was very intense.

565
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,735
-Excuse me.
-Enough.

566
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:48,699
I found out what I wanted to know.
I don't need to know how you knew.

567
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,909
I know because I can see everything.

568
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,787
Eun-seol is so sad.

569
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,083
I think I should let her friends know.

570
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:09,219
Did we really do something so terrible

571
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,097
that we deserve to be cursed?

572
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,309
She said Eun-seol died because of us.

573
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,353
She hates us.

574
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,481
What should we do now?

575
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:26,528
We can't explain ourselves
to someone who is dead.

576
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:39,333
I'm really beside you right now.

577
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,044
I'll listen to what you have to say.

578
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,339
-It's Eun-seol.
-That lady took her phone.

579
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,966
Then, this must be...

580
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,426
It's Eun-seol.

581
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,721
Let's just think that it is.

582
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,811
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

583
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:01,938
I'm sorry, too.

584
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,817
I thought you were a nuisance.

585
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,156
I was so mean to you.

586
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,744
I'm sorry.

587
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,040
I'm really sorry.

588
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:30,467
I wish you would smile
and say it's okay, like you used to.

589
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,639
Apple, orange, lemon.

590
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,528
Apple.

591
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,032
Orange.

592
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:41,872
Lemon.

593
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,835
My friends. It's okay.

594
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:49,880
Eun-seol.

595
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:53,967
I'm sorry.

596
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,387
I'm sorry.

597
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,066
What do you think she's looking at?

598
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,693
She's just spacing out.

599
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,779
Is that what you think?

600
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,828
I don't think I can take my eyes off her
looking at the unknown.

601
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:12,671
Let's go.

602
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,882
-What about her?
-She'll go away by herself.

603
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:21,179
Are you going to keep
your promise to let her stay?

604
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:48,248
Does that mean I can keep working here?

605
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,046
Yes.

606
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,925
"I don't have the time to manage
people on the cleaning crew."

607
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:01,428
That's what he said.

608
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:04,764
Do you think I could go
and thank him in person?

609
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:10,353
"Make sure the unpleasant sun
does not appear on my floor."

610
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,855
That's what he also said.

611
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,481
He doesn't want you to go there.

612
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:18,111
Why are you disappointed?
He'll come down here anyway.

613
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,073
That's right.

614
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:29,539
What will happen to the girls?

615
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:33,251
Will that girl be punished
for manipulating the photo?

616
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,003
He's going to let it pass.

617
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,715
I thought he was mad about the fountain.

618
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:42,052
He's very happy because of the fountain.

619
00:53:56,775 --> 00:54:01,237
People come here because there's a rumor
that the fountain grants wishes.

620
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,366
Look, a lot of coins have piled up.

621
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,744
Shall I throw one in, too?

622
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,336
Do you want to make a wish?
What is your wish?

623
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,382
I want toys and new sneakers.

624
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,424
Okay.

625
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:27,097
I'll give you this, so go and say your
wish loudly in front of your mom.

626
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:32,602
Your wish will come true
on the second floor.

627
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,939
Mom, I have a wish.

628
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,442
Most wishes are related to consumption.

629
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,154
I don't care if it's a ghost or goddess
as long as sales go up.

630
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,865
Make promotions saying
that it grants wishes.

631
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,583
I'm going to let the photo incident pass.

632
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:56,584
Why?

633
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,755
Your past got talked about
because of that.

634
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:05,176
If I respond, it will get more attention.
If I let it pass, it will be forgotten.

635
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,262
Can you forget it?

636
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:14,060
Are you still alone because you think
that she died because of you?

637
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,439
Are you still feeling guilty?

638
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:19,899
Jung-won.

639
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,610
I know what you'll say.

640
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,989
I've heard it over a thousand times.

641
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,868
The best excuse for the living.

642
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,747
"The living must go on living."

643
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,000
Yes, the living must go on living.

644
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,502
I know that.
You don't have to keep saying it.

645
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:45,050
I'm scared my existence might look
like I'm saying it wasn't my fault.

646
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,595
That's how you see me right now.

647
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,972
I'm just worried about you.

648
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,974
I know. Don't worry.

649
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,769
I can say this for sure.

650
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,438
Never did I once...

651
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,232
think that it was my fault.

652
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:17,916
...holds the spirit
of a young woman who died unfairly.

653
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,375
Don't you feel sorry?

654
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,711
Are you still feeling guilty?

655
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,883
Did you really not see
the kidnappers' faces when you were here?

656
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,450
Cha Hui-ju.

657
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:55,662
Are you okay?

658
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,230
What happened?

659
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,358
Are you okay?

660
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,360
Jung-won.

661
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:30,738
I'm sorry.

662
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,118
Joo Jung-won.

663
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:52,218
I have been wronged
because you died like that.

664
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,304
Cha Hui-ju.

665
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,771
This incident had nothing to do
with that case.

666
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,358
But there's someone around
Mr. Joo that is bothering me.

667
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,153
It's a woman.

668
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:13,281
Hey, newbie. You're Ms. Tae, right?

669
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:14,949
How old are you?

670
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,870
-New girl, tell us about yourself.
-I don't want to.

671
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,750
Gosh.

672
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,920
Excuse me, ma'am.

673
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:32,258
Isn't today the anniversary
of your father-in-law's death?

674
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:37,222
That's right. I totally forgot.

675
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,098
I should get going.

676
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,268
How did you know, Ms. Tae?

677
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:43,895
I just...

678
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,691
I thought I heard you mention it before.

679
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:53,321
Thank you. I should hurry.

680
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,078
I think something strange is haunting him.

681
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,622
Should I do an exorcism?

682
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,250
-That woman...
-Woman?

683
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,669
That young lady.

684
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,921
I think she's the one from before.

685
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:13,383
-Who?
-The one who ruined the wedding.

686
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:16,344
Really?

687
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,362
"Tae Gong-sil."

688
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,616
I will remember you.

689
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,086
Ms. Tae Gong-sil.

690
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,678
Will you be done soon?

691
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,930
Yes, we're almost done.

692
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:02,890
Let's go home together.

693
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:04,642
What?

694
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:08,396
We live in the same place.
Let's go together. I'll wait outside.

695
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,023
-Oh, my gosh.
-Goodness.

696
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,858
Are you two dating?

697
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:15,194
-Do you live together?
-Do you live together already?

698
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:18,114
-When did you get married?
-My gosh.

699
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,742
You must be so happy.

700
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,744
-Oh, my.
-I'm so jealous.

701
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:25,705
Do they already live together?

702
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,123
-Wow.
-I can't believe it.

703
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,958
Isn't it too soon?

704
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,960
My goodness.

705
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,212
You must be so happy.

706
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:47,101
-"Let's go together"?
-Gosh.

707
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,647
All right, let's go.

708
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,023
Let's go.

709
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,881
Do you see something again?

710
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:18,925
What?

711
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,094
Do you see something
on my expensive fountain?

712
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,264
No, I don't see anything.

713
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,517
Stay out of my sight.

714
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:30,687
-Excuse me.
-Why are you talking to me?

715
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:33,314
I'm really sorry.

716
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,568
I didn't know you had a hurtful past.

717
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:44,242
If I did, I wouldn't have told you
that I saw Cha Hui-ju next to you.

718
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,618
"Hurtful past"?

719
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:49,497
I must have just made you
feel guilty again about the past.

720
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,040
"Guilty"?

721
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:58,756
She probably wanted to tell you
to forget everything and go on living.

722
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,217
It's not your fault.

723
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,233
Can you summon that thing you see?

724
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:19,986
Why?

725
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,947
If you can, summon it.
I have something to say.

726
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,408
What?

727
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:29,245
You

728
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:31,414
evil

729
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:32,957
bitch.

730
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,929
