00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,236
JOO JUNG-WON
TAE GONG-SIL

2
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,028
CONFIRMATION

3
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,910
Get up. The car will be here.

4
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,127
I slept so well since I was with you.

5
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,881
You drooled here. You have to buy this.

6
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,717
I can wipe it off.

7
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,347
I slept so well.

8
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,308
I would really like to sleep some more.

9
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,148
You said you have plans.
Sleep more if you like.

10
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,026
Oh, no. That's right.

11
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,361
Woo.

12
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,781
Miss.

13
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,241
Here it is.

14
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,202
Mr. Joo.

15
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:04,833
This is a copy of the document.
He said we should each take one.

16
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,130
And he gave us this too.

17
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,923
He said we should take one each.

18
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,511
They're giving them out
as gifts to customers.

19
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:20,056
-Let's take one each.
-Why should I take one?

20
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,350
I don't want anything as a pair with you.

21
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,520
It's really cool.

22
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,147
Put it away.

23
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,774
Okay.

24
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,486
Why are you standing here?

25
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,031
Aren't you going to give me a ride?

26
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,658
I'm too tired today.

27
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,035
I almost got shot because of you.

28
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,540
I am sorry.

29
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,335
It's dangerous to get too involved
in the world you see.

30
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,712
I shouldn't go any further.

31
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:55,592
I should draw a line
between the two of us.

32
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,012
Do you mean I should get lost?

33
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,890
Let's just stick to what we need
from each other.

34
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,271
From now on, here to here
is the "Tae Gong-sil Zone."

35
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,149
If you need the shelter, don't talk to me.
Just touch me.

36
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:15,028
And only talk to me
when you see Cha Hui-ju.

37
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,951
I really liked talking
to you about things.

38
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,287
I don't like it. Keep your distance.

39
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,002
I'll let you use
the "Tae Gong-sil Zone" any time.

40
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,421
But don't try anything else.

41
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,216
My arm has no eyes, ears, or a mouth.

42
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,094
So, do not expect me
to look, listen, or talk to you.

43
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:45,558
I talked to you because
you are not scared of ghosts.

44
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,395
Yes, I'm not scared of ghosts.

45
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,521
Tae Gong-sil.

46
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,024
You're the one I'm scared of.

47
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,915
Isn't Ms. Tae coming with us?

48
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,000
She has plans. Let's go.

49
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:12,627
Okay.

50
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,433
He almost got shot because of me.
No wonder he thinks I'm dangerous.

51
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:30,728
Tae Gong-sil.

52
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,525
I-ryeong. Hi.

53
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,736
-Did you come to watch the musical?
-Yes.

54
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,321
You, too?

55
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,533
I just saw something interesting.

56
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,160
I see.

57
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,705
Bye.

58
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,171
You know, I thought you would pretend
you didn't see me.

59
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,091
I am so glad that you said hello.

60
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,969
Bye, Little Sun.

61
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,555
Sure. Good luck, Big Sun.

62
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,649
It looks like Big Sun
has no idea what's going on.

63
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:22,447
I'm watching people who get close
to Mr. Joo for my client.

64
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,741
Tae Gong-sil is one of them.

65
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,494
So, you got close to her
to investigate her?

66
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,913
I'm doing it to keep Mr. Joo safe.

67
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,249
Don't interfere with this.

68
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,208
I won't.

69
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,753
You're watching the musical
with Gong-sil, right?

70
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,546
Good luck with your work.

71
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,306
She thinks this is a date.

72
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,808
I'm so sorry, Big Sun.

73
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:52,643
Woo!

74
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,315
Are you mad I'm late?

75
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,692
It just started. Shall we go inside?

76
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,111
Let's not watch this.

77
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,489
-Why?
-I heard it's no good.

78
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,449
I heard it's good.

79
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,992
I heard it's not.

80
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,454
I don't want to see people
act out things that aren't real.

81
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,707
Let's do something else.

82
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,795
To be honest,
I don't like being in the dark.

83
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,713
What shall we do?

84
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:25,510
Let's do what you want.
I won't ask anything and come with you.

85
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,687
You signed it. Did you check the contents?

86
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,524
Yes. Tae Gong-sil read it for me.

87
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,235
Did you tell her
about your reading problem?

88
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,404
Yes.

89
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,700
I won't get dragged around
by Tae Gong-sil anymore.

90
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,787
I almost got shot and gave her a warning.

91
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,124
You must have been startled.
Do you think that pill will be enough?

92
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,375
It's enough.

93
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,173
Tae Gong-sil has a copy too,

94
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,092
so call her right away
if anything is wrong.

95
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,468
I'll call her tomorrow.

96
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:12,348
You said she's on a date.
I can't call her right now.

97
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:17,019
The musical is the one we're going to have
at our autumn festival.

98
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,604
I heard it's really good.

99
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,733
She won't be able to watch it.

100
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,278
She'll probably run out
because something appeared,

101
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,698
or if not, she'll probably run
after something she feels bad for.

102
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,577
No.

103
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,163
If something happened,
she would have called you.

104
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,833
She hasn't called,
so the date must be going well.

105
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,008
I can't believe it.

106
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:51,387
You're taking pills because of the shock,
but she's on a date.

107
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:58,853
I guess she can't cancel a date
just because of you.

108
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,397
Get some rest.

109
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,403
Are you sick?

110
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,656
I must be getting old.
I caught a cold in summer.

111
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,743
I'll call my doctor.
Go see him right away.

112
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,537
You cannot get sick, Mr. Kim.

113
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,916
I know I can't get sick
until I can find my replacement.

114
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,752
That's bitter.

115
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,015
I took a pill. I have to sleep.

116
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,191
I can't sleep
even after taking that bitter pill.

117
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,031
But she seems to be having a sweet time.

118
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,542
I came here because
you didn't have anywhere in mind.

119
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,459
Is it okay?

120
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,336
This is the Han River.

121
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,174
I haven't been here
since I almost got dragged into the water.

122
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,467
I'm so scared.

123
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,554
Where? Did you almost fall into the water?

124
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,471
Yes.

125
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,432
Let's not get close to the water.

126
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,938
Shall we go to the fountain show
over there?

127
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:24,855
Sure.

128
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,697
My gosh!

129
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,076
Aren't you going?

130
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,370
Let's go that way, Woo.

131
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,163
The bridge is over there.

132
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,667
That's the bicycle rental place.
Do you want to ride a bike?

133
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,877
Yes. Let's go this way.

134
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,720
-Isn't it cool?
-Yes.

135
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,774
Can we go faster, Woo?

136
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,860
Let's go faster.

137
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,203
It was fun to ride a bike.
I haven't ridden in a while.

138
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,457
-Shall we do it again?
-I said no! Stop it!

139
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,586
We won't if you don't want to.

140
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:34,216
That's not what I meant.
I don't like the heat.

141
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,468
I'm so hot.

142
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,596
-Would you like a drink?
-Yes.

143
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,351
There's a store over there.
Could you get something for me?

144
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,268
Wait here.

145
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,819
Will running once do it?

146
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,780
DANGER, SAFETY FIRST

147
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,993
Excuse me. Over here.

148
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,412
Excuse me. Hello.

149
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,665
I'm sorry, but please help me out.

150
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,916
Please hold this.

151
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,961
You should stand over there.
And you should stand here.

152
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,588
Over here. Okay.

153
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,256
Please help me out.

154
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,801
What's all this?

155
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,389
Yes, that's good. Okay, ready.

156
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:24,892
Is there someone there?

157
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,060
Start!

158
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,738
You did it!

159
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,991
Excuse me.

160
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,285
You should go now.

161
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:46,831
Bye!

162
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,256
Gosh. I am so sorry.

163
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,426
-I'm sorry.
-Are you okay?

164
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,430
Thank you. I am so sorry.

165
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,182
She must be the crazy woman
they all talk about.

166
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,810
You should be careful, too.
It could happen to you.

167
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,148
Woo.

168
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,693
-Why didn't you wait there?
-I felt bad.

169
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,530
Shall we drink this at the fountain?

170
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:22,908
Let's go.

171
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,411
I really hate water ghosts.

172
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,955
Please don't come out.

173
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,923
The water ghosts were really scary.

174
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,512
I hope they didn't follow me.

175
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,983
Yes, I'm not scared of ghosts.

176
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,359
Tae Gong-sil.

177
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,820
You're the one I'm scared of.

178
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,295
It must be scary to be pestered by ghosts
because of me.

179
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,963
MR. JOO

180
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,635
Hello? Mr. Joo.

181
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,556
I was scared a ghost followed me,
so I was thinking of calling you--

182
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,474
Whatever.

183
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,392
I called for a reason.

184
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,772
We're going to ask to hold the musical
you watched at our autumn event.

185
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,774
Report to me what it was like.

186
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,776
I didn't watch it.

187
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,611
You didn't?

188
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,697
Yes, we just went to Han River for a walk.

189
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,407
Really?

190
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,702
But a running ghost kept following me.

191
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,705
It was so hard pretending to be normal.

192
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,958
I knew it.

193
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,294
And then we went to watch
the fountain show.

194
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,340
Ghosts kept coming in and out
of the fountain.

195
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,801
I was so scared, seeing that.

196
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:08,681
So I was going to call you
in case a ghost followed me.

197
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,184
But you called me right on time.

198
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,436
Thank you.

199
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,021
I didn't call you so you can be grateful.

200
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,108
And I told you not to talk to me
about those things.

201
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,402
If you didn't watch
the musical, never mind.

202
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,529
Get lost. I mean, I'm hanging up.

203
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,578
Tae Gong-sil will need
some bitter pills, too.

204
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,873
I'm sleepy.

205
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,335
Just talking to my shelter
makes me feel so much better.

206
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:48,053
There's a Tae Gong-sil Zone.
I can't touch other places.

207
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,015
It's too small, right?

208
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,938
Rock, paper, scissors.

209
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,982
Rock, paper, scissors.

210
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,318
Mom, are you going to be late again?

211
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,654
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Seung-jun is sick.

212
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,990
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Okay.

213
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,788
Seung-jun, tell me what's wrong with you.

214
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,582
Aren't you going to eat?

215
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,795
I'll go get your favorite bread.

216
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,425
Rock, paper, scissors.

217
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,846
Rock, paper, scissors.

218
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,685
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

219
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,191
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

220
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,655
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

221
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,032
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

222
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,660
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

223
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,496
Gong-sil!

224
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,373
Seung-mo?

225
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,589
Something is wrong with Seung-jun?

226
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,550
Seung-jun.

227
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,720
Are you sick?

228
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,182
-I'll go get my mom.
-Okay.

229
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,645
Why are you so cold?

230
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:23,357
Do you have an upset stomach?
I'll go get some medicine, okay?

231
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,451
Your mom isn't coming
even if you're sick, right?

232
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,912
You're really going
to become friends with us.

233
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,542
I'm sure there was
some digestive medicine here.

234
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,253
Seung-jun.

235
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,422
Seung-jun.

236
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,507
My dear Seung-jun.

237
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,426
It's must be Seung-jun's mom.

238
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,302
My baby.

239
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,805
Are you sick, my baby?

240
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,474
Oh, my baby. I am so sorry.

241
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,269
I'm sorry I didn't come earlier.

242
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,604
Let's go to the hospital.

243
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,606
Okay.

244
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,152
It's okay now.

245
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,695
It's okay.

246
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,913
He's no good.

247
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,291
His mom hugged him.

248
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,418
We can't be friends with him.

249
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,794
It must be you guys.

250
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,464
You're the ones
who pestered Seung-jun, right?

251
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,631
-Hide!
-Hide!

252
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,432
Where did they go?
I'm sure they came here.

253
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,186
Where are you?

254
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,022
Are you going to keep
pestering Seung-jun in here?

255
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:46,940
Come on out.

256
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,539
Are you hiding in there?

257
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,001
Oh, gosh.

258
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,718
Mr. Joo, I found this.

259
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,888
What is this?

260
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,225
There are strange kids inside this thing.

261
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,726
But...

262
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,901
I'm not scared of this.

263
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,361
Then you should go.

264
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,946
But Mr. Joo, this...

265
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,865
There's no talking allowed
in the Tae Gong-sil Zone.

266
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,367
Take it and get lost.

267
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,381
Tae Gong-sil.

268
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,091
What are you doing?

269
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,885
Why are you leaving it here?

270
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:01,014
It seems dangerous,
so I thought I'd keep it here.

271
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,477
Why would you keep
something dangerous here?

272
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,813
Do you want me to be in danger?

273
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,524
You're not scared of such things.

274
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,861
There are three child ghosts
hiding in there.

275
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,531
Tae Gong-sil, I almost got shot yesterday.

276
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:18,740
At such times,

277
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:24,913
you could have brought vitamins
and asked if I slept well last night.

278
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:29,001
Or at least ask if I took anything
to calm myself.

279
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,670
You shouldn't bring me three ghosts.

280
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,547
Can I do that?

281
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,633
Is it okay for me to worry about you?

282
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:45,184
I thought you wouldn't like it,
so I wasn't able to say anything.

283
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,811
Can I do that?

284
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,147
Well, try it.

285
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,108
I have ears, so I will listen.

286
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,028
Mr. Joo.

287
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,280
Did you sleep well?

288
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,950
You must have been so shocked yesterday.

289
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:10,667
I always have this with me because they
help when I see scary ghosts.

290
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,044
You should have one.

291
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,797
Are they FDA approved?

292
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,591
It's sold at drug stores.

293
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,885
I will share them with you in the future.

294
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,805
Are you saying you want
to keep being shocked together?

295
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,599
I always got startled by myself,

296
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:29,770
but now that I have you,
I won't need to take this as much.

297
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:35,192
You're the safest person in Kingdom,
so please keep the dangerous doll.

298
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,110
It's dangerous?

299
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,240
The security team should keep
scary and dangerous things.

300
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,785
Shouldn't you take it to Sweet Kang?

301
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,330
I can't do that to Woo.

302
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,583
He really hates such things.
What if he gets shocked?

303
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,966
If he gets shocked,
you should give him this.

304
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,343
Take that and get lost.

305
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,816
He designated a Tae Gong-sil Zone?

306
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,151
Yes. But it's too small.

307
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,279
It will get bigger.

308
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,951
-This is what you asked for.
-Right.

309
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,917
So, this is what Mr. Joo is looking for.

310
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,045
It looks like it'd be ten billion won.

311
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,010
It's Cha Hui-ju.

312
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,930
She was even prettier when she was alive.

313
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,725
She's pretty.

314
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,896
Gosh. She left it here.

315
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:04,156
Why do I feel bitter
when Tae Gong-sil is happy?

316
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,374
It's bitter.

317
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,293
It's so bitter.

318
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,671
I have someone else
I should be looking for.

319
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,965
So, stop being a nuisance and come out.

320
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,303
You're bad kids
who torment good kids, right?

321
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,388
Tell me why you're being so bad.

322
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,807
Aren't you going to talk?

323
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,644
Get out of there!

324
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:38,440
Come out! Come on!

325
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:39,983
Gong-sil.

326
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,993
What are you doing with the doll?

327
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,538
Were you just...

328
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,792
talking to the doll?

329
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,837
I know everything.
I've seen you several times.

330
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,130
You saw it?

331
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,803
Sometimes, you talk to the trash bin.

332
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,013
And you talk to paintings on the wall.

333
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,848
Did you see all that?

334
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,309
I had a friend who was like you.

335
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,313
He used to name his pencil and talk to it.

336
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,149
Do you know where he is now?

337
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,985
A mental hospital?

338
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,488
He's at NASA.

339
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,990
He said he would make a spaceship
to go to Andromeda.

340
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,617
And now he's really making one.

341
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,829
You must have a good imagination, too.

342
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,791
Yes. Imagination.

343
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,670
Have some coffee.

344
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,802
Coffee, you are so black.

345
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:49,803
Hi.

346
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,974
Have a good talk and add some milk
if you don't like it black.

347
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,725
Thank you.

348
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,318
Andromeda...

349
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:10,657
A man from the hospital
said he met an alien from there.

350
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,078
Don't tell Woo about how you went
to the hospital or the police station.

351
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,415
I can't tell him about ghosts
because it would torment him.

352
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,085
Shouldn't I tell him about other things?

353
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:27,174
I was so grateful that someone likes me.

354
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,718
But it's so hard to keep things from him.

355
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:35,348
You said you're feeling better.
Do those things still appear?

356
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,976
They don't just stop appearing...

357
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:38,935
What?

358
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,817
Why did you do that, Han-ju?

359
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,737
Why does Gong-sil always act like that?

360
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,617
I told you not to scare Gong-sil
like a ghost, didn't I?

361
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,243
Am I a ghost?

362
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,791
-Is my nose bleeding?
-No.

363
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,044
I think my nose is bleeding.

364
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,047
My nose is bleeding because she hit me.

365
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,299
This is an assault. I can't believe this.

366
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,634
It's not bleeding.

367
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:13,845
But...

368
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,557
-Your nose is running. Blow it.
-I don't think that's it.

369
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,982
I can't let her get taken
to the police again for assault.

370
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,528
My gosh. I was really surprised.

371
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,367
Why aren't you going to her?

372
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,370
Do you also think it's natural

373
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:42,666
for me to go ask if she is okay?

374
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,794
You always went to her
when she's like that.

375
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,714
I always went. And I went too much.

376
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,635
I won't go anymore.

377
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,935
The summer event...

378
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,145
I'm sorry.

379
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,648
The reaction was very positive...

380
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,777
You should go see the doctor again.

381
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,780
No, there are documents
and articles I must show...

382
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,868
Are you okay, Mr. Kim?

383
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:23,540
Mr. Joo, could you have
someone replace me for just one day?

384
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:24,958
Who?

385
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,215
I have experience as a secretary.

386
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:37,554
But next to my boss was a man
with an ax stuck in his head.

387
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,432
That's why I quit the job.

388
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,349
An ax?

389
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,935
Did you work for a thug?

390
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:48,315
No, it was small
but it was a finance company.

391
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,774
What's the name of the company?

392
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,277
-Sera Finance.
-"Sera Finance"?

393
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,865
The president of that company
was arrested for murder last year.

394
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,325
Really?

395
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,870
You see ghosts, but you don't
watch the news or read newspapers?

396
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,123
Everything in the news should be true.

397
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:09,085
But I noticed that
not everything in the news is true.

398
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:14,799
An artist was in the news for getting
a world-famous award this year.

399
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:18,762
But he had actually stolen
his dead friend's work.

400
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,767
-Let me tell you who he is.
-Don't tell me.

401
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,644
Keep it to yourself.

402
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:34,277
I just want to think Korea
has an artist who is acknowledged.

403
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,655
I don't care if it's true.
Read the newspaper you're holding.

404
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,784
Sure. I don't know if everything
will be true, though.

405
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:46,539
"Kingdom's event for children
is getting a lot of good feedback."

406
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,624
That's true.

407
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,459
Good. Keep going.

408
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,796
Tae Gong-sil is acting
in Mr. Kim's place right now.

409
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,422
Really?

410
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,550
She is going to become Mr. Joo's weakness.

411
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,471
If his aunt is against it,
wouldn't his father be, too?

412
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,641
Mr. Joo probably hates
his father the most.

413
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,853
I don't know if it's true,

414
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:14,192
but there was a rumor the girl died
because of Mr. Joo's father.

415
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,447
They said my brother
didn't pay the ransom,

416
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,991
and that's why Hui-ju died.

417
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,369
It is all a lie.

418
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,204
Of course.

419
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:30,500
Why would a father not pay the ransom
when his son might die?

420
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,086
I hope Jung-won thinks so, too.

421
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,381
I think my brother is traveling
all around the world

422
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:40,635
to find the jewel that was lost
and to make things right with his son.

423
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,055
But I can't be sure if it's true.

424
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,855
I think he might have seen the kidnapper.

425
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,149
But he says he didn't.

426
00:28:55,692 --> 00:29:00,321
I can't tell if he's telling
the truth or not.

427
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,708
Mr. Kim is sick and took the day off.

428
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,918
Tae Gong-sil has taken his place.

429
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,628
I'm sure they're in a relationship.

430
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:20,508
Don't talk about things
you are not sure about.

431
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:21,801
Mr. Kang.

432
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:27,724
Stop being so hung up on her. She's more
mysterious than a mystery circle.

433
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,726
I feel so bad for you.

434
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:38,651
Right, listen carefully to the meeting
and make notes on it.

435
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,572
Shall I read you the meeting notes again?

436
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,490
No.

437
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,408
I have it all in here.

438
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,618
I have to concentrate hard

439
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,578
to keep it in here
so I don't have to read anything.

440
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,831
I've been following you all day.
You are actually quite busy.

441
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:56,628
You aren't really aware
that I am the president of this place.

442
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,547
You're always looking
through your telescope in your room,

443
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,049
so I thought you weren't busy.

444
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:04,761
What do you look at all the time
when you're so busy?

445
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,679
You only ever talk about your world.

446
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,182
Are you finally curious
about my world now?

447
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,392
You should take a look.

448
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,747
Please begin.

449
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:44,592
This is the business plan
for the Shanghai Kingdom.

450
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:50,682
Let me start with Korean malls
that have entered the China market.

451
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:55,812
A total of seven companies
are operating in the Shanghai area.

452
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,817
They are mostly centered
in commercial areas.

453
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,944
As you can see,

454
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:09,993
two companies have been successful
and are considering expansion.

455
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,277
The other companies
are in the early stages, just like us.

456
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,987
And they are currently...

457
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,131
-Please carry on.
-Yes, sir.

458
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:12,972
The other companies
are researching the market.

459
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,643
The market share in the Shanghai area

460
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:20,939
is currently being shared evenly
among the Korean companies.

461
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,984
Thank you for what you did earlier.

462
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,655
We said we'd give each other what we need.

463
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,033
My head hurts from memorizing so much.

464
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,744
I will organize the notes from today

465
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,497
and give them to Mr. Kim
when he gets back.

466
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,046
Can I take a look through that?

467
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:54,889
What were you looking at?

468
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,437
My competitor is over there.

469
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,234
And you can see the cars
coming into Kingdom.

470
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,863
And also the cars going out.

471
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,282
You can see everything.

472
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,749
Kingdom is the world
I belong to and reign over.

473
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,712
I'm busy enough
trying to make this place more perfect.

474
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,219
Why? Did you see something?

475
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:35,888
No.

476
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,934
I was reminded of the ghost
I saw in the meeting.

477
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,478
I almost screamed.

478
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,315
Thanks to you,
I was able to get through the meeting.

479
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,358
Tae Gong-sil.

480
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,652
You were probably able to get through it.

481
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,155
The shelter was there for the radar.

482
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:57,326
There's something you ignore, just like
how you ignore that I'm the president.

483
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,704
I don't ignore that.

484
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,080
Yes, you do.

485
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:06,335
You totally ignore the fact
that your shelter is a man.

486
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,129
That's...

487
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,214
If you acknowledged I was a man,

488
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,550
you couldn't ask me
to sleep with you holding your hand.

489
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,179
You probably think of me as concrete.

490
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,391
In any case, the meeting
did not end quietly at all.

491
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,478
Since you turned up,
my world has become noisy.

492
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,147
I hung on to you so I could live.

493
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,358
I didn't realize your world
had been disrupted.

494
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:33,946
I decided to endure that
when I decided to install you.

495
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,240
I'll take care of it.

496
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,828
It's time for the Kid's Mall event.

497
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,121
Let's go.

498
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:43,873
Okay.

499
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,335
Think of him as concrete.

500
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,088
Mr. Joo.

501
00:34:55,551 --> 00:35:00,056
I'd feel sorry to say that
you're just concrete to me.

502
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,062
You're the best kind of marble there is.

503
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,523
Are you saying that as a compliment?

504
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,317
I mean that I think highly of you.

505
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,735
Marble.

506
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,161
This isn't just any marble.

507
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,497
It's the most expensive marble
in the world.

508
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,292
You could never have it
if you were just some normal woman.

509
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:32,004
I let you have it
because of your special radar.

510
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,591
Just this much.

511
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,100
He keeps emphasizing that. Just that much.

512
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,324
You must be working. Surveillance duty.

513
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,244
I'm not on surveillance duty.
I'm being jealous.

514
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,081
I'm watching the woman I like
walking with another man.

515
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:08,958
That's jealousy.

516
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,336
-You lied that you like her.
-I never said it's still a lie.

517
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,298
Why do you keep appearing before me?

518
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,425
Are you watching me? Or...

519
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,385
Or what?

520
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,637
Do you think I like you?

521
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,265
What's wrong with you? I'm a top star.

522
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,685
You're just a salaryman.

523
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,438
Shouldn't it be hard
to see a top celebrity?

524
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,108
I see you so often
that you feel like a neighbor.

525
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,235
Which neighborhood is that?

526
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,528
If I'm just a neighbor,

527
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,865
are all the people
who live there celebrities?

528
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,577
Top star Tae I-ryeong.

529
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:49,498
You look better on TV,
so don't come out of there.

530
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,545
Are you saying I'm not pretty in person?

531
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,339
Maybe?

532
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,804
He's confusing me.

533
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,182
Is he saying I'm pretty or not?

534
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:10,394
Is he watching Tae Gong-sil
or being jealous?

535
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,940
My contact lenses move around
if I think too much.

536
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,908
You must like kids.

537
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,245
Do you know how much money
each kid brings in?

538
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,747
The mom, dad, grandmother, grandfather,

539
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,791
two more from the other side,
that makes at least six.

540
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,669
And if they have single
aunts and uncles too,

541
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,921
they can bring in so much money.

542
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,509
There's a kid in my building
who only has a mom to buy him things,

543
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,719
so he plays with dolls
that were thrown away.

544
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:49,100
If you feel bad,
open your wallet and buy something.

545
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,601
I'm going to buy stuff somewhere else.

546
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,852
Darn...

547
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,105
Did you just swear at me?

548
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,607
What will I do with that doll?

549
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:07,994
Mom.

550
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,456
I can't find my bag.

551
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,459
I think I lost it.

552
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,587
Go find it.

553
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,218
SPECIAL CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER

554
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,273
Who are you?

555
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,692
Hi. Let's be friends.

556
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,235
Take us with you.

557
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,072
You're just like us.

558
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,417
That's the doll I brought.

559
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,128
Doll?

560
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:49,136
The doll that the boy
in the yellow shirt is holding.

561
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,763
Isn't it the doll that I brought here?

562
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,599
That's dangerous.

563
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,779
What should I do?
The kids will torment him.

564
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,911
Walk faster.

565
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,872
You'll have to be scolded
for losing your bag.

566
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,468
His mother is a member,
so I found the address.

567
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,886
Is that doll so important?

568
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,848
Yes, I have to find it.

569
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,101
I'll be off soon.
Let's go together when I'm done.

570
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:40,104
I'm in a hurry.
I have to get it right away.

571
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:43,399
Aren't you working with Mr. Joo
in Mr. Kim's place today?

572
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,193
Can you just go off to find the doll?

573
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,155
Mr. Joo understands what I do.
I should go now.

574
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,911
He understands her leaving to get a doll
during working hours?

575
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:57,872
Really?

576
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:02,209
The boy in our building got sick
because of that doll.

577
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,336
Are you sure it was because of the doll?

578
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,337
I'm sure.

579
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,590
And the kid who took it
will get sick, too.

580
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:20,644
This is Kingdom.
Did your son take a doll from here?

581
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,730
A doll? Why?

582
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,690
I'm not blaming you,

583
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,651
but I would like to go
and get the doll back.

584
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,403
He didn't bring anything like that.

585
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:33,324
He lost his bag at Kingdom.
Go and find that for me.

586
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:34,575
Yes--

587
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,576
Hold on.

588
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:40,080
Why did she lie that he didn't
take it when he did?

589
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,459
Do you think the kid hid the doll?

590
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,376
Stop it.

591
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,754
If it's not going to affect Kingdom,
stop here.

592
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,049
I got the address. Can't you come with me?

593
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,300
Tae Gong-sil.

594
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,386
I said I will only allow you this much.

595
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,514
Don't think of dragging me there.

596
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,073
Do you think my mom is angry?

597
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,075
What should I do?

598
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,960
Do you know what you did wrong?

599
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,922
I am so sorry, Mom.

600
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,484
Mom.

601
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,455
Did you find the doll?

602
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,792
-No.
-You said he lost his bag, right?

603
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,546
This was found today. Could this be his?

604
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,258
It is his.

605
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,342
PYEON CHANG-MIN

606
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,052
So his name is Chang-min.

607
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:21,807
Let's go together after work.
Can I get you a prettier doll?

608
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:25,769
See you later.

609
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,397
Thank you.

610
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,948
She will let me in if I say
I found the bag, right?

611
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,409
SKETCHBOOK

612
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,725
There's a good artist
I'm thinking of buying some pieces from.

613
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,018
Would you like to buy some, too?

614
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,854
Who is it?

615
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:13,817
Baek Hwang-sul.
He received the Turner Award this year.

616
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:20,199
An artist was in the news for getting
a world-famous award this year.

617
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,785
But he had actually stolen
his dead friend's work.

618
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,537
Could that be him?

619
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,498
The price will rise further.

620
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,125
I should buy some now, right?

621
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,294
If I didn't know,

622
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,631
I wouldn't have hesitated
to make an investment.

623
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,675
What? You're not going to?

624
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,261
Let me think about it.

625
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,139
SPECIAL CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER

626
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,981
I'm going to buy some pieces
even if his name is Baek Hwang-sul.

627
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,942
I'm just here to check
since I feel uneasy.

628
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,570
Tae Gong-sil!

629
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,952
Where did she go?

630
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,667
PYEON CHANG-MIN

631
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,669
What is this? Is this the kid's bag?

632
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,329
Come out, okay?

633
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:34,291
I know you're not bad kids.
Come on out. Come on.

634
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,087
What about Chang-min?

635
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,048
Where is Chang-min?

636
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,676
Chang-min!

637
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,886
Let's go to a doctor.

638
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,016
Are you okay? Can you walk?

639
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:36,812
Who are you?

640
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,358
I have to take him to a doctor.

641
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,319
It's none of your business.
Leave him and go.

642
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,489
Did you do this to him?

643
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,825
I was punishing him
because he did something wrong.

644
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,744
Are you saying
that this was his punishment?

645
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,455
-Are you really his mother?
-Get out of my house!

646
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,251
-He has to see a doctor.
-Stay out of this!

647
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,595
He has to see a doctor!

648
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,221
Come here.

649
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:15,892
Where are you going?

650
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,051
Mr. Joo.

651
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,053
We have to take him to a doctor.

652
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:52,804
I know.

653
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,613
The kids were all alone in the end.

654
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,241
It was this doll,

655
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,576
not the adults who stayed by them.

656
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,165
Mom.

657
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,377
I am sorry.

658
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,296
-No one helped them.
-Mom.

659
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,258
And no one hugged them.

660
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,894
No one cried for them.

661
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:36,908
So, kids with similar stories
came into this doll and became friends.

662
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:40,704
I'm sorry.

663
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,749
I'm sorry no one hugged you.

664
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,732
I didn't know Dooly was pink.

665
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,734
That's Gong-sil, Dooly's girlfriend.

666
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,195
"Gong-sil"? Really?

667
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,865
They're dinosaurs,
and Dooly's girlfriend is Gong-sil.

668
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,659
-Didn't you know?
-No.

669
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,662
You're Gong-sil.

670
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,291
You two look good together.

671
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,595
Where did Gong-sil go?

672
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,515
Since Gong-sil isn't here,

673
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,976
you should stay here instead.

674
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,812
Dooly will stay in the security office.

675
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:04,514
We burned the doll.
Will the kid be okay now?

676
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,058
I'm getting him checked from head to toe.

677
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,646
Did you bring in Pyeon Chang-min?

678
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,814
Yes.

679
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,441
You were reported
for breaking and entering,

680
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,151
violence, and kidnapping.

681
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,736
You should come with us.

682
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:18,904
What?

683
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:33,084
Mr. Kim, I heard you're sick.
Are you okay?

684
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,294
Yes.

685
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,173
Is Jung-won inside?
I came to take him to dinner.

686
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,842
I don't think he will be able to do that.

687
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,344
Why?

688
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,055
Did something happen to him?

689
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,098
Well...

690
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,313
Mr. Joo.

691
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,066
Are you there, Mr. Joo?

692
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:01,071
Mr. Joo. You're okay, right?

693
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,405
Be quiet.

694
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:08,912
I'm thinking about where I am
and where I will go because of you.

695
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:16,002
Don't worry too much, Mr. Joo.

696
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:20,715
I've been here a few times.
There's really nothing to it.

697
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,719
The beef soup they order for you
is delicious.

698
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,138
If you're hungry, shall I ask for some?

699
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,515
Ms. Tae.

700
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,726
I am not hungry.

701
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,312
Please be quiet.

702
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:49,703
What is it now?

703
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:56,001
A child counselor has reported you
for child abuse.

704
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,961
A child counselor? Who?

705
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,088
That would be me.

706
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:04,426
And Kingdom's lawyer is asserting

707
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:09,806
that the violence that happened
to save the child

708
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:10,765
was not intentional.

709
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,267
Kingdom's lawyer?

710
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:14,561
That would be me.

711
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:19,983
Your son will be treated
while you are being investigated

712
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:23,403
and will be sent
to a child protection agency.

713
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,156
Why can't I do what I want with my child?

714
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,783
And sometimes you can hit kids
when you are raising them.

715
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,285
My gosh.

716
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,079
There was a mosquito.

717
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:35,665
-That hurts.
-So you do feel pain.

718
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,254
-Come with me.
-What did I do wrong?

719
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:46,051
Kingdom will cover
all of the kid's hospital expenses.

720
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,846
Please look closely for evidence of abuse.

721
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:56,019
Mr. Joo is at a police station? Why?

722
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,687
I don't know.

723
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,398
Why would someone like Mr. Joo be there?

724
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,778
I thought it might be good
for you to know.

725
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,905
Would you like to come with me?

726
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,574
Hey, wait for me!

727
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:17,040
I will stay and take care of things
with the other lawyers.

728
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:18,583
Let's go.

729
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:23,296
What about me?
Aren't you taking me with you?

730
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,098
I couldn't tell you
because you seemed angry.

731
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,559
But there is a lady next to me.

732
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,270
I'm scared.

733
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:58,665
Mr. Joo!

734
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,091
SEOUL YEONGDEUNGPO POLICE STATION

735
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,594
I have to stay. You should go ahead.

736
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,401
I'm sorry, Mr. Joo.

737
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,319
I am really sorry.

738
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,448
Don't apologize.
You did a good job, Tae Gong-sil.

739
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,203
Thank you for saying that.

740
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,417
You're hurt.

741
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,920
I think I got scratched
while fighting that lady.

742
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,926
That child's mother
will have to be punished.

743
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:56,598
She hurt her own child
and someone else's child, too.

744
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,142
Ms. Tae. Let's go see a doctor.

745
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,582
Did he come here because of Tae Gong-sil?

746
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,484
Cha Hui-ju.

747
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,823
He trusts me now
and gave me an important job.

748
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,046
I try not to go to hospitals.

749
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:13,716
I used to just endure it
even if I'm really sick.

750
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,635
It's so nice to come here with you.

751
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:20,431
I had a nice time looking around
a holding cell, thanks to you.

752
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,600
But why do I feel so hot?

753
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,685
Really?

754
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,605
Would you like to use this?

755
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,025
It's the fan we got as a pair.

756
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,904
That's right, you said you
don't want anything as a pair.

757
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:43,955
Isn't it cool?

758
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,553
Mr. Joo, this isn't the Tae Gong-sil Zone.

759
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,016
My body's already ruined. Just use it.

760
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,185
I didn't stop because of a ghost.

761
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,732
I felt dizzy from hitting my head before.

762
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,737
You don't have to hold me.

763
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:21,534
You'll feel worse if you see a ghost
so hold me to prevent that.

764
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,786
You did a good job today. It's a reward.

765
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,456
This is expensive.

766
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:33,129
I thought you would never let me
touch you again.

767
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:37,300
But now that you're telling me
to use you freely,

768
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,219
it feels strange.

769
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:51,189
When the crazy sun
first appeared in my life,

770
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:53,107
I tried to kick it out.

771
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:58,237
But when I came to my senses,
I was being dragged into your life.

772
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,323
I tried my best not to go any further.

773
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,284
But I realized something
in that cell today.

774
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,038
I've already...

775
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,336
come too far.

776
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,674
You said you want to be by my side.

777
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,968
Congratulations. You've succeeded.

778
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,305
Mr. Kim should be here now.

779
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,349
Let's go.

780
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:29,394
Mr. Joo.

781
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:32,230
I...

782
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:37,985
Something strange
is being detected on my radar.

783
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:40,988
So use me.

784
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:16,107
You don't feel anything
even if I touch you, right?

785
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,528
Right?

786
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:26,534
Do you really think
I'm a shelter made of marble?

787
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,424
Of course not.

788
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,939
