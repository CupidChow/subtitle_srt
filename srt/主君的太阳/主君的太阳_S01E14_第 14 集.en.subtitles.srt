1
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,144
Are you Tae Gong-sil?

2
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,690
How did you come here
when you can't even remember me?

3
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,233
I don't know who you are.

4
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,154
But I think you were
someone very important.

5
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,572
Who are you to me?

6
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,617
You must have expected
something surprising.

7
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,746
Just believe what you see.

8
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,540
I'm just a woman
who doesn't have any money.

9
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,003
You're a rich man. What do you think I am?

10
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,382
You said that I was special to you.

11
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,260
How am I special to you?

12
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,263
I got a ride in your car by coincidence,

13
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,390
and you were the president of Kingdom.

14
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,436
I had to have you,
so I got a part-time job and pursued you.

15
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,315
I said I was lonely and sad
and you started to look at me.

16
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,652
You helped me when I was in need
and got me a job.

17
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,529
And you held an event
at your hotel for me.

18
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,407
That's how you became special to me.

19
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,911
I kept someone like you by my side?

20
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,662
That can't be right.

21
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,540
Do you own this building?

22
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:26,544
You told me you'd get me
a new place and a new car.

23
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,629
I did?

24
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,132
That's a very unpleasant joke.

25
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,635
So you're saying that you're Candy,

26
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,470
and I'm a foolish rich guy
who gave you anything?

27
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:43,144
Are you saying I did all that with
a woman who isn't even that attractive?

28
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,814
I used some special skills I had.

29
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,110
You don't seem to have
any skills that would seduce me.

30
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,152
But it worked.

31
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,490
It wasn't easy, so I wasn't planning
on leaving so easily.

32
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,326
But you got hurt while being with me.

33
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,079
I felt bad, so I was going to leave you.

34
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:07,335
I'll think of the money you gave me
as compensation for leaving you.

35
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,920
I'll use it well.

36
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:11,881
Thank you for everything.

37
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,217
Bye.

38
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,096
Is that really everything?

39
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,809
Okay, if that was what it was,
let me hold you again.

40
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,894
Then I'll know what you were to me.

41
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,022
Don't touch me. I said it's over.

42
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,025
In these kinds of relationships,
I'm the one who ends things.

43
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,695
What? I let you stay by my side?

44
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,532
I'll know how much you're worth
when I see my bank account.

45
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,995
But that's not all of it for me.

46
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,085
A lot of things changed
during the time I can't remember.

47
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,380
I'm startled by it.
But I don't seem to hate it.

48
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:56,217
Is it because of you?

49
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,222
I feel like I lost something very big.

50
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,518
Do you have it?

51
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,609
You did leave something here.
Wait. I'll get it for you.

52
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,440
To keep my beer here.

53
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,652
Look, now there is some space.

54
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,380
Take this. This is all you left here.

55
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,970
You asked me to be a woman
who leaves easily.

56
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,931
That's what I'm going to do.
So, please leave.

57
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,977
Did I really drink something like this
while I was with you?

58
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,399
Okay, if it was just this, then it's okay.

59
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,027
Thank you for leaving me.

60
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,154
And returning this.

61
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,907
Don't ever come back here.

62
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,422
Tae Gong-sil.

63
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,925
They said her name is Tae Gong-sil.

64
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,844
You know her, right?

65
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,470
Do you...

66
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,180
remember her?

67
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,517
I have no memory.

68
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,978
And Mr. Kim is away and can't be reached.

69
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:16,858
So, you should report what you remember,
since you always watch me.

70
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,487
Did I flaunt my relationship with her?

71
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,032
The rumor spread everywhere.

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,911
You could hear it from anyone.
So, I'll report what I heard to you.

73
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,915
You went very far, Mr. Joo.

74
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,084
Keep going.

75
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,463
I think you thought of it
lightly at first.

76
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,424
We agreed only to exchange
meaningless physical contact.

77
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,887
Some kind of special skill...

78
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,890
I fell for that.

79
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,476
You usually don't care what others think.

80
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,979
You took her around everywhere,
just like how you usually act.

81
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,273
Oh, my.

82
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,443
-You're kidding, right?
-No, it's true.

83
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,112
And?

84
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,824
There was talk about you marrying
the daughter of Sejin Group's president.

85
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,577
But you said you couldn't break up.

86
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,828
I'm not letting her go.

87
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,914
I can't stop seeing her.

88
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll keep my distance by getting married,
but I'll keep seeing her.

89
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,214
I think Bang-sil is quite something, too.

90
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,926
You got a porcelain jar
as an engagement gift.

91
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:29,472
She told your aunt that she will break it
right to her face.

92
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,558
The family of Jung-won's fiancÃ©e
sent it as an engagement gift.

93
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,813
You're very arrogant and impudent.

94
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,607
Didn't I tell you
that you should break it?

95
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,528
Are you saying you'll break
Jung-won's engagement?

96
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,155
It's dangerous.

97
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,616
I'm going to break it.

98
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,034
Be careful.

99
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:56,749
She said that and then you broke the jar
and the engagement.

100
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,961
That was very dangerous.

101
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:04,423
You were really into her.
Are you going to start over?

102
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,512
Your belly fat.

103
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,890
I got it. You can go now.

104
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,936
Sure.

105
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,357
I just told you objectively
what everyone else knows.

106
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,610
The subjective interpretation
is up to you.

107
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,084
I was being so thoughtless.

108
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,588
I'm glad I forgot about it.

109
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,014
I wish I could drink
in a situation like this.

110
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,643
Do you know what I feel the most
upset about because of the ghosts?

111
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,063
It's the fact that I can't drink
at all because I'm scared.

112
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,567
You said Mr. Joo is your shelter.

113
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:09,155
You could have done anything
if you were with him.

114
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,492
Will you really be okay without him?

115
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,496
I do miss it.

116
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:21,375
I wish we'd drunk some beer together
while I was still with him.

117
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,754
I'm worried.

118
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,343
You stayed hidden in this building
before you met Mr. Joo.

119
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,597
I'm worried that
you might become like that again.

120
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:41,270
I saw the scariest spirit
in the world at the hospital.

121
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,942
I was never more scared in my life.

122
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:51,113
I am never going to drag him
into my world again.

123
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,660
If I think about that, other ghosts
aren't scary at all.

124
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,246
It's bearable.

125
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,750
Mr. Joo erased his memory.

126
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,503
I'm upset to see that you have to

127
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,882
hide your feelings
and endure the pain all by yourself.

128
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,593
I told you I'm keeping my feelings
sealed up.

129
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,639
So it's right that I should
be the one to endure all that.

130
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,063
I was stabbed here.

131
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,150
Did it come through here?

132
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,528
Something is missing.

133
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,656
I think I gave it to her
but she said that I abandoned her.

134
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,163
Don't ever go back to get it.

135
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,839
Don't worry about me.

136
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,383
I won't live in hiding again.

137
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,469
I'm thinking of going back to school.

138
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,471
-Really?
-Yes.

139
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:02,810
I think I could even ask the ghosts
for answers while taking exams.

140
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,688
Then you could be top of your class.

141
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,608
I used to be top of my class.

142
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,485
-Are you boasting?
-Yes.

143
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,197
I used to win all kinds of awards.

144
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,867
I was going to become a great person.

145
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,038
Then don't give up,
and become a great person.

146
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,123
Then I will be your bodyguard.

147
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:31,297
I'm pretty good at protecting people.

148
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,968
That's right, they said you could
have worked at the Blue House.

149
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:43,434
I should at least become the president
to ask you to guard me.

150
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:49,523
I'll do it for you
even if you only become class president.

151
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,567
Let's drink to that.

152
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,278
Let's become great people.

153
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,038
Hey, your coffee is here.

154
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,831
Why are you trying to take my soda?

155
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,923
There's a kid who always comes
to get coffee from me.

156
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:19,345
Is it too scary if I tell you
that there's a ghost here?

157
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,224
No.

158
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,352
I have become pretty brave about them.

159
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,147
I need to overcome that
to be able to protect you.

160
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,736
You should drink, too.

161
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,572
Cheers.

162
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,177
RE-ADMISSION FORM

163
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,055
Studying was easy for Big Sun.

164
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,433
I will be able to do it well again.

165
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,202
If you care for him,
please lend me your body.

166
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,498
She's not coming back to ask me again.

167
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:53,856
It seems like he woke up
and is doing very well.

168
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,651
Yes, thank you for helping me.

169
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,612
His memory

170
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,823
is sealed in that thing.

171
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,326
But you didn't return it to him.

172
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,914
Then you will be nothing to him.

173
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,294
That's why I'm not returning it to him.

174
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,048
That's up to you.

175
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,176
I hope you didn't forget about our deal.

176
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,721
What do I have to do?

177
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:31,393
First, you should give up
living a normal life.

178
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,449
You should gather

179
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,662
the ghosts of women who died single.

180
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,084
I am a matchmaker for ghost weddings.

181
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:02,424
There's been a shortage
of female ghosts lately.

182
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,558
Go to places where spirits are gathered.

183
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,811
And bring back
some good bridal candidates.

184
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,567
Hello?

185
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,756
Oh, my!

186
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,844
Oh, my gosh.

187
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,534
Is there anyone who isn't married here?

188
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,621
Would someone like to come with me?

189
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,919
Are there any women who aren't married?

190
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,174
Oh, my gosh.

191
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,096
Are you single, by any chance?

192
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,850
All right.

193
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:35,893
Well, then...

194
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,065
Excuse me! Miss!

195
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:47,196
If you're not married,
do you want to get married?

196
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,496
You will work for me
as long as I need you.

197
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:59,583
You should gather ghosts for me.

198
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:04,922
That's what you agreed
to do to save that man.

199
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,635
Please come with me.

200
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,641
I don't want to film a movie in the US.

201
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:19,395
It's a great opportunity.
The director is Peter Jason.

202
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:23,482
I can't act. Can't the director see that?

203
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,777
It's a role that requires
only beauty and a good figure.

204
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,905
You could become famous
worldwide, like a Bond Girl.

205
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,532
Say you'll do it.

206
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,617
Are you trying to get me away
from Kingdom?

207
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,119
Well done!

208
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:40,082
-Let's go for just a year.
-I'll think about it.

209
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,628
That's Tae Gong-sil.

210
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,464
Who is that witch?

211
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,010
I think she's introducing her
to the people with them.

212
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,597
We found a bride for your son.

213
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,768
She found the bride.

214
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,437
Yes.

215
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,233
Then Seung-hoon
won't be lonely in the afterlife, right?

216
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,119
He won't.

217
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,496
Kang Woo.

218
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,125
I might go to the US to film a movie.

219
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,376
Really?

220
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,881
I saw your movie before.
You're really bad at acting.

221
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,676
But I have a good figure
and a beautiful face.

222
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,474
So, you've seen my movie?
You said you didn't even know about it.

223
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,851
-It was on TV.
-I see.

224
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:46,774
It was a sad movie
and I'm no good at crying, that's all.

225
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,567
I hate crying.

226
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,535
Yes, crying doesn't become you at all.

227
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,164
I didn't feel good when I saw you cry.

228
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,459
Is that your review?
It's like a bad Internet comment.

229
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,668
Anyway,

230
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,838
you should practice your acting skills
and become a global star.

231
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,673
You'll be able to do it.

232
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,805
Would you like to be the bodyguard
of a global star?

233
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,556
It's such an honor.

234
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,060
But I'm sorry, Tae I-ryeong.

235
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:28,023
If Tae Gong-sil goes to someone else,
you'll become just like me.

236
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:28,982
You're so ill-mannered.

237
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,487
A woman who has eyes
like this and wore black

238
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,365
was introducing Tae Gong-sil
to a rich-looking family.

239
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,576
They were asking her
to take good care of their son.

240
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,663
-A woman in black?
-Yes.

241
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,458
I'm not lying. Ask Tae Gong-sil.

242
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,294
Ask her what she was doing with that lady.

243
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,682
Could it be her?

244
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,519
EUNHA DORMITORY

245
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,774
Are you going somewhere? It's raining.

246
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,985
Yes, I have to be somewhere.

247
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,695
Are you studying hard?

248
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:23,328
Are you hanging out
with that strange woman, Ms. Go?

249
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,626
You left to go see her
when you were at the hospital, right?

250
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,712
Have you been visiting her since then?

251
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,549
Yes, she asked me for a favor.

252
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:40,262
Don't worry. She knows a lot about me.

253
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,140
I should go.

254
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,946
You should give up living a normal life.

255
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,199
Forever.

256
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:17,216
If you continue to do well,
my Kingdom will never fail.

257
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,051
Let's talk about Shanghai.

258
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,719
Give me a detailed plan.

259
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,807
Get me the information on the interior
designer working on the Shanghai mall.

260
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,937
I haven't received
the information from Mr. Kim yet.

261
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,358
I'll find it before the afternoon meeting.

262
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,575
Mr. Kim would have recorded it.

263
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,459
The contract for the Shanghai site.

264
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,294
The seller--

265
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,214
Kingdom is the buyer.

266
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,929
I will be recording this
because Mr. Kim has a cold.

267
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,057
I will do it in the tone you like.

268
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,938
I will read you the market research
for Shanghai Kingdom.

269
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,899
You make a lot of money, Mr. Joo.

270
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,484
You must be happy.

271
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,330
SPECIAL CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER

272
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,930
She was here.

273
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,102
But I don't remember anything.

274
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,815
It's so empty.

275
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,919
I'm getting married next week.

276
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,759
But the woman I was engaged to
before appears in my dreams.

277
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:32,350
She says she will be with you forever,
as she promised.

278
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,567
I didn't really mean it. Gosh.

279
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,288
I will try to persuade her.

280
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,210
He is still alive. So, you should...

281
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,299
Why don't I introduce someone
who is dead and younger for you?

282
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,551
He's getting married.

283
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,304
Following him around won't do anything.

284
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,514
Well...

285
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,394
My nephew will be here.

286
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,938
Would you mind eating with him?

287
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,065
Did you tell him that I am with you?

288
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:24,903
When I ask him to eat with me,
he'll come regardless of who is with me.

289
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,531
I told you that I like you, Hanna.

290
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,538
It's Tae Gong-sil.

291
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,832
She's with Ms. Go again.

292
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,333
Is she your friend?

293
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,502
Oh, no.

294
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:45,382
That woman is known as a ghost
wedding planner. She's a psychic.

295
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,717
A psychic?

296
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,768
Excuse me.

297
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:05,777
You asked to send that girl
to run an errand for you before.

298
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,490
Does she have anything to do with ghosts?

299
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,331
Is that why she said
she will call the dead girl?

300
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,840
Are you saying that I should believe that?

301
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:31,469
Her hair is my length
but she has bangs, right?

302
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,929
That's right.

303
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,766
Wow.

304
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,935
-She's right here.
-Wow.

305
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,856
-She lives in Seongsu-dong.
-Seongsu-dong.

306
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,527
Is her ghost really with me?

307
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,487
She's really lonely and sad.

308
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:53,491
If she comes to you at night,
please comfort her.

309
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,747
Is Candy lonely and sad again?

310
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,460
You just broke up with me.
Why are you lonely so soon?

311
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,507
I'm busy. Don't touch me.

312
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,555
Did you meet with this woman, too?

313
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,516
Yes, he was in a similar situation as you.

314
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,773
Did she really leave you
with no strings attached?

315
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:29,152
I'm scared that she might cling to me.

316
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:33,406
If you've been through it,
tell me how you got rid of her.

317
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,577
Should I tell you this?

318
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,415
I almost died.

319
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,254
She only left me after
a huge screwdriver was stabbed in my back.

320
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,301
If you don't want to die,
you should get lost right away.

321
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,804
Get lost. Got it.

322
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,432
Wait, this is a misunderstanding.
Don't mind what he says.

323
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,520
I mind, and it feels bad.

324
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,564
Even if you're lonely and sad,
stop doing this for a while at least.

325
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,150
I gave you a lot of money.

326
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,416
I asked her to come.
You don't mind, do you?

327
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:45,395
I have no memory,
but did we meet somewhere before?

328
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,691
We live in the same apartment complex.
Maybe you saw me before.

329
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,610
But when I saw you,

330
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,864
it felt like we knew each other.

331
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,871
This is the most recent photo
of Hanna that I have.

332
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,541
This is Hanna?

333
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,878
It's not the face that I remember.

334
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,546
Hanna had surgery done.

335
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,924
-Plastic surgery?
-Yes.

336
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,428
Hanna said that she hated her face.

337
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,641
Did you say she's in Korea now?

338
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,603
I should find her and meet her.

339
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,442
I'll find out her Korean phone number.

340
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,818
That's fine.

341
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,905
I think I know where she is.

342
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:55,298
Hanna, you must have heard the rumor
that Jung-won is haunted by a ghost.

343
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,594
That's why I asked Ms. Go for a favor.

344
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,012
What did you ask?

345
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,556
I asked her to bring someone.

346
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,142
There's a girl who can see ghosts.

347
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,269
-See what?
-Ghosts.

348
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,105
This should be interesting.

349
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,448
Where are we going now?

350
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:27,122
It's so scary to go
to cemeteries every night.

351
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,957
And I have to sleep, too.

352
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,209
I haven't slept much.

353
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,337
Look at my face.
I should get some sleep during the day.

354
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,509
This time, it is someone very special.

355
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:43,972
You always say that.

356
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,561
Here she comes.

357
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,358
Jung-won, that girl can see ghosts.

358
00:28:56,443 --> 00:29:00,864
Tae Gong-sil, you used to work
at Kingdom, right?

359
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,908
I didn't know you had such a talent.

360
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,707
I know you can't remember, Jung-won.

361
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,877
She clung to you saying
she'll see the ghost that haunts you.

362
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:19,132
Ms. Tae. Do you see a ghost?

363
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,384
Is there one here?

364
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,016
Yes, I see one.

365
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,271
I saw it all along.
It's right next to you, Mr. Joo.

366
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,614
Cha Hui-ju.

367
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,367
Please don't appear
in front of me anymore.

368
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,829
I don't want to see you anymore.

369
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,042
No. Let's talk things out here.

370
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,960
Who is the one
that caused you to lose your life?

371
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:57,962
I'll tell him.

372
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,809
If you're not going to say anything,
don't appear before me again.

373
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,069
-Stop it.
-I'm working. Don't touch me.

374
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,031
Hey, Jung-won!

375
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,956
Now I know why he is so special to her.

376
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:42,340
-You see ghosts?
-Yes, I see ghosts.

377
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,511
Candy was cute. But this is scary, right?

378
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,056
You set up an office for me.
The Special Customer Center.

379
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,517
All the special customers were ghosts.

380
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,562
I got you a job,
so that you can see ghosts?

381
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,523
I was once a ten billion won radar
that was going to find your money.

382
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,900
But I was paid for each case later on.

383
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,112
That's the money that you sent to me.

384
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:09,409
Everything I did during the time I don't
remember was because of ghosts?

385
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,120
I wish you didn't find out.
It's scary, right?

386
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,748
I'm not scared of such things.
I'm scared of people I can see.

387
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,042
Yes, that's right. That is correct.

388
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,045
But you were with me and you got hurt.

389
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,132
The pay was good.

390
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:29,053
And the job suited me well,
so I was going to try to stay.

391
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:34,058
But you got hurt because of me,
so I felt bad and quit my job.

392
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,770
So, you quit and got a new job
with that Ms. Go?

393
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,105
It's none of your business.

394
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,525
I don't want to see you anymore.

395
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,444
Just ignore me.

396
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,865
Don't touch me. I don't like it.

397
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,861
A ten billion won radar.

398
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,844
EUNHA DORMITORY

399
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,996
Hello, my ten billion won radar.

400
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,127
Your shelter is here. Hide.

401
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,153
You can't ask him to be your shelter.

402
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,686
If she wasn't lying,

403
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,563
are you...

404
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,816
really still here as a ghost?

405
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,401
Are you...

406
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,820
by my side?

407
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,996
If you are here with me,
then I will apologize.

408
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,416
I am sorry.

409
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,376
My dear sister.

410
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:09,273
So, I was trying to find the kidnapper?

411
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,485
Yes, Cha Hui-ju had a twin sister.

412
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,571
And you thought
she might be the accomplice.

413
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,910
You said I used Tae Gong-sil
to find out about Hui-ju.

414
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,412
The necklace that went missing
was worth ten billion won.

415
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,249
Is that why she's
my ten billion won radar?

416
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,961
Yes, that's right.
Do you remember anything?

417
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,757
I don't remember.
But I guess she was worth it, though.

418
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,469
I don't hate Hui-ju anymore.
And I can read now.

419
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,263
Your memory is gone.

420
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,349
Do you really not need her anymore?

421
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,603
I hope you'll become someone

422
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,399
that Gong-sil doesn't need, either.

423
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,992
Why do I feel so bitter?

424
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,917
If the guy who stabbed me gets caught,
he's dead meat.

425
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,516
I heard she works at Kingdom.

426
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,895
Do you think it ends when someone dies?

427
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,274
He is watching you right now.

428
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,614
Excuse me.

429
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,993
The shopping mall is that way.

430
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:45,953
Okay.

431
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:31,958
Excuse me.

432
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,533
Let go of me!

433
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,997
I called the police. They'll be here soon.

434
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,291
Please let me meet her.

435
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:17,920
I feel like I'm going crazy
ever since she told me that.

436
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:18,963
Did you

437
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,091
come to hurt Tae Gong-sil?

438
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,886
Please just let me meet that woman!

439
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,099
She said the dead kid is watching me.

440
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,519
I can't do anything because of that.

441
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,773
I think that's what you have to live with.

442
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,826
Are you the one who stabbed me
with a screwdriver?

443
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,996
I didn't mean to stab you.

444
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:56,250
You tried to save her.
That's why you got stabbed.

445
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,544
I got stabbed instead?

446
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,379
Yes, that's right.

447
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,883
I was startled because
you suddenly jumped in front of her.

448
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,178
I really didn't mean to stab you.

449
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,640
What's going on?

450
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,101
You said I followed Tae Gong-sil there.

451
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,311
Does it mean...

452
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,022
I did it

453
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,316
to save her?

454
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,277
-No, it was--
-That's right.

455
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:33,245
You almost died
trying to save Tae Gong-sil.

456
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,927
This is driving me crazy.

457
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,016
She said this was the ghost office.

458
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:59,563
How crazy was I about that woman?

459
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:01,941
She said ghosts were here.

460
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,151
Do you all know anything?

461
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,952
Do I really not need her?

462
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,290
It's bitter.

463
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,252
It's so bitter.

464
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,429
Ghosts have tastes, too.

465
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,849
If they don't like their partner,

466
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:39,103
they come to harass me at night.

467
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,108
By the way,

468
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:49,071
do you know how I got
the ability to see ghosts?

469
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,575
You said you were unconscious
for three years.

470
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:57,538
If your spirit had
wandered for three years...

471
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,291
then you could see ghosts.

472
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,293
Wandered?

473
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:04,795
Where?

474
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,548
I don't know.

475
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:17,141
Tae Gong-sil was lost in a mountain?

476
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,643
We couldn't find her for ten days.

477
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:25,107
Then we found her,
but she was unconscious for three years.

478
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:26,942
Was she brain dead?

479
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,487
Then she wouldn't have woken up.

480
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,449
She was fine
but she just wouldn't wake up.

481
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,503
Here.

482
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,967
Are you sad because
you can't get coffee from Gong-sil?

483
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,764
I can't let her continue like that.

484
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,599
You should keep an eye on her.

485
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,604
Has she broken up with that guy?

486
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,027
Should I go meet Gong-sil now?

487
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,322
Will she recognize me?

488
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,798
-Gong-sil.
-Woo.

489
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,717
You look tired. Are you doing okay?

490
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,472
It's hard to become a great person.

491
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,725
I heard the killer was caught.

492
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,812
The police called
and said he was caught at Kingdom.

493
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,522
Really?

494
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:50,359
That's good. Whoever caught him did well.

495
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,695
Right? I'm so grateful.

496
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,282
Say my name just once
when you're really scared.

497
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,868
Who knows? I might just appear.

498
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,415
Thank you for saying that.

499
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,333
Good night.

500
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:31,900
Oh, my gosh.

501
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,873
Just say my name
when you're really scared.

502
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,637
My gosh.

503
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,932
Jung-won likes this wine.

504
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:50,562
Jung-won, I heard that you said
you'll bring your girlfriend to the party.

505
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:55,109
-I don't remember.
-You'll need a partner.

506
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,904
You should go with him. Is that okay?

507
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:02,616
-I would like that.
-Excuse me.

508
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,628
Your aunt told me not to tell you this.

509
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,965
But Ms. Tae came every day
while you were in the hospital.

510
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,259
She cried a lot.

511
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,888
You said my heart stopped
during the surgery, right?

512
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,058
Yes. You came back from the dead.

513
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,604
I came back from the dead?

514
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:37,109
You could probably have
a normal life with that woman.

515
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:43,615
But you almost died for Tae Gong-sil,
the woman who sees ghosts.

516
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,952
I don't remember.

517
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,302
Hanna says she can come with you.

518
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,053
Sure.

519
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,421
Mr. Kim, are you here?

520
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:43,717
Where is he?

521
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:46,720
MESSAGE
MR. KIM

522
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,555
MS. TAE, PLEASE COME
TO THE OFFICE RIGHT AWAY.

523
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,019
Should I wait for him?

524
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:57,898
Are you in there?

525
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,110
My gosh.

526
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,364
-What is this?
-Did you think I was a ghost?

527
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,033
What about Mr. Kim?

528
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,955
You won't answer my calls
and weren't at home, so I texted you.

529
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,123
I can text now.

530
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,252
Why did you call me?

531
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,797
I put some facts together.
I need to check them with you.

532
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,465
Come with me.

533
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:33,850
Sit down.

534
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,443
I thought things through.

535
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:49,074
I was possessed by
a woman who isn't even that attractive.

536
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:54,413
And I almost died
when I got stabbed trying to save you.

537
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,249
Right?

538
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,334
Yes, that's right.

539
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:03,213
I am curious about how I felt
at the last moment.

540
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,802
-You know, right?
-How would I know?

541
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,141
You were there while I was in surgery.

542
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,643
My heart stopped during the surgery.

543
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,145
I was dead.

544
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,231
Dead people become ghosts
and you can see ghosts.

545
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,402
You saw me, right?

546
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:40,417
I almost died because of you.
I probably came to see you.

547
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,713
Yes, you came to see me.

548
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,804
Most people become honest in their last
moments, because there's nothing to lose.

549
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,473
I must have been honest.

550
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,059
What did I tell you?

551
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,687
Are you avoiding me
because what I said scared you?

552
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:01,772
Yes.

553
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,776
-I heard something scary.
-Something scary?

554
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:11,073
Did I resent you
because I died because of you?

555
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,618
Did I try to take you with me
because I didn't want to go alone?

556
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,792
If I had said that,
I'd want to get my memory back,

557
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,794
because I can handle that.

558
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:33,512
But it looks like it was the worst case
that I can imagine.

559
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,561
Tae Gong-sil.

560
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:43,980
I love you.

561
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:12,342
If we went that far, shouldn't I remember

562
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,262
a good moment I had with you
when I'm looking at you?

563
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,139
Why can't I remember anything?

564
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,811
Your memory will never return.

565
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,021
It's been sealed up safely.

566
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,150
So, don't worry.

567
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:33,071
Can you really live without it?

568
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,033
I can.

569
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:43,874
Okay, I thought I lost something,
so I've been trying to find it.

570
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:48,003
I won't do that anymore.
I won't call you or linger around you.

571
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:49,838
That's what I want.

572
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:54,050
I will ignore you if I see you
and I will not touch you.

573
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,428
I'll do the same. I should go.

574
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,013
Go.

575
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,354
If you can't live without it, turn around.

576
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,149
Then I will try to find
my memory once more.

577
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,874
Shoot.

578
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,127
It's bitter.

579
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,151
Okay. It's all over now.

580
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:01,243
I need a detailed profile of Hanna Brown,
the one in charge of the exhibition.

581
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,995
I need it for the exhibition's security.

582
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:08,041
I'll bring you a pamphlet
from one of her exhibitions.

583
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,776
It's the same handwriting.

584
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,367
They look different.

585
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:44,870
But the handwriting is the same.

586
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,498
How can this be?

587
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,884
Mr. Kim. You're back.

588
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:03,054
Someone who seems to be
Cha Hui-ju's twin has appeared.

589
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,140
Is it Hanna Brown?

590
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,601
How did you know?

591
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,812
Cha Hui-ju and Hanna Brown

592
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,773
are my nieces.

593
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:19,696
That is why I have been around Mr. Joo...

594
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,282
until now.

595
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:39,674
Mr. Joo.

596
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:45,055
You must be going with me
because your aunt forced you to.

597
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,514
I don't care.

598
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,577
-Hey.
-Gosh.

599
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,919
That man is married now.

600
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,963
You should leave.

601
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,173
-You should kiss.
-Okay.

602
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,928
-All right.
-Congratulations.

603
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,096
Let's go inside.

604
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:30,266
You're just the past to him now.

605
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,187
-You can't be his future, like his bride.
-We'll be heading off now.

606
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,107
You're dead.

607
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:46,741
She's gone. Can I go home now?

608
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:18,565
He placed a new future next to him,
instead of finding his memory.

609
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:45,967
Mr. Joo.

610
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,791
Don't come to me anymore. Just go.

611
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,299
Three days is perfect.

612
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:27,258
I guess so.

613
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,888
-Hello.
-Hello.

614
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,515
Hello.

615
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,767
You look so beautiful today.

616
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,812
You're too kind. Have a drink.

617
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,820
I saw Ms. Tae in the lobby.

618
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,073
She was with Ms. Go.

619
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,242
It has nothing to do with me.

620
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,285
-Really?
-So?

621
00:56:55,662 --> 00:57:01,251
I heard that Ms. Tae made a deal
with Ms. Go for the rest of her life.

622
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:07,674
It looks like Ms. Tae
is now part of the afterlife.

623
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,853
I can't lend you my body.
I have to live, too.

624
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,025
What is the deal
you made with Tae Gong-sil?

625
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:30,113
You're interested.
You must want to find your memory.

626
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,116
No. I don't want to find my memory.

627
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,742
Tell me what the deal is.

628
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,162
Can I compensate with money?
How much will it cost?

629
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:43,543
But can I find my memory
if I want to find it?

630
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,005
Yes, you can. Shall I tell you how?

631
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:49,966
No, I don't want to know.

632
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,593
It's very easy.

633
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:56,890
Just remember what disappeared
the moment you woke up.

634
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:02,187
Never mind, we agreed
that we don't need it.

635
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,564
Dead, end, no future.

636
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:08,693
I said something I wouldn't have said
unless in that situation.

637
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,906
I don't want to have
to be responsible for it.

638
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,826
That woman has taken the words you said.

639
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,120
And she's taking the burden all alone.

640
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:22,916
I know, that's why I am bothered by her.

641
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,250
I understand.

642
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,836
She's pitiful.

643
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,838
Just live a happy life like that.

644
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:33,092
Tell me how much your deal is worth.

645
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:37,514
She gave up everything to me.

646
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,559
You should calculate
how much that is worth.

647
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,229
We can come to an agreement then.

648
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,399
Jung-won.

649
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,570
-Are you in pain?
-Yes.

650
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,450
I'm not just bothered.
I am actually in a lot of pain.

651
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:21,993
Are you okay?

652
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,667
I noticed it at first
and kept looking at it.

653
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,086
But I wanted to ignore it.

654
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,327
Are you not feeling well?

655
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:06,704
I must go find what I lost.

656
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:08,164
Mr. Joo.

657
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:14,587
Wasn't it me that you had been looking at?

658
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,589
It is the same.

659
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:19,550
But that's not the real one.

660
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,817
I ended it with him for good.

661
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,068
Look.

662
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:44,742
I'm going throw this away,
so don't come looking for me.

663
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:14,355
Did you really think
you can live without a shelter?

664
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,900
-Did you get your memory back?
-Yes.

665
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,194
I didn't want to, but I got it back.

666
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,946
Why did you come
if you didn't want to find it?

667
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,740
Do you think I wanted to?

668
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:28,578
I could have been happy in my world
without my memory or your world.

669
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,748
Yes, I was happy without you, too.

670
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,666
It was so much better without you.

671
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,753
I was feeling better. Why did you come?

672
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:40,298
Don't you lie.
You couldn't have been okay.

673
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:46,637
Tae Gong-sil,
you can never feel better without me.

674
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:50,266
You have to feel like
you'll die without me.

675
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,543
