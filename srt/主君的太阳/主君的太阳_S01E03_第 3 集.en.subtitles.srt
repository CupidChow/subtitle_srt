1
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,144
You

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,396
evil

3
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:22,939
bitch.

4
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,237
Did you just swear?

5
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,615
Yes, tell that to the ghost
that you're saying you can see.

6
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,288
You must resent her a lot
for leaving you all alone.

7
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:42,292
I guess you liked her so much
that you wanted to swear.

8
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,296
If I see her, I'll tell her

9
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,715
that you still like her a lot.

10
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,052
Don't try to glamorize it.
It's just as you heard. I swore.

11
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,346
-Evil bitch.
-I know.

12
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,727
People all say that
when they miss someone.

13
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,395
This is not right.

14
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,483
If you're going to tell her that,
get lost, Ms. Tae.

15
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,903
I'm just so happy that you believe me.

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,113
I don't believe you. Don't be happy.

17
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,741
I've been so lonely and scared until now.

18
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,328
Meeting you was like a ray of light.

19
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,916
I'm so happy there's a shelter
I can go to when I'm too scared.

20
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,211
That's not right, either.
Did you call me your shelter?

21
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,297
You can come knock.
But I'll never open the door.

22
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:30,924
Please.

23
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,301
No, I won't. Never.

24
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:37,138
You're the only one I can run to.
I am so scared.

25
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,015
Please open up.

26
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,379
This is a luxury brand.
What is this doing here?

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,215
Is there only one shoe?

28
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,430
I wonder if the lost and found
is still open.

29
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,912
That's my shoe.

30
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,791
My shoe.

31
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,961
-Did you...
-I heard it, too.

32
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,761
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

33
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,804
What happened?

34
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,267
I tripped on something up there.

35
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,569
What's going on?

36
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,906
Woo, she fell down the steps.

37
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,410
-Try to move it.
-Ouch, it hurts a bit.

38
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,996
There's nothing you could trip on.

39
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,666
But I'm sure there was something, Mr. Joo.

40
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,049
The floor is slippery.
There is too much wax.

41
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,176
Clean it again.

42
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,553
-Right now?
-Now.

43
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,014
Kang Woo, take Ms. Ahn
to the hospital right now.

44
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,349
Yes, Mr. Joo.

45
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,560
We won't be able to go home together.

46
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,855
I have to clean up.
Please take good care of her.

47
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,691
See you at home.

48
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,609
See you at home.

49
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,620
Kang Woo and I live--

50
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,664
Stop. I'm not curious.

51
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,256
Ms. Ahn says she has
some documents for Mr. Do.

52
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,091
I think I'll have to get them.

53
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,928
You should go. I'll go on my own.

54
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,888
-Will you be okay?
-Of course.

55
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,360
My gosh.

56
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,034
What? Have I never driven this car before?

57
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,081
I thought I'd be able to go home
with a guy, like a normal person.

58
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,796
It's a shoe.

59
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,593
It's so pretty.

60
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,221
I'd like to go on dates
wearing such shoes.

61
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,523
Is there only one shoe?

62
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,526
That was so scary.

63
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,215
SEARCH ROUTE

64
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,343
"Search."

65
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,012
HOME

66
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:10,930
"Home."

67
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,478
-Beginning route guidance.
-Okay.

68
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,277
I read it. Good job.

69
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,195
Good job.

70
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,602
-Mr. Joo.
-My gosh.

71
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,687
Please open the door.

72
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,356
-Please open the door.
-I won't.

73
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,775
-Get lost.
-Mr. Joo!

74
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,696
Mr. Joo!

75
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,652
What is it? What's all the fuss about?

76
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,193
That's Mr. Joo. What...

77
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,363
Oh, my gosh.

78
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,824
Zoom in.

79
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,375
Thank you.

80
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,965
Where's your shoe?

81
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,259
What's that one in your hand?

82
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,803
The owner of this shoe came after me.

83
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,807
I think the owner is dead.

84
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,275
I think she died
right after the collision.

85
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,867
She might have been driving drunk.

86
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,747
Look, she was so out of it
that she was only wearing one shoe.

87
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,796
-You need to pull down your skirt.
-What?

88
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,555
Down?

89
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:18,886
What are you doing?

90
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,472
Don't mind me.

91
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,517
Please stop. If not, I will stop you.

92
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,401
I know this face.

93
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,488
How could you push me like that?

94
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,698
You were acting suspiciously.

95
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,200
This is my car.

96
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,577
I need to buy something
but my manager isn't around.

97
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,915
I saw the sunroof was open,
so I came to get some money.

98
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,422
See that round container?
There's money in there. Money.

99
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,382
I was trying to get it out.

100
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,051
-Is that what you need?
-Yes.

101
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,984
-There's only 1,000 won.
-Really?

102
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,570
What do you need?

103
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,495
Two bottles of soju, one dried squid,
one dried filefish, right?

104
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,751
You grilled the squid.
That's very kind of you.

105
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,505
Why are you in the hospital
if you can drink two bottles of soju?

106
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,802
Yes, it's all fake.
It was the timing for me to collapse.

107
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,929
-Will you tell the reporters?
-No.

108
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,516
I know that you must be in a lot of pain.

109
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,602
Are you pitying me?

110
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,771
Don't pity me
because my wedding got canceled.

111
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,483
Weren't you doing this
to get pitied by people?

112
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,903
Give me your number.
I'll send you the money.

113
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:03,782
It's okay. I hope the soju
helps you more than the hospital.

114
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,080
I was trying to get
his number but he refused.

115
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,750
What a fool.

116
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,548
-Are you Choi Yun-hui's husband?
-Yes.

117
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,801
Is it my wife?

118
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,887
She passed away.

119
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,466
Yun-hui!

120
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,224
Honey.

121
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,043
Are you sure the dead woman is here?

122
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,046
Yes. Shall we go?

123
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,759
Are you really going to go like that?

124
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,720
I don't have my shoe.

125
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,639
There's some tissues left in here,
so it's pretty soft inside.

126
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,476
I'm not talking about comfort.
Aren't you embarrassed about it?

127
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,145
I'm okay.

128
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,649
I once went home wearing a box

129
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,985
when I ran away from a bathhouse.

130
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,989
This isn't embarrassing. Let's go.

131
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:12,536
If the shoe owner isn't here,
you'll be hospitalized here right away.

132
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,841
I really hate coming to emergency rooms.

133
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,392
Where's the owner of that shoe?

134
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,110
Over there.

135
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,682
HANKUK MEDICAL CENTER

136
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,936
Can you believe how scared I must be,
now that you saw for yourself?

137
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,814
Aren't you scared
that there are such things?

138
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,526
I'm not scared.
I can't see them. I don't care.

139
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,861
I don't use my imagination
on useless things.

140
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,032
She did this and chased me like this.

141
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:32,992
Stop it.

142
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,912
If I tell them to stop,
they appear in front of me like this.

143
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,955
Stop it.

144
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,958
Yes, you must be scared.

145
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,337
But when I hold you like this,
I don't see them.

146
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,675
Do you understand why
I keep clinging to you now?

147
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,971
Mr. Joo doesn't let just anyone
get close to him.

148
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,976
He calculates that person's
current and future value.

149
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,522
He only opens up if that person
meets his expectations.

150
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,608
It's the same with choosing
the woman to spend his life with.

151
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,319
He's just a little picky.

152
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:15,451
So, you're saying he's not avoiding women
because of Hui-ju, right?

153
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,580
It means he hasn't met a woman
who will help his business yet.

154
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,916
He'll choose someone who will benefit him.

155
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,588
But some people have a kind of value
that can't be calculated the normal way.

156
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,425
It's not the money
or because you're handsome.

157
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,510
It's because I see ghosts.

158
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,722
I'm not like Candy
who is trying to seduce you.

159
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,643
Are you a Christian?

160
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,858
Are you saying
that you have a sixth sense?

161
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,860
Yes. It's unexpected, right?

162
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:53,030
I thought you were being coy
but you were using your sixth sense.

163
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,824
So, if you keep chasing me because...

164
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,954
of those things,
why do those chase after you?

165
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,290
They come to ask me to do things.

166
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:08,170
They don't explain their situations
or ask politely like the living do.

167
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,803
They just appear and say what they want.

168
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,972
And they harass me
until I do what they ask me to.

169
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,519
What does the owner of that shoe want?

170
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,313
She wants me to give
this shoe to her husband.

171
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,358
She said she'd be watching.
And that she'll protect that person.

172
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,244
He must be the husband
of the shoe's owner.

173
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,914
I know him. He owns a store at Kingdom.

174
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:49,128
Really? She must have lost
her shoe on her way to meet him.

175
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,297
It must be very special.

176
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,735
She's dead. She's really dead.

177
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,364
This is a miracle.

178
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,242
She went and died on her own.

179
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,668
His smile was scarier than the ghost.

180
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:36,300
I was so scared that I wasn't able
to get my shoe when I ran.

181
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,178
She must have felt the same way.

182
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:45,350
I wonder what she saw
when she left this behind.

183
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,978
I don't use my imagination
on things that don't matter.

184
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,398
I think she must have seen
something very infuriating.

185
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,317
She's dead.

186
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,985
She's really dead.

187
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,447
This is a miracle.

188
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,991
She went and died on her own.

189
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,457
He won't be able to smile
if he knows his wife is watching him.

190
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,669
-Let's go.
-Good luck.

191
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,714
Go help her and make him pay.

192
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,549
Where are you going?

193
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,177
You have to come with me.

194
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:25,098
-Why should I?
-I can't go back without you.

195
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,852
I'm scared, and other ghosts
might cling to me.

196
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,607
-I need you.
-Oh, your special shelter.

197
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,776
You said you can't see them
when you touch me.

198
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,320
And you want to come to me
when you're scared.

199
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,158
But do they give you
any useful information?

200
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,037
Do they tell you which stocks will rise?
Or where you can find oil?

201
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,082
Or where all the treasure ships
are buried?

202
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,710
Or do they tell you next week's
winning lottery numbers?

203
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,340
Then I don't need you.

204
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:03,387
Your sixth sense that sees useless things
holds no value for me at all.

205
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:08,183
Let me give you some advice
about what I have heard and seen here.

206
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,061
Because you go around
doing stuff like that,

207
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,357
people see you as a crazy woman
who wears a tissue box on her foot.

208
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,320
Get a hold of yourself
and take care of how you look.

209
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,032
You know I'm not crazy.

210
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,120
-You saw it, so you believe me.
-No.

211
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,748
I will only see what I want
and believe what I want to.

212
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,793
I see you as a crazy woman
and I won't believe your words.

213
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,862
Stop it.

214
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,198
Do you know what the stock market
will be like tomorrow?

215
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,869
Can you even tell me one
of the winning lottery numbers?

216
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,954
You can't even do that.

217
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,582
Tell me such things
if you want to ask me a favor.

218
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,625
My gosh.

219
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,591
I only have 2,000 won.

220
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,137
VISITORS' ENTRANCE

221
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:29,848
Not again.

222
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,902
What? There were shoes in here.

223
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,794
It's quite sturdy.

224
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,798
It's soft. It should be okay.

225
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,720
What is this? It broke apart.

226
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,601
It broke apart.

227
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,354
The tissues keep coming out.

228
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,902
-Gong-sil.
-Oh, Woo.

229
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,696
Why are you here?

230
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,033
I brought Ms. Ahn to the hospital
and now I'm on my way home.

231
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,077
I came from the hospital, too.

232
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,456
-Is she okay?
-Yes.

233
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,669
-What is that?
-This?

234
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,005
I lost my shoe.

235
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,592
I look like a crazy person, right?

236
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:52,556
You reacted quickly to protect
your foot with the tissue box.

237
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,849
Right?

238
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,394
I put it on because I needed to.
Not because I am crazy.

239
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,313
But it's falling apart now.

240
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,690
My gosh.

241
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,484
It looks like the tissue box
has played its role for now.

242
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,236
We should call a rescue party.

243
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,615
There's a taxi. Let's take it together.

244
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,372
The shelter was closed
but I met a rescue party.

245
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,376
Please be quiet.

246
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,756
It's nothing.

247
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,140
You have deviated from the route.

248
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,559
I know. Be quiet.

249
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,396
I wish I hadn't seen that tissue box.

250
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,736
Did she run in that tissue box?
How far did she go?

251
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,614
You have deviated from the route.

252
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,241
I know. I'm going to go now.

253
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,177
Turn right.

254
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,806
What? Turn right again?

255
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,018
Wouldn't that put me back there?

256
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,688
Your wife was driving
with only one shoe on.

257
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,024
We thought she was drunk, but she wasn't.

258
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,568
-Is there a problem?
-No.

259
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,530
It's just strange
that she was only wearing one shoe.

260
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:36,576
Sang-u.

261
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,289
Are they saying something happened
to my daughter before the accident?

262
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,666
Please calm down.

263
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,335
She must have lost
the other shoe somewhere.

264
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,254
I'll find it.

265
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,342
HANKUK MEDICAL CENTER

266
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,136
Did you find the shoe?

267
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,347
It's not there?

268
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,557
Okay.

269
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,032
Thank you for helping me out.

270
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,035
Then can I ask you a question?

271
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,704
What is it?

272
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,541
The special person at Kingdom
you talked about, is it the president?

273
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,584
Well...

274
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:28,712
Yes.

275
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,464
Did you start working
at Kingdom because of him?

276
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,551
Well, yes.

277
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,555
I saw him come here to meet you.
Are you special to him?

278
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,515
Well...

279
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,104
I was wondering if we can keep
coming home together.

280
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,024
I can't do that with my boss' girlfriend.

281
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,069
I'm not special to him.

282
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,822
To him, I'm...

283
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,745
just a crazy woman.

284
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,585
-Then let's come home together again.
-Yes.

285
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,177
Thank you so much for today.

286
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,846
Who is that handsome guy?

287
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:21,931
Hold on a moment.

288
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,231
He's the head of security at Kingdom?

289
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,817
-And he lives in Room 404?
-Yes.

290
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:38,239
Does he know about your special world?

291
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,533
He wouldn't ask
to come home together if he did.

292
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:43,787
Gong-sil.

293
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,625
You might be like this
because you lack male energy.

294
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,920
You should become friends
with him and get male energy.

295
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,588
Male energy?

296
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:57,342
In historical dramas,
you see really good female shamans

297
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:01,054
get kicked out when they sleep with men.

298
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,433
You see ghosts
because you have similar powers.

299
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,645
Getting male energy
might help you get rid of it.

300
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,854
Really?

301
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:15,235
Is that man special to me
because he has strong male energy?

302
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,612
Who do you mean?

303
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,696
There's someone.

304
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,448
Just get close to whoever you need.

305
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,908
Drink up their energy.

306
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,619
He won't even let me touch him.

307
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,497
Let's start with Room 404.

308
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,667
You should sleep. You have
to go to work to come home with him.

309
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,628
I can't sleep.

310
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,715
What if a ghost takes my body
while I sleep, like last time?

311
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,345
Is there something here?

312
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,563
The summer sales have never been higher.

313
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,940
Kingdom is on the rise.

314
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,068
Giant Mall will open soon.
Keep that rising trend going.

315
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,903
Prepare aggressive strategies.

316
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,614
This store has the third highest sales.

317
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,534
Hello.

318
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,120
Hello.

319
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,372
This store's sales aren't so good.

320
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,708
-Let's go.
-Sir.

321
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,049
This store has the highest sales.

322
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,470
-Mr. Joo.
-Hello. Nice to meet you.

323
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,139
-Call me if you need anything.
-Sure.

324
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,558
Please keep up the good work.

325
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,435
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

326
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,444
We took this when Tae I-ryeong
was going to marry the soccer player.

327
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,072
-Is it okay to put this up?
-It's really aggressive.

328
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,743
This photo will have
a huge advertising impact.

329
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,161
Tae I-ryeong will probably protest.

330
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,791
We already paid her.
There's no point of protesting.

331
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,046
All right. Good.

332
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,179
CLOSED TEMPORARILY
DAHLIA

333
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,765
It was this store.

334
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,396
Right.

335
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,067
The wife of the store owner
died a few days ago.

336
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,610
I know.

337
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,529
It has the fourth highest sales in here.

338
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,615
Giant Mall has been contacting them
to lure them away.

339
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,951
But he is loyal to me,
so he won't go there.

340
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,745
I can't trust him because I saw something.

341
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,373
Find out more about him.

342
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,543
Find out more about him.

343
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,840
I heard the wife of Dahlia's owner
died last week.

344
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,259
I heard he was really good to his wife.

345
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,595
-I feel bad.
-I saw that couple, too.

346
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,680
-This is weird.
-This one?

347
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,848
-Delete it.
-Look at this.

348
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,474
They would come on dates here.

349
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,644
They made plans to go hiking
or traveling on weekends.

350
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,521
He was so good to her.

351
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:01,150
He should be. The wife is really rich
and she got him the store too.

352
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,153
The mother-in-law is even richer.
She owns several buildings in Gangnam.

353
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,656
Let me see. The only daughter has died.

354
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:10,577
She only has a son-in-law.
So, all her assets will go to...

355
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,080
-Oh, my gosh. He hit the jackpot.
-Wow.

356
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:18,877
He's a good guy and was good
to his wife, so he deserves it.

357
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,841
My gosh. Gong-sil.

358
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,050
Hey.

359
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:30,471
If everyone says a person is good
but I say that he's not good...

360
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:34,100
-no one will believe me, right?
-Did you see something again?

361
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:35,852
No.

362
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:41,733
Gong-sil, let's work here for a long time.

363
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,111
You should keep working here
so you can go home with the handsome guy

364
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,071
and get his male energy.

365
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,367
Okay. I'm sorry. I should go now.

366
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,369
Bye.

367
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,458
It always feels weird
after Gong-sil comes by.

368
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,753
My gosh.

369
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,424
Is someone there?

370
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,638
-Go. Go away.
-Excuse me.

371
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,893
-Is she your sister?
-Yes, she is. Why?

372
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:21,064
I would like to get to know her.

373
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,815
I'll help you. Something fell off.

374
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,366
You got hospitalized to get sympathy
but they put this photo of you up.

375
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,201
Let's go and protest.

376
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,080
-Is this it?
-Look at this.

377
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:38,873
It's okay.

378
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,835
It's better than getting pitied
for being sick.

379
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,007
I think kicking a ball
like this suits me better.

380
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,135
Are you really okay with this?

381
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,720
I like it.

382
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,098
Okay...

383
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,642
Shall we go find the woman
who ruined my wedding while we're here?

384
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,479
-Let's think after we eat.
-Okay.

385
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,906
-Tae Gong-sil?
-Do you know her?

386
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:12,991
What?

387
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,035
It can't be. No way.

388
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,416
Excuse me.

389
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,128
Yes?

390
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,339
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

391
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,342
I can't take time off
because of such a small injury.

392
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:38,266
You said that you tripped
on something on the stairs, right?

393
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:42,478
Did you happen to see this shoe there?

394
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,065
Hey, that's the shoe
that I found in the corridor.

395
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,900
Where did you find it?

396
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,743
Sang-u.

397
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,454
THE LATE CHOI YUN-HUI

398
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,247
Yun-hui!

399
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,671
Yun-hui!

400
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,640
Are you sure that you came from there?

401
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,059
No?

402
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,312
This way?

403
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,900
Did you fall over like this?

404
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,117
I heard that this shoe was found here.

405
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,954
It's really close to her husband's store.

406
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,706
Was it found there?

407
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,334
Then it's trash.
And you're the cleaning crew.

408
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,629
Your job is to throw the trash away.

409
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,756
You know it's not trash.

410
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,550
You know what I'm trying to do.

411
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,887
No, I don't.

412
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,933
To me, you're a lazy employee
who is doing strange things.

413
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,477
You're someone I would consider firing.

414
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,316
Those shoes.

415
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,903
Don't they look exactly like this one?

416
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,197
They're the same, right?

417
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,242
So?

418
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:26,040
I may say I don't want to know,
but I cannot ignore what I see.

419
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,668
I'm like that.

420
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,424
Not again.

421
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,135
I saw something that I shouldn't have.

422
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:53,002
Do you have to go hiking
with your wife again?

423
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,254
I have to keep going with her

424
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,381
so I don't get suspected
when the accident happens.

425
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,885
Does she like hiking?

426
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,221
She likes it.

427
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,390
She doesn't know I'm looking
for a place for her to die.

428
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,910
Honey! Yun-hui!

429
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,629
Yun-hui. Hear me out.

430
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,175
Honey.

431
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,947
MY DARLING

432
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:54,100
-Are you wearing those shoes now?
-Your wife is dead.

433
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,561
I couldn't wear them before,
in case we got caught.

434
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,313
But it's okay now.

435
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,774
Be careful.
My mother-in-law is still around.

436
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,737
Who do you think everything
will go to once the old lady dies?

437
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,073
She's so healthy. When will that be?

438
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,742
She's not doing well
after her daughter died.

439
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:15,246
It will be soon. We're always lucky.

440
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,770
Giant Mall is trying to take
the stores that have high sales.

441
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,398
We have to keep them here.

442
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,193
Isn't that why
you went around the mall today?

443
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:50,823
My face is hurting from smiling
at the important ones.

444
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:54,493
Dahlia has high sales.
You should meet the owner, too.

445
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:58,497
I saw something I shouldn't.
I don't know if I can smile at him.

446
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:03,752
The woman Tae Gong-sil went after
works at Dahlia.

447
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,257
I heard the owner
just lost his wife and is very sad.

448
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,760
I'm worried that Ms. Tae
might cause trouble.

449
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,896
Mother, why did you come? You should rest.

450
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,315
Yun-hui isn't around to take care of you.

451
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,526
I brought you some food
to last a few days.

452
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:34,658
Mother, it's just the two of us now.
Let's rely on each other.

453
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,830
Why don't we go hiking together?
I used to go with Yun-hui.

454
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,593
-What is this?
-She asked me to bring you this.

455
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,887
It's your dead wife's shoe.

456
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,891
Is this Yun-hui's shoe?

457
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,435
She came here before the accident.

458
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,688
She came to see her husband
but saw him do something terrible.

459
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,858
She lost this because she was so shocked.

460
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,195
Sang-u. What is she talking about?

461
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,365
My wife was here?

462
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,450
That's not true.

463
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,912
And that is not my wife's shoe.

464
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,705
Don't lie.

465
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,751
I don't know what you're talking about.

466
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,213
Mother, I found Yun-hui's shoe.

467
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,422
What?

468
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,312
The police found it
at the scene and brought it to me.

469
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,357
This is my wife's shoe.

470
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:52,111
No, that's another woman's shoe.

471
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,821
That woman is right there.

472
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,448
Who are you?

473
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,243
Why are you doing this?

474
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,412
She said she would watch you.

475
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,333
She said she has to protect you.

476
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,961
He is a bad man.

477
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,423
Look. Why are you doing this?

478
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,094
It hasn't even been a week
since my wife passed away.

479
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,930
I feel like dying.

480
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:25,019
I am barely hanging on.
Why are you doing this to me?

481
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:30,107
Can you say that even if
your wife is watching you right now?

482
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,234
If she is watching, she will know.

483
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,947
How much I loved her.
How much pain I am in.

484
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,742
She will know.

485
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,755
You're lying.

486
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,175
-Those are fake tears.
-What are you doing?

487
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:57,468
Are you out of your mind?

488
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,636
She saw everything.

489
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,596
She saw you smile.

490
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,890
And she's watching you lie right now!

491
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:03,849
Stop this.

492
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:04,975
Don't you feel bad?

493
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,936
-Please leave.
-He is a bad man.

494
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,730
Your daughter wants to protect you.

495
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,107
-Come on, get out!
-Let me go!

496
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,652
Sir.

497
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,987
A woman who is making a fuss at Dahlia

498
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,615
is Tae Gong-sil, from the cleaning crew.

499
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,866
Tae Gong-sil?

500
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,410
-Let me go!
-What are you doing?

501
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,830
-Please stop this. What are you doing?
-Please!

502
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,582
-Please let me say one thing.
-Gosh.

503
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,001
-She is...
-He's a really bad man.

504
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,961
-Just stop it.
-Please come with me.

505
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,713
It really was Tae Gong-sil.

506
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,925
You mean the girl who was prettier
and smarter than you?

507
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,053
-Gosh.
-I heard she became weird. So it was true.

508
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,847
-Please, just a moment.
-She's totally ruined.

509
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:47,101
-You're in danger.
-Hey, please stop this!

510
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,812
Oh, my gosh.

511
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,063
What's wrong with her?

512
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,818
Excuse me. You're security, right?

513
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,820
Take her away. Right now!

514
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,655
-What's going on?
-All right.

515
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,699
-Is she crazy?
-Why was she doing that?

516
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,036
-She must be crazy.
-Miss, let's go.

517
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,956
-Look at her.
-Why was she acting like that?

518
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,375
-Why did she do that?
-She's weird.

519
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,127
What's wrong with her?

520
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:26,890
Let's go, Mother.

521
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,355
Tae Gong-sil.

522
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,406
Why are you sitting there
like a crazy person? Get up.

523
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:50,873
Get up.

524
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,480
Did you find the owner of that shoe?

525
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,483
Yes. He's...

526
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:20,068
I found her husband.

527
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,197
But he's lying
that it's not his wife's shoe.

528
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,617
I'm not lying.

529
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,660
My dead wife's shoe is this one.

530
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,748
That woman is crazy and doesn't know
what she's talking about.

531
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:38,587
Then we should find out
if she's crazy or if you're lying.

532
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:51,558
This is the one shoe
that your wife had on when she died.

533
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:57,606
I brought what you threw away
in the hospital trash bin.

534
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,741
-They're not a pair.
-It was true.

535
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,872
-So he was lying?
-Right. I can't believe it.

536
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,209
So it's not his wife's shoe?

537
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,254
Yours is not a match.

538
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,019
-Oh, my gosh.
-It's a match.

539
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,898
-Oh, my goodness.
-He was lying?

540
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,108
He must have been lying.

541
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,485
This is a match.

542
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,738
Are these really Yun-hui's?

543
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,702
Whose shoe were you holding, then?

544
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,628
-Bring that woman out.
-Yes, sir.

545
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,054
-It's her shoe.
-Oh, my gosh.

546
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,723
Oh, my gosh.

547
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,808
Oh, my. He's so shameless.

548
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,983
The one shoe
you wanted to hide by lying...

549
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,193
is over there.

550
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,654
Have you

551
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,615
been lying...

552
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,951
to me and Yun-hui?

553
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,373
-Ma'am.
-Are you okay?

554
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:49,635
She says she'll keep watching you
and find a place for you to die.

555
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,596
Just like you did.

556
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,892
He's a real douchebag.

557
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,211
Do you think

558
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,047
my daughter is watching?

559
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,345
Yes.

560
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,829
Yun-hui.

561
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,996
The president seems kind.

562
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,498
He took his employee's side.

563
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,251
Mr. Joo isn't the type to do that.

564
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,975
I'm Tae I-ryeong. Let me go.

565
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,185
-I-ryeong.
-Let me go.

566
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,691
-I'm Tae I-ryeong.
-You took me by surprise.

567
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,276
You did it last time, too.

568
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,404
You must be a security guard.
Do you work here?

569
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,283
Kang Woo? Is that your name?

570
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,576
Yes.

571
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:24,206
-I'm glad we met. Last time--
-I'm on duty. Bye.

572
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,711
-Do you know him?
-Did he just ignore me?

573
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,466
Thank you.

574
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:39,012
-How did it go?
-Mr. Joo took care of everything.

575
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,389
-Mr. Joo came here himself?
-Yes.

576
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:48,104
Ms. Tae is Mr. Joo's secret girlfriend.
I am sure about what I saw.

577
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:51,900
-You must be right.
-Do you think I held her too hard?

578
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,945
I hope she wasn't offended.
What should I do?

579
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,327
You said you don't believe anything
and that you'll ignore it.

580
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,287
Thank you for helping me.

581
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,374
There's no need to thank me.
I just got my revenge, that's all.

582
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:13,171
Not only did he betray his wife,
but he betrayed Kingdom, too.

583
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,758
He already signed with Giant Mall.
What a jerk.

584
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,595
I got revenge
for his betrayal, that's all.

585
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:25,642
Didn't you watch that man at the hospital
because something bothered you?

586
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:29,104
I just took a wrong turn
and saw what I shouldn't have.

587
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,655
What is this? I'm back at the hospital.

588
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,368
Let's go home now.

589
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,302
I took a wrong turn
and I saw it, so I brought it.

590
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:06,057
People find things in places
they didn't imagine they would.

591
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:10,353
Or they get lost and end up
in an unexpected location.

592
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:14,441
They think it's just some random
luck or bad luck.

593
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,612
But not all of it is just a coincidence.

594
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:22,032
Are you saying I didn't get lost
by coincidence?

595
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,619
Turn right.

596
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:31,875
Turn right.

597
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,169
What? Turn right again?

598
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,922
Wouldn't that take me back there?

599
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,024
Stop right there. Don't say anything else.

600
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:57,692
Mr. Joo.

601
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,363
I've been thinking.

602
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:06,451
I think there's a way
for me to be special to you.

603
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,954
You'll be special to me?

604
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:10,747
Why?

605
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,375
Did you get the winning lottery numbers?

606
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:14,834
Cha Hui-ju.

607
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,879
She's very special to you, right?

608
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:22,676
And I can see Cha Hui-ju.

609
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:27,347
Yes, you said Hui-ju is by my side.

610
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,352
If you stay by my side,
then you could see her again.

611
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:36,398
Yes, if I get to see her again,

612
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,441
then I'll be special to you.

613
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:43,196
I'll tell you if I see her again.

614
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:44,906
Thank you.

615
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:58,253
I can meet Hui-ju again?

616
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,805
What did you learn from this incident?

617
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,558
What? Me?

618
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,938
I don't care if you first approached me
for my money.

619
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,775
-Honey.
-You just have to stay loyal to me.

620
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:26,031
Beautiful women will grow old
and their boobs will shrivel.

621
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,826
But my money will never run out.

622
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:35,290
So, you should keep being loyal to me,
like in the beginning.

623
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,459
And don't look elsewhere.

624
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,627
That's all I need.

625
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,920
My love for you

626
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,923
will never change.

627
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,640
If you turn around even a little bit...

628
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,562
I will not let it pass and throw you out.

629
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,522
That will never happen.

630
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,155
Hello.

631
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,616
Please have this.

632
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,076
Okay.

633
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:14,287
We're having a team dinner.
Would you like to come, too?

634
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:17,749
Team dinner? Where you drink together?

635
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,543
-And go to karaoke rooms?
-Yes.

636
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,548
I would like to go, but...

637
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,843
If it's a team dinner,
Mr. Kang Woo must be joining too, right?

638
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:29,886
Yes.

639
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,598
Gong-sil, let's go.
Let's go get some energy.

640
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,227
But I shouldn't drink.

641
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,895
I can't let my mind run loose.

642
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:42,148
You don't have to drink. You can just eat.

643
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,025
Of course. So, you're coming, then.

644
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:46,486
I just want to get to know you better.

645
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,739
-For real. Let's go.
-Shall I go?

646
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,324
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

647
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,452
It's so much better with you here.

648
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,955
Gong-sil, what do you think about me?

649
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,332
I think I'm a little drunk.

650
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:01,251
Look at this place,

651
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:05,505
there should be
a balance of men and women.

652
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,799
I will make you a mileage card.

653
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:10,176
I'll buy you lunch
if you come three times.

654
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,928
And if you come five times,
I'll buy you drinks.

655
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,973
And if you come ten times,
then I'll get you a blind date.

656
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:21,271
Gong-sil, here's coke for you
since you can't drink.

657
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:30,029
Please have some coke. There's no alcohol.

658
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,906
-Okay.
-Raise your glasses. Cheers!

659
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,616
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

660
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,294
-Gosh.
-Have another glass.

661
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:46,379
-Excuse me.
-You're a good drinker.

662
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:48,965
One more glass.

663
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:55,305
Gong-sil, go lie over there. Get up.

664
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,182
Why does my head hurt?

665
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,559
-Please move over a little.
-Okay.

666
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,521
Lie down here. Good.

667
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,568
My head hurts so much.
Maybe it's because I'm so tired.

668
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:10,987
Are you okay?

669
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,617
Yes. I'm really good.

670
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:19,287
It's been a long time
since I mingled with others.

671
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,749
Are you tired? Are you drunk?

672
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,542
But I didn't drink at all.

673
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:27,337
I'm too scared to drink.

674
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,422
I become someone else when I'm drunk.

675
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:32,258
Everyone becomes
someone else when they're drunk.

676
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,346
I really do become someone else sometimes.

677
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:53,655
Cha Hui-ju.

678
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:58,535
Is it true that you like me
because I'm from a rich family?

679
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:04,123
Were you hesitating to answer?
I am offended.

680
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,335
I was pretending to think,
so you won't be offended.

681
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,088
You'll feel hurt

682
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,341
if I admit it right away.

683
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,058
Are you mad, Jung-won?

684
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,228
You won't be mad anymore
if I just call your name three times.

685
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,314
Joo Jung-won.

686
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,276
Joo Jung-two.

687
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,488
Joo Jung-three.

688
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,078
It's not funny at all.

689
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:46,541
It's not funny
but you're not angry, right?

690
00:59:59,095 --> 00:59:59,929
You evil bitch.

691
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,493
Hey. It's that girl.

692
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:25,788
I said I'd help him meet her.

693
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:46,976
I think the woman I told you about
is special to Joo Jung-won.

694
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,980
I will keep an eye on her and see if she
has anything to do with Cha Hui-ju

695
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,232
and if she knows anything.

696
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:29,477
Tae Gong-sil.

697
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,902
Why did you come here?

698
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:41,239
How did you know I live here?

699
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,535
You got in my car
and then entered Kingdom.

700
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,287
And now you even press my doorbell?

701
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:53,418
I warned you.
Didn't I tell you to stop this?

702
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:57,130
Jung-won.

703
01:01:59,006 --> 01:01:59,966
"Jung-won"?

704
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,428
You're really crazy.

705
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,392
You're mad at me, aren't you?

706
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,436
Yes, I am. I'm mad at you.

707
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:15,356
You're fired.
Don't ever come near me again.

708
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:17,567
Get lost.

709
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,987
Will you stop being mad
if I call out your name three times?

710
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,534
Joo Jung-won.

711
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,329
-Joo Jung-two.
-Joo Jung-two.

712
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,459
-Joo Jung-three.
-Joo Jung-three.

713
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:45,970
It's not funny at all.

714
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:49,849
What are you doing?

715
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,269
It's me.

716
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,105
The evil bitch you hate.

717
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,918
