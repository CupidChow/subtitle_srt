1
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:37,328
You don't feel anything
even if I touch you, right?

2
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:41,833
Right?

3
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:47,756
Do you really think
I'm a shelter made of marble?

4
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,975
Of course not.

5
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,355
It's not like I don't feel anything.

6
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:10,320
Do you feel kind of weird, too?

7
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,198
I always did.

8
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,993
You always just...

9
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,663
touched me too much.

10
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:25,376
I didn't say anything
because you didn't seem bothered.

11
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:30,006
Now that you seem to feel something,
let me ask you.

12
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:37,889
I want it to look as if we're just
close friends when you use me.

13
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,267
I don't want people to look at us
and wonder what we're doing.

14
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,022
This is close friends.

15
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,447
And this is "What on earth
are they doing?" Okay?

16
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,616
Okay.

17
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:03,248
I just touched you so I can survive,
whether you like it or not.

18
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,751
I should be careful now.

19
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,588
-Be careful.
-Yes, be careful.

20
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,393
Be careful about such things, too.

21
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:27,981
I'll listen to your ghost stories, so
don't go around by yourself and get hurt.

22
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,151
Worrying like this is being close friends.

23
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:38,032
If this goes any further, people will
wonder what we're doing, okay?

24
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,450
Yes.

25
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,204
Let's go. I'll take you home.

26
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,832
It's okay. I'll go alone.

27
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,751
You were in a holding cell
and you got hurt, too.

28
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,254
I will worry about you that much.
Take my car.

29
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,256
I have to be careful.

30
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,219
Something strange
just turned up in my radar.

31
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,056
So, hold me. Use me.

32
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,018
It's okay.

33
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:12,442
Are you being careful because Sweet Kang
might see me take you home?

34
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,737
I'm just being careful.

35
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,699
I have nothing to be careful about.

36
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,410
If we meet Sweet Kang,
he won't wonder what we're doing.

37
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,663
I'll tell him we're just close friends,
so come with me.

38
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,419
Do you know how good it is
to be friends with the president?

39
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,713
Sweet Kang won't be able
to treat you lightly.

40
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:39,552
Mr. Joo went to the police station
because of Tae Gong-sil.

41
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,890
And I'm sure Tae Gong-sil is related
to Cha Hui-ju in some way.

42
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,312
I missed it because of personal feelings.

43
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,730
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,690
Cha Hui-ju was an orphan.

45
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,609
If she has no parents either,

46
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,155
they could have met at an orphanage.

47
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,573
I will find out.

48
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,325
One more thing.

49
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:09,624
Find out if Tae Gong-sil
ever lived in or visited Europe.

50
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,001
Yes, sir.

51
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,128
Kang Woo.

52
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,009
You seemed to have feelings
for that woman.

53
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,512
Are you okay?

54
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:23,930
I will be.

55
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,599
Don't act strong.
Tell me if it's too hard for you.

56
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:32,772
When your heart isn't being honest,
pain gives you the answer.

57
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,110
Do you think it will hurt?

58
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:38,736
I will...

59
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,198
end things with her.

60
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,849
Mr. Joo.

61
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,602
Thank you for today.

62
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,315
You should have tofu
since you've been in a cell.

63
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,983
I don't eat tofu.

64
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,903
I'm going. Good night.

65
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,115
Gong-sil, you said
something strange was on your radar.

66
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,908
Did it follow you?

67
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:30,121
It wasn't something scary.
Just something that needs scolding.

68
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,874
I think I will have to talk to it
and reason with it.

69
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,792
Good night.

70
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,003
Let's go.

71
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,594
You're not Candy. You're a radar.

72
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,262
Get a hold of yourself.

73
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:10,203
I'm eating bitter pills all the time
since meeting Gong-sil.

74
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,167
It's so bitter. Water!

75
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:29,263
You should have tofu
since you've been in a cell.

76
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,141
This looks a bit like tofu.

77
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:54,705
You don't feel anything
even if I touch you, right?

78
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,377
She used to ask to sleep
with me holding my hand.

79
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,920
Why is she so worried now?

80
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,264
It's so salty.

81
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,731
Since scary ghosts aren't
coming up on your radar,

82
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,192
is your mind in the gutter?

83
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,612
Touching him like this
is sexual harassment.

84
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,323
It's like touching
someone's bottom on the subway.

85
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,664
Are you here again, supermarket grandma?

86
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,169
How can I sleep
when you're watching me like that?

87
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:48,843
You should scare me since you're here,
so I can get a hold of myself.

88
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,390
Stop! Please stop!

89
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,269
You can stop now! Please stop it!

90
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:04,567
Mr. Joo, I heard you went to a police
station doing stuff you didn't need to.

91
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,485
Sit down.

92
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,405
I was really shocked.

93
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,617
I was really shocked, too.

94
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,246
You did a good deed,
so I can't say anything.

95
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,249
But you're doing things
with Bang-sil that you didn't use to.

96
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,836
Your father already knows
about her and asked about her.

97
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,549
That is a little more shocking.

98
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,011
Are you sending him reports about me?

99
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,852
It wasn't me.
We only talked about golf last time.

100
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:44,148
People all talk about you.
He must have heard from somewhere.

101
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,610
It's only natural that a father
takes an interest in his son's life.

102
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,659
I am so shocked to find out
he is interested in me after 34 years.

103
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,497
He must be getting old
and getting interested in his son.

104
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,249
Right, honey?

105
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,334
Of course.

106
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,836
He must want to have grandchildren.

107
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,757
Mr. Joo, I hope you succeed this time.

108
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:10,967
I don't know.

109
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,388
I don't think meaningless
physical contact will make grandkids.

110
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:35,241
Grandma, I got my senses back,
so please come out of there.

111
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:39,036
Please don't roll
your eyes like that, Grandma.

112
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,789
Please come out.

113
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,000
Woo.

114
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,461
Are you going for a run at this hour?

115
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,299
Yes. I'm going for a run.

116
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:57,513
I'm sorry I left without you,
when I said I'd leave with you.

117
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,640
Something came up.

118
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:05,896
Gong-sil.

119
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,692
I think we should make things clear.

120
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,904
You're mistaken that I like you.

121
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,615
What?

122
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,535
I said it as a joke to the kids
but you really believed it.

123
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,245
So, I couldn't say it wasn't true.

124
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,377
You even thanked me.
So, I tried to take it further.

125
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,339
But I can't. I'm sorry.

126
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,133
Oh, I see.

127
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,552
I thought it was strange.

128
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,056
This is embarrassing.

129
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,811
You could have just told me so.

130
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,899
You gave me the lollipop
and tickets to a musical.

131
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,360
I made a fool of myself.

132
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,323
You accepted the lollipop
and the musical tickets.

133
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,827
But you didn't like me. Right?

134
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,499
A man I respect said
when the heart isn't being honest,

135
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,668
pain gives you the answer.

136
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,254
I don't think you're in pain
because of me.

137
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,800
So I don't have to feel sorry, right?

138
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,861
Hey.

139
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,237
Nice.

140
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,738
Over there.

141
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,705
Nice throw.

142
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,583
Catch!

143
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,054
Go get it.

144
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,058
Hey, I'm going to get you for that.

145
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,944
What's wrong?

146
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:03,991
Help!

147
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,676
Excuse me! Please help!

148
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,845
-Excuse me!
-Help!

149
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,194
-Wake up.
-Wake up.

150
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,828
Wake up.

151
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,175
There have been three accidents
at the Kingdom Hotel pool.

152
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,720
They say something pulled at their legs.

153
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,138
But there wasn't anything there.

154
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,226
It can't be a water ghost.
What could it be?

155
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,480
Are you sure
it's not someone playing a prank?

156
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,441
The lifeguards were there
but it wasn't a person who did it.

157
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,654
It's the peak season. We can't
have a strange rumor going around.

158
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,199
We could lose our guests to Giant Hotel.

159
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,660
We can't let that happen.

160
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,456
I should set up the radar at the pool.

161
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,094
Giant Mall is higher than us.

162
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,597
Mr. Kim!

163
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,815
Hello, my ten billion won radar.

164
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,567
I need to use the radar.

165
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,115
Were you tormented all night long again?

166
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,076
Your eyebags could touch the ground.

167
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,915
The old lady from the supermarket came
and kept me up all night.

168
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,087
Mr. Joo. Do I look sick?

169
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,716
You always look sick.

170
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,637
But today you look more like a zombie.

171
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,307
You haven't even seen
a real zombie before.

172
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,355
Didn't you say you've seen
a water ghost before?

173
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,774
Yes.

174
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:46,570
I once went to the Han River
with my sister to eat chicken.

175
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,907
I almost drowned in the water
because of a water ghost.

176
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,618
Water ghosts.

177
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,455
I never want to see another one again.

178
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:00,793
Never! I hate water ghosts!
Water ghosts are so scary!

179
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:03,837
Hold me.

180
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,052
It's no use with the water ghosts.

181
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,562
Water ghosts.

182
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,107
She really hates them.

183
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,153
I'd feel bad just sending her there
to catch it.

184
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,124
Mr. Joo is giving them to you
to use on your day off.

185
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,753
A voucher for Kingdom Hotel.

186
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,173
Isn't this a really nice place?

187
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:52,219
He put in a few vouchers.
He said to enjoy it with your friends.

188
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,974
He told me I look like a zombie.

189
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,394
He must be sending me there
to get some rest.

190
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:02,771
Yes.

191
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,026
I'm so happy.

192
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,902
I gave them to her.

193
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,071
She was so happy
and said she'd go tomorrow.

194
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,911
Okay, I'll send her there first.

195
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,497
Then I'll ask her to look for it.

196
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,416
Yes.

197
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,713
Kingdom Hotel is really luxurious.
I can't believe this.

198
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,300
I have a few more.
You should bring your friends.

199
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,262
Shall we ask
the guy in room 404 to come with us?

200
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,266
Okay. Let's get packed.

201
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,394
Take a lot of pretty clothes.
I'll take them in my car.

202
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,312
Okay.

203
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,190
I'll take lots of pretty photos of you.

204
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,152
Gong-sil. I am so happy.

205
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,739
Isn't there a pool at Kingdom Hotel?

206
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,825
Let's take our swimsuits, too.
This is so good.

207
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,785
Water ghosts...

208
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,040
Doesn't it feel spooky to think
there's something in the pool?

209
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,168
There is no such thing.
This isn't Loch Ness.

210
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,621
You wanted to see me?

211
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,375
I'm not someone you can just meet
when you want to.

212
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,002
Thanks for coming.

213
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,672
What is the favor you want to ask me?

214
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,508
Find out things I can't learn
from records about Tae Gong-sil.

215
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,844
If you ask her friends,

216
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:01,014
you can find out if they saw
her parents and if they got along well.

217
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,850
Why do you want to know about her family?

218
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,560
Do you want to marry her?

219
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,146
I wouldn't ask around like this if I did.

220
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,440
-I would just meet her family.
-That's right.

221
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,236
So is this work? You're investigating her?

222
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,613
Then I will help.

223
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,699
Let's talk over lunch.

224
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,450
Will you only help if I eat with you?

225
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,619
Of course not.

226
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,497
It's time to eat,
so I'm letting you eat with me.

227
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,999
Then you don't have to.

228
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:28,876
Call me when you know something.

229
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:30,878
Hey!

230
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,217
I made reservations.

231
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,137
Why is he being so haughty,
when he's just a salaryman?

232
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,058
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, sir.

233
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,312
Are you reporting to my father about me?

234
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:53,066
He hasn't talked to me
since I saw him last year.

235
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,277
Why do you ask?

236
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,990
He wasn't interested in the woman
I was thinking of marrying before.

237
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:04,536
It's strange that he's interested
in Tae Gong-sil.

238
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,580
It must be out of affection.

239
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,459
That does not make sense at all.

240
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,880
Has Tae Gong-sil left?

241
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,597
It's so nice here. Hurry up.

242
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:24,806
Okay.

243
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,186
I'll leave as soon as I'm done.
You should look around.

244
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,946
Where are you going? Someplace nice?

245
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,865
You don't need to know.

246
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,789
Why am I going around investigating
Tae Gong-sil when I'm a career woman?

247
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,540
Gosh.

248
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,876
I received this.

249
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,088
You should bring Kang Woo with you.

250
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,049
You want us to come
and join the Tae sisters?

251
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:04,763
I am going to try to set Gong-sil
up with Woo.

252
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,599
I'll buy lunch if things work out.

253
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:14,731
Should I tell Mr. Do or should I just...

254
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,984
Let's go. I should just go.

255
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,198
It's so big
that it doesn't seem scary in here.

256
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,536
There's a fireworks festival tonight.

257
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,665
They can't do fireworks during the day.

258
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,419
And I'm too scared to go out at night.
I could never watch it.

259
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,175
Mr. Joo?

260
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,470
-Where are you?
-In the hotel lobby.

261
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,222
It's really nice here.

262
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,932
Of course. It's mine.

263
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,727
The painting next to you
is really expensive.

264
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,690
It looks expensive.

265
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,069
How do you know where I am?

266
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,612
Because I'm behind you.

267
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:11,997
Mr. Joo!

268
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,000
-What are you doing here?
-I followed you.

269
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,502
Did you come alone? Have you eaten?

270
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,379
My sister hasn't arrived yet.

271
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,133
Really? Let's eat first. I'm hungry.

272
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,264
He followed me?

273
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:30,932
Why?

274
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,897
-Is everything ready?
-Yes, sir.

275
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,233
I won't let anyone
enter the pool after dinner.

276
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,736
We can go after dinner.

277
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,614
-Where are we going?
-I'll tell you after dinner.

278
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,746
Mr. Joo must be preparing
an event for that woman.

279
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:56,500
I envy her. They'll watch the fireworks
alone at the pool tonight.

280
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,507
Is there anything you want to eat?
Tell me. I'll buy you everything.

281
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:07,094
Are you buying me something nice
because I look tired?

282
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,386
Yes.

283
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,848
Then buy me everything I want to eat.

284
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,892
Okay, let's go.

285
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,191
It's been 15 years since Hui-ju died.

286
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:25,987
Thank you for not forgetting
to help us every year.

287
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,118
It's already been
15 years since Cha Hui-ju died.

288
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,302
After she died,
it felt like I was paying for her death.

289
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,513
So I thought of cutting ties
with this place.

290
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,852
I think I was right to keep coming,
for Jung-won's sake.

291
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:02,065
This is where Mr. Joo
first met Cha Hui-ju, right?

292
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,192
That's right.

293
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,505
Mr. Kang?

294
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,383
What is he doing here?

295
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,636
Mr. Kim. What are you doing?

296
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,138
Oh, I'm coming.

297
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,693
Tae Gong-ri. Tae Gong-sil.

298
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:51,448
No one like this stayed at our orphanage.

299
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,874
You didn't bring Woo.
Why did you come, Han-ju?

300
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,168
Mr. Kang is busy.

301
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,545
And I don't miss out on opportunities.

302
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,464
Then you should at least pay for gas.

303
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,299
I have a small salary.

304
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,850
-It's Kim Dong-su.
-Do you know him?

305
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,190
Hey, it's the same thing. Who is it?

306
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,360
Someone who took my money and disappeared.

307
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,085
Ouch, my neck. Are we going after him? No.

308
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,504
-We have to be somewhere.
-Shut it! Hold on tight.

309
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,351
It's sparkling water.
Drink this instead of wine.

310
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,062
Thank you.

311
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,694
Your eyebags are smaller
after resting at a good place.

312
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,695
You look good.

313
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,363
Really?

314
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,286
Don't you have any other clothes?

315
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,542
My sister is bringing my stuff
but she's running a little late.

316
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:36,845
Excuse me.

317
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,729
She'll need something to change into
after she goes into the water.

318
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:47,605
Should I prepare something?

319
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:03,621
Mr. Joo is closing off the pool for a
surprise event in time for the fireworks.

320
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,665
I envy that woman so much.

321
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,959
We shouldn't get jealous.

322
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,128
I wish I could go on a date
with him just once.

323
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,213
Let's go.

324
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,759
An event?

325
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,470
For me? Could it be?

326
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:35,945
Are you going to your room?

327
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,448
Meet me in the lobby in two hours.

328
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,950
We just ate. Is there something else?

329
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,246
Something very important.

330
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,541
Don't get mad even if you're shocked.

331
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:50,835
Okay.

332
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,969
Mr. Joo reserved the whole pool.

333
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,472
And he's meeting me in two hours.

334
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,395
Did he reserve the pool for me?

335
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,749
Do not let anyone in
after I enter the pool area.

336
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,962
-Yes, sir.
-Send what I prepared to the room.

337
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,213
Yes?

338
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,345
What is this?

339
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,472
President Joo Jung-won sent this.

340
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,116
It's so pretty.

341
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,165
It's pretty.

342
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,421
So the important thing
that Mr. Joo said must be...

343
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,007
Mr. Joo.

344
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,812
Did you prepare this for me?

345
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,898
Yes. There's more.

346
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:20,860
Look.

347
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,147
Please go in. Mr. Joo is waiting.

348
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,901
Did he really reserve the whole pool,
so no one else can go in?

349
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,613
Yes, he said not to let
anyone else inside.

350
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,332
I came because there's a problem.
I'm not here to have fun.

351
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,418
Yes.

352
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,713
I'll find out what's in the water
and take care of it.

353
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,508
Yes. It won't take long.

354
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,262
Hello, my ten billion won radar.

355
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,097
I need to use the radar.

356
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,057
Didn't you say you've seen
a water ghost before?

357
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:35,768
Yes.

358
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,857
Tae Gong-sil. Where are you going?

359
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,483
One moment, please.

360
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,456
That was close.
I could have been so embarrassed.

361
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,001
It would have been awful
if I went in that dress.

362
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,557
Why do I feel so upset?

363
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,523
When your heart isn't being honest,
pain gives you the answer.

364
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,598
Do you need anything else?

365
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:57,892
What?

366
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,937
We'll prepare flowers, champagne
or an orchestra, anything you need.

367
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,522
No.

368
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,026
They must be mistaken.

369
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,283
She must have been rejected by him.

370
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,285
-What was it, then?
-I guess it wasn't an event.

371
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:24,877
You got changed.

372
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,213
Yes, I thought it would be uncomfortable.

373
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,340
You looked pretty, though. Let's go.

374
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,306
It's okay, there's nothing scary here.

375
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,435
There are people
who are scarier than ghosts.

376
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:45,148
They'll wonder what we're doing.
We can't let that happen.

377
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,734
I don't care what they talk about.

378
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,528
It's you I care about,
and you're concerned about what they say.

379
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,449
Gong-sil. Were you upset?

380
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:56,951
Yes.

381
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,830
You looked like Candy
when you ran off before.

382
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,707
You're right.

383
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,625
Think about it.

384
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:08,546
You invited me here, bought me
dinner and clothes. I was just like Candy.

385
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,257
Why didn't you just ask me
to be the radar?

386
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,508
You said it was scary.

387
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,802
I am your shelter.

388
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:21,642
I felt bad about pushing you
to do what you don't want to.

389
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,813
Was that it?

390
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,441
Then I feel a little better.

391
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,276
Let's go get the ghost.

392
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,446
Let's go.

393
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,698
It's okay now.

394
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:36,991
Let go if you can.

395
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,118
I don't care.

396
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,627
They must be expecting an abandoned Candy.

397
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,088
I don't want to be that. Let's go.

398
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:00,890
That was fast.

399
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,267
I asked Gong-sil's closest friends.

400
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,521
Her parents were her real parents
and they got along very well.

401
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,482
I recorded the call.
Do you want to hear it?

402
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,360
Send it to me. Thanks anyway.

403
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,155
Hey!

404
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,332
We totally look like spies.

405
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,042
I always wanted to be in a spy movie.

406
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,627
Aren't you a singer?

407
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,712
I was in a movie, too.

408
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:35,007
Didn't you ever search the Internet
about me? You can find out right away.

409
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,093
Are you going to keep following me?

410
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,179
You don't have a car, right?
I will give you a ride.

411
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,389
Come with me.

412
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,932
I'm going to take the subway.

413
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,310
Anyone can take the subway.
Try taking it if you can.

414
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,065
How dare he?

415
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,489
Gong-sil.

416
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,994
We've been here a while.
Do you see anything?

417
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:07,039
I don't see anything.
Maybe it's in the water.

418
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,667
I should just go inside.

419
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,587
Let's wait a little more.

420
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,840
It could appear when it gets darker.

421
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,551
A shot is scarier before you get it.

422
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:23,556
Ghosts are scarier
before they actually appear, too.

423
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,977
I want to end this
before the fireworks start.

424
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,896
I'll go in and look for it.

425
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,273
Will you be okay?

426
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,692
I'm really scared of water ghosts.

427
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,528
They won't let go
once they get hold of me.

428
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,741
If I don't come out, will you fish me out?

429
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,493
No, don't do it.

430
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,955
Go rest in your room
and watch the fireworks.

431
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,498
What about the ghost?

432
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,169
We should take care of it
while the pool is empty.

433
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,963
We'll drain the water
and dry it for a few days.

434
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,298
Let's go.

435
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,006
You almost fell in.

436
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,844
She's in there. There's a lady in there.

437
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,472
It's so scary.

438
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,693
That must be his house.

439
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,320
I've got you, Kim Dong-su.

440
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,448
I'm going to get my money back
and break you into pieces.

441
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,290
He's married.

442
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,046
You said

443
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,841
you'd break him into pieces.

444
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,033
Sweetie, did you hear about Tae I-ryeong?

445
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:50,619
I don't like her. She can't sing,
and she's supposed to be a singer.

446
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,831
I know. She was pretty when she was young.

447
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,709
But now you can tell
she got plastic surgery.

448
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:57,918
You're right.

449
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,504
Her career's over now.

450
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,925
She can't beat
young singers like IU anymore.

451
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:05,926
It's over for her.

452
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,803
-It's over.
-It's over.

453
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,096
Let's get off at the next station.

454
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,063
Hello, I'm Tae I-ryeong.

455
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,233
It's Tae I-ryeong. Gosh, so pretty!

456
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,861
I'm still very popular.

457
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:28,532
-Thank you.
-Oh, my gosh.

458
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,451
Please keep supporting me!

459
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,911
Can you look over here?

460
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,289
-Tae I-ryeong.
-Look over here.

461
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,210
What? That was fun.

462
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:43,506
You really are a bad singer.

463
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,342
Was I that bad? But I was pretty, right?

464
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:50,805
-You're really weird.
-I know, so I've decided.

465
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,015
You should be my boyfriend.

466
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,602
No.

467
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,858
How can you reject me right away?

468
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,193
Hey!

469
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,113
-It's Tae I-ryeong.
-Wow! It is her.

470
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,118
-I-ryeong, you're so pretty.
-Oh, my gosh!

471
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,870
-Oh, my gosh!
-Wow!

472
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,915
-Tae I-ryeong.
-I-ryeong.

473
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,959
Come on. Take a lot of pictures.

474
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,128
I love you!

475
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,589
The water ghost is a woman?

476
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:07,965
Yes.

477
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,134
She's over there.

478
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,596
Over there?

479
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,723
-Yes.
-What is she doing?

480
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,895
She's fixing her make-up.

481
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,230
Make-up?

482
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,736
Why would a ghost put make-up on?

483
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,280
There's something very strange about that.

484
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:32,990
She's leaving.

485
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,035
Shouldn't she just stay in the water?

486
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,037
Maybe she's not a water ghost.

487
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,414
She's coming this way. Don't come here.

488
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,666
What?

489
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,252
She went that way.

490
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,059
What took so long?

491
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:05,481
She took a shower, went into the sauna
and even knocked before entering.

492
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,400
Are there such polite ghosts, too?

493
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,778
I think she doesn't realize
that she is dead.

494
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,072
Where is she now?

495
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,782
She's going up.

496
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,723
She's sitting on that chair
and having dinner.

497
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,978
She doesn't just stay in the pool?

498
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,858
She's wiping her lips now.

499
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:54,905
She must be leaving.

500
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,658
-Where's she going?
-Come.

501
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,757
She's reading a magazine.

502
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,636
What? Is she doing a tour of the hotel?

503
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,400
She went into that room.

504
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,987
That's the most expensive room
in this hotel.

505
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,532
-Excuse me.
-Yes, sir?

506
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,659
Is someone staying in that room?

507
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:43,078
No, that room is empty.

508
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,082
Open it.

509
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,924
What is she doing in this expensive room?

510
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,181
She's sitting over there and having wine
while admiring the view.

511
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,103
She's acting like someone who is alive.

512
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,815
If she's acting like a person,
what was she doing in the pool?

513
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,943
She doesn't think she's dead,

514
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,781
so maybe she was just trying to swim,
and pushed people who were in her way.

515
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:28,916
Go tell her she's dead
and that she needs to check out.

516
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,417
Go.

517
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:31,669
Okay.

518
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:38,967
Excuse me.

519
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,518
I'm sorry to say this.

520
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,813
But you can't be here like this.

521
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,002
What did she say?

522
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:17,798
She said she won a prize,
so she can be in here.

523
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:21,468
She showed me a voucher
that looks just like mine.

524
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,222
She won a hotel voucher?

525
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:32,604
She's Kang Gil-ja,
who won a voucher to the royal suite.

526
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,442
-Is that her?
-Yes, it is.

527
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:40,654
She's someone I remember
among those who won the prize.

528
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,950
-Hello. Are you Kang Gil-ja?
-Yes.

529
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:46,743
Can I see that?

530
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,871
All right. Please come this way.

531
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,959
It's so nice in here.

532
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,505
I wish I could live in a place like this.

533
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,759
I remember how happy she was
while she stayed here.

534
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:09,183
It's no wonder she couldn't forget
this place after she died.

535
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:10,642
Died?

536
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:15,355
-Who died?
-Kang Gil-ja. She passed away.

537
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:19,109
You're mistaken. She is still alive.

538
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,987
-What?
-Where is she?

539
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,239
I heard she's in a hospital.

540
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,201
Is that possible?

541
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,995
I've never seen anything like that.
I am not sure.

542
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,500
She's fine. Why isn't she getting up?

543
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,126
She's not fine.

544
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,838
She collapsed while preparing food
for your birthday. Don't talk like that!

545
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,548
Why are you shouting?

546
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,134
You're the one
who got drunk and threw a fit.

547
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,554
You always fought with her.
Why are you yelling at me?

548
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,226
Why isn't she getting up?

549
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,355
Gosh.

550
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,485
You shouldn't be staying here like this.

551
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,906
You should go back. You could really die.

552
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,078
She doesn't seem to want to go back.

553
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,585
What was her daughter's name?

554
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,003
Ju-yeon.

555
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,505
Ju-yeon...

556
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,009
She's responding.

557
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,973
Lee Ju-yeon's mother.
You can't stay here like this.

558
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,767
Your family is waiting.

559
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,186
You have to go live.

560
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:41,817
Do you want to go?

561
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,153
That's a good decision.

562
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:46,572
Yes.

563
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,701
Watching her do that
doesn't feel weird anymore.

564
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,372
-Okay.
-Okay?

565
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,458
Things must be working out.

566
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,795
She's going to go back.

567
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,760
She just wants to watch
the fireworks tonight.

568
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:12,139
I'll go watch it at the pool with her.

569
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:16,935
She already got changed.

570
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,522
-I'll be back.
-Gong-sil.

571
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,900
Even the ghost got dressed up for it.

572
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:26,820
You should, too.

573
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:32,492
It's her last time.
Shall I go enjoy it with her?

574
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,797
She's really excited.

575
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,468
I haven't seen fireworks in a while.
It should be so pretty.

576
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,639
Excuse me, wait for me.

577
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:03,231
People are watching.
Pretend you're talking to me.

578
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,153
Shall we go?

579
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:55,158
It was such a nice dream.

580
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:00,080
But I should wake up now.

581
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:31,862
Mom!

582
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,322
Honey!

583
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:38,076
-Are you okay?
-Are you awake?

584
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,663
Can you see me? I can't believe it.

585
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:46,293
I will be good from now on.
Thank you so much, Mom.

586
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,380
Thank you.

587
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,924
Thank you so much.

588
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,023
Is Kang Gil-ja happy?

589
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,569
Yes, she's really happy.

590
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,788
She said it is like
a midsummer night's dream.

591
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:29,711
She feels like she had a dream
that made her dizzy.

592
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:39,596
She said this was exciting and joyful...

593
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,349
But it hurt, too.

594
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,310
Because it was so good to be here.

595
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,666
She's gone.

596
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,795
-Since when?
-Just now.

597
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:17,259
I can't see them,
so I just have to trust you, right?

598
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:19,970
Yes.

599
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,598
The fireworks are over.

600
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:29,771
Today, I woke someone
from a really good dream.

601
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,205
"Tae I-ryeong's surprise subway show"?

602
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,416
TAE I-RYEONG
GAINS POPULARITY AMONG CITIZENS

603
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,515
I didn't know he'd be married.

604
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,493
My money...

605
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:54,064
Hey! Kiss.

606
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,621
You have a business trip.

607
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,123
-How long will it be?
-A week.

608
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,335
A week? That's pretty long.

609
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,546
-Should I tell her?
-She already knows.

610
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,593
But she seems fine.

611
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,679
This is what she said.

612
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:33,061
Mr. Joo is like a voucher
to a really nice hotel.

613
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:35,397
It's a stroke of good luck.

614
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,817
But it's not a place
where I can stay a long time.

615
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:43,029
In order to live normally when I get out,
I have to get used to living without it.

616
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:52,956
So what she said before wasn't her words,
but Kang Gil-ja's hotel review.

617
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,792
I shouldn't have been concerned.

618
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,294
Do you feel bad?

619
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,296
Not at all.

620
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,551
She said she doesn't need me.
I actually feel less burdened.

621
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:09,848
"When your heart isn't being honest,
pain gives you the answer."

622
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,143
That's what Ms. Tae said.

623
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,771
And she said she found the answer.

624
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:24,946
"When your heart isn't being honest,
pain gives you the answer."

625
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,283
I used to hear that a lot from someone.

626
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:30,702
Who?

627
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:36,207
Cha Hui-ju.

628
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:47,802
When your heart isn't being honest,
pain gives you the answer.

629
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,644
Are you saying I should be in pain?

630
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,021
Yes.

631
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:03,651
You like me more,
so it's only natural that you hurt more.

632
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,490
So I have to be in pain to like you?

633
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,407
Yes.

634
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:14,037
I want you to be in a lot of pain,
Jung-won.

635
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,044
Those words... Where did you hear that?

636
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,712
Did you hear it from Hui-ju?

637
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,882
I didn't see Hui-ju.

638
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:29,552
How do you know
what Hui-ju used to say, then?

639
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,932
I heard it from Kang Woo.

640
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,815
Bring me Mr. Kang's résumé again.

641
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:42,857
Yes, sir.

642
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:44,818
Mr. Joo.

643
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:49,489
I went to Cha Hui-ju's orphanage
to give them our fund

644
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,866
and saw Mr. Kang there.

645
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:03,044
Mr. Kang had an impressive résumé.
He was recommended to me.

646
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,504
Is there something wrong?

647
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,090
Who recommended him?

648
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,843
Well...

649
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,303
Was it my father?

650
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:16,433
Did you know?

651
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,603
He told me not to tell you.

652
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:24,441
I didn't think you'd like it,
so I decided not to tell you.

653
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,651
I was being considerate to both sides.

654
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:33,491
Don't do that in the future.
Take a side and be clear about it.

655
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,440
So, my father sent you.

656
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:10,195
I was ordered to keep an eye
on people around you.

657
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:11,738
Why?

658
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:15,116
He said someone related
to Cha Hui-ju could approach you.

659
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:16,451
Why?

660
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:21,623
He thinks someone
around Cha Hui-ju was the kidnapper.

661
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:26,127
He thinks that Cha Hui-ju
was an accomplice, not the victim.

662
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,547
Is he right?

663
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,892
Did you really not see the kidnappers?

664
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:44,771
You should give me an honest answer first.

665
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:49,442
Did you really pay my ransom?

666
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:54,072
Do you think Hui-ju died
because I didn't pay it?

667
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,365
If that isn't the case,

668
00:58:56,616 --> 00:59:00,286
why are you worried
that I saw the kidnappers?

669
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:04,999
Believe what you want to.

670
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:09,796
You can also believe what you want to.

671
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:24,102
Tell him to come explain

672
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:27,063
why he's curious about it after 15 years.

673
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,024
One more thing.

674
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,610
He told me to believe what I want.

675
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:38,491
Tell him I believe the lost necklace
would not be found with him.

676
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,911
Tell him I'm looking for it,

677
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:47,041
and that I really hope
I don't find it with him.

678
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,902
I wonder what Woo
has to do with Cha Hui-ju.

679
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,377
Cha Hui-ju.

680
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,294
What's wrong? What is it?

681
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:19,008
Cha Hui-ju was here.

682
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:31,729
She told me.

683
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:35,024
She told me why she's an evil bitch.

684
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:42,699
I thought you'd find out one day
since you can see her.

685
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,577
She was one of the culprits.

686
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:54,585
Who was it? Who was she working with?

687
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,133
She said she can't tell me.

688
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,093
What?

689
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:08,558
She said she has to protect that person.

690
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:15,773
Okay.

691
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:29,579
I want you to be in a lot of pain,
Jung-won.

692
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,342
Gong-sil.

693
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:49,891
Don't go.

694
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,517
Stay here.

695
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:58,024
I don't want her to see me like this.

696
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,693
You can see her.

697
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:05,364
