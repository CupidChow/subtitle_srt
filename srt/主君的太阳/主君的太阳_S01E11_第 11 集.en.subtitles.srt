1
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:20,478
Gong-sil. I think I love you.

2
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,733
What will you do now?

3
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,241
You said you're getting married,
then you told me to be Candy.

4
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:34,826
And now you say you love me?

5
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,619
Are you kidding me?

6
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,790
I broke up an expensive marriage,
and I said a cheesy line to bring you out.

7
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,833
Do I look like I'm joking?

8
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,294
You're scaring me, Mr. Joo.

9
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,046
When you first sprung at me,
saying you see ghosts,

10
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,507
I thought you were joking
and was scared, too.

11
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,342
I understand how you feel.

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,679
But I accepted it. You should, too.

13
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,268
If I accept it, will things change?

14
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:04,189
You don't seem to get it.
Let me give you an example.

15
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,235
If you ask me to sleep with you
holding your hand,

16
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,489
I am going to enjoy it.

17
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,325
Are you doing this
to stop me from touching you?

18
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:20,497
I really don't touch you
because I enjoy it.

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,583
You know I do it because I need to.

20
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:27,128
You have a clear reason.
But I don't have one anymore.

21
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,715
I wondered why I kept you by my side
even though I gain nothing.

22
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,384
It was...

23
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,722
because I like you.

24
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,980
I tried to get married to keep
some distance between us

25
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,108
because I thought I might
exert power over you,

26
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,360
and I thought about
turning you into Candy.

27
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,861
But you refused.

28
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,739
I did my best.
I'm going to do as I wish now.

29
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,160
From now on, how you react to that
is up to you.

30
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,495
You deal with it.

31
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,541
I don't understand.

32
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,795
If you like me,
shouldn't you want me to fall for you?

33
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,382
Does this look like
I'm trying to seduce you?

34
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,719
I'm warning you not to fall for me
even if I seduce you.

35
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,348
Then you should not try to seduce me.

36
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,935
Hold on, I'm having a conversation.

37
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,145
Come back later.

38
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,690
So, you're saying that you like me,

39
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,651
but you don't want me to like you back.

40
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,987
Hold on. We're having
a serious conversation.

41
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,447
What? I have no time to...

42
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,365
My gosh.

43
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,207
I missed you while I was away
and I was worried about you.

44
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,502
I felt foolish looking at my phone
waiting for you to call me,

45
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,546
so I just turned it off.

46
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,591
What am I supposed to do
if you act like this?

47
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,222
This is what you should deal with.

48
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,558
You said that you will be okay.

49
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,351
I trust you.

50
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,610
Telling you makes me feel better.

51
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,028
Let's go now.

52
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:22,911
Tae Gong-sil said Mr. Joo
is her one and only special person.

53
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,496
That's what she said.

54
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,876
And Mr. Joo broke off his engagement
to come get her.

55
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,588
You can't get between them.

56
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,800
-I see.
-If you know, you should stop liking her.

57
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:43,765
That's for me to decide.
You should stop liking me, too.

58
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,852
I thought you were just bored,
so I ignored it until now.

59
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,147
If you're serious, you should stop.

60
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,692
I'm not serious.

61
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,154
I don't do serious shows.
I only do entertainment shows.

62
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:02,325
Following you around
was like being on Running Man.

63
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,536
I'm not giving up because you tell me to.

64
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,164
-I'm giving up because I'm fed up.
-That's a relief.

65
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,834
You were with your friends.
You should go inside.

66
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,469
Even Yoo Jae-suk thanked me
for coming on his show.

67
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,347
Who is he to tell me to stop?

68
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,399
Maybe you're slightly attracted to me
because I kept touching you?

69
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,901
That wouldn't make me like you like this.

70
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,862
You did touch me a lot,

71
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,700
but that didn't really
affect me like that.

72
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,329
In any case, I guess I was possessed
by your special powers.

73
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,250
Are we going to hold hands
and go on a date?

74
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,168
Do you want to go anywhere?

75
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:59,173
There are a lot of places,
but I'm scared of the night.

76
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:05,388
But I guess I could go anywhere
if I'm holding your hand like this.

77
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,807
That's the kind of man I am to you.

78
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:12,687
I could go to the night market
and watch a late-night movie.

79
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,605
I can go see night views, too.

80
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:19,610
I once went to see the night view,
but there were too many ghosts.

81
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,987
So I couldn't see anything.

82
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,949
If you like going up to high places,
would you like to ride my plane?

83
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,286
Are you going to go anywhere with me?

84
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,789
I will stay by your side today,
since I am enjoying this.

85
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,793
Where should we go?

86
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,421
Namdaemun? Dongdaemun?

87
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,090
The sea? My gosh.

88
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,675
Hold on.

89
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,054
The beach?

90
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,388
Yes, Mr. Kim.

91
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,348
Yes.

92
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,808
The movie theaters?

93
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:51,893
Okay.

94
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,979
I've made up my mind.

95
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,107
Tae Gong-sil,
just come along with me today.

96
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,776
Where?

97
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,361
It will be the place

98
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,406
where the richest people in Korea gather.

99
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,162
Oh, my gosh.

100
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,665
We should get you some clothes first.

101
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,251
You should dress in black
so you look luxurious.

102
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,753
Really?

103
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,719
The chairman of Giant Group passed away.

104
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,889
The president of Giant Mall
is the chief mourner.

105
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,770
You didn't have to tell me you love me
to bring me here.

106
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,192
It was just really bad timing, that's all.

107
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,945
I don't believe you.
I'm putting up my radar.

108
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,618
Lee Yong-jae, chairman of Giant Group,

109
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:55,081
passed away in his Cheongpyeong
vacation home this morning.

110
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:59,210
Lee Yong-jae was a frugal man,

111
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:02,088
so the funeral will be held quietly
with just his family attending.

112
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:08,010
He sent away his wife and son
at the last moment

113
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,805
and was with his mistress
at his vacation home.

114
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,893
He was famous for being
a family man and a clean person.

115
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,397
He really betrayed his family in the end.

116
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,609
Everyone is nervous that the woman
might come to the funeral.

117
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,446
The son is the president of Giant Mall.

118
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,574
He was so shocked that he didn't even cry.

119
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,793
He is the president of Giant Mall.

120
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,425
Wow.

121
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,219
Do you see something?

122
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,263
He's handsome.

123
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:58,102
You talked so badly about him
that I thought he would look nasty.

124
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,896
But he's handsome.

125
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,026
We're on a date.
How can you look at another man?

126
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,612
Put up your radar and look for ghosts.

127
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,365
Don't touch me when I have my radar up.

128
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,744
And I'm paid by each case.

129
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,039
If I get a rich ghost,
you should pay me a lot.

130
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,252
-It's been a long time, Mr. Joo.
-Hello.

131
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,129
Is she with you?

132
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,759
-She's my girlfriend.
-Oh, really?

133
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,970
You should bring her
to our foundation day party, too.

134
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,014
Of course.

135
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,310
What are you doing?

136
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,563
Your rich friends are here.
How can you say that?

137
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,983
You'll be upset if I don't do
what I did in front of your friends here.

138
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,903
Can you sense anything?

139
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,406
Not yet. I'll go look.

140
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,619
I keep detecting something I can't handle.

141
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,273
Mr. Lee.

142
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,125
I met him.

143
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,544
Who?

144
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,131
That man over there.
It's the chairman, right?

145
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,260
-Yes.
-He asked me a favor.

146
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,803
You should go rest.

147
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,764
There's something his son
cannot find out about.

148
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,017
He wants me to get rid of it.

149
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,699
Father!

150
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,619
Father!

151
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,621
Father!

152
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,863
You fooled us all your life.

153
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,408
But you got caught in the end, Father.

154
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:06,624
He spent his last moments
with the woman he loved

155
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,833
and hid all his life.

156
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,127
He wants me to get rid of her things.

157
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,838
I don't want to get involved in it.

158
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,178
It would have been nice if he had left
some business secret behind.

159
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:23,516
The president of Giant Mall
didn't even cry. He didn't look so good.

160
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:28,020
He must be shocked that his father
died in the arms of his mistress.

161
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,440
My father is always
in his mistresses' arms.

162
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:38,030
If the woman appears,
the inheritance will be complicated.

163
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:44,161
Let's let the woman appear
and blow up a nuclear bomb in his face.

164
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,289
He seems like a nice person.
We should stop that.

165
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,583
Whose side are you on?

166
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,837
Let's leave together tomorrow afternoon.

167
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,632
The vacation home
takes about two hours from here.

168
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,008
We can get back before it gets dark.

169
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,010
My vacation home is in Yangpyeong.

170
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,178
Are you boasting?

171
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,806
The chairman's vacation home
is in Cheongpyeong.

172
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,184
I don't have any intention of going
and removing the nuclear bomb.

173
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:11,230
If you want to go to Yangpyeong,
we could leave right away.

174
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,233
Yangpyeong? Isn't it really nice there?

175
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,611
What are you talking about? No way!

176
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,073
Don't worry, Gong-sil.

177
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,951
I can go and just hold your hand
all night long.

178
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:28,122
I believed you. I'm upset
that you're not believing me.

179
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,959
Where are you going?

180
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,420
I can't go to Yangpyeong with you.

181
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,672
We're not going there.
We both have to go home.

182
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,633
What are you thinking?
I'll drive you home.

183
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,928
Why are you confusing me?
Are you making fun of me?

184
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,349
I'm playing along with your ghost games.

185
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,852
You and I live in different worlds,

186
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,354
and the ghost games aren't that fun.

187
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,564
But I want to play along...

188
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,317
because I like you.

189
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:03,741
If you're not scared of ghosts anymore
and can play alone,

190
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,286
then I'll send you home.

191
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,915
You said there will be an end to this.

192
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,042
That is up to you.

193
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,503
Of course.

194
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,796
We should end this someday.

195
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,927
Let's not become like the wolf and goat.

196
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,847
What happens to them?

197
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,935
There's a storybook, too.
You should read it if you can.

198
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,938
Are you looking down on me
because I can't read?

199
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,774
If you act like that,
I'm going to Yangpyeong.

200
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,611
Fine, why not?

201
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,988
I don't intend to just hold your hand.

202
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,538
You want to play my games
and return to your world.

203
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,582
I understand what you mean.

204
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,877
Right now, you just have to take me home.

205
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,839
Ghosts might follow me
from the funeral hall.

206
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:02,967
Okay.

207
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,010
But just in case...

208
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,105
Jung-won broke off his engagement again.

209
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,233
I wanted to get it done with
while you were here,

210
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,193
but he broke it off.

211
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:22,987
How many has it been?

212
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,573
Three? Four?

213
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,284
It's the fourth.

214
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,328
They will say it's the curse
of the dead girl again.

215
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:37,084
Do you think Jung-won is doing this
because of Cha Hui-ju?

216
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,963
This time it's not.
There's someone called Bang-sil.

217
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,507
It's not Bang-sil. It's Tae Gong-sil.

218
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,636
Tae Gong-sil has the ability
to see dead people

219
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,805
and said she saw Cha Hui-ju's ghost.

220
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,518
And my son believes that groundless story?

221
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,645
Yes, so he will not think...

222
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,817
that Cha Hui-ju is alive.

223
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,945
What do you think?

224
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,490
You watched her from close by.

225
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,370
I believe Tae Gong-sil, too.

226
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,541
Tae Gong-sil...

227
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,086
Good night.

228
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,758
What is the title of the book
about the wolf and goat?

229
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:26,842
The book?

230
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,386
There's an animation.
You should watch that.

231
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,100
The book has a gloomy ending.

232
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,728
You can't read books, anyway.

233
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,605
I won't ask you to read it for me.

234
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,608
I have been thinking...

235
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:47,613
I felt upset when you said
you'll just have fun with me.

236
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,867
People say that I seem ominous and dark
when I talk about ghosts.

237
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,160
I guess it's better than that.

238
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,581
So, let's have fun while we are together.

239
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,751
Good night.

240
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,549
Okay.

241
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,386
Let's have fun together.

242
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,391
Then the wolf and goat will go back

243
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,643
to each of their homes.

244
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,896
EUNHA DORMITORY

245
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,249
Right, they used to be full all the time.

246
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,209
Who has been emptying them?

247
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,295
-That's strange.
-Gong-sil.

248
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,339
Woo.

249
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,092
You left so suddenly. Are you okay?

250
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,469
What's with the clothes?
Did you go to a funeral?

251
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,595
Yes.

252
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,807
It's kind of a spy outfit.

253
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,227
Did Mr. Joo take you and use you?

254
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,603
What?

255
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:05,524
Mr. Joo said he keeps you by his side
to make use of you.

256
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,860
Is it true?

257
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,696
He does use me.

258
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,951
But we're close,
so we decided to have fun together.

259
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,165
I heard he broke off his engagement
because of you.

260
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,002
Did he say that
he will only have eyes for you?

261
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,174
Woo.

262
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:35,012
You said that when your heart isn't being
honest, pain gives you the answer.

263
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,973
He says his heart was being honest.

264
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,475
But I guess

265
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,811
I have to handle pain.

266
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,691
You should go upstairs.

267
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,527
Your clothes look uncomfortable.
I'll do this.

268
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,490
Were you the one who always emptied out
the trash when it got full?

269
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,909
I should be honest about this.

270
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,952
Yes, it was me.

271
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,412
Every time?

272
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,374
I've wronged you.

273
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,211
I said I liked you.

274
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,633
Let's do it together, then.

275
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,762
Gong-sil.

276
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,017
Did you really see Cha Hui-ju?

277
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,311
Yes.

278
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,446
How can you drive like that?

279
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,868
I must have startled you. I am sorry.

280
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,162
You appeared out of nowhere.

281
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,039
Are you okay?

282
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,499
I am sorry.

283
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,920
I used to live in the UK. I haven't gotten
used to driving on the opposite side.

284
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,256
-Are you okay?
-We're okay.

285
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,676
I saw you once before.
Are you from the UK?

286
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:56,844
Yes.

287
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:00,639
I've seen you take walks together.

288
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,058
I wanted to get to know you
since you looked so good together.

289
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,395
Let's have tea together some time.

290
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:07,729
Sure.

291
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,703
She's Joo Jung-won's aunt, right?

292
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,012
I have never been in this room before.

293
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,891
We should clean it
before his son comes, right?

294
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,060
Have you ever seen Mr. Lee's mistress?

295
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,356
I knew he sometimes smelled of a woman,

296
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,026
but I didn't know he brought her here.

297
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:02,367
Don't touch my things!

298
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,664
Why do I suddenly feel a chill?

299
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:13,670
The late Mr. Lee wouldn't like us
touching his things.

300
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,758
Let's leave this until his son
comes to clean it up.

301
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,555
The funeral was only a few days ago,

302
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:10,102
but there's a rumor going around
that Mr. Lee died

303
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,063
in his secret mistress' arms.

304
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,817
Giant Mall's president
must be having a hard time.

305
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:21,280
He will be here soon to talk about
the car entrance to Kingdom.

306
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,451
-Okay.
-Ms. Tae wants to meet him, too.

307
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,708
The chairman hasn't appeared since then.

308
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,628
I thought he might be next to his son.

309
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:40,340
Do you go and visit the ghosts
yourself now?

310
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,092
Aren't you scared?

311
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,722
He wasn't scary. He looked sad.

312
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,560
I smelled a very strong scent
when I saw him.

313
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,521
I thought it was perfume,
so I looked for what it was.

314
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,647
This was it.

315
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,360
The scent of the woman
that the chairman misses.

316
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:06,658
If he smells it on me,
maybe he will talk to me.

317
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,539
Are you trying to seduce a ghost?

318
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,335
I said I'm popular among ghosts
even if I don't try.

319
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:17,753
Right?

320
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,932
Were you having coffee
with your fellow ghosts?

321
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,561
One of them really likes coffee.

322
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,272
But he brought someone with him.

323
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,358
Is it the guy from the trash can?

324
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,530
He doesn't move from there.
He doesn't really talk to me, either.

325
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,531
Really?

326
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,285
So you're not close to that ghost.

327
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,888
Is she not wearing it,
or did she not find out about it?

328
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,726
Did she not like it
because I threw it away?

329
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,154
The president of Giant Mall will be here
soon. You should go to the meeting room.

330
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:27,823
Sure.

331
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,117
Are you that bothered?

332
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,994
I confessed everything, so I shouldn't be.

333
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,454
But I am.

334
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,999
You're talking about
the car entrance to Kingdom, right?

335
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,377
No. Never mind.

336
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,422
Mr. Kim. Go get me a book.

337
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,423
A book?

338
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:50,178
Are you going to try to read it yourself?

339
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,147
Mr. Joo, when are you
going to see the chairman?

340
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,023
He's at Kingdom Hotel.

341
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,694
I'm always at Kingdom.
He can come see me anytime.

342
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,406
You know he's not the man
to come and explain things to you.

343
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:13,493
He also knows I'm not the kind
to go and explain things to him.

344
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,787
They're so alike.
They won't be able to meet again.

345
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,581
-Mr. Kim.
-Right.

346
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,667
The president of Giant Mall is coming.

347
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,630
It's the chairman's son.

348
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,304
Excuse me.

349
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,102
The president of Giant Mall
stopped because of Ms. Tae.

350
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,771
He's talking to her.

351
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,691
It's a unique scent. What perfume is it?

352
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,445
I can't remember the name.

353
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,156
But I can show you the bottle.

354
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,325
Please do so.

355
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,410
Come with me.

356
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,998
They're going somewhere.
That's not the meeting room.

357
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,877
They must be going to Ms. Tae's office.

358
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,172
Why is he following a woman
that he has only just met?

359
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,924
Maybe she said something is with him.

360
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,342
There should be something.

361
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,470
That thing asked her to go somewhere.

362
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,597
Where is that?

363
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,102
Giant Group president's vacation home
in Cheongpyeong.

364
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,022
So she wanted to meet him

365
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,525
because she wanted to know where it is.

366
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,945
Then they will probably go together.

367
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:37,869
The wife of the president
is not with him right now.

368
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:42,040
He must be sad after his father's
death. Ms. Tae should be of some help.

369
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:49,297
Cheongpyeong is a great place
to fill the heart under the sun.

370
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,885
Isn't it your role to go with her
when this happens?

371
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,973
You can't let her go alone with him.

372
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,895
I really didn't want to go.

373
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:07,065
But I guess I have no choice.

374
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,741
This is it.

375
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,454
This is the scent.

376
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,749
It's the scent you smelled
on the chairman, right?

377
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,334
Do you know my father?

378
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,337
I met him once.

379
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,298
Are you...

380
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,258
the one?

381
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,555
My mother doesn't use perfume.

382
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,809
I sometimes smelled
another woman's perfume on him.

383
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,186
But I trusted him.

384
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,231
It's not me.

385
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:50,859
That's a relief.

386
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,363
If it was someone so young,
I would have hated my father even more.

387
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,538
He must hate him a lot.

388
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,543
I didn't ask where
the Cheongpyeong home is.

389
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,133
Let's go to Cheongpyeong.
I'll come with you.

390
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,385
You said you wanted the nuclear bomb
to blow in his face.

391
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,929
No, I met the chairman a few times.

392
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,640
We should hide his secret for him.

393
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,144
Let's go.

394
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,111
Why do you need my big mouth again?

395
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,784
The rumor about Tae Gong-sil and Mr. Joo
has already spread thanks to you.

396
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:45,622
This time, I need your ears,
not your mouth.

397
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,541
My ears? What do you want to hear?

398
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,253
Tae Gong-sil got into Hankook University
but didn't graduate.

399
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,548
She got in an accident
and quit right before graduation.

400
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,634
I heard that's when she became like this.

401
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:02,097
You should find out
what kind of accident it was.

402
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:03,848
Why?

403
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,852
I think Mr. Joo has fallen for her now.

404
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:12,399
But if she's not healthy,
he won't be able to marry her.

405
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,984
So I want to find out in advance.

406
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,906
I've become pretty close to her.
I feel kind of guilty.

407
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,621
Who's the big mouth that works for Mr. Do?

408
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,458
I don't think it's our team.
I think it's the PR team.

409
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,127
Really?

410
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,628
There's a rumor

411
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,382
that the big mouth
is asking about her past.

412
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,217
What about Gong-sil's past?

413
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,011
I heard there was an accident.
When was it?

414
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,557
Seven years ago.

415
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,475
Seven years. It's been a long time.

416
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,477
It's been four years
since she got out of the hospital.

417
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,771
She was hospitalized for three years.

418
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,566
It must have been a bad accident.
Was it a traffic accident?

419
00:28:54,649 --> 00:29:00,321
My heart still beats really fast
when I think about that accident.

420
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,615
I don't want to talk about it.

421
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,537
You must have been so worried about her.

422
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,956
Do you want to have dinner tonight?

423
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:10,915
Dinner?

424
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,585
Since you said your heart beats so fast,

425
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,337
I thought I might buy you
some grilled chicken heart.

426
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,008
Shall we? I love grilled chicken heart.

427
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,594
-Okay.
-Okay.

428
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,929
Thank you.

429
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,393
I think it will be easy to make her talk.

430
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,522
But why do I feel like
I'll be opening up old wounds?

431
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,899
Get a hold of yourself.

432
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:43,281
The president of Giant Mall
was preoccupied during the meeting.

433
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,199
And thanks to that,

434
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,994
the car entrance issue
will be settled favorably for us.

435
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,663
He must feel betrayed by his father.

436
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,165
He said he hates him.

437
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:55,960
If he got used to it since he was young,
he could have just ignored it.

438
00:29:56,753 --> 00:30:00,298
Don't you like your father, Mr. Joo?

439
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,512
We don't like each other.

440
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,557
Anyway, can we just go into that home?

441
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,061
I don't want to go to jail again
for breaking and entering.

442
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,481
He asked me to go,
so he'll be waiting for me.

443
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,899
He'll let us in.

444
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:30,787
This is the room.

445
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,338
He's over there.

446
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,342
Excuse me.

447
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:51,766
He wants me to delete the photo of her
from the camera.

448
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,073
Is this it?

449
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,451
He told me not to let anyone see it.

450
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,205
I don't want to see it either.
Delete it so we can leave.

451
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,331
Okay.

452
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,048
Did you take these yourself?

453
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,718
They're so good. They're pretty.

454
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,178
We left the room as it is.

455
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,228
I'll take care of the things in here.

456
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,357
I'm going to burn everything in here.
Please start the incinerator.

457
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,275
Yes, sir.

458
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:17,977
What do we do?

459
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,605
There's nowhere to go or anywhere to hide.

460
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,231
I have to erase this.

461
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,442
You can't erase it now.

462
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:28,363
If we get caught, we need this
to explain why we're here.

463
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,406
He doesn't want his son to see it.

464
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,660
We can only get out of here
if we show it to him.

465
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,056
Yes?

466
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,766
It's Joo Jung-won of Kingdom.

467
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,102
Mr. Joo Jung-won?

468
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:05,608
I called because our discussions today
were too favorable to us.

469
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,569
We realized we made a mistake
after the meeting.

470
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,488
Thank you for calling.

471
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:14,742
Then let's discuss things again
and take your needs into consideration.

472
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,536
Come to Kingdom right now.

473
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,662
Well...

474
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,123
I'm in Cheongpyeong right now.

475
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,290
Come right now,

476
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,127
before I change my mind.

477
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,589
All right. I'll be right there.

478
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,772
He's gone.

479
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:50,069
Of course. You don't know
how much I just gave up.

480
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,741
I think Mr. Lee is grateful to you.

481
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,702
Give it to me. I will erase it.

482
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,455
He said I can't show it to anyone.

483
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,040
Then hurry. I don't want to see it either.

484
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:10,339
I guess hiding the woman
is important to the chairman.

485
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,675
Doesn't he think about his son at all?

486
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:18,056
He was so out of it
that he made a wrong business decision.

487
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,974
He shouldn't be trying to hide the woman.

488
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:26,522
Shouldn't he be asking you
to tell his son that he is sorry?

489
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,236
If he was...

490
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,865
going to end things like this,

491
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,910
he should have let his son get used to it.

492
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,370
He hid it so well

493
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,999
that he ended up giving
a huge shock to his son.

494
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,256
I think this is the woman.

495
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,898
Was she the one?

496
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,028
Just delete it so we can go.

497
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,197
Mr. Joo.

498
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,495
Mr. Lee wants me to show this to you.

499
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,747
-Tell him it's fine.
-But...

500
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:30,211
He wants to know
how his son would feel if he saw it.

501
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,839
He wants you to look at it and tell you.

502
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:33,965
Me?

503
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,052
I'm used to seeing my father with women.

504
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,722
I am used to all ages and nationalities.
I won't be shocked.

505
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,665
CHAIRMAN LEE YONG-JAE OF GIANT GROUP
PASSES AWAY

506
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,083
Hypocrite.

507
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,593
Yes, Mr. Joo. I am on my way.

508
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,553
Come back.

509
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:27,226
I am in the room your father passed away
in your Cheongpyeong home.

510
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,145
What?

511
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,152
What are you doing here?

512
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,363
You...

513
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,326
You denied it. So it was you?

514
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,412
Were you my father's woman?

515
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,372
Get a hold of yourself.

516
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,708
She is mine.

517
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,002
The woman your father hid...

518
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:55,838
is this one.

519
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,509
Are you trying to threaten me...

520
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,262
with this photo?

521
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:07,975
I want Giant Mall
to move away from my mall.

522
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,727
Can you do that?

523
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:13,481
Whatever my father left,
that's my father's problem.

524
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,985
I might be shocked,
but I won't be affected by it.

525
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,863
I might hate my father,

526
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,116
but I won't let others attack him.

527
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,201
Then...

528
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,411
take a look.

529
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:30,957
Mr. Lee.

530
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,085
Don't try to protect your son.

531
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:37,964
It would be better
to let your son protect you.

532
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,474
This is the only photo
that is left of her.

533
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,271
It's the woman that your father hid
all his life.

534
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,590
He said...

535
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:26,178
it was a woman
that he could not show to anyone.

536
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,894
He had so much to protect.

537
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,898
So he had to hide his real soul.

538
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,283
The scent you smelled on your father...

539
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:51,037
probably was the scent
of your father's real soul.

540
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,007
He wanted to take a portrait photo of her

541
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,677
before he passed away.

542
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:12,391
He was going to have a funeral for her
but suddenly collapsed.

543
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,227
He knew you would be shocked,

544
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,730
so he wanted to hide it.

545
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,827
I have to keep protecting...

546
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,456
what my father protected.

547
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,899
This poor woman.

548
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,530
I will hold a funeral for her.

549
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,974
My father is leaving tomorrow morning?

550
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,977
Does he have no intention
of coming to see me?

551
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,062
He is waiting for you to come.

552
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:43,107
He has not come
to explain about the necklace.

553
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,528
Do you think it's because he has it?

554
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:52,491
Maybe he's trying to hide something
to protect his son.

555
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,873
Mr. Kang told your father about Ms. Tae.

556
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:04,044
He's worried that you are being fooled
by her stories.

557
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,964
If you don't go talk to him,
he might get Mr. Kang...

558
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,217
to bring Ms. Tae to him.

559
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,189
Why is he here again?

560
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,317
I told him I won't renegotiate
the car entrance matter with him.

561
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:30,237
He's holding flowers.
I don't think he's here for you.

562
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,783
Once they feel Ms. Tae's warm heart,
they keep coming back.

563
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,704
That bouquet is really big.

564
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,043
Has he nothing to do?
Why didn't he have it delivered?

565
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,838
But she will be happier
if he gives it in person.

566
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,342
And he can check for sure
if the flowers were delivered.

567
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:03,187
Tell me clearly if she got it or not.

568
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:24,458
If she took it,
please turn the lid for me.

569
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,714
She did take it.

570
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,259
Okay.

571
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,137
Did she like it?

572
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,392
I guess not.

573
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,648
Did she like it that much?

574
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:54,071
I would have seen her surprised face
if I had given it to her myself.

575
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,577
I've decided not to do such things.

576
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:02,955
I won't.

577
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,316
Ms. Tae is very special to Mr. Joo.

578
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,193
Is there a reason
she must stay at Kingdom?

579
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,111
Yes.

580
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,823
She's like the sun for Mr. Joo.

581
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:42,369
I will let her know you're grateful.

582
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,704
That's a shame.

583
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,126
Right.

584
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,754
Please tell this to Mr. Joo.

585
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,798
I have a telescope, too.

586
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,807
You should have some.

587
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:05,768
Yes.

588
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:11,106
So that is why Mr. Kim and Mr. Park
got into a fight.

589
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,400
Shall I explain what happened to them?

590
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,652
Okay.

591
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,445
What?

592
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,740
Mr. Kim of the car park
lost his things where?

593
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:21,784
In the parking lot?

594
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:25,412
Behind the shopping cart? Okay.

595
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,415
I'll find it for him. Yes.

596
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,000
And...

597
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,752
Oh, my gosh!

598
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,214
Please don't come so close to me.
You really startled me.

599
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,634
If you keep doing this,
I'm going to bring Mr. Joo.

600
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,137
You all know what happens
when I touch him, right?

601
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:57,236
Ms. Tae hasn't been going
to Mr. Joo's room lately.

602
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,570
That's a relief.

603
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,369
Have you come to shop?

604
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,287
Yes. Are you here to shop as well?

605
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:11,375
My nephew is the president of Kingdom,
and my husband is the vice president here.

606
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,168
Oh, I see.

607
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,629
You're not married, are you?

608
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,590
No. All I did was work.

609
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,967
I see.

610
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:24,471
Let's have dinner at my place. My nephew
lives in the same apartment, too.

611
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:26,765
All right, thank you.

612
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,274
She seems pretty decent.

613
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,819
I forgot to ask her name.

614
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,831
It's been a long time, Joo Jung-won.

615
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,135
Mr. Joo is here.

616
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,431
I'm here.

617
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,601
I didn't think you would come.

618
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:15,105
I am sure I won't be affected
by your answer.

619
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,319
If you want to hear my answer,
you should talk to me first.

620
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:21,820
Sure.

621
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,032
Hui-ju was the culprit.

622
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,868
I was totally fooled by her.

623
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,955
And I told her
about Mother's necklace, too.

624
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,542
I gave the necklace as the ransom,
as they asked.

625
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,295
I believed Hui-ju
when she came to get the ransom.

626
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,006
I had to save you.

627
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,925
So I gave it to her.

628
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,888
So both of us were totally fooled by her.

629
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,390
The statute of limitations
will end very soon.

630
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,019
That incident will be completely deleted
from my life.

631
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,313
Jung-won.

632
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,900
You still can't read
because of that, right?

633
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,320
Do you think you can end things?

634
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,404
I don't read.

635
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,491
But...

636
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,119
there is something
that I would like to read.

637
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:14,540
I came here because there's something
I want to show you.

638
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,877
You could be affected if you see this.

639
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,921
Can you handle it?

640
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,424
Is it about Hui-ju?

641
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:29,263
Yes, if you don't want to see it,
I'll leave it with Kang Woo instead.

642
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,103
You can decide whether to look at it.

643
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:39,273
If you do,
Kang Woo will explain all about it.

644
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:41,775
You should go now.

645
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,869
Father, you didn't tell me
about the ransom.

646
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:58,458
Were you trying to make me
blame you instead of myself?

647
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,711
Believe what you want.

648
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:06,091
Did you figure that out
and never question what I did?

649
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,927
You can believe what you want.

650
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:10,887
Take care.

651
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,776
Cha Hui-ju.

652
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:42,586
ONE STORMY NIGHT

653
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:46,048
-My gosh.
-The books you wanted.

654
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,094
Why are there so many?
Isn't it just one book?

655
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,430
There are a lot.
There are a lot of words, too.

656
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,100
-There are six books.
-Shall I read them for you?

657
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,729
No, I will try reading them myself.

658
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,697
"One...

659
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:14,785
One...

660
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,873
Stormy...

661
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,835
Night."

662
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,587
What a coincidence.

663
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,633
You first met Ms. Tae on such a night.

664
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:36,682
You knew that Cha Hui-ju
was the culprit, right?

665
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,059
Well...

666
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:42,562
Mr. Joo met his father today
and told him everything.

667
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,231
Really?

668
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:48,610
You saw Cha Hui-ju.
Didn't you find out anything?

669
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,862
I did see her,

670
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,865
but I wasn't able to find out
anything helpful.

671
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:58,537
Mr. Joo won't let you go
before he solves things

672
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,248
with Cha Hui-ju.

673
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,001
I guess that is part of it.

674
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,461
It will end...

675
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,464
once he finds the culprit.

676
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,844
If I can, I want to help with that
before we end things.

677
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:20,142
So, there's no reason
for you to stay here now?

678
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,435
There is.

679
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:25,856
I'm going to stay here.
I need to end things to start over.

680
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,609
I might move, though.

681
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,903
Are you leaving our building?

682
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,363
Should I stay?

683
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,993
Shouldn't you be asking me to stay?

684
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,080
You're the manager, right?

685
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,168
Don't leave.

686
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,462
I already got an apartment.

687
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,923
But since you asked me to stay,
I have no choice.

688
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:55,761
I won't leave.

689
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,354
Was he boasting that he has an apartment?

690
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:13,361
His name's still up there.
This is such a scandal.

691
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:14,654
Mr. Kang.

692
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,364
Did you see this online?

693
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,451
-What?
-You're all over the Internet.

694
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,161
-Me?
-Yes.

695
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,289
"Superstar Kang Woo."

696
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,168
I can't believe this.

697
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,087
The photo doesn't do you justice.

698
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,548
Anyway, since you're famous,
why don't we go buy some sunglasses?

699
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,887
This is not the man I'm dating.

700
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,598
The netizens have
already found out about him.

701
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,392
He's the head of security at Kingdom,

702
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,771
and you have been
going there a lot recently.

703
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,856
It's true that
I've been going there often.

704
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,360
If you admit it,
we'll make this a good story for you.

705
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,947
The man I've been dating
does work at Kingdom.

706
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,867
But it's not him.

707
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:03,954
It's the president,

708
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,665
Joo Jung-won.

709
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,876
-The president of Kingdom?
-Really?

710
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,757
Mr. Joo will be in the news?

711
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,425
Tomorrow?

712
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:23,014
Hold on, we'll sue them if they write
articles without verifying the facts.

713
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,724
Okay.

714
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,936
Why will Jung-won be in the news?

715
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,231
It's about a scandal with Tae I-ryeong.

716
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,232
What?

717
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,985
Does your nephew have a girlfriend?

718
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:41,700
No, we only had dinner together
a few times.

719
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:44,119
I guess her being a celebrity
makes it news.

720
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,120
It's not true.

721
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,455
We should stop that
from getting out, right?

722
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,959
Hold on, let's decide
after we talk to Jung-won.

723
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:54,462
Mr. Joo has Ms. Tae,
and she's friends with Tae I-ryeong.

724
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,172
He won't let this pass.

725
00:52:56,339 --> 00:53:01,219
I'm going to use this to find out
how much he likes her.

726
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:06,224
Your nephew's girlfriend
isn't Tae I-ryeong but Tae Gong-sil?

727
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,604
I'm sorry we're talking
about family matters

728
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,606
on our first dinner.

729
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,274
It's okay.

730
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:16,776
It's interesting.

731
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:25,994
GHOST ROOM

732
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,124
Gong-sil.

733
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,961
Where did you decide to go?

734
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:36,922
What?

735
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:40,425
Where did you decide to go
before we went to the funeral?

736
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,887
-Why?
-Why are you asking why?

737
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,222
I want to take you there.

738
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,683
Why? Don't you want to go?

739
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,688
If you want to go, hold on.

740
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,362
He told me not to be seduced
even if he tries.

741
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,781
Does he want me to wait or not?

742
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:23,927
I knew you would come.

743
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,721
I kept avoiding you, but you've found me.

744
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,432
I have no time. You have ten minutes.

745
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,894
We can talk about the jar
and the broken engagement.

746
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:37,065
Jung-won, there will be an article
about Tae I-ryeong and you.

747
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,609
-Pardon?
-I-ryeong.

748
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,487
Doesn't this deserve about 20 minutes?

749
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:16,896
If I put it on now,
it will look like I want something.

750
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:30,994
Can't I show him that I like him?

751
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,700
I don't care.

752
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,662
But Tae I-ryeong is our model.
We should stop it because of that.

753
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,539
Is that really why?

754
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,792
Not because of Tae Gong-sil?

755
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,629
You break off engagements easily.

756
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:26,549
I knew you wouldn't care
about a few lines in the news.

757
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,968
But Tae I-ryeong and Tae Gong-sil
are friends, right?

758
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,555
Isn't that why you want to stop it?

759
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,808
Tae Gong-sil doesn't get bothered
by such things.

760
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,142
I told you before,

761
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,604
but she won't leave me because of that.

762
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,648
I think that's so strange.

763
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,566
How can she not be bothered?

764
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:48,696
When I told her you're getting married,
she didn't seem to mind.

765
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,697
You're right.

766
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:53,159
Think of her as someone
from another world.

767
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:57,038
You can't scare her. She won't budge.

768
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,470
Does she have no pride?
Does she love you that much?

769
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:24,065
She has no pride.

770
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,528
There's a clear reason
for not letting me go.

771
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,489
She has no time to take care of her pride.

772
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,034
Even if I love her,

773
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,787
she can't even enjoy it.

774
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,039
So...

775
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:42,709
it's okay.

776
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:57,765
Right?

777
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,728
Yes.

778
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:07,484
Did you say you have ten minutes
because you're taking her out?

779
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,321
Let's go.

780
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,991
Ms. Tae. You heard everything.

781
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,660
Do you still want to leave with him?

782
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,330
Yes.

783
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:25,084
I don't really care.

784
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:28,213
I have no time for that.

785
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,173
Let's go.

786
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:34,844
Jung-won.

787
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:40,058
By looking at your expression,
it doesn't seem like things are okay.

788
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:53,947
I've made up my mind.

789
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,199
I wanted to go home.

790
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,742
I'm going home. I'm tired.

791
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,873
I should go.

792
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,621
ONE STORMY NIGHT

793
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,710
I shouldn't have shown him.

794
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,304
Tae Gong-sil.

795
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,352
I know you're in there. Come out.

796
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:02,575
You said you can handle it,
so why are you crying?

797
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,121
Who are you?

798
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:12,001
Oh, are you that jerk Joo Jung-won?

799
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,212
"Joo Jung-won?" What's wrong with you?

800
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,338
Why did you come here?

801
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,548
Is she so easy to you?

802
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,510
How can you be so self-centered, you jerk?

803
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:25,556
Is someone in there?
Are you not Tae Gong-sil?

804
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,058
No, I'm not.

805
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,352
I heard you're having fun with her.

806
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,856
She said that she doesn't enjoy it at all.

807
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,485
So just let her use your body
and don't linger around her.

808
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:38,695
Get lost.

809
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,031
Get lost!

810
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,034
I touched her, so why are you still here?

811
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:50,540
I came back because I'm mad.

812
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:52,125
It happens. Do you even know ghosts?

813
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:55,294
I don't know much,
but I've fended off many.

814
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:59,340
Because of that, she can't do anything
and is in a lot of pain.

815
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,760
She's in a lot of pain, you jerk.

816
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:05,805
Okay, I got it.

817
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,099
I want to talk to Tae Gong-sil.

818
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,309
She doesn't want to. Go.

819
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:11,728
You...

820
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:17,942
You don't know how
the walnut pie lady left, right?

821
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:20,862
Why? Did you hit her?

822
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:23,239
Watch carefully and come back.

823
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,919
