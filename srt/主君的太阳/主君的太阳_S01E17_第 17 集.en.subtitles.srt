1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,809
I was so shocked
that I thought I was seeing things.

2
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,396
But it really is you, Gong-sil.

3
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,190
I was so surprised
that I thought I saw a ghost.

4
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,609
Does your radar still work?

5
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,780
Do you still see ghosts?
Are you here with one?

6
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,616
Were you having a drink with the ghost?

7
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,619
I didn't want to meet you like this.

8
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,330
I don't see ghosts anymore.

9
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,000
-Really?
-Yes.

10
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,669
So stop talking about ghosts now.

11
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,755
How have you been?

12
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,925
If you were curious about that,
why didn't you call?

13
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,386
We ended up meeting like this.

14
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,596
I was curious about you.

15
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,058
I was thinking of going to see you.

16
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,353
So you were doing well enough
to think of coming to see me.

17
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,981
I have been well.

18
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,108
I traveled a lot.

19
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,694
I've changed.

20
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,031
You look different.

21
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,618
Mr. Joo.

22
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,997
Are the people from Sejin all here?

23
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,877
Yes, Ms. Park Seo-hyun just arrived.
They are all here now.

24
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,838
Please tell them
that I'm attending an urgent meeting

25
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,007
and will be a little late.

26
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,258
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,265
Oh, you have a meeting.

28
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,310
Yes, it's a meeting
that involves a lot of money.

29
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:46,731
I could lose millions,
but I'm making time for you.

30
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,193
Isn't Mr. Kim with you anymore?

31
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,987
Because of his age,
he doesn't leave the office much anymore.

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,702
Isn't Park Seo-hyun the woman
you almost got engaged to?

33
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,620
Yes.

34
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,541
We're opening Shanghai Kingdom
together soon.

35
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,543
You must be earning
a lot of money together.

36
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,714
You're about to make a lot of money.
We met at the wrong moment.

37
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,592
I will leave for China next month
and stay for a few years.

38
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,927
It's the right timing.

39
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,849
I also earned some money while I was
abroad, even if it's not as much as you.

40
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:25,478
I got quite a lot of seed money,
so I bought a house in the UK.

41
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,231
I congratulate you for making money.

42
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,776
But are you sure you don't see ghosts?

43
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,529
Yes, I am sure.

44
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:40,326
So, you were enjoying
your freedom alone here?

45
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,706
Yes, I enjoy drinking these days.

46
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,292
That's something to boast about.
We should have a drink.

47
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,632
It's a shame I can't drink
because of my meeting.

48
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:05,560
Congratulations on getting rid of
the radar. You can drink now.

49
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,645
What?

50
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:13,568
Are you scared that something
might come and go if you drink this?

51
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:18,907
Were you hesitating
whether you should come see me?

52
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,535
No, I'm fine.

53
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,961
I told you, I've changed.

54
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,504
You must have.

55
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,385
Congratulations.

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,638
Thank you.

57
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,522
You're losing money. This is bad timing.

58
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,608
Let's meet again when the timing is good.

59
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:57,070
Were you going to come see me
when the timing was good?

60
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,530
Yes, I was going to.

61
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,116
I should get going.

62
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,873
She got better,

63
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,585
but she didn't come straight away
to see me.

64
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,847
Don't follow me.

65
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,558
You said you fell because you were drunk.

66
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,103
Why did you have to ask me
to buy you a drink?

67
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:38,653
I wanted to meet him just as Tae Gong-sil,
not as someone who sees ghosts.

68
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,864
You ruined everything.

69
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,710
Are you okay?

70
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,338
Shall I open the window for you?

71
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,718
Sir, please go to Mangwoo-ri.

72
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,261
You said you were going to Seodaemun.

73
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,225
I have to go to Mangwoo-ri.

74
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,146
I have to buy a shovel before I go.

75
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,274
Where can I buy one?

76
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,444
Why do you need a shovel?

77
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,904
The tree roots keep poking at me.

78
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,658
I'm going to cut them.

79
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,286
Are you drunk? There are no tree roots.

80
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,583
Have you ever been buried in the ground?

81
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:41,924
Oh, my gosh.

82
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:44,802
What's going on?

83
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,225
-What is it?
-Sir, please stop the car.

84
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,120
Tae Gong-sil.

85
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,414
I don't care about timing, so get off.

86
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,875
Is she your girlfriend? Good.

87
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,251
I can't take her.

88
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,379
Take this woman who wants to dig up
something in Mangwoo-ri.

89
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,393
Let's go to Mangwoo-ri.

90
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,855
Something is inside you.

91
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,360
Get lost.

92
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,007
If you avoided me because of the ghosts,

93
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,094
I will let you off, Tae Gong-sil.

94
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,006
Are you awake, Gong-sil?

95
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,431
You must be wondering
how much you wanted this

96
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,266
to dream about it.

97
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,770
Do you think it's a shame
that it's not adult-rated?

98
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,983
I don't care if the sun is up.
Shall I help out?

99
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:08,863
Come here.

100
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,367
What happened?

101
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,161
Why am I here?

102
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,414
You really have changed.

103
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,459
You weren't even surprised
when you woke up in cemeteries.

104
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,920
At least you seem puzzled
about waking up here.

105
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,713
What happened?

106
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,673
I'm sure I got into a taxi.

107
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,051
You got drunk and tried to go
shovel up something.

108
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,428
I followed your taxi.

109
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,390
You were getting kicked out of the taxi,
so I brought you here.

110
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,896
Was I okay?

111
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,981
I wasn't okay.

112
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:51,197
You tried to seduce me
in many different ways.

113
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,998
Mister, give me some ice cream.

114
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,710
Give me ice cream. Ice cream!

115
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,008
I want more.

116
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:12,927
No more.

117
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,012
Gong-sil will have a stomachache.

118
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,723
She'll be in pain, and she will get fat.

119
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:19,850
No!

120
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,041
Who are you?

121
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,462
That pose doesn't look like a dog.

122
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:58,139
The old cat from downstairs
must have died.

123
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:00,891
Come on down.

124
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,811
What?

125
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,150
Last time, the dog tore apart a cushion.
What should I throw you this time?

126
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:37,845
Darling.

127
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,607
That's my skin toner. It's not liquor.

128
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,234
It's for the face. You shouldn't drink it.

129
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:57,990
I'm lonely tonight. Don't leave me alone!

130
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,950
Look, Parisienne.

131
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,204
You'll be gone once I touch you.

132
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,081
I can't do what you want me to.

133
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,041
It's hard for me
to just hold hands all night.

134
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,462
Let's just sleep quietly apart.

135
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,341
No? Shall I say it in French?

136
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,389
No. Get lost.

137
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,985
I can't believe this.

138
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,739
There's only so much I can endure.

139
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:50,334
Did I act strangely
when I was drunk yesterday?

140
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:55,047
You seem to have acquired new skills
while you were gone.

141
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,801
You were acting really boldly,
but I couldn't just accept it.

142
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,721
It was hard
to just hold your hand all night.

143
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,599
Did I just act a little easy
while I was drunk?

144
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,104
You were just drunk.
Everyone can get drunk.

145
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,442
You were just
drunk Tae Gong-sil yesterday.

146
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,944
That's a relief.

147
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:18,988
I'm sorry.

148
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,790
Tae Gong-sil.

149
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,042
Tae Gong-sil.

150
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,128
I'll get you water.

151
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,508
I missed you, Mr. Joo.

152
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,888
Did you miss your shelter
because you still see ghosts?

153
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:51,312
It's not like that at all.
I just really missed you.

154
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:55,983
But...

155
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,778
I still see ghosts.

156
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,157
I wasn't able to find a way
to become normal.

157
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,663
Is that why you didn't come to me?

158
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,919
I was getting ready to seduce you.

159
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:22,301
I wanted to appear before you
as a totally normal and cool woman.

160
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,637
Then you'd fall for me.

161
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,766
And then when you have
totally fallen for me,

162
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,771
I was going to tell you
that I still see ghosts.

163
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,483
I have already fallen for you.
The order of things isn't important.

164
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,859
It's important!

165
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:46,867
I didn't want to be a woman with a radar
who needs a shelter.

166
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,039
I made a lot of money
that you like so much.

167
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,999
It's all ruined!

168
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,550
I'm sorry for bothering you.

169
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,010
Thank you for the tea.

170
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,888
Hey, easy girl.

171
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,477
If you spend the night at a guy's house,
shouldn't you give the guy your number

172
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:18,899
and make plans to meet again
in the near future?

173
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,150
Give what?

174
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,152
I'm not an easy woman.

175
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,655
Okay, let me correct that.

176
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,699
Arrogant Tae Gong-sil.

177
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,701
I thought you might not give me
your number,

178
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,953
so I got it myself.

179
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:38,210
Don't be arrogant and ignore me
when I call you.

180
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,045
If you do, I'll tell everyone
you're an easy woman.

181
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,590
Don't call me.

182
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,552
I'll call you. That's what I decided.

183
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,764
Since you say that
the order is important to you,

184
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,101
I will try to understand
and do as you say.

185
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,897
Can I text you?

186
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,483
-Sure.
-Thank you.

187
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,193
I should go.

188
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:10,701
Tae Gong-sil.

189
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,246
Do your best to seduce me.

190
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:15,873
Good luck.

191
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,177
I guess I was fine even though I drank.

192
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,388
That's right, nothing came
into me recently.

193
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,932
What a relief.

194
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,019
Okay, I'll bring him.

195
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,148
Tae Gong-sil?

196
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,653
What about Jung-won?

197
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,406
I don't think he's in the state
to work out.

198
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,574
Really?

199
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,161
What happened to Jung-won yesterday?

200
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,747
Why did he cancel the meeting with Sejin?

201
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,416
I don't know. He seemed happy.

202
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,334
Don't worry.

203
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,254
I don't think Mr. Joo
will go out with other women.

204
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,757
It's almost been a year
since he last saw Bang-sil.

205
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,385
He'll forget her
if he doesn't see her for another year.

206
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:14,056
I think Mr. Joo is going to have
a lot to smile about.

207
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,599
Good luck, Bang-sil.

208
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,607
I have a bad feeling
about you saying that.

209
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,192
Okay.

210
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,654
If Jung-won isn't going,
I don't want to go either.

211
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,240
I don't feel too good, either.

212
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,242
Aren't you going?

213
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:38,080
Sometimes I feel that you value
Mr. Joo more than me.

214
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:42,876
Right now, Jung-won comes first,
and then you come second.

215
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,755
We should have a kid.
Then I'll have someone on my side.

216
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,176
I was joking.

217
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,596
We're too old for that.
Let's just love each other.

218
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,348
Smile.

219
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,308
I love you.

220
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,688
Honey.

221
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,191
Okay, Gong-sil.
I'll go as soon as I'm off.

222
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,360
Is Tae Gong-sil back?

223
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,278
Why?

224
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,613
Are you going to use your big mouth again?

225
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:16,201
You know I haven't been doing that
since I became the team leader.

226
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,371
Anyway, don't tell anyone.

227
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,624
Whatever she decides to do,
I'm on her side.

228
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,585
Mr. Joo will be excited if he finds out.

229
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,295
Since Gong-sil left,

230
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:31,175
there have been rumors that Mr. Joo
has been slightly out of his mind.

231
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:36,680
Many people have seen him
talk to himself on that bench.

232
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,350
Gong-sil has ruined that man.

233
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,147
She should be responsible
for what she did to him.

234
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,692
You should be responsible for me.

235
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,736
What about me?

236
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,864
For so many nights,

237
00:17:54,364 --> 00:18:00,454
you have been playing with my heart
over and over again.

238
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,833
You and your big mouth.
Why are you talking about this?

239
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,507
You're going to formally introduce me
to your sister, right?

240
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,135
You should meet my parents,
and we should get married soon.

241
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,262
You should take care of me.

242
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,182
Maybe I will.

243
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:28,440
I'll ask Mr. Kang to preside
at our wedding.

244
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:32,361
Well, he's not my boss anymore,
so I'll call him Kang Woo.

245
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:37,616
And I'll ask Tae I-ryeong
to sing at our wedding.

246
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,661
It will be great.
We'll be the couple of the century.

247
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,329
Han-ju and Gong-ri.

248
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,207
Why would she do it?

249
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,962
Tae I-ryeong will do it
if Kang Woo asks her to.

250
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,508
I once wanted things to work out
between Mr. Kang and Gong-sil.

251
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,885
But he fell for Little Sun.

252
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,639
If Kang Woo finds out
that Tae Gong-sil is back,

253
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:05,102
I'm worried that he might return to her.

254
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,770
Don't you worry.

255
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,690
Eat this.

256
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,820
It's sweet. Just like you.

257
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,519
Tae I-ryeong made her manager
become a paparazzi.

258
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,945
Look at this.

259
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,283
Why is she flirting with her bodyguard?

260
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,872
Why are all the ambassadors' wives
so pretty?

261
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,261
Why did you take the photos?

262
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,431
Kang Woo, it's me.

263
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,437
You're I-ryeong's manager.

264
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:50,916
Hey, Bad Manners.

265
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,462
You should go work at a place
where there are only men.

266
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,839
Hey, Black-whiskered Whale.

267
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,927
Do you want to get rid
of all the women around me?

268
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,306
Yes, I'm still not sure
if I'm the only one you're seeing.

269
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,643
You always meet me so briefly

270
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,853
at places where there aren't any people.

271
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,065
-How can I not be anxious?
-That's because you're Tae I-ryeong.

272
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,359
I'm just trying to protect you.

273
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,117
Kang Woo.

274
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,453
Did you just say you're protecting me?

275
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,374
You said you're protecting me, right?

276
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,251
Why?

277
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,335
It means...

278
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,171
your heart is mine now.

279
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,633
You're a really foolish whale.

280
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,429
It's been quite a while.
How could you not know?

281
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:50,600
If you really mean it,
let's go watch a movie.

282
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,478
A movie? We've been to the movies often.

283
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,397
Not at a cinema.

284
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,026
-At a film festival.
-"Film festival"?

285
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,987
Let's walk the red carpet

286
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:07,326
arm in arm and go to the film festival.

287
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,121
I can show the whole world
that you're mine.

288
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,836
You are still
a little overwhelming for me.

289
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,005
The red carpet is too much.

290
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,218
You'll have to do it
if you want to protect me.

291
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,554
I have to be on that carpet.

292
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,560
Can't you go with me?

293
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,147
That's right. That's where you belong.

294
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:42,486
But what if I go where I don't belong...

295
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,616
and I'm not able to protect you properly?

296
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,205
Let's go together. Please?

297
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:09,262
You can stay with me.
Why do you want to stay here?

298
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:13,975
I went to other houses before,
but I feel the most comfortable here.

299
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,188
Do you still see things?

300
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,775
I thought that went away
while you were with Yoo Jin-woo.

301
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,030
No, but I think I know
why I became like this.

302
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,032
Where is he now?

303
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,827
He's still abroad,
but he's going to return soon.

304
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,540
You're not going to leave again, are you?

305
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,416
No, I'm not.

306
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,753
-I'm going to buy this building.
-What?

307
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,466
You said you made money.
But did you make that much?

308
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,970
When I was in Europe,

309
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,807
I stayed in a house
that was full of ghosts.

310
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,019
I got all the ghosts out, fixed it up,
and sold it for a huge amount of money.

311
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,981
But why would you buy this building?

312
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,316
I like this place.

313
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,986
It would be good to study here.

314
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,532
And someone said he would give me a chance
if this building was mine.

315
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,916
Is the owner willing to sell?

316
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:24,337
That building was sold
to a new owner around last year.

317
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,757
I asked about selling it,
and they said they will meet you.

318
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:28,842
Really?

319
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,720
I hope they won't ask for a huge amount.

320
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,347
I don't know.

321
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,892
Here he comes.

322
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,400
-Mr. Kim.
-It's been a while, Ms. Tae.

323
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,903
You're still really bright.

324
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,740
What are you doing here?

325
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:55,535
I'm the legal representative
of the owner of this building.

326
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,207
So the new owner is...

327
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,964
Yes, I bought it.

328
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:11,968
I bought it because K Group and L Group
will develop the area.

329
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,724
You ignored all my texts
asking when you're going to call.

330
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,060
Did you come to find out
the price of the building?

331
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,520
Are you saying...

332
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,149
I have to pay a lot more to buy it?

333
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,609
I'm just saying that.

334
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:29,903
When will you call me?

335
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,989
I thought I could buy it at market price.

336
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,075
I'm a little short.

337
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:40,080
I hope you're not thinking
of going abroad to earn more money.

338
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:45,794
You have the number of the owner.
Why don't you just call him?

339
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,630
If you talk to him,
he might give you a discount.

340
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,091
I know him very well. He's an easy target.

341
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,677
I'm not going to call yet.

342
00:25:55,095 --> 00:26:00,058
Think about how much more you want
and contact me through Mr. Kim.

343
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:02,769
I should go.

344
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,647
Answer my texts.

345
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:07,857
Okay.

346
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,196
Didn't you buy it...

347
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:17,367
because someone said
it had the best rooftop in Seoul?

348
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,619
Isn't that what you said?

349
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,497
The first purpose was the development.

350
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,918
The second reason was that someone

351
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,839
might want to rest there
when they come back.

352
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:35,927
Has Ms. Tae not made her mind up
about being with you?

353
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,137
She made up her mind.

354
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,556
But she has her own order of things.

355
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,516
It's so hard to let her have her way.

356
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,645
You're not the kind of person
who always follows the order of things.

357
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:51,568
I didn't think you would wait
when you really want something.

358
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,781
Yes, that's what I used to be like.

359
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:58,908
Can I do that?

360
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,996
You asked me to give you some advice.

361
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:08,585
I think you can cheat a little
and give her a small push from the back.

362
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,808
Has the result of my regular health check
come back?

363
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:24,851
Yes.

364
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,570
I haven't been feeling well lately.

365
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:39,282
I am prepared to hear some bad news,

366
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,035
but I hope it's nothing serious.

367
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,329
Tell me.

368
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,663
Ms. Joo...

369
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,582
you're pregnant.

370
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,169
You're five weeks pregnant.
Congratulations.

371
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:00,887
Me?

372
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,017
I'm pregnant at this age?

373
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:13,191
I thought I couldn't have children
even when I was younger.

374
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,485
But I'm pregnant now?

375
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:19,572
Because of your age and past miscarriage,

376
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,742
you'll have to work hard
to protect the baby.

377
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:29,749
I am not sure I can do that at my age.

378
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:34,212
-If you do not try hard--
-Will I lose the baby?

379
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,766
I heard you were at the doctor's.

380
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,440
Was the result not good?

381
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,069
No, I'm fine. There's nothing wrong.

382
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,654
That's a relief.

383
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,575
We can go on our fifth-anniversary trip
as planned, then?

384
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,746
Wasn't the itinerary quite dynamic?

385
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,456
Yes, it should be fun.

386
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,126
We'll fly light planes
and ride horses in Mongolia.

387
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,962
I filled the whole trip
with the things you like.

388
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,925
It should be thrilling and dangerous.

389
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,554
Why?

390
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,389
Don't you like it?

391
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,143
I do.

392
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:34,981
I want to spend the rest of my life
freely with you.

393
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,069
Seong-ran.

394
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,948
I love you.

395
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,998
My plan keeps getting interfered with.

396
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,377
Hello.

397
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:58,922
You're still here.

398
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,842
It's been a long time. Have you been well?

399
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,471
Tae Gong-sil.

400
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,976
You didn't talk to me.
Pretend you didn't see me.

401
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:15,522
What is it?

402
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:19,692
Shall we negotiate the price over lunch?

403
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,028
I already had lunch.

404
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,196
Really?

405
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,657
Then you could wait,
and we could have dinner.

406
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,867
I promised to have dinner with my sister.

407
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,454
There are many people
who want to eat with me.

408
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,959
You know my aunt
keeps setting me up with women, right?

409
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,253
I have so many women to meet these days.

410
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,339
Are you just going to let me do that?

411
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,845
So, how many of those dinners
have you had?

412
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,932
That's a better question
than asking the price of the building.

413
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,102
What number will make you react wildly?

414
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,397
So you did go to them. I knew it.

415
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:02,068
You're also working
with the Sejin Group girl to go to China.

416
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,152
Does it worry you?

417
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,822
That's why you shouldn't worry
about the order.

418
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,741
You should ignore the order
and just seduce me.

419
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,953
I will forgive you for not calling.

420
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,539
Did I tell you something
when I was drunk the other day?

421
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:18,084
Yes, you told me all about the plan
that pleases me a lot,

422
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,294
so put it into action.

423
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,670
I don't care

424
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,925
if you still see
the guy sitting over there or not.

425
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,057
Did you know that I still see them?

426
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,019
Yes.

427
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,189
Do you still hate that you do?

428
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,867
Sir.

429
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,330
Ghosts always interfere
at the most important moments.

430
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:56,998
What's wrong?

431
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,043
He's actually moving.

432
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,295
Where are you going?

433
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,341
Hold on, you said
he never moves from there.

434
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,300
I know.

435
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,719
Where are you going?

436
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,890
-I should go.
-He's my friend. I'm coming, too.

437
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,435
You and I really can't talk
without ghosts coming up.

438
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:18,937
Sir!

439
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,356
Tae Gong-sil!

440
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,786
You will be very satisfied
with your wedding.

441
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,704
It's so nice.

442
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,958
I would really like to get married here.

443
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,376
Right, Mom?

444
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,504
It must be his wife and daughter.

445
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,340
It looks like they're looking
for a wedding venue.

446
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,424
I guess so.

447
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:53,596
You stayed here because
you were worried about them?

448
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,182
No?

449
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:57,809
Did he say no?

450
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,189
Her father passed away three years ago.

451
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,858
It's because of the lottery.

452
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,443
The lottery?

453
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,446
He always bought lottery tickets
with the same numbers.

454
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,992
And like a miracle,
those numbers were chosen.

455
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,579
Did he die from a heart attack
because he was so happy?

456
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,541
He lost the lottery ticket.

457
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:26,337
He threw it out
when he emptied out his wallet.

458
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,924
We told him that it couldn't be helped.

459
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,886
But he was sick for months.
His blood pressure was already bad.

460
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,222
Eventually, he passed away.

461
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,355
So, he threw it away here?

462
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,945
That is why he never left this spot.

463
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,656
He passed away,
but he kept thinking about it.

464
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,368
With that money,

465
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,537
he could have paid
for his daughter's college,

466
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,666
paid for her wedding,
and his wife would have had a better life.

467
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,880
He must have felt frustrated
to lose a winning ticket.

468
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,926
Your daughter is so pretty and kind.

469
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:18,681
Your wife boasted
that she got a really good son-in-law.

470
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:24,562
The people you loved are living happily
without that money.

471
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:29,942
So, you can believe
they will be happy and leave now.

472
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:46,042
I do like this place,
but it's too expensive for us.

473
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,504
I'll do it at the place
I chose with my boyfriend.

474
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:55,218
Your father wanted you to get married
at the best place possible.

475
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,263
If you and your boyfriend
don't mind, I'm okay.

476
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,683
Mr. Joo.

477
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,230
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Joo Jung-won, the president here.

478
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,607
Oh, my gosh.

479
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,861
Your late husband was very close to me.

480
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,449
You could say that he was my savior.

481
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,827
-My husband?
-My dad?

482
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:26,249
I would like to help out
with your daughter's wedding.

483
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,376
Please accept my offer.

484
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,423
Reserve the date and time that you want.

485
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,218
Please make sure everything is the best.

486
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,594
If it's okay,

487
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,182
we would like to prepare a dress for you.

488
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,308
Would that be okay?

489
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,565
-Please get it prepared.
-Yes, sir.

490
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,574
-Oh, my gosh.
-Take a look around.

491
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,367
All right. This is so nice.

492
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,620
It's so pretty.

493
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,664
Dad.

494
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,666
Thank you.

495
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,303
I still see ghosts.

496
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,931
Does it mean the time you were away
was meaningless?

497
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,266
You said you changed.

498
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,978
You do seem different. What happened?

499
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:34,734
I went to the places I went to
when I was a spirit.

500
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:50,333
I learned that my spirit
had met many other spirits

501
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,501
during that time.

502
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:57,215
And when I returned
from wandering as a spirit,

503
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,968
I started to see them
because of my promise.

504
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:32,416
I said I would help the helpless spirits
tell their stories when I wake up.

505
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,377
I made many promises.

506
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,838
It was those promises
that made me shine brightly.

507
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:54,272
I was so scared and hated myself
for seeing them when I woke up,

508
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,439
but not anymore.

509
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,027
I promised them
to become their bright sun.

510
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,656
I'm not scared and I don't hate myself
for keeping the promise.

511
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:08,160
You really have changed.

512
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:12,915
I also learned how to handle ghosts
who just charge at me.

513
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:17,461
I should look into their eyes
and hold my breath when they approach.

514
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,258
He taught me a lot of things since
he's been doing this for a longer time.

515
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:32,143
I wonder if I was a good guide
to Gong-sil.

516
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,813
Do you think she found the right path?

517
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,526
Isn't there something you realize
by looking at her?

518
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,029
It's time you went back now, Jun-seok.

519
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,116
Are you afraid to take the college exam
when you go back?

520
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,535
Life is all about tests.

521
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,912
You can't avoid them.

522
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,207
You should return.

523
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,795
And you should find your way
like Gong-sil has.

524
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:28,366
Tae Gong-sil, you only
talked about ghosts with that guy, right?

525
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:32,370
You didn't have feelings for him
like you did for me, right?

526
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:36,582
But you let your aunt
set you up all the time.

527
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:42,254
I didn't go to those dinners. Do you know
how much I starved because of you?

528
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,255
Really?

529
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:47,176
Then, would you like
to have dinner with me?

530
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,096
Right now?

531
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,680
I'll call you.

532
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:56,060
Call me soon. Why won't you call me
when you said you'd seduce me?

533
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,771
Are you teasing me?
Do I have to endure this?

534
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,400
You should go to that man.

535
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,944
Why are you talking about ghosts
right now?

536
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,987
You said he's your friend.

537
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:10,741
Do you want him
to stay in front of that trash can?

538
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,912
Since you're his friend,
you should go talk to him.

539
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,041
Tae Gong-sil has really changed a lot.

540
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,504
She's playing with my heart
like a huge flirt.

541
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,423
Call me!

542
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,402
So you have returned.

543
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,487
Yes, I have returned.

544
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,157
Are you going to play with his heart?

545
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,369
I'm going to hold him tight
and not let go.

546
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,707
You have changed, Ms. Tae.

547
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,375
Yes.

548
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,044
You have changed, too.

549
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,213
I haven't changed.

550
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,841
I still don't like you much.

551
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,134
Not that.

552
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,096
You're holding another soul inside.

553
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,642
Can you...

554
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,061
see things like that, too?

555
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,771
It's a very weak soul.

556
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,399
You'll have to protect it very well.

557
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:32,031
Don't say anything,
and don't tell Jung-won.

558
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,366
I haven't decided what to do yet.

559
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,828
It will be hard to make a choice
and protect something.

560
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:42,917
And no one knows
what will happen to your choice.

561
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:50,508
You could make a hard decision,
but it might give you more pain.

562
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:57,014
Having affection for someone
doesn't always bring happiness.

563
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,685
The choice is up to each of us.

564
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:02,895
Are you...

565
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,398
talking about you and Jung-won?

566
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,818
Or are you talking about
me and the baby inside me?

567
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,405
I'm just talking about
how people love each other.

568
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,700
A heart that hasn't been born yet,

569
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,661
and a heart that has already left...

570
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:22,831
I think it's the most difficult
when you have to live with them.

571
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,223
I am going to make sure
your daughter's wedding is grand.

572
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:42,560
You should leave
after you see the wedding.

573
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,063
Stop regretting over the lottery ticket
you threw away.

574
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,943
Do you think you regret things
more than I do?

575
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:54,697
If I married someone like
the daughter of Sejin Group's president,

576
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,284
I could have gained so much
more than lottery winnings.

577
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,161
But I don't regret it at all.

578
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,793
Okay, I do regret it a little.

579
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,004
But I just let go of it.

580
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:17,011
The woman I love is the sun
that shines from the sky.

581
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:18,721
Isn't that amazing?

582
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,810
Please say that it's amazing
by turning the lid once.

583
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:36,822
She doesn't just shine
in the eyes of dead people.

584
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,325
I can't believe

585
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,369
how dazzling she is.

586
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,458
Do you think I can get married
before your daughter?

587
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,961
Do you think it's possible?

588
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,677
But one thing is for sure.
You won't be lonely if you choose love.

589
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,228
-One, two, jump!
-Three!

590
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,315
Come here.

591
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,443
Kiss your mom.

592
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:19,406
You'll look into their eyes,
eat with them, and smile.

593
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:25,079
Those moments will be the reward
for having protected your love.

594
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,305
If I lose it,

595
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:48,686
I will never know what that feels like.

596
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,609
Hey!

597
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:56,652
-Gong-sil!
-Gong-sil!

598
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,278
Are you moving out?

599
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,864
Yes, we're going to a house
with two rooms.

600
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:01,782
Really?

601
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,951
Your mother must have worked hard.

602
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,869
Are you going to live here again?

603
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,664
-Yes.
-What about your special guy?

604
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,167
What shall I do?
Shall I let him live with me?

605
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,753
But you can't live without him.

606
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:18,465
I don't think he can live
without you, either.

607
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,259
He can't even read.

608
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,011
He can read now.

609
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,765
But he can't live without me.

610
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,809
My goodness.

611
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:29,852
Kang Woo!

612
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:36,066
-Are you back?
-Yes, I am back.

613
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,610
Did you come to see me?

614
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,070
No.

615
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,407
I promised to help them move.

616
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,325
Right.

617
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,996
You should help, too.

618
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:50,581
Okay.

619
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,211
Let's have a drink since we worked hard.

620
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,966
How have you been?
I read about you and I-ryeong.

621
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,510
We're always photographed
when we are together.

622
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,845
I guess so.

623
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:09,892
Come to think of it, Small Sun
also has a lot of people who follow her.

624
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,060
You should protect her.

625
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:16,690
She does everything as she pleases,
so it's hard to be her bodyguard.

626
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:22,279
That's why you are just right for her.
You're a great bodyguard.

627
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,950
Gong-sil, you don't seem
nervous or scared anymore.

628
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,038
I wanted to return to the man I love,

629
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:35,250
so I gathered all the light I have
and tried my best.

630
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,714
Do you remember saying
that we should become great people?

631
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:45,219
I'll compliment you
since it looks like you've achieved it.

632
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,845
Thank you, Woo.

633
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:51,266
You should also protect
the famous Small Sun the best you can.

634
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,146
I'm not sure if I'll have the courage.

635
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:02,819
I have to go through a red road
I never thought about before.

636
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,364
I'm a little scared.

637
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,282
I see ghosts, but I still overcame it.

638
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,785
You should be brave.

639
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:12,120
Here.

640
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:14,748
Thank you.

641
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,799
I found more things to do on our trip.

642
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:27,344
Bungee jumping looks fun.

643
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,221
Windsurfing seems nice, too.

644
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:32,099
-Skydiving, too.
-Honey.

645
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:37,145
I am going to try to be really brave.

646
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,065
Do you think you can try skydiving?

647
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,027
I won't be able to go skydiving,

648
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:49,533
horse riding, or fly a small plane.

649
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:54,538
Why? Don't you want to go on this trip?

650
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:55,706
I...

651
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,000
have to give birth to a baby.

652
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,467
Have what?

653
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,844
I'm in my 50s.

654
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:15,392
It's our fifth anniversary,
and a five-week-old baby is in here.

655
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,189
-Honey.
-Honey.

656
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:27,821
I'm so old that I get confused
if your name is Seok-cheol or Cheol-seok.

657
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,198
Will I be able to do this?

658
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,545
I love you.

659
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:47,716
I will try this since I have you.

660
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,385
Help me. As hard as you can.

661
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,095
Yes.

662
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,228
Cheol-seok's mom.

663
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:02,606
Oh, my.

664
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,376
I guess I was asking for too much.

665
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,470
Kang Woo.

666
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:36,890
Yes.

667
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,981
I'm scared of that red road.

668
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,026
But I'll go through it with you.

669
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,113
If you're scared,

670
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:53,907
you can hold me.

671
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:00,163
I'll hold you tight so I don't lose you.

672
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:11,925
Okay.

673
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,314
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

674
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:34,030
So now, the building is yours, Ms. Tae.

675
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,661
Mr. Joo didn't give me a discount.

676
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,830
But he didn't ask for more.

677
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,250
This is a really good buy.

678
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,877
We have reliable information.

679
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,255
Mr. Joo said it himself

680
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:54,092
that he would give me a chance
if this belonged to me.

681
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,261
So now, I satisfy his basic condition.

682
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,680
Ms. Tae, I was on your side

683
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:03,518
since the day you first took him
to that building.

684
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:09,941
If you hadn't stopped the car,
we wouldn't have come so far.

685
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:12,778
Thank you.

686
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,864
I watched Mr. Joo fall for you, Ms. Tae.

687
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:20,786
It was as if I was watching my child
grow up under the sun.

688
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:25,874
Even if he doesn't listen to you,
acts arrogantly, and says mean things,

689
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:29,211
please let him off a little
and stay with him.

690
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:46,853
French lady.

691
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,147
Are you still here?

692
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:53,652
Will she call me today or not?

693
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,488
Shall I just keep waiting or not?

694
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,785
THE SUN OF DEATH

695
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,163
She's calling.

696
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:08,917
I have to wait.

697
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,336
I have to count to five.

698
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,171
One.

699
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,136
You called so soon
after you got my number.

700
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:22,180
Did you wait for my call?

701
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,057
Yes.

702
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,478
Did you stare at the phone
thinking about me?

703
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,731
Yes, I totally fell for your plan.

704
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:32,774
Joo Jung-won.

705
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:36,695
I would like to formally invite you over.

706
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:37,821
Would you like to come?

707
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:41,199
-Invite me?
-Yes, invite you.

708
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,742
I have something to tell you.

709
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,786
That's standard procedure.

710
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,872
Calling to invite me.

711
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,499
If our eyes meet, I will fall for you.

712
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,167
Is that what you're anticipating?

713
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:56,089
I always follow standard procedure,
like when I was doing the cleaning.

714
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,467
Will you come here?

715
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,054
Then I'll follow standard procedure, too.

716
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:04,931
I will be there.

717
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,392
Please wait, Tae Gong-sil.

718
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:13,940
What do I do first?

719
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,485
Let's shower first.

720
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,290
Let's spray some perfume.

721
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:50,101
As provocative as possible.
Good luck, Tae Gong-sil.

722
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,650
Something more provocative.

723
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:09,955
I ignored your taste
and prepared something sweet and romantic.

724
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:14,459
You must not know I changed.
I really like sweet things.

725
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,921
It's okay, I like it.

726
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:21,132
Oh, this building is mine.

727
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,343
You made a fortune at a young age.

728
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,721
I don't know what your ability is,
but you made a lot of money.

729
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,183
The land is expensive here. I respect you.

730
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,894
Please sit down.

731
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:39,943
Here.

732
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:55,125
Let me tell you something
before I have a drink.

733
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,502
I have bad drinking habits.

734
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:58,837
Really?

735
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,507
Sometimes when I get drunk,

736
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,844
I become another person or another thing.

737
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:10,140
Don't be startled if that happens
and just touch me lightly.

738
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,684
Thank you for the warning.

739
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,478
And you'll probably find out
while we talk,

740
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:19,858
but I might look somewhere else
or say something random.

741
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:26,448
You can just think that I got a call
and that I'm talking on my phone.

742
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,284
You have to answer a call
if it's important.

743
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,493
I understand.

744
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:37,292
I have a world
that you could never hear or see.

745
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:41,796
I might get sad or cry because of it.

746
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:48,595
You might not understand me,
but don't think too much of it.

747
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,472
No one can understand

748
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,433
the other's world perfectly
in any relationship.

749
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:59,731
Don't get upset if I ignore you
because I don't understand.

750
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:05,236
I might give you a hard time
or cause you trouble.

751
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:09,240
But I don't want to be sad and lonely
without you.

752
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,953
I am going to go to your side,

753
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,417
because you are really special to me.

754
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,170
I love you.

755
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,298
I'm going to love you a lot.

756
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:29,302
I am Tae Gong-sil. Tae, like the sun.

757
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,638
Can I rise next to you?

758
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:38,436
Is that the main line
you prepared for today?

759
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:45,735
Then, I cannot accept this invitation.

760
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,325
An invitation means that
I am only here for a short while.

761
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:53,785
I don't intend to do that.

762
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:59,040
I am going to keep living by your side.

763
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:10,718
I never let you go.

764
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:17,976
You're like the sun, something
the Earth would be destroyed without.

765
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,020
You're my sun.

766
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,864
Thank you for not letting me go.

767
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:30,924
It's going to be hard for you,
but I'm not sure what to do.

768
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:33,218
Just stay by my side.

769
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:36,930
If I give birth successfully, you should
raise the child since you're young.

770
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,515
Of course.

771
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:42,352
You just give birth.
I'll take care of the rest.

772
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,443
She's here.

773
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,571
-She's here!
-She's here!

774
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,907
-Don't push!
-She's getting out.

775
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,618
-Tae I-ryeong!
-Tae I-ryeong!

776
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,745
Tae I-ryeong!

777
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:01,913
She's getting out!

778
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,837
-Tae I-ryeong!
-Over here!

779
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,839
Look here, please.

780
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:14,342
Look over here.

781
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,635
Over here.

782
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:16,970
-Over here.
-Over here.

783
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,141
Tae I-ryeong!

784
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,226
Look over here!

785
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,234
-Over here!
-Don't push.

786
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,361
-She's coming!
-Over here.

787
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,655
Over here, please.

788
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,573
Over here!

789
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:37,490
Are you okay?

790
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,286
It's not as scary as I thought.

791
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,870
-Over here.
-Please look this way.

792
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,539
Are you just going to go in?

793
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,292
Kang Woo, can I kiss you here?

794
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,340
Hey, that's a bit...

795
00:59:58,803 --> 00:59:59,804
I'll kiss you later.

796
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,556
You promised.

797
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,808
It has to be a really deep one.

798
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,569
There are so many couples.

799
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:20,074
How many of them do you think
are real soulmates?

800
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,784
Just us?

801
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:26,789
I am not sure that you are my soulmate.

802
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,958
Really? Give me your hand.

803
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,338
My heart is pounding.

804
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,300
I can't tell.

805
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:41,262
We're soulmates. Can't you tell?

806
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:43,514
I know.

807
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,601
It would be nice

808
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,188
if you could just find your soulmate
just by touching them.

809
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:53,399
But that's impossible.

810
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:57,862
That's why most people
don't recognize their soulmates.

811
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,740
An ability to know
by just touching someone.

812
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,450
That would be great.

813
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:03,743
If we knew,

814
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:07,997
we could hold on to that person
no matter what.

815
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,166
Just like us.

816
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:23,638
Are you the president of Kingdom?

817
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:31,145
-Did you feel that tingle?
-No.

818
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,981
I just felt a really strong tingle.

819
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,608
It was really strong, right?

820
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:47,578
Maybe I knew that you were special to me
right away because I can see ghosts.

821
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:51,082
That is very helpful.
I'm glad you see ghosts.

822
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:56,587
Okay, I've decided.
Let's go to the next course.

823
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,716
Do we have to go to the East Sea
to see the sunrise?

824
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,217
The sun rises everywhere.

825
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,929
The sun is up somewhere right now.
Why do we have to go there?

826
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:09,934
You just said I was special.
Now you're saying I'm not.

827
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:12,145
You were gone for a year.
Don't be so shameless.

828
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,981
You have the obligation
to continuously seduce me.

829
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,774
Seduce me here right now.

830
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:22,196
I did prepare several things
to seduce you.

831
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:23,614
Try one more.

832
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:27,368
I'll only let you do one more.
Then I'll do as I wish.

833
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:33,958
I met Steve Jobs in the US,
the guy you wanted to meet so badly.

834
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,126
Really?

835
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,421
-Did you talk to him?
-Yes.

836
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:42,175
If he were alive,
tomorrow's sun would be different.

837
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,177
Tell me more. What else?

838
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,596
I shouldn't tell you this.

839
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,557
The future is supposed
to be for the living.

840
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,185
I'm special. Just tell me.

841
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:53,561
No.

842
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:54,729
Never mind.

843
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,482
Okay. Because you're special.

844
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:00,610
Steve Jobs said...

845
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:05,281
-Really?
-Yes.

846
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,116
-And then...
-Yes?

847
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,454
Jobs said that?

848
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:12,955
You can't tell anyone.

849
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,957
Okay, I won't.

850
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:17,460
-And then...
-Yes?

851
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,212
No, I can't tell you this.

852
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,963
-I'm going home.
-Come on.

853
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,758
-Can I tell you this?
-Tell me.

854
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,220
Just tell me.

855
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,180
No, I can't.

856
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,224
Then should we continue what we just did?

857
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,857
