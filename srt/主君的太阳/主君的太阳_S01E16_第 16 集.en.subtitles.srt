1
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,476
I am leaving.

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,900
I think I'm a sun that should only shine
for dead people.

3
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:34,034
I just want to be a sun
who is popular with ghosts.

4
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,458
But when I see you,
I feel like I'm someone with bad luck

5
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,669
who makes people die.

6
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,256
So, I get scared of myself
and hate myself.

7
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,634
So, you won't even feel bad without me.

8
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,639
I only make you be scared
and hate yourself?

9
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,642
I don't want to be that kind of sun
by your side.

10
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,148
Please, just tell me to get lost now.

11
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,862
Until now,

12
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,365
I was able to tell you to get lost...

13
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:21,664
because I probably knew
that you would come back to me again.

14
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,629
I will do as you ask.

15
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,135
Get lost, Tae Gong-sil.

16
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,474
Mr. Joo, I heard Ms. Tae is leaving.

17
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,978
Weren't you with her? Where is she?

18
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,904
You have to call often.

19
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,657
Are you going to be gone a long time?

20
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,744
I won't know how long until I get there.

21
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,668
Is he the one you're leaving with?

22
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,842
Hey, isn't he the one who found you
in the mountain?

23
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,304
Yes, so don't worry.
I will come back safely.

24
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,014
Okay.

25
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,060
-Bye.
-Take care.

26
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,440
Go.

27
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,817
I'll call you.

28
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,448
Go.

29
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,587
Ms. Tae left you?

30
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:40,261
I thought if I took the burden,
Tae Gong-sil would feel okay.

31
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,557
But she said it's scary and hard for her.

32
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:51,231
Now that I think about it,
I've never tried to understand...

33
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,317
or consider her situation.

34
00:03:54,609 --> 00:04:00,448
So, are you sending her away
because you understand her now?

35
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,285
Do you think I'm crazy?
I'm not letting her go.

36
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,872
Why would I do something
I haven't done in 34 years?

37
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:14,545
I won't understand
or be considerate enough to let her leave.

38
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,040
DEPARTING PASSENGERS ONLY

39
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,352
Please answer your phone.

40
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,815
Your call cannot be reached...

41
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,456
Did you end things well with that person?

42
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,628
How could I end things with him?
I just left him against my will.

43
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,051
I just want the plane to take off soon.

44
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,344
I'll feel better
when I'm far away from him.

45
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,691
I told Kang Woo I'm leaving
but he's not even calling.

46
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,864
He has no manners.

47
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,299
Tae Gong-sil is on a plane to LA.

48
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,261
Get me on the next plane.
I'm going after her.

49
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,598
Yes, I'll get the ticket
as soon as your passport arrives.

50
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,689
-Jung-won's going to the US?
-Yes.

51
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,903
Ms. Ahn just took
his passport to the airport.

52
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,404
Why is he going to the US?

53
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,867
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

54
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,621
It's nothing.

55
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,342
If you pass the audition,
we don't need to come back.

56
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,595
Let's stay there and practice your acting.

57
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,558
I need to go to the bathroom.

58
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,316
-Tae Gong-sil.
-I-ryeong.

59
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,027
What are you doing here?
Are you going to the US?

60
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,073
Are you going on a business trip
with Mr. Joo?

61
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,702
No, I'm going on a personal matter.

62
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,621
I saw the news that you're going there
to film a movie.

63
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,332
Yes. I'm going for an audition.

64
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,004
-Is he with you?
-Yes.

65
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,674
My seat is over there.
Come over if you're bored.

66
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:57,894
She's a friend.

67
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,735
I booked a flight
that leaves in two hours.

68
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,613
-Isn't there anything sooner?
-No.

69
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,495
Did you just let Tae Gong-sil leave?

70
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,999
She said she'd leave
once the Cha Hui-ju matter is solved.

71
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,835
But you just let her go
without stopping her?

72
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,755
I'm not letting her go.
I'm going to go get her back.

73
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,383
Even if you go after her,
there will be a two-hour gap.

74
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,511
What if she disappears by then?

75
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,682
It's a tracking device.
Take this with you.

76
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,442
I put a tracking device in
Tae Gong-sil's bag earlier, just in case.

77
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,528
She won't know.

78
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,532
You must go and bring her back.

79
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,079
You're really good.
You must work at Kingdom again.

80
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,958
I will double your salary.

81
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,544
Turn it on.

82
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,506
TAE I-RYEONG

83
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,219
Kang Woo, did you know
Tae Gong-sil is going to the US?

84
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,932
-How did you know that?
-She on the same plane as me.

85
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,394
She's leaving with some man.

86
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:22,979
Really?

87
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,942
Tae Gong-sil is on the same plane
as Tae I-ryeong right now.

88
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,278
The plane hasn't taken off yet.

89
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,282
Hello?

90
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,033
Hey!

91
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,244
Hey, you...

92
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,539
Mr. Joo?

93
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,624
Listen carefully, Tae I-ryeong.

94
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,670
I need your great acting skills right now.

95
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,380
What?

96
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,137
Hey.

97
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,848
Do you think I'm a good actress?

98
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,600
What?

99
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,021
Don't interrupt the acting
I'm going to do now, okay?

100
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,287
I-ryeong!

101
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,372
What's wrong?

102
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,542
Gong-sil, my stomach hurts.

103
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,461
What? Why does it hurt?

104
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,924
I don't know, I can't breathe.
I think it's my appendix.

105
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,886
Excuse me, somebody help her!

106
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,888
Excuse me, somebody help her!

107
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,099
-I think she needs to get off.
-Gong-sil!

108
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:46,896
-It hurts!
-It's okay, I-ryeong. Hang in there.

109
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,692
Big Sun, please stay with me!

110
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,321
Big Sun!

111
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,742
-Gong-sil! Don't leave me to die!
-Oh, my gosh.

112
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,703
-Don't let me die!
-I'm going with you!

113
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,955
Come with me!

114
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,376
-Come with me!
-You should get on first!

115
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,087
-Come with me! No!
-Okay! Let's go!

116
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,297
-Please get on with her.
-Okay.

117
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,510
Tae Gong-sil!

118
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,143
I never imagined I'd be moved
by Tae I-ryeong's acting.

119
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,981
You've stopped her from leaving.
What will you do now?

120
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:35,486
Understanding. Consideration.
I'm going to try that stuff now.

121
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,031
You have to help me.

122
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,326
I'm no good at things like that.

123
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,830
Tell me if I'm wrong
and stop me from making mistakes.

124
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,626
Just like you have for the past 15 years.

125
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,545
Sure, I'll do that.

126
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,047
But, Mr. Joo,

127
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,050
I feel a little hurt.

128
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,345
You wouldn't budge for the past 15 years.

129
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,307
How could you open up
your heart so easily to Ms. Tae?

130
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,476
It wasn't easy.

131
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,521
You know that I'm not such an easy person.

132
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,398
I don't know.

133
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,485
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, sir.

134
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:22,783
All right.

135
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:26,871
Fine.

136
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,377
Small Sun.

137
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,549
You look too fine for someone
who said she was sick.

138
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,427
Can't you see? I was just acting.

139
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:48,100
I even got an acting teacher.
I think my acting improved quite a bit.

140
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,062
I got a script for a role of a sick girl.
I should take that role.

141
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,692
Did you drag me off the plane
to practice your acting?

142
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,612
I didn't really want
to go to this audition.

143
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,782
And Mr. Joo asked me
to get you off that plane.

144
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,160
-Mr. Joo?
-I didn't want to do it.

145
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:11,665
I don't want you to become a couple
with someone like Mr. Joo.

146
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,083
I would be so jealous.

147
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,377
So, why did you do it?

148
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,797
Because you have to become safe and happy.

149
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,887
To make him stop worrying about you
and leave your side for good,

150
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,848
the only way is for you to date Mr. Joo.

151
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,058
That's why I helped.

152
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,727
Then you shouldn't have gotten involved.

153
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,356
I was leaving
so I could be safe and happy.

154
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,818
You must be trying
to act tough in front of me,

155
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,321
but it didn't look like that at all.

156
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,158
You're like, "I'm leaving
because I love you so much."

157
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,577
You're just acting like Candy.

158
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,454
-Candy?
-Yes.

159
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,832
"I'm leaving you because I care for you.

160
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,670
If you love me, come after me
and I will let you catch me."

161
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:58,712
That's it, right?

162
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,009
If he stopped you like this,
he has done as much as he can.

163
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,345
You should just let him have his way.

164
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,556
You shouldn't let it drag on anymore.

165
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:16,355
I-ryeong, I have a weakness
that prevents me from doing that.

166
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,773
A weakness?

167
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,110
That must be it.

168
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,905
That's why Kang Woo and Mr. Joo
say they have to protect you.

169
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:26,866
What is it?

170
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,495
I see ghosts.

171
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,332
What?

172
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,837
There's one here.

173
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,339
I think he passed away in this room.

174
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,345
I don't believe such things.

175
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,640
Whatever. There's a message
from the ghost.

176
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,893
He says he's a fan of yours.

177
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,728
I should go.

178
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,107
Hey, Gong-sil! Where are you going?

179
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,153
It's scary if you say something like that
and leave me here alone.

180
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,783
I really hate ghost stories.

181
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:26,508
Whether I stay or go,
people just see me as Candy.

182
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,437
You're U-jin.

183
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,484
Why are you still here?

184
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,050
It's his mother.

185
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,753
U-jin, you remind me
of that horrible event.

186
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,296
I don't want to see you.

187
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,689
Mr. Joo Jung-won.

188
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,115
Ms. Tae was about to leave,
but you forced her

189
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,534
to come back to you.

190
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,748
-Who are you?
-I'm the one who will leave with her.

191
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,875
Gong-sil must have told you.

192
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,630
I met someone who can see and hear
the same things as I do.

193
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,180
Are you saying you can see ghosts,
like Tae Gong-sil?

194
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,434
Unlike you,
I share the same world with Gong-sil.

195
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:52,863
Ms. Tae.

196
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,449
Mr. Kim.

197
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,868
How could you just disappear like that?

198
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,456
Were you running away from Mr. Joo?

199
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,374
I wasn't running away.

200
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,170
-I was going to find something.
-What is it?

201
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,882
The reason I became like this.

202
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,720
I wanted to find out
why I see dead people.

203
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:22,142
Are you saying she can find the reason
if she goes back there?

204
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,271
I'm not sure.
We'll know when we get there.

205
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,193
Were you going to take her there
without being sure of anything?

206
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,695
That's not what's important.

207
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:39,326
It's that Gong-sil is facing
her problem for the first time.

208
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,413
Until now, she only hid from it
and avoided it in pain.

209
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,086
You became a really good
hiding place for her.

210
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,967
But now Gong-sil is thinking
of getting away from you.

211
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,679
That's why I came to her.

212
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,934
What can you do for Tae Gong-sil?

213
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:08,647
I am going to help her remember
the years she spent as a spirit.

214
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,359
That's when she started to see spirits.

215
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,278
If she gets her memory back,

216
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,573
Gong-sil will be able to change.

217
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,910
-How?
-She won't be scared anymore.

218
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,123
She will be able to accept her ability.

219
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,585
Or she could lose that ability.

220
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:35,007
So, she could stop seeing the ghosts?

221
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:36,466
Yes.

222
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,263
She could accept or lose her ability.

223
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:46,685
But you will lose your meaning
as a shelter to her, Mr. Joo.

224
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,899
Does Tae Gong-sil know about this?

225
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,984
Yes.

226
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,446
That's why she's trying to leave with me.

227
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:15,255
So, you thought I was leaving
for Mr. Joo's sake, like I-ryeong.

228
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,426
I was really only thinking about myself.

229
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,681
I guess Candy
is much more romantic than me.

230
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,808
She left for the other person.

231
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,687
I'm not that pure, bright or beautiful.

232
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,607
You have changed, just like Mr. Joo did.

233
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,402
You used to say you would be
delighted if anyone likes you.

234
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,280
You were hiding way down there.

235
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,742
But now you want to go up there and shine.

236
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,329
I can't stop you. This is hard for me.

237
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,248
My gosh.

238
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,962
Do you think Mr. Joo
thinks I'm leaving for him, too?

239
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,298
Should I really pretend to be Candy?

240
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,468
I don't know about Mr. Joo.

241
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,178
He's Mr. Joo, after all.

242
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,034
I know I forced you to come back,

243
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,787
but I feel better
now that you're in front of me.

244
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,333
Mr. Joo. Why did you stop me from going?

245
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:38,547
I was leaving for you
because I am nothing compared to you.

246
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,048
Don't pretend to be Candy.

247
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,176
Do you think I'd run to you
and give you a hug or something?

248
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:44,928
Did it show?

249
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,223
Were you trying to look like a pure moon
when you're a shameless sun?

250
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:56,273
I thought you might understand
if I said that I am doing this for you.

251
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,775
I like it when you're honest with me,
even if you're shameless.

252
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,696
I don't like the moon
that changes and confuses people.

253
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,490
Okay, I'll be frank with you.

254
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,162
I'm leaving so I can live.

255
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,457
It's not like I didn't think
about you at all.

256
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,958
But I came first.

257
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:22,132
I was most at ease
when I was using you as my shelter.

258
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,927
I could just go to you
without too much thought.

259
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,056
But I started to like you.

260
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,810
I think that's when I started
to hate myself for seeing ghosts.

261
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:39,733
You said that you'd come down
to my level for me.

262
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:45,030
But I felt so miserable
about how low I was.

263
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,994
I can't go on living like this.

264
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,538
I want to find out why I became like this.

265
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,708
And I want to get rid
of my ability if I can.

266
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,128
You can find out and then return to me.

267
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,299
I can't promise that.

268
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:10,472
If I don't change, I will never return
to your side again.

269
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,435
I told you.

270
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,980
I don't want to be
an unlucky sun next to you.

271
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:24,611
I shouldn't have gone to you
that day when I was stabbed in the back.

272
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,697
Luckily, your life didn't end there,

273
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:32,619
so I'm looking for a way
to live a better life.

274
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,497
Can you understand that?

275
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,375
I'm not a fool. I got it, so please stop.

276
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,418
Thank you.

277
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:46,341
You seem fine in a hospital
that you used to be so scared of.

278
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,512
I guess you won't return
because you miss your shelter.

279
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,810
I need a weapon to negotiate with you,
so please wait.

280
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,770
I'm going to leave as planned.

281
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,648
Then you will have to face
the police before you do.

282
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:06,153
-Why?
-Because you're a molester.

283
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:11,032
You poked every part of my body.

284
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,368
You got on my bed without permission.

285
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,121
And you paid for it, too.

286
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,206
A hundred thousand won...

287
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,333
and a million won.

288
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,253
Didn't you say you'd understand?

289
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,755
But I don't intend
to be considerate about it.

290
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:29,593
I won't let you leave so easily.

291
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,528
I am going to do as I wish from now on.

292
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,822
You should handle everything on your own.

293
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:55,535
If you're not scared of ghosts
anymore and can be alone...

294
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,039
then I'll send you home.

295
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,042
She has no pride.

296
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,545
There's a clear reason
for not letting me go.

297
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,381
She has no time to take care of her pride.

298
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,675
I'm not scared if the ending is clear.

299
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,764
I always told her to shoulder
the burden and that it would end.

300
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,141
And it really happened.

301
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,064
At least I told her how I felt.

302
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,403
I love you.

303
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,367
Was that enough?

304
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,163
I guess the worst possible case
I can imagine has happened.

305
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,918
I forgot that I said that.

306
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,048
What I told Ms. Go was the worst.

307
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,425
Dead, end, no future.

308
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:56,388
I said something I wouldn't have said
unless in that situation.

309
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,642
I don't want to have
to be responsible for it.

310
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,023
She wouldn't have heard that.

311
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,817
Her deal ended with Ms. Go.

312
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,486
I paid her a lot.
She wouldn't have told her.

313
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:22,539
If I said something nice, I could go
and ask her how she could do this to me.

314
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,132
I heard Hanna was the culprit.

315
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,634
Mr. Joo had a close call.

316
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,554
What if he had married her because of you?

317
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,144
Jung-won must be so shocked.

318
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,440
Did you say Tae Gong-sil caught her?

319
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,649
Yes.

320
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,069
Honey, Bang-sil has done
a really good job.

321
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:56,906
Honey.

322
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,002
Are you okay, Jung-won?

323
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,757
Aunt, I am tired. Let's do this later.

324
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,008
Okay.

325
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:24,434
Mr. Joo, I'll take care of the meeting
and all your work.

326
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:34,235
My brain for work
and this matter function separately.

327
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,574
I will take care of both things.
So, please leave, everyone.

328
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,624
Just go.

329
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,799
My goodness.

330
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,802
Mr. Joo looked like he was really shocked.

331
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:02,847
He'll need someone
to comfort him by his side.

332
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,182
He has me.

333
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:09,562
I know he has you.
But he needs someone to love him warmly.

334
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,939
Who are you talking about?

335
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,066
Bang-sil.

336
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:19,364
I heard she solved everything
and then planned to leave.

337
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,699
And Mr. Joo tried to stop her.

338
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,828
They are so in love.

339
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,454
Goodness.

340
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:37,924
I was really moved when I heard
about your story from Ms. Ahn.

341
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,302
You got on a plane
and Mr. Joo came after you.

342
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,764
That was such a story.

343
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,143
I heard if you want
to really confirm your love,

344
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,646
you should get on a plane and try
to leave, so you've settled it now.

345
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,941
It's not like that.

346
00:28:55,817 --> 00:29:01,197
Gong-sil, Mr. Joo wants you to stay.
So just don't go.

347
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,408
I'm not leaving because of him.

348
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,784
But he...

349
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,247
He knows that you see those things.

350
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,751
But he still likes you. Isn't that enough?

351
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,882
Does it look like I'm playing hard to get?

352
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:24,137
Tae Gong-sil, you shouldn't play
with his heart too much.

353
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,598
Why are you being mean to Gong-sil?

354
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,642
Ms. Tae.

355
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,604
Ms. Joo would like to see you.

356
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,314
-Me?
-Yes.

357
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,732
Why?

358
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:50,038
If Ms. Joo approves,
things will work out as Mr. Do wishes.

359
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,917
I didn't think it would work out
between them.

360
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,338
I thought I got in the wrong line,
but this was the right one.

361
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:00,632
Lee Han-ju.

362
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,300
Were you working for Mr. Do?

363
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:06,095
I was Mr. Do's eyes, ears, mouth, and...

364
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,889
Head and shoulders, knees and toes--

365
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:11,142
You were the big mouth
who was working for him?

366
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,355
So all the time you were buying me dinner,

367
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,983
you were just fishing for information
so you could babble!

368
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,568
Gosh!

369
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,072
Tae Gong-ri!

370
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,116
I won't interfere for a while.

371
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:33,206
So, don't make Jung-won troubled
by saying you'll leave.

372
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,292
You are both so fond of each other.

373
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:42,257
I'm not going to make you two
want each other more by interfering.

374
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:46,970
I believe my nephew
will come to his senses in the end.

375
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,097
Don't do that.

376
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,643
I don't have the time
to be so much in love.

377
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,192
You said I'm bad luck.

378
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,736
You're right.

379
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,116
Mr. Joo almost died because of me.

380
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,829
But I'm looking at him again.
I shouldn't ever do that again.

381
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:20,211
Are you upset with me
because I was hard on you?

382
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:24,924
Are you saying you want
an apology from me?

383
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,342
No.

384
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,013
You're doing this
because you love Mr. Joo.

385
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,308
You're the family of the person I like.

386
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,560
I am grateful to you.

387
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:41,816
Are you trying to play games with me?

388
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,109
No.

389
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,237
I'm letting go.
I am really going to leave.

390
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:19,103
-You seem to have a lot on your mind.
-Yes.

391
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,191
People don't understand me,

392
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,195
so they think I'm playing hard to get.

393
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:32,992
They can't believe I'm leaving
when Mr. Joo wants me to stay.

394
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,243
Then,

395
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,080
do you want to stay with him

396
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,708
and try to accept and endure everything?

397
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,712
He seemed ready to do that.

398
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,509
I can't do that.

399
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:53,304
It wasn't easy to decide to leave.

400
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,436
When I think
that I might never see him again,

401
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,065
it feels like there's a hole here.

402
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,705
Is this boy following you around?

403
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,082
He's U-jin.

404
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,835
He keeps following me
because he's worried about his mom.

405
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,383
-Aren't you going to listen to him?
-No.

406
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,720
I almost got Mr. Joo killed
because of this boy.

407
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,016
I'm going with you
because I don't want to do that again.

408
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,643
I'll wait at the airport tomorrow.

409
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,312
You should decide whether to come or not.

410
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,876
So, you were the one who made
Gong-sil think about these things.

411
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:13,009
She will also make
her last choice because of you.

412
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,282
She's sleeping.

413
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:41,329
She told me to come
with the necessities of a fake illness.

414
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,123
Is she really sleeping?

415
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,848
This is quite a famous director.

416
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,643
Is it really okay
to miss this opportunity?

417
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,904
She seems okay when she's sleeping.

418
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,169
What?

419
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,214
Did you just kiss me?

420
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,428
It's a little startling.

421
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,057
But I'm not mad
because I knew it was coming.

422
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:47,061
But will you be satisfied with that?

423
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,982
I came prepared
for something more extreme.

424
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,152
Thank you for ending it lightly.

425
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,239
Really? You wouldn't have been mad
if I did something more extreme?

426
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,116
No, I wouldn't have.

427
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:04,537
You even gave up a big movie for this.
I feel bad for you.

428
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,000
Kang Woo. That didn't count.

429
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,461
I'll try again.

430
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,549
There are reporters outside.

431
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,302
You can't come out.

432
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,060
What a shame. I should have been bolder.

433
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:59,133
I found something really unfair
while thinking about us.

434
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,386
-It doesn't make sense.
-What doesn't?

435
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,723
We both always talked about ending things.

436
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,559
But we never really started anything.

437
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:13,272
We never had a meal together
or held hands, except because of ghosts.

438
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,652
Isn't it funny to talk about ending things
without starting anything?

439
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,071
It is funny.

440
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:27,578
I poked and touched you enough
to be called a molester.

441
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,332
But I never touched you
because I just liked you.

442
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,252
Try it.

443
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,547
Stop talking about leaving.

444
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,259
Let's hold hands
and go have a meal together.

445
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,687
It feels strange.

446
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,149
I think it's the first time I held your
hand for some reason other than ghosts.

447
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:01,696
See, isn't it unfair to end things
after just holding hands once?

448
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,284
Let's go have lunch. I'll go get changed.

449
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,703
Hurry up, then.

450
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,669
Enjoy your meal.

451
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:25,219
It's my favorite udon place.
It's the best place around here.

452
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,514
I like udon, so I come here
five times a week.

453
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,392
I didn't know that you liked udon.

454
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,768
Do you like udon, too?

455
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,815
I hate these fat noodles
that are in the hot soup.

456
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,276
I like cold noodles
that are thin and cold.

457
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,237
So, you like cold noodles.

458
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,573
I don't like all cold noodles.

459
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,659
I only like dish number three
of the one place I go to.

460
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:54,707
I stopped eating it since the taste
changed after the owner died.

461
00:38:55,166 --> 00:39:00,421
Really? I would have gone there with you
if I'd known that.

462
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:06,552
I could find out why the taste changed
if the owner is still around.

463
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:12,641
If you leave, I'll never get a chance
to eat cold noodles again.

464
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:16,729
That's unfair.

465
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,774
Where is the restaurant?
I'll go there before I leave.

466
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,318
Don't pretend to worry about me
if you're going to leave.

467
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,906
Eat the fat noodles
before they become fatter.

468
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:32,620
Enjoy it and then be in agony
when you think of udon.

469
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,427
This is where I sometimes
come to exercise.

470
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,806
I used to be really good at tennis.

471
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:56,060
I'm good at tennis, horse riding,
golf, swimming, and shooting.

472
00:39:56,602 --> 00:40:00,356
You must have exercised a lot
as you couldn't read books.

473
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,733
I only read books
because I couldn't go outside.

474
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,735
That's a shame.

475
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:10,783
You could have recommended books
and I could have taught you sports.

476
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,746
You're destroying the chance
for us to help each other.

477
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,209
You're right. I wanted to learn golf
and horse riding.

478
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:24,046
I have a horse, a golf course,
a tennis court, and a swimming pool.

479
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,175
You could have access to all of them.

480
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,554
Do you have a horse?
I once saw a horse ghost.

481
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,766
You can't ride that. You can ride mine.

482
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,070
Mr. Joo.

483
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:53,576
There's a ghost who interferes
with couples who date.

484
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,120
All couples who sit there break up.

485
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:00,958
Excuse me!

486
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:07,465
-But they'll break up.
-We don't have time for them.

487
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,217
I don't want to see other couples
get along so well. Let's go.

488
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,250
Tae Gong-sil.

489
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,088
Don't go.

490
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:15,759
Ms. Tae said she's leaving for herself,

491
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,972
so Mr. Joo won't be able to just stop her.

492
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:25,477
I thought Mr. Joo
could do what I couldn't do for her.

493
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:30,941
That's why I stood back
and decided just to watch from a distance.

494
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:37,615
But if Tae Gong-sil
is the most scared of herself,

495
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:43,412
all he can do
is wait and watch her, like me.

496
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:48,125
Mr. Joo has never just accepted
someone else's decision.

497
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:55,341
I'm not sure
if he'll be able to understand

498
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,594
and accept this.

499
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,901
I didn't know he was the big mouth.

500
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:18,238
I had dinner with him not once, but twice.

501
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,576
Darn it.

502
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:33,754
Hey, big mouth. This is my liquor.

503
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:38,050
I didn't pour it so you could drink it
with your big mouth.

504
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,100
Hey, big mouth.

505
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,937
Why are you quiet? Say something.

506
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:55,484
You have no use for your mouth
except when you talk.

507
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,705
Hey.

508
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,836
What did you just do with your big mouth?

509
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:21,093
I have no other way
to explain what happened.

510
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,102
That was a short explanation.

511
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,360
Shall I try to make a longer explanation?

512
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:42,156
First...

513
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,036
I'm the only one drunk here,
so you should drink.

514
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:49,746
Okay.

515
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:57,838
Give us another bottle.

516
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,768
It's sweet, it's so sweet.

517
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:18,317
I like your rooftop very much.

518
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:21,028
I think I know
why you say it's comforting.

519
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,113
It's the best place to have a beer.

520
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:31,371
I want to fill up your fridge
and go have a beer every day.

521
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,834
Tae Gong-sil, how much beer should I buy?

522
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:43,425
Just one for tonight
or can I buy as much as I want?

523
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,888
Let's start with a six-pack.

524
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,182
A six-pack.

525
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,810
I'm going to hold
your hand and have one, too.

526
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:59,733
We could drink them all tonight
or have them later on.

527
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,819
Okay, a six-pack.

528
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,781
Do you have a favorite?
I'll just buy them.

529
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,545
We'll just have a six-pack.

530
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,923
It's a shame to just leave.

531
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,181
A six-pack. Six days.

532
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,684
I've bought that much time.

533
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:47,739
U-jin.

534
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,994
Please help my mother, Gong-sil.

535
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,622
No. I don't want to see you.

536
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,509
Please help me.

537
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:27,946
I'm not going. Go away.
I'm not going to go.

538
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,918
Where did she go?

539
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,864
MR. JOO

540
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,661
Why isn't she answering her phone?

541
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,375
Aren't you going to answer your phone?

542
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,252
SWITCH OFF DEVICE

543
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:34,054
I put a tracking device in
Tae Gong-sil's bag earlier, just in case.

544
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,317
Here it is.

545
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:51,863
GPS
BEGIN LOCATION TRACKING

546
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,996
Please stop here.

547
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:33,613
U-jin, I am coming with you.

548
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,256
No! Stop!

549
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,550
-Don't do this!
-Let go of me!

550
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,595
Let go of me! Let go!

551
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,847
Please don't do this.

552
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,516
Please don't do this.

553
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,728
Please calm down.

554
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:08,940
Don't do this.

555
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,401
U-jin!

556
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,696
-No. It's dangerous.
-I'm going to go to my son.

557
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,658
It's okay.

558
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,740
U-jin is over there.

559
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:05,080
He came to ask for help.
He said his mother was in danger.

560
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,543
I almost got you killed
by following him last time.

561
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,921
But I followed him again.

562
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,803
She might try it again,
even though I stopped her.

563
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,347
But that's her life.

564
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,516
You can't take the burden for her.

565
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,646
I keep getting affected
because I see and hear things.

566
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,068
I hate it, but that's me.

567
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:44,286
I can't handle myself.

568
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,539
How could you handle me?

569
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:22,115
If you go with him,
can you stop seeing those things?

570
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:23,742
I don't know.

571
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,580
At least I'll be able to find out
why this happened to me.

572
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:35,420
I will accept the decision you made.

573
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,175
Okay.

574
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,344
This is the end.

575
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:03,740
Tae Gong-sil, you and I just held hands
and had lunch once.

576
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,868
It means we can forget each other easily.

577
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,038
I am going to...

578
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:13,875
forget you.

579
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:17,128
Sure.

580
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,508
You can say I'm a bitch who seduced you
if you hate me.

581
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:25,929
No, we only held hands once.
There's no reason to do that.

582
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,478
I'm leaving.

583
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,731
She

584
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,816
still didn't say

585
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,652
that she loves me.

586
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,355
It's been 375 days

587
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,232
since...

588
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:46,194
Gong-sil left.

589
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,699
I haven't been destroyed.

590
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,755
What should I wear today?

591
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,165
-Are you ready?
-Yes, sir.

592
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:47,714
We have to beat Giant Mall in sales.

593
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,633
We're preparing a year-end special event.

594
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:54,220
I am going to Shanghai
after this season is over.

595
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:58,808
You should beat Giant Mall
by this much before then.

596
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:01,019
-How much?
-This much.

597
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,188
Louder. This much!

598
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:09,360
When Jung-won goes to Shanghai,
you'll be the president of this mall.

599
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,530
I'm really excited.

600
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:19,120
I have to get him married
before he leaves for Shanghai.

601
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,918
Doesn't he meet Park Seo-hyun often
when he works with Sejin?

602
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,922
-What do you think?
-They only talk about money.

603
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,632
There's no hope in other areas.

604
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,135
You should get them
to stay together after meetings.

605
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:37,597
-Can you do that?
-Sure, I can.

606
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,267
But you know...

607
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:45,647
I think Mr. Joo is waiting.

608
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,733
Does it make sense
for Jung-won to wait for someone?

609
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,987
If he wants someone,
I could line up women to the moon.

610
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:57,825
But Bang-sil?
Is she some princess from the moon?

611
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,744
-Why would he wait for her?
-Well...

612
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:14,592
I'm waiting for the sun to come up again.

613
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:22,392
Please turn the lid to give me hope
that she will return again.

614
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,149
Thank you.

615
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:35,697
When you do that, it helps me feel better.

616
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:59,178
Did you already tell Mr. Joo that
the meeting with Sejin is at Palace Hotel?

617
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,056
Yes, I checked with Sejin
this morning, too.

618
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:07,729
My gosh. I should have
set up the meeting at Kingdom Hotel.

619
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,022
I made a mistake...

620
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,401
I'm going with him to that meeting.

621
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,195
He'll be really mad if he has to wait.

622
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,781
It's my mistake.
I'll talk to him about it.

623
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,909
I don't know what got into me.

624
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,912
Was I possessed by something?

625
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,838
We're here too early.

626
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:40,720
Mr. Kim wouldn't make such a mistake.
Maybe he's not feeling well.

627
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,106
Mr. Kim, did you go see a doctor?

628
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:56,527
You should think of your age.
Take a few days off.

629
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,581
You'll make me catch a cold.
I'll send my doctor, so stay at home.

630
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,083
Did you eat?

631
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,795
I'll send you your favorite porridge.

632
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,589
No ice cream. I'm hanging up.

633
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:29,060
I've been watching you.
Shall we have a drink together?

634
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,354
No, I'm here with someone.

635
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,147
But you were alone.

636
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,943
Excuse me. Can I move
to the table over there?

637
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,528
-Yes, of course.
-Thank you.

638
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:52,792
Thank you.

639
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,422
It's nice now that I am different.

640
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,509
I didn't know the night view
of Seoul was so nice.

641
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:08,641
Excuse me,

642
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:10,893
would you like to have a drink with me?

643
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,312
No, please go.

644
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:17,150
You look so much like someone I know.

645
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,860
I said, no.

646
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:22,572
Are you really not going to look at me?

647
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,490
I am with someone.

648
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,205
Who? A ghost?

649
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,641
You are Tae Gong-sil.

650
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,728
The bitch who seduced me and left me.

651
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,462
