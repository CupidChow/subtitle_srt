1
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,765
There he comes.

2
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,352
That's the woman
who is going to marry Mr. Joo.

3
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,124
Hello, Seo-hyun.

4
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:44,043
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

5
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,094
Let's go upstairs.

6
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,020
Is that woman an employee here?

7
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,481
She keeps staring at you.

8
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,357
Don't look at her. Just keep going.

9
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,318
It's killing me.

10
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,785
Go on up without me.

11
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,001
How have you been for a week?

12
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,545
You don't look bad.

13
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,672
It was terrible for me.

14
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,760
Are you really getting married?

15
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:39,390
Aren't you curious what she thinks of you?

16
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,603
It's not even a secret. I can just see it.

17
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,563
Do you see something?

18
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,942
Something that is as scary to me
as the ghosts are to you.

19
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,405
Are you getting married,
so that you can avoid me?

20
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,740
Tae Gong-sil.

21
00:01:56,199 --> 00:02:00,203
Do you think you're important enough
to affect my marriage?

22
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,872
No.

23
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:08,378
Then you have no right to ask
and I have no obligation to answer.

24
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,296
Right.

25
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,731
Your aunt went upstairs first. Let's go.

26
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,738
I told you that I hate it
when someone touches me.

27
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,534
Don't hold onto me,
even if you think you're going to fall.

28
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:47,167
Mr. Joo is so mean,
even to the woman he's marrying.

29
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,044
Why is he marrying her
if he doesn't even let her touch him?

30
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:02,307
Why didn't he tell me?
He didn't answer his phone, either.

31
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:15,987
Gong-sil.

32
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,948
Woo.

33
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,161
Didn't you know about Mr. Joo's marriage?

34
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,245
No.

35
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,125
It's so sudden
that I am a little startled.

36
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,379
Mr. Joo came back for a moment on the day
of the Ruyi Jang concert, right?

37
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,050
Did something happen when you met him?

38
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,303
Did he come back that day?

39
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,270
Was the person I saw Mr. Joo?

40
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,399
So, he did come back to see you.

41
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,694
I wasn't in my right mind that day.

42
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,072
I wasn't really myself.

43
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,203
I must have met Mr. Joo
when the ghost was inside me.

44
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,122
What did they talk about?

45
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,086
It's not even a secret. I can just see it.

46
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,466
She must have told him my secret.

47
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,010
Your secret?

48
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,972
She must have told him I like him.

49
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,557
Oh, no.

50
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,692
How can you use marriage
as a tool for your business?

51
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,236
I can.

52
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,991
It's something that was
a clear answer I came up with in my head.

53
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,286
Ms. Tae looked shocked and confused.

54
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,829
What will you do?

55
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,248
I can't seem to make
clear calculations about her.

56
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,295
It's because she's not in here.
She's somewhere else.

57
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,048
I was really shocked
but I had to admit the truth.

58
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,634
Then you should tell her, too.

59
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,138
And you should tell her
that you're not getting married.

60
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,597
I don't want to.

61
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,103
Mr. Kim, I still don't...

62
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:20,320
I still can't read, and the reason's
not in my head, it's in my heart.

63
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:25,491
I only want to use this part of me
that works properly.

64
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,619
Ms. Tae can see spirits.

65
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,832
Don't you think she will understand
your problem and embrace it?

66
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:39,088
Then I will go to her
when I die and become a ghost.

67
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,014
He must be trying to keep me away.

68
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,309
But I can't live without him.

69
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:55,104
Is he the only person
that gives you a place to hide?

70
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,565
He's the only person in the world.

71
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:03,321
I just barely got his consent
to stay by his side after so much begging.

72
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,990
If he's getting married to another woman,

73
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,452
it means he doesn't think of you
in a romantic way.

74
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,747
He's getting married.

75
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:17,085
If he knows that I like him,
he'll tell me to get lost.

76
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,712
You said you like him.

77
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,256
Doesn't it hurt

78
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,134
that he's snubbing you?

79
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:32,767
In your world, I am probably Candy
and Mr. Joo is probably a prince.

80
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,938
But in my world,
I'm just a radar that sees ghosts.

81
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,774
And Mr. Joo is a shelter where I can hide.

82
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,069
I can't be Candy.

83
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,533
He has no intention of being my prince.

84
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,954
At least a radar is useful.

85
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,498
He'll let me stay by his side.

86
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,877
I should go see him.

87
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:34,620
Congratulations on your marriage, Mr. Joo.

88
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,497
What?

89
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:40,293
I was too shocked before
to tell you something important.

90
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,256
Congratulations. And I wish you happiness.

91
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,176
You're scaring me.

92
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,263
You'll become someone's sweet home now.

93
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,600
So, being a shelter
will probably be a big burden.

94
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,643
But don't get rid of it.

95
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,147
If you keep it somewhere
around the second basement,

96
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:07,862
can I just use it sometimes
and without being a burden?

97
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,115
"Sweet home"? I don't like sweet stuff.

98
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,702
Then you should have a son very soon.

99
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,163
Have a son that has
the same ability as you.

100
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:21,000
If you let me take care of him,
I'll be his nanny, free of charge.

101
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,045
You just barged in here
and you're going way too far.

102
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,088
You want me to have a son?

103
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:38,851
Is this because of the secret
you talked about with the walnut lady?

104
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,395
Did she tell you about my secret?

105
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,064
I didn't hear it.

106
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,025
It's something you
want to keep hidden, right?

107
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,028
So, I refused politely
and said I don't want to hear it.

108
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,113
-Aren't you grateful?
-Really?

109
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,243
-It's nothing special.
-I didn't hear it.

110
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,828
But now it's so obvious.

111
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:03,209
It's so sloppy that I am not sure
if you want to hide it.

112
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,754
You barge in here and what?
"Congratulations"? "Be happy"?

113
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,133
That girl who says she doesn't cry
even when she's lonely or sad...

114
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,762
It's what that Candy character
usually does.

115
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,766
Right? No. This might be easier.

116
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:23,980
You congratulated me and offered
to move into the second basement.

117
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,899
And you'll be the nanny
of the little shelter to be born.

118
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:32,280
I'll pretend I didn't see or hear that,
so you won't be embarrassed.

119
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:33,781
Okay?

120
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,747
You seem to be mistaken.

121
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,959
You're not the person I said I like.

122
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,545
It's not you, it's someone else.

123
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:54,093
You know who it is. I really like sweets.

124
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,433
And I stayed by your side
because you are my shelter.

125
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,313
I never want to date men like you,
the kind that are so mean.

126
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,316
Okay, I'm grateful that I'm not your type.

127
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,693
I will leave
before you tell me to get lost.

128
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,613
I really hated hearing that, too.

129
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,823
Hold on.

130
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,200
Get lost.

131
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,336
Why did she have to use
Sweet Kang as her excuse?

132
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,019
SPECIAL CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER

133
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,187
Hello.

134
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,106
Tae Gong-sil. Ms. Joo wants to see you.

135
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,819
Ruyi Jang introduced you as his muse.

136
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,782
I thought you'd have an eye for art.
So, I asked you to come see this.

137
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,451
You should take it out.

138
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,078
This?

139
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,839
It's a pottery.

140
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,386
The family of Jung-won's fiancée
sent it as an engagement gift.

141
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:22,723
You can't put a price on art,
but it costs over 100 million won.

142
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,519
Hey, this is really expensive.

143
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,149
-I'm sorry. I was shocked.
-You must be shocked.

144
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,529
It's a little too much
for you to manage, right?

145
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,447
What would you have done if you broke it?

146
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,324
Doesn't it scare you?

147
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,452
You must be thinking that
you shouldn't have touched it.

148
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,370
Right.

149
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,332
You shouldn't touch that thing.
It's not good.

150
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,251
-What?
-Tae Gong-sil.

151
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,878
It's a very precious white porcelain jar,

152
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,131
not something to be called "that thing."

153
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,343
People say that it's precious these days.

154
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,680
But it was probably
just a jar that held water.

155
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,851
You should stop saying
that not anyone can touch it.

156
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,562
-It will become arrogant and impudent.
-What?

157
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,481
Are you talking about me?

158
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,152
No, I'm talking about this jar.

159
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,156
Right.

160
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:25,035
I was trying to tell you subtly
not to break Jung-won's marriage.

161
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,246
I was trying to be nice about it.

162
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,707
But what? "Arrogant and impudent"?

163
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:34,378
I'm sorry. I was just talking
about the jar.

164
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:38,132
This used to be a jar
used only to hold water.

165
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,926
But if you start having
a certain sentiment

166
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,804
towards it, strange things can come out.

167
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,184
If you become possessed by it,
you will have to break it.

168
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,644
Can't you understand
because I'm being nice?

169
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,939
Are you saying you'll break
Jung-won's marriage?

170
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,942
You're really something.

171
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,279
I guess you can't understand
because you can't see it.

172
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,116
I already congratulated him
on his marriage.

173
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,828
This jar could cause you huge trouble.

174
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,622
You have to be really careful.

175
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,795
You should break it.
You'll become possessed.

176
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,221
Good luck, Bang-sil.

177
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,187
"Something scary"? "Possessed"?

178
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,898
She's talking about herself.

179
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,073
Did Ms. Joo do a number on you?

180
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,533
It was a little scary.

181
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,202
Did she throw money at your face?

182
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,163
No, I saw a ghost.

183
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,917
I warned her, but she didn't understand.

184
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,044
Really?

185
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:04,009
People keep gossiping
about how you got rejected by Mr. Joo.

186
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,683
I guess other people
just thought I was trying to seduce him.

187
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,852
Only the ghosts understand my situation.

188
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,776
You're getting married.
You'll get rid of her, right?

189
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,528
I have no intention of that.

190
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,030
I am getting married,
so I can keep her safely by my side.

191
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,157
You're going to keep her by your side?

192
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,703
-Did she say she won't leave?
-I'm not letting her leave.

193
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,872
I can't stop seeing her.

194
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,958
I'll keep my distance by getting married
and keep seeing her.

195
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,626
For how long?

196
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,337
Until I don't want to see her.

197
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,304
Was she shocked because of this?

198
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,141
She almost broke it
when we said that it's really expensive.

199
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,351
She wouldn't have been shocked
by the price.

200
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,230
Is there something in it?

201
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,276
-Hey!
-Jung-won!

202
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,402
That's really expensive.

203
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:07,615
She won't be scared by money.
So, don't do this again.

204
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,412
My goodness.

205
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,205
Good luck, Mr. Joo.

206
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:20,419
Big Sun is dating Mr. Joo?
I can't believe this.

207
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,797
Mr. Joo is marrying
the daughter of Sejin Group's president.

208
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,049
Really?

209
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,385
My friend who works at Kingdom Hotel
saw him do an event for her.

210
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,803
He probably just had some fun.

211
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:34,099
But even if they did,
she really doesn't match his level.

212
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,226
Why? What's wrong with Big Sun?

213
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,647
She's smart, pretty, athletic,
and has a great personality.

214
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,942
Let's be honest.
She wasn't called "Big Sun" for no reason.

215
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:47,196
I thought Big Sun was worthy
of dating the president of Kingdom.

216
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,824
You should see Tae Gong-sil for yourselves
and come to your senses.

217
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,953
Why don't we go see her? Let's set a date.
You'll be really shocked.

218
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,887
Are you okay?

219
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,722
What did you see in the jar?

220
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,766
Did something follow you?

221
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,685
It didn't follow me.

222
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:22,231
But tell them to be careful
because it's something dangerous.

223
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,607
They wouldn't listen to me.

224
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,067
Why didn't you come to me?

225
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,238
I said I wouldn't avoid you
if you came because you need me.

226
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,533
You asked me to keep the shelter
in the second basement.

227
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,034
Why aren't you using it?

228
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,495
Can I be honest?

229
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,664
If you can.

230
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,459
It's because the person I like
might take it the wrong way.

231
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,297
Are you going to keep insisting
that it's Sweet Kang?

232
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,800
Are you going
to keep thinking that it's you?

233
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,218
What?

234
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:55,597
In an animation I saw,
a wolf met a goat on a stormy day.

235
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,060
The wolf had to eat
the goat in order to live.

236
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,647
But he almost starves to death
because he liked the goat too much.

237
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,942
He had to look at it as food
needed for survival.

238
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,111
And not as a goat he likes.

239
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,530
He's such a fool, right?

240
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,241
I won't do that.

241
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:19,455
So, you're the wolf who thinks I am a goat

242
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,041
that you must eat to live.

243
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,542
Yes.

244
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,504
So, stop asking the wolf
if it likes the goat.

245
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,089
Okay.

246
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,592
Let's say the wolf is like that.
What about the goat?

247
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,095
In the animation,
the goat likes the wolf, too.

248
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,722
So, what happens?

249
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,851
It likes the wolf so much that it says,
"Wolf, you should eat me."

250
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,271
That goat must be crazy.

251
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,112
How could the wolf eat the goat?
It likes the goat.

252
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,724
I could tell you a secret I know.

253
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,768
-I don't want to know.
-Why?

254
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,521
Because you won't be able
to calculate her worth?

255
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,948
Maybe I should have just let her tell me.

256
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,913
Whatever. I don't care.

257
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:53,215
The chairman said he will come early
if his son is really getting married.

258
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,426
What should I report to him
about this marriage?

259
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,471
Actually...

260
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,641
this marriage is fake.

261
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,978
It's business for both sides.

262
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,493
If I accept your suggestion,
will the owner of Sejin Group be changed?

263
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,704
I was banished here.
I'm not here to study.

264
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,749
If I return to Korea to get married,
I can avoid suspicion from my stepmother,

265
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,836
and find my father's stocks
which are under different names.

266
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:36,216
I'm going to make Sejin Cement
the holding company of Sejin Group.

267
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,052
Is a week enough to use
the wedding as a smokescreen?

268
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:46,059
If you help me, I will help Kingdom
with its ventures in Shanghai.

269
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,776
I will accept that offer.

270
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,575
This marriage could be canceled in a week.

271
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:06,496
Tell the chairman that he doesn't need
to change his schedule.

272
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,667
Does Tae Gong-sil know about this?

273
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,044
She doesn't.

274
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:18,008
Don't tell her about this
before Mr. Joo explains it to her.

275
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:20,802
Okay.

276
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:27,976
I like elegant white porcelain
better than fancy celadon.

277
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,188
It's like a gentle scholar.

278
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,066
Don't touch it. She said it's not good.

279
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,442
Just look at it.

280
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,236
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

281
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,699
Honey. What are you doing?

282
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,453
What's wrong with this? No one is here.

283
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,663
What about me?

284
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,415
I told you I don't like
ungentlemanly behavior.

285
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,252
Go scratch them in the bathroom.

286
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,338
Okay.

287
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,729
How did I fall in love
with a man like that?

288
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,815
He's not my type.

289
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,446
I used to like men
who are like gentle scholars.

290
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,085
Who are you?

291
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,887
Did you call for me, gentle scholar?

292
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,715
Why won't you change your sleeping habits?

293
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,553
I've always been like this.
Why are you suddenly getting mad?

294
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,641
You used to say that it's cute
that I sleep like a child.

295
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,935
It's so ungentlemanly.

296
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,937
Go sleep in another room!

297
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:25,487
I was with an elegant scholar.
Why did he wake me?

298
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,866
Who did you meet?

299
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,083
I want to go into Mr. Do's office.

300
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,669
-I'll come with.
-No.

301
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,879
I don't think you should go.

302
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,465
Is there a ghost?

303
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,260
I saw something in there.

304
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,804
I just want to go and check it out.

305
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,931
So, if you give me the key, I'll go alone.

306
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:54,850
I'll come with you.

307
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,813
I won't be able to go past
that office if I don't check it out.

308
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,400
I'll bring the key.

309
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,531
Let's go.

310
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,497
Are you going to stay late?

311
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,752
There's a lot to take care of
after the business trip.

312
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,797
You're done for the day.
You should go home.

313
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,591
Okay.

314
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,762
Ms. Tae is still here.
Should I drive her home?

315
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,224
No, Mr. Kang will probably take her home.

316
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,189
He said that on purpose.

317
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,566
But I didn't hear it.

318
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,699
What?

319
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,701
Did she leave already?

320
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,677
VICE PRESIDENT
DO SEOK-CHEOL

321
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,974
Woo.

322
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,560
You can hold me if you're scared.

323
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,022
Then I'll rely on you.

324
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,863
I don't want to hang on to you
like a child.

325
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,074
I'm more used to this position.

326
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:35,867
Okay.

327
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,371
But you should loosen up
your hand a little.

328
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,790
I will loosen my grip.

329
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,919
Shall we take a look?

330
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,469
The jar isn't here. Neither is the ghost.

331
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:55,679
Really?

332
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,898
-Aren't you scared, Gong-sil?
-I'm scared, too.

333
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,859
I'm just more used to it than you.

334
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,196
Is that why you lived
hidden away like that?

335
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,032
I only stayed at my place.

336
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:20,787
But I have become
much better since I met Mr. Joo.

337
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:26,126
I could breathe better
and my life changed, too.

338
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,047
Mr. Joo gives you something

339
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,259
that I could never give to you.

340
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,345
But he's getting married soon.

341
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,266
I won't be able to stay
by his side like I do now.

342
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:49,441
This marriage could be canceled in a week.

343
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,654
Gong-sil.

344
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,699
Why don't you test yourself
if you can live without him?

345
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:02,704
You came to work and did okay
while he was away on business.

346
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:09,210
But I don't know if I can keep my distance
when he's right next to me.

347
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,756
Keep your distance
for a week and think about it.

348
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,133
If your conclusion
is that you can be without him,

349
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,551
don't go back to him...

350
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,055
even if things change.

351
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,184
It would hurt.

352
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,195
Wait for me. Let's go together.

353
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,823
The new ramyeon place near
our building is good. Let's go get some.

354
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,159
There's something there.

355
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,622
Then you should take me to someplace safe.

356
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,582
The gimbap place next to it is okay.

357
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,084
But the food's no good.

358
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,627
That place sounds good.

359
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,338
Hold me.

360
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,733
Isn't Kang Woo here?

361
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,737
He's on patrol.
I see you very often, Tae I-ryeong.

362
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,240
Do I seem like a next-door neighbor
to you, too?

363
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:24,702
You're a goddess.
A goddess who has descended to our office.

364
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,706
What's that?

365
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,086
Oh. That's Mr. Kang's.

366
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,217
He has a cute side.

367
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,721
I'm sorry,
but could I take a photo with you?

368
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,363
If you keep doing this,
you won't be able to eat with her.

369
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,021
-What was that for?
-Kang Woo.

370
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,774
You are so cute.

371
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,027
Did you do this because you were scared?

372
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,988
-Do it again.
-No.

373
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,199
Why did you come here?

374
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,659
You and I might be in the news soon.

375
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,537
-What?
-We were photographed together.

376
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,373
I'm going to meet
a close reporter friend tomorrow.

377
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:57,378
If you go get a beer with me now,
you'll just be a handsome bodyguard.

378
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,465
If you don't,
I'll say you're my boyfriend.

379
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,592
You'll be all over the Internet.

380
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,137
I'm getting gimbap with Gong-sil.

381
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,765
You should come, too.

382
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:09,933
You're friends.

383
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:13,853
Kang Woo!

384
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,794
That looks good enough.

385
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,049
Let's go. Let's show it to Gong-sil.

386
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:47,887
Show her that this color
and this color are the same.

387
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,310
SPECIAL CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER

388
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,814
Really? Then let's get gimbap
another time.

389
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,067
Okay. I'll go ahead.

390
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,701
Is Mr. Joo still here?

391
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,208
Is he not in?

392
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,754
Oh, my gosh.

393
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,007
I thought you were a ghost.

394
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,134
You'd like it better
if I were a ghost, right?

395
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,388
Then you don't have to mind
other people and have me to yourself.

396
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,392
If you were a ghost,
you'd be the one clinging onto me.

397
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,519
I'm popular with ghosts.

398
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:40,023
I heard that ghosts
see me as a bright sun.

399
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,817
I'm not a ghost, so why am I like this?

400
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,986
-What?
-Come in.

401
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,159
Sit down.

402
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,585
Tae Gong-sil, would you like to be Candy?

403
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,213
Leave your house. I'll get you a place.

404
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,299
You'll need a car, too. Just choose one.

405
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,301
Do you want to study more?
Do it. I'll pay for it.

406
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,346
Do you have a big ghost to catch?

407
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,390
Gong-sil, if you were a normal person,

408
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,685
you should either thank me
or ask me why I'm doing this.

409
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:22,941
I don't need a big place
because ghosts will be able to hide there.

410
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:28,363
And I know how to drive but I can't
because something might jump out.

411
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,657
I did think about studying.

412
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,243
I think I can take exams now
even if ghosts are around.

413
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,538
None of your answers can be calculated.

414
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:42,001
I want our relationship to be very clear.

415
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,214
I push you away as you're poor
and you cling to me as I'm rich.

416
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,383
And people try to pull us apart.
That would be easier.

417
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,677
If I offer to buy you a house and a car,

418
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,346
make a clear response
that I can understand.

419
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:58,476
Mentioning ghosts when my aunt
insults you makes me too confused.

420
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,769
Just be Candy.

421
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:04,065
Then I will be able
to get rid of you for sure.

422
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,859
I'm not scared if the ending is clear.

423
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,489
So, you want me to make it
easy for you to get rid of me.

424
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:15,702
If I go into your world and become
the one and only person to you,

425
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:19,414
then I can't tell you to get lost.

426
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:26,838
Be like Candy, so I can treat you easily.

427
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:31,300
Please come play with me in here, okay?

428
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:35,138
If I become Candy,
you can tell me to get lost.

429
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,349
I don't want to do it.

430
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:39,976
What should I do, then?

431
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,064
I said I'm getting married and you said
you'll move into the basement.

432
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,110
I told you to be Candy
and you won't do that, either.

433
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:54,782
Will you keep going on until I become
a goat and tell you to eat me?

434
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,160
I don't even wish for that.

435
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,370
Why are you having such a hard time?

436
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,041
Are you scared that I might like you?

437
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,128
I don't like you.

438
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:11,883
I'll go get the ghost, just like I did
at the hotel swimming pool.

439
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,350
It's not here. Just go home.

440
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,186
Let's go.

441
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,777
Look.

442
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,865
You don't even ask why,
even though I said horrible things.

443
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:43,456
Actually, I met a really scary lady
on my way here.

444
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,001
Let's go.

445
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,174
Where did you see her?

446
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,927
At the entrance.
It must be her first time here.

447
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,679
We should keep holding hands, then.

448
00:34:59,097 --> 00:34:59,931
Yes.

449
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,558
If you're uncomfortable,
I can just hold your finger.

450
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,023
Did you see anything else
while I was away?

451
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,985
I did but I held your pen
and got through it.

452
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,070
My pen?

453
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,157
Oh, the charm.

454
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,750
I have been thinking.

455
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:32,755
I got through a week
by holding onto your pen.

456
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:38,719
I think I'll be able to leave
before you tell me to get lost.

457
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,347
So, don't worry too much.

458
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,224
There will be an end to this.

459
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,786
I guess she didn't find the necklace.

460
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,924
Am I such a big burden to him?

461
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,772
Everyone stay alert.
After China, it's the US.

462
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,524
I'll give you three years.

463
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,111
If you can't keep up,
you can go to Giant Mall.

464
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,070
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

465
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,990
Get a hold of Giant Mall's blueprints
and analyze it.

466
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:44,452
Make the front side a mirror,
so that it's dazzling and beautiful.

467
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,705
That girl stayed at a suite room
with Mr. Joo at the hotel.

468
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,165
-A suite room?
-Yes.

469
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,167
He booked the whole pool, too.

470
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,919
-Who?
-Over there.

471
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,386
But she got dumped.

472
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,889
He's marrying someone else.

473
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,352
-My gosh.
-I knew it.

474
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,271
I envy her, though.

475
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,065
Why would you envy her?

476
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,026
They're talking about me.

477
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,986
I would marry someone else, too.

478
00:37:54,647 --> 00:38:00,945
How can you be so elegant,
graceful, and noble?

479
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,695
This is so good.

480
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,780
Try it.

481
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,996
You're so vulgar
and such a voracious eater.

482
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,044
What is it this time?

483
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,379
You said I was dirty
for going to the bathroom too often.

484
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,800
Why are you picking
on everything that I do?

485
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,470
How can you be so small-minded?

486
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,097
I've lost my appetite.

487
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,518
Gosh.

488
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,235
Her name's Gong-sil, too.

489
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,448
I know Dooly but I didn't know Gong-sil.

490
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,661
You seemed down, so I brought Gong-sil
to cheer Gong-sil up.

491
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,789
Thank you.

492
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,210
She looks so much like Dooly.

493
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,380
Gong-sil's boyfriend is Dooly.

494
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:43,756
Really?

495
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,345
Please take care of Gong-sil.

496
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:52,098
Okay, I will make reservations.

497
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,557
See you then.

498
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,939
This is your office?

499
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,858
It's so tacky.

500
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,486
I heard we're having
a high school reunion.

501
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,322
Everyone wants to see you.
Don't you want to go?

502
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:10,741
I'll go.

503
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,202
I should go to such things.

504
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:17,164
Really? I'll text you
when we set the time and place.

505
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,960
There's something
I'm really curious about.

506
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,089
What is your relationship with Mr. Joo?

507
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,051
Just believe what you see.

508
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,097
I heard you tried to seduce him
but got rejected.

509
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,890
That's what people say.

510
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,226
If that's how it looks,
I guess that's what it is.

511
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,727
That's too bad.

512
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:43,649
Mr. Joo had that curse
of his first love or something.

513
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:48,112
His marriages always got canceled, but
it seems it'll really happen this time.

514
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,740
Why did the curse have to be lifted
when you were trying to seduce him?

515
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:54,743
I know.

516
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,663
What is that?

517
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,624
Gong-sil. Her name is Gong-sil, too.

518
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,922
Is this a fake Dooly?

519
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,884
No, her boyfriend is Dooly.

520
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:39,788
Yes, I will be at the airport
when you arrive.

521
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,999
Okay, see you then.

522
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,255
I might have to stay
for a while this time.

523
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,969
If she's alive, I will find her.

524
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:03,354
They say that Mr. Joo is cursed
by the ghost of Cha Hui-ju.

525
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,482
It was always mentioned
when there were talks of marriage.

526
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,818
People are probably
talking about it again.

527
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:14,031
But Cha Hui-ju isn't a curse to him.
She's just an old wound.

528
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,324
If it's an old wound,

529
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,702
he should want someone to come cure it.

530
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:23,582
But he keeps pushing people away.
It's really like a curse.

531
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,086
You're right. He keeps saying, "Get lost."

532
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,838
Someone who says they will never change,

533
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,841
and someone who doesn't leave
even if they're told to get lost.

534
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:36,387
Who do you think will win if they fight?

535
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,848
Are you talking about Mr. Joo and me?

536
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,059
I'm totally on your side.

537
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,606
I heard you have
a high school reunion tomorrow.

538
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,858
Where will it be?

539
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,992
I made reservations for your meeting
with Park Seo-hyun.

540
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:02,162
It's been a week.
Are you ending this marriage?

541
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,915
Are you going to continue this?

542
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,712
I know what you're thinking, Mr. Kim.

543
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,006
I'm not going to tell you.

544
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:35,738
Honey.

545
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,789
Why is she acting like this
towards me these days?

546
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,388
You should break it.
You'll become possessed.

547
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,025
It's your engagement present.
You should keep it here.

548
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,361
Is my aunt acting strangely?

549
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,946
Since she brought this home,
she's been looking down on me.

550
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,824
And whatever I do,
she says I have no dignity or class.

551
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,951
She even said she doesn't want to see me.

552
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,663
Normally, she would never say that to me.

553
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,835
That lady said that we should break it
if something goes wrong.

554
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:35,964
It makes me uncomfortable
but it's not like I can break it.

555
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,634
Did Tae Gong-sil

556
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:40,969
tell you to break this?

557
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,304
Yes, she did.

558
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:47,434
How can we break it when you're
not going to break the engagement?

559
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,063
You should take care of it.

560
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,611
I'll break this
and tell her to take responsibility.

561
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,327
You said it should be broken.

562
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,498
-Shall I break it?
-Is your aunt in a bad state?

563
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,209
It's really bad.

564
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,629
She's very sick. She can't even get up.

565
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,508
Shall I break this or not?

566
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,927
You should break it, but...

567
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,305
If I break this, the engagement
will be broken off, too.

568
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:26,390
Shall I break it or not?

569
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,560
Then you can't break it.

570
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,273
My aunt is in a really bad state.

571
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,191
She's dying.

572
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,486
She's my only aunt.

573
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,031
Then you should break it.

574
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,201
Okay, I'll listen to you and break this.

575
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,203
If my engagement is broken,
you'll be held responsible.

576
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,455
Why should I be held responsible?

577
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,291
Because you are the reason
I'm breaking this.

578
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,585
-I'm breaking it.
-Mr. Joo.

579
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,263
Honey!

580
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,932
-What?
-Honey!

581
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,311
Are you okay?

582
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,521
What was it?

583
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,565
There's nothing here.

584
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:26,867
Gong-sil, you told him to break it
because of the ghost.

585
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:30,204
But he'll think you said it
to break his engagement.

586
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,041
It's not what you meant, right?

587
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:40,339
I can finally understand
what this looks like to other people.

588
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:43,884
What shall I do?

589
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,224
Kang Woo.

590
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:53,644
Is something here?

591
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,689
Gong-sil and Gong-sil were talking.

592
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,735
It's been a week. How do you feel?

593
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,613
Do you think you can do without him?

594
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:08,242
I'm not sure if I can do without him.

595
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,411
But I know what it will look like
if she's next to him.

596
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:19,503
Gong-sil looks the best
when she's next to Dooly.

597
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:27,511
It's your reunion today, right?
Seung-mo said you're very nervous.

598
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,473
You're right.
I haven't seen them in a long time.

599
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,894
Don't women boast
about their boyfriends when they meet?

600
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:38,438
I guess so.

601
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:42,150
Then you should boast
about your boyfriend, too.

602
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,111
Who? Dooly?

603
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:47,531
If Dooly turns up there,
your friends will be shocked.

604
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,912
I think I liked Ddochi better then Dooly.

605
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,373
That won't do.

606
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,919
I should tell Dooly to go there
to prove his worth.

607
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,637
Mr. Kang.

608
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:14,641
-You're going to the airport today, right?
-Yes.

609
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,393
Do you have plans afterward?

610
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,645
Are you meeting Ms. Tae?

611
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:20,772
Yes.

612
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,493
You know a lot of people.

613
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,788
Tell them Gong-sil and Mr. Joo
aren't in a relationship.

614
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,915
Who's spreading such rumors?

615
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:43,712
I know, I wonder who it is.
People talk so much these days.

616
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:48,133
I think it's someone on the security team
who reports to Mr. Do.

617
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,134
Really?

618
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:52,929
I don't think anyone
on our team has such a big mouth.

619
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,016
Find out who it is. I will destroy him.

620
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,895
If you find out who it is,
I will give you free coffee.

621
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:01,480
Eat this.

622
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,025
Here you are, Lee Han-ju.

623
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,111
Mr. Do wants you in his office
after lunchtime is over.

624
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:16,828
-Why does Mr. Do want to see you?
-I don't know. I wonder why.

625
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,832
You should go find out
who the big mouth is.

626
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,584
Okay.

627
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,753
-Okay?
-I should go. I'll take this to go.

628
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,267
Honey.

629
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,230
What is it this time?

630
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:47,025
You eat the noodles with such might.

631
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,278
I fell for your sexy lips.

632
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:54,866
You're back.

633
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:00,539
I guess breaking the jar
like she said was effective.

634
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:04,459
Why did Jung-won
break the engagement gift?

635
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,585
I don't know.

636
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,338
Was he going to call it off?

637
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,340
-Honey.
-Right.

638
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:15,345
Your brother's returning today.
It's been a year.

639
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:19,641
He can't be coming
to help Jung-won get married.

640
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,727
Does he have other business?

641
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,532
It's been a long time, Kang Woo.

642
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:37,659
Let's go.

643
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,043
Thanks to you, everything worked out.

644
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,922
I would have liked to go ahead
with the marriage if it was okay with you.

645
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,842
It's a shame you want to end it here.

646
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,302
We're not losing anything here.

647
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:59,473
We started it is as a business deal
and we both gained quite a lot.

648
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:04,102
Let's calculate how much
each of us gained.

649
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,199
-It's been a long time.
-Right.

650
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:20,410
-We saw you often on TV, though.
-Let's meet often.

651
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,037
You're still so pretty.

652
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,955
Hey! Big Sun!

653
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:27,167
-Hey!
-It's been such a long time.

654
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,084
Hi.

655
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,546
-Come sit here.
-Wow.

656
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,883
-Oh, my gosh.
-Are you okay?

657
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,179
What's wrong?

658
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,390
No, I'm okay.

659
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:53,610
We're breaking up, so I guess
we can't meet often for business.

660
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:59,074
Does this mean I'm also a victim
of your curse?

661
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,993
It's famous.

662
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:06,039
Kingdom's president Joo Jung-won
is cursed by his late first love.

663
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,335
This is your fourth
broken engagement, right?

664
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,755
I hope the curse is lifted next time.

665
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:27,936
She said she is the fourth victim
of my curse.

666
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:32,691
I should gather all my cursed fiancées
and play a game of poker.

667
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,651
It won't be much fun.

668
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,321
They were all chased away by you.

669
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:43,952
Being unable to accept anyone
is the curse.

670
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:45,954
If you don't change,

671
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,707
the curse won't be lifted.

672
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:58,717
I kept you by Jung-won's side
because of this photograph.

673
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:00,927
This is Maria.

674
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:05,307
I found this photo
in one of her old photo albums.

675
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,394
Who do you think this is?

676
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,985
It's Cha Hui-ju.
Where was this taken? England?

677
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,947
Yes, someone who looks
just like her was in England.

678
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,450
It was a year after Cha Hui-ju died.

679
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,787
Does that mean Cha Hui-ju is alive?

680
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:34,586
You said Jung-won met the late
Cha Hui-ju through Tae Gong-sil.

681
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:42,302
I found Cha Hui-ju alive in Europe.

682
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:47,223
Do you think Cha Hui-ju had a twin?

683
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,351
That's the most possible explanation.

684
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:54,230
But I found something very strange.

685
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,362
What are these?

686
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:08,578
Christmas cards the two women
in the photo exchanged for ten years.

687
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:15,794
This woman moved around the globe a lot.

688
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,296
According to the dates,

689
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:23,927
she spent three years in LA,
four in New York, and three in Beijing.

690
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:28,223
My son spent most of his life
abroad after the kidnapping.

691
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:33,812
Three years in LA, four in New York,
and three in Beijing.

692
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:40,318
Did this woman follow Joo Jung-won around?

693
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:44,823
In the last card,
she wrote that she's returning to Korea.

694
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:50,537
That was five years ago.
Jung-won also returned to Korea then.

695
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:57,085
Do you think she is staying
somewhere near Joo Jung-won?

696
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:00,005
Yes, I think Cha Hui-ju is alive.

697
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,091
And she is following Jung-won around.

698
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,678
And I think she will be
near him right now.

699
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,129
Who was that? I haven't seen her before.

700
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,881
She moved here recently.

701
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:08,990
It's Tae Gong-sil.

702
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:14,162
I guess this is where she's having
her high school reunion.

703
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:19,125
Your father just arrived at the hotel.

704
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:24,964
Mr. Kang will come here soon.
Would you like to talk to him?

705
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:29,260
I'll talk to my father in person.
Don't tell Mr. Kang to come here.

706
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:33,932
I didn't ask him to come.
He's coming to meet Ms. Tae.

707
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,186
I guess he's going to join the reunion.

708
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:44,526
Ms. Tae should be pretty proud
in front of her friends.

709
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,070
Her boyfriend is very handsome and tall.

710
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:59,791
So, you were in an accident.
Are you okay now?

711
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,001
Yes, I've become much better.

712
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:05,588
It's such a shame
that you didn't finish school.

713
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,216
Is there an age limit
to returning to finish your studies?

714
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,426
I still have some time, but...

715
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:13,096
Gong-sil. Tell us about yourself.

716
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,889
Don't you work at Kingdom?

717
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:19,602
Is the president of that company
really your boyfriend?

718
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,904
Tell them what you told me.

719
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,616
How you tried to seduce him
and how you got rejected.

720
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:47,547
You're right.
I met a really rich and great guy.

721
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:49,924
How?

722
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:55,346
It was a rainy day
and I got a ride in a nice car.

723
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,267
And he was the president of Kingdom.

724
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:02,479
I had to meet him again,
so I went to see him.

725
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,233
I knew I had to have him.

726
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:10,778
So, I got a part-time job
and kept clinging to him.

727
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:19,204
I said I was lonely and sad
and he started to give me attention.

728
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,043
Your shelter is here. Hide.

729
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:29,631
He helped me and stayed with me
whenever I had a hard time.

730
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:35,970
He even booked
the whole hotel swimming pool for me.

731
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:45,021
How do I seem to you after hearing that?

732
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:48,483
-I'm so jealous.
-You must be so happy.

733
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:53,029
So? The ending is important.

734
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:04,499
He's going to marry a rich girl soon.

735
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:06,584
Gosh.

736
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,170
I knew it.

737
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:14,634
But I'm still not leaving his side.

738
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,512
I can't leave him.

739
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:20,765
But that's...

740
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,853
I don't care if I seem
a little foolish or shameless.

741
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:32,360
To me, he is a special person.
The only one in the world.

742
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,435
That would be me.

743
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,606
Tae Gong-sil, I just broke off
my engagement because of you.

744
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,613
So, you should take responsibility.

745
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:18,823
Let's go.

746
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:21,868
What are you doing here?

747
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:26,831
You're finally making a clear
response. Shall I do the same?

748
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,920
My baby must be very upset.

749
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,715
I need to calm her,
so I'll pay for your dinner.

750
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:38,885
I hope you have a fun time together.

751
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,680
My baby. Shall we go now?

752
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,059
Let's go.

753
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,314
-Oh, my gosh.
-I can't believe it.

754
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,400
-He's awesome.
-I'm so jealous.

755
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,028
What are they doing?

756
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:09,999
Without the radar and shelter,
people understand our relationship.

757
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:13,920
Stop it. I get it.
This is me in your world.

758
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,174
Tae Gong-sil.

759
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,510
What's wrong?

760
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:24,180
What's wrong? Did something happen?

761
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:25,765
No.

762
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:33,064
I was taking her home.

763
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,026
Kang Woo.

764
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,990
What's going on? Why is she upset?
Why is Mr. Joo here?

765
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,659
He broke off his engagement
because of her.

766
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,536
He came to tell her
to take responsibility.

767
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,834
What about you? Why did you come here?

768
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:56,337
Did you come because of her, too?

769
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,842
-Yes.
-Do you really like Tae Gong-sil?

770
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,345
Yes.

771
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:09,934
Will you stop asking me
to be your boyfriend now?

772
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,785
You said you'll let me use you.

773
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,621
I just need a small hole
to breathe through.

774
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,125
Are you so scared that I would want more?

775
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,209
Yes, I'm scared.

776
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,755
Can you really protect me
without any other intentions?

777
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,966
Can you protect me as your marble shelter?

778
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:44,635
And finally get lost
when you can breathe on your own?

779
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,764
I said I would. And I still feel that way.

780
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:52,602
-Can I believe that?
-I may feel really hurt by your actions.

781
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:56,564
But I will jump into your arms
if something scary appears.

782
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:00,109
That's how I am.
It's not like you don't know it.

783
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,780
Okay, good. I will believe you.

784
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,032
I am going to do as I wish from now on.

785
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,326
You should handle everything on your own.

786
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:11,662
Thank you. I can handle anything.

787
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,580
Really?

788
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,917
Then you should handle this first.

789
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,378
Gong-sil.

790
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,881
I think I love you.

791
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,219
What will you do now?

792
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,658
