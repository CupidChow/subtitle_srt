1
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:24,712
- Finish this up for me, will you?
- Yes, ma’am.

2
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:29,902
Bea.

3
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:39,104
Get up so you can have
breakfast with your dad.

4
00:01:41,295 --> 00:01:44,048
I’ll forward to you my itinerary
so you’ll know where to find me.

5
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:47,962
I’ll be in New York, LA,
then San Fo are my routes.

6
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:49,547
It’s really a tight schedule.

7
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:52,269
Lots of meetings.

8
00:01:52,294 --> 00:01:54,422
Meet-ups with college frat members.

9
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,615
That’s good.

10
00:01:56,088 --> 00:01:59,675
At least, you’ll have time
to relax and not just work.

11
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:04,703
Can you drop by mom at the hospital
before you head to the airport?

12
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:05,868
Love, sorry.

13
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,938
With the traffic,
I might not make it to my flight.

14
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:12,362
Get her a get-well-soon gift for me.
Charge it to my credit card.

15
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:16,907
Dad, you’ll be gone for a while.

16
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:19,370
I’ll try to get back
as soon as I can.

17
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,391
You already got your allowance, right?

18
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:25,491
Don’t give her more than what she needs.
She might end up loafing around.

19
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,323
Come straight home from school, okay?

20
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:30,113
Okay.

21
00:02:30,962 --> 00:02:32,010
You better eat.

22
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:34,625
I’ll have breakfast at school.

23
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:39,613
You’re too lenient with her.

24
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:41,424
You’re too strict with her.

25
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:45,252
I loaded all your stuff in the car.

26
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:47,580
- Thank you.
- Okay, have a safe flight.

27
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:49,440
- Take care.
- Alright. I’ll call you later.

28
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:51,331
- Bye.
- Alright. Bye.

29
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:53,456
Bye.

30
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:23,766
I have something to tell you, girls.

31
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:25,351
- Spill the tea.
- What is it?

32
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:27,770
I actually slipped right
in front of my crush.

33
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,873
- Oh my god!
- And that’s how I met him.

34
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:31,923
Really?

35
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:37,780
Wait. I told my mom I have a boyfriend
during graduation. She said, “Okay.”

36
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:39,406
I envy you.

37
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:41,784
I wish we can all be like you.

38
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:43,227
I want to have a boyfriend, too.

39
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:44,628
Me, too.

40
00:03:44,653 --> 00:03:47,281
But I can’t have one yet.

41
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:56,804
Mom,

42
00:03:57,122 --> 00:03:59,487
Bernard bought you a gift.

43
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:03,102
He can’t visit you
since he’s busy right now.

44
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:04,546
Let him be.

45
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:12,671
Let's see... Wow! What a nice bag.
Thank him for me.

46
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:15,003
I’ll use this when I go ballroom dancing.

47
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:17,956
And I’m ready for my Zumba session
when I get out of here on Wednesday.

48
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:19,579
Zumba session?

49
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:22,050
I thought Bea is coming with you.

50
00:04:22,897 --> 00:04:24,982
I don’t know what’s up with her.

51
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,933
You had a spat with her again?

52
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,441
I don’t understand her.

53
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:35,471
She keeps silent when I talk to her.
She can be really stubborn at times.

54
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:38,397
It’s just a phase.

55
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:42,190
You were stubborn too
when you were her age.

56
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:57,710
- I said no! Let go of me! It’s painful!
- Please take your meds and stay calm.

57
00:04:57,735 --> 00:05:00,754
- I don’t want to take my meds!
- You need to take it.

58
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:02,923
- My body is aching all over.
- Please stay calm, ma’am.

59
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:05,676
- Get out of my room!
- Please stay calm, ma’am.

60
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:09,722
Don’t make me!
I don’t want to. Leave!

61
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:12,624
- Ma’am…
- Just get out and leave me alone!

62
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:18,198
Just leave me alone!
Why don’t you listen to me? Leave!

63
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:20,767
Get out! Just get out of my room!

64
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:25,088
Don’t make me!
I don’t want to. Leave!

65
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:41,651
Knock, knock.

66
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:51,002
Chona?

67
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:58,362
Chona?

68
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:06,518
Who’s there?

69
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:16,159
I missed you.

70
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:18,510
I missed you, too.

71
00:06:20,274 --> 00:06:21,932
Why was it so hard
to look for you?

72
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:26,503
It’s really hard to look for someone
who doesn’t want to be found.

73
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:29,837
Besides, I don’t do social media.

74
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,940
Why are you here?

75
00:06:47,594 --> 00:06:49,550
Well…

76
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,784
I’m sick.

77
00:06:56,855 --> 00:06:57,971
You go first.

78
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,057
I worked for a while after college.

79
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:05,011
After I married Bernard
and we had a kid...

80
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,261
I gave in to his request for me

81
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,925
to be a full-time housewife.

82
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:12,784
How about you?

83
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:22,003
As always, I had to put my career first.
I got into a lot of businesses.

84
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,957
Then when I realized

85
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:28,026
I wanted to have a family...

86
00:07:29,644 --> 00:07:31,893
It was too late.
I was already sick.

87
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:35,565
You’re here in the hospital
to get treated.

88
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:37,962
You’ll get well, for sure.

89
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:40,832
I have cancer.

90
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:49,644
I’m on my third cycle
of chemo treatment.

91
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:53,737
Actually, I’ve already grown tired of it.

92
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:56,050
And if it’s time for me to go,

93
00:07:56,075 --> 00:08:00,370
I don’t want the effects of
chemotherapy seen on me.

94
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:03,487
Hey! Don’t talk like that.

95
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:06,589
We just met after so many years.

96
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:13,550
Sorry, we lost touch.

97
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,597
But that’s how life goes.

98
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:25,025
At first, we wait and see who’s going
to organize a reunion.

99
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:30,261
Then we lose interest
until we forget about it.

100
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,674
That’s what happens
to a group of friends, right?

101
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:42,338
Do you need anything?
Is there anything I can do for you?

102
00:08:54,563 --> 00:08:56,518
- You know...
- What?

103
00:08:57,526 --> 00:08:58,612
There is something.

104
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:05,552
I want our gang
to have a reunion.

105
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,690
We can meet up
and spend time together.

106
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:09,887
That’s easy.

107
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:14,119
I thought so, too.

108
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:17,151
That’s why I got into social media.

109
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:21,555
The first one I found was Gwen.

110
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,542
But she doesn’t reply to my messages.

111
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:29,518
Then I looked for Janet, Becky, and Sue.

112
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:32,057
I don’t think they do social media.

113
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:37,635
I’ll take care of it.
I’ll even have the police locate them.

114
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,440
I’m glad we met again.

115
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,073
Me too.

116
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:43,555
Oh my!

117
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:45,861
What are you doing here?

118
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,918
You scared me.

119
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:51,494
Why did you sneak in
like a cat in the dark?

120
00:10:51,543 --> 00:10:53,594
Why are you in the dark?

121
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,970
What? Well…

122
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:58,517
I was looking at something.

123
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:00,782
Geez!

124
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:03,556
Bea! I’m still talking to you.

125
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:02,797
<i>Oh okay, my gosh!</i>

126
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,580
<i>Stop messing around.</i>

127
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:07,664
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

128
00:12:07,706 --> 00:12:10,959
<i>One at a time.
Think you can beat me?</i>

129
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:13,361
<i>You’re blaming others again.</i>

130
00:12:13,386 --> 00:12:17,300
[students chattering]

131
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:18,621
Excuse me.

132
00:12:21,062 --> 00:12:22,315
<i>What’s that smell?</i>

133
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,886
Watch it!

134
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:29,831
Sorry.

135
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:33,042
I’m Annie.

136
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,323
Can I sit beside you?

137
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:39,355
Just don’t bother me.
I’m busy here.

138
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:44,333
Hey transferee,

139
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:46,449
which school
did you come from?

140
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,925
Himamaylan.

141
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,324
- Huh? Where’s that?
- Is that a school?

142
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:54,902
I think it’s by the sea.

143
00:12:55,462 --> 00:12:57,494
- I think so, too.
- Why?

144
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,183
Because you smell like dried fish.

145
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:02,292
No wonder it's smelly here!

146
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,068
She stinks!

147
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,016
Oh my god.

148
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:11,201
Ouch!

149
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,565
Stop bothering her
because she’s not bothering you.

150
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,362
Girls, let’s go.

151
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,128
Move.

152
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,995
I’m Chona.

153
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:25,809
You are?

154
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:27,649
Annie.

155
00:13:28,638 --> 00:13:30,292
Are my lashes good?

156
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,479
- Sorry.
- Forever!

157
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:38,605
Sorry.

158
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:45,182
What?

159
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:46,535
Get out of my face.

160
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,621
[students chattering]

161
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:53,253
Quiet!

162
00:13:56,598 --> 00:14:01,449
I am your class adviser
and Physics teacher.

163
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:04,612
Take my subject seriously.

164
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:05,760
Understood?

165
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:07,745
Yes, ma’am.

166
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:12,234
You gotta meet the others.

167
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,974
- They're all here.
- I don't even like your watch.

168
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,550
What? Why?

169
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:17,452
Annie, meet the gang.

170
00:14:17,477 --> 00:14:19,769
That’s Gwen.

171
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,949
The most soft-spoken of us all.

172
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:23,019
As if!

173
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:24,573
You see?

174
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:26,644
That’s Dang.

175
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:28,706
She just loves her eyelashes.

176
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:31,269
As long as you don’t touch
my eyelash curler, we’re good.

177
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:34,784
Those two are Becky and Janet.

178
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:36,152
Becky!

179
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,589
Hi! Come on.

180
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,838
Hi!

181
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:47,378
I’m Becky from New York, Cubao!

182
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:50,331
A future beauty queen.

183
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:52,417
- Go, girl!
- You’re gorgeous!

184
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:54,011
I’m Janet.

185
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:56,542
I’m the nerd who does
everyone’s homework.

186
00:14:57,715 --> 00:15:02,730
The snob earlier who’s at the corner,
that’s Sue.

187
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:06,985
She’s beautiful.

188
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,542
Sue’s a professional model

189
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:10,714
whose face has graced a lot
of magazine covers.

190
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:15,370
She earns a lot but she does not want
to spend on snacks.

191
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:18,503
She gets full on nicotine.

192
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:19,946
You want to know why?

193
00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:23,792
- Why?
- Because she’s the bomb!

194
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:25,456
Sue!

195
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:26,571
Sue!

196
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:31,198
Let’s eat.

197
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,097
[girls chattering]

198
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:35,628
How’s your new school?

199
00:15:36,774 --> 00:15:37,925
It’s fine.

200
00:15:38,282 --> 00:15:41,855
Of course, I‘m happier in my
former school in the province.

201
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:44,738
Here, I’m the only hick in my class.

202
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:46,901
Don’t mind them.

203
00:15:46,926 --> 00:15:48,988
What do you mean
you’re a hick?

204
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:55,199
Like I look tacky compared to
my classmates who look cool.

205
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:58,166
You don’t go to school
to look cool.

206
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,331
You’re there to study.

207
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:06,347
Are you ashamed that you came
from the province?

208
00:16:06,372 --> 00:16:08,714
Of course not.

209
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:15,792
You should be grateful you got
a scholarship from my company.

210
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:19,769
Or else, you won’t be able
to go to a good school.

211
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,152
Mhm!

212
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:27,535
So just focus on your studies.
And go straight home from school.

213
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,613
It’s so scary here in the city.
A lot of kids died from that disco fire.

214
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:35,738
Mom, why did our
conversation end up there?

215
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:42,636
Alright everyone, listen.

216
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:49,136
A delivery van is moving at 22.4 m/s

217
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:55,548
then skids to a halt in 2.55 seconds.

218
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,577
Now, assume the uniform acceleration.

219
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:04,980
- What is she talking about?
- What? Why are you asking me?

220
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:07,534
What is she asking for?

221
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:17,097
No one leaves
until you’ve solved the problem.

222
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,921
You have to determine
the skidding distance of the van.

223
00:17:23,157 --> 00:17:24,325
Anyone?

224
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,889
You, go ahead.

225
00:17:57,765 --> 00:17:59,476
You are correct.

226
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:02,015
You better thank Annie.

227
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:03,782
Class dismissed.

228
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:05,476
[girls cheering]

229
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,968
- You're so smart!
- You’re the bomb!

230
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:10,000
Annie’s a genius.

231
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:21,640
Ramos…

232
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,414
Okay. Gwen…

233
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,547
Criselda…

234
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:39,656
Rodriguez?

235
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,999
And so we move on
to our third quarter sales.

236
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:50,639
We were able to hit
our target for this quarter.

237
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:51,709
Applause, everyone.

238
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:58,408
Therefore we are getting not only
commissions but also incentives!

239
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,368
Great job, everyone!

240
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:01,567
However,

241
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,953
we also have some bad news.

242
00:19:03,978 --> 00:19:11,687
We can see from this performance chart
that not all of you have hit their targets.

243
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,844
Yes, Miss Dang Rodriguez?

244
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:16,054
Sir?

245
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:17,851
What’s your excuse this time?

246
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:20,378
Oh, someone’s calling me, sir.
It might be a client.

247
00:19:20,403 --> 00:19:23,365
- It might be a client.
- A client? Go ahead, take the call.

248
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,836
Excuse me.

249
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:28,758
Hello? Advisor Dang here.

250
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,644
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Who’s this?

251
00:19:31,073 --> 00:19:32,890
<i>Dang, this is Annie.</i>

252
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,531
Annie?

253
00:19:34,848 --> 00:19:36,367
<i>It's Annie!</i>

254
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,538
- Annie who?
- <i>From the Sunny gang.</i>

255
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:42,164
<i>So, how's your lashes?</i>

256
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,929
Hey, Annie!

257
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,718
Oh, yes! Yes!

258
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,890
Yes, Ma’am Annie. Yes.
Thank you!

259
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:54,125
Sir, it’s a closed deal!

260
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:58,023
Wow, good job!

261
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,444
Come on!

262
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:02,238
Hold on.
I’m impressed with your setup.

263
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:03,740
- There’s no hidden camera.
- Where’s the camera?

264
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:06,017
- I told you, there’s none.
- I know there is.

265
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:08,753
Dang, it’s not a prank.

266
00:20:08,781 --> 00:20:10,109
It’s not a prank.

267
00:20:11,553 --> 00:20:12,608
Chona?

268
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:16,934
You even put on makeup to look sick.

269
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,961
I’m impressed.
You two are good.

270
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:20,863
- I’m so impressed.
- You better sit first.

271
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:24,176
- It’s a prank. I knew it!
- Sit down first.

272
00:20:24,201 --> 00:20:26,203
You two did well with the setup!

273
00:20:26,228 --> 00:20:28,453
And the makeup...
Bring out the hidden camera!

274
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,437
Do you want me to pull out
your lashes?

275
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,515
Tell me.
It’s a prank, right?

276
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:37,328
It’s not?

277
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,538
It’s not.

278
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,570
You’re so insistent.

279
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,758
How come you only showed up now?

280
00:20:52,783 --> 00:20:54,524
How come you never showed up?

281
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:59,390
I was trying to hide
from my creditors.

282
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:00,958
Forgive me, okay?

283
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:02,818
- Hey!
- Hm?

284
00:21:02,843 --> 00:21:07,348
What are we going to do?

285
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:09,098
Nothing.

286
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,071
I just want to see you.

287
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:13,042
That’s it?

288
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,789
She wants the gang
to be together again.

289
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:18,495
Help me make that happen.

290
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,842
Of course,

291
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:24,204
I’ll help you.

292
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:26,726
I’ll help you.

293
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:36,898
You can pull out one of her lashes now.

294
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,006
Would that make you happy?

295
00:21:59,737 --> 00:22:00,804
Oh god!

296
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:04,961
Mom, where’s my assignment notebook?

297
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:06,841
Uh...

298
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:10,062
Is it not in your room?

299
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,412
Perhaps, it’s in your bag?

300
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:15,272
I’ve looked everywhere.
I can’t find it.

301
00:22:15,297 --> 00:22:17,789
You have?
Did you check your drawer?

302
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:19,566
Maybe it’s here.

303
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:21,000
Or maybe here.

304
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,257
Uhm…

305
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,234
Or maybe here.
Here it is!

306
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:28,843
Have you had breakfast?

307
00:22:29,377 --> 00:22:30,836
I don’t feel like eating.

308
00:22:33,273 --> 00:22:34,457
Mom!

309
00:22:34,482 --> 00:22:36,140
Mom!

310
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:39,629
- What is it?
- Mom!

311
00:22:39,654 --> 00:22:42,554
I’ll be late for school.

312
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:43,633
What is it, then?

313
00:22:43,658 --> 00:22:45,660
Where’s my sweater, mom?

314
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:49,234
I told you to prepare your things
the night before

315
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:53,121
so you don’t panic in the morning.

316
00:22:53,979 --> 00:22:55,640
Thanks, mom.

317
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,664
Granny!

318
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,166
- Thanks.
- Take care.

319
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:01,359
- I will, granny.
- Take care.

320
00:23:01,384 --> 00:23:04,078
- Bye, dad.
- Take care.

321
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:33,277
When you’re done, leave your test paper
on my desk and you may go.

322
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:03,131
What are we going to do?

323
00:24:03,164 --> 00:24:04,665
We’ll just scare them off.

324
00:24:04,772 --> 00:24:06,524
Piece of cake.
Leave it to me.

325
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:08,552
I’ll teach these assholes a lesson.

326
00:24:09,435 --> 00:24:11,846
Asshole? What’s that?

327
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:13,685
You better stop asking questions.

328
00:24:14,397 --> 00:24:16,130
I don’t wanna get wounded, okay?

329
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,974
Are we getting into a brawl?
I might lose my scholarship for this.

330
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:23,005
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

331
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,935
Wait. My ulcer is acting up.
Does anyone have some crackers?

332
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,093
I’m on a diet.

333
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:30,238
Girls, let’s go!

334
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:33,207
There’s seven of them,
and seven of us, okay?

335
00:24:33,888 --> 00:24:34,965
- Let’s go?
- We’re ready!

336
00:24:35,071 --> 00:24:36,612
Come on!

337
00:24:57,815 --> 00:25:00,702
- Are you guys ready?
- What is it this time?

338
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,935
This is my last warning to you.

339
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,167
Warning? Are you
the school principal?

340
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:07,686
That’s enough!

341
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:09,877
You talk too much.
Let’s do this!

342
00:25:10,516 --> 00:25:12,518
Or are you scared to fight us?

343
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,374
Your faces scare us more.

344
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:16,510
You all look like you belong
in a horror movie.

345
00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:17,536
Why you…

346
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:20,413
- Hey! Chill.
- Don’t mind her.

347
00:25:20,438 --> 00:25:23,024
And you.
You think you look beautiful?

348
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:25,293
You look like the Queen
of Manila Zoo.

349
00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:27,195
Is that so?

350
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,803
You shitface!

351
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:32,436
You used cornstarch slurry on your hair
instead of hairspray.

352
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:37,056
Stop bothering us, will you?

353
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,237
Stop meddling in our affairs first.

354
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:40,805
Sure.

355
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:45,405
We’d stop meddling as long as you stop
harassing our classmates. Deal?

356
00:25:46,065 --> 00:25:48,234
That’s none of your business!

357
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:49,952
Who do you think you are?
The police?

358
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:53,657
What’s...

359
00:25:53,867 --> 00:25:55,202
What’s with her?

360
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:58,660
What’s with her?

361
00:26:00,795 --> 00:26:02,241
You better leave.

362
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,880
She looks like
she’s being possessed.

363
00:26:08,421 --> 00:26:10,178
Please don’t enter her body!

364
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:12,147
Please don’t!

365
00:26:12,729 --> 00:26:15,315
Don’t possess her body!

366
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:17,186
No!

367
00:26:17,606 --> 00:26:19,839
Please don’t!

368
00:26:19,864 --> 00:26:21,295
Don’t be scared, okay?

369
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:28,842
Not here.

370
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:31,967
Someone might hear it!
Don’t do it here.

371
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:33,779
Don’t do it here.

372
00:26:39,513 --> 00:26:41,304
Oh! Same thing happened
in The Exorcist.

373
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:44,248
- No!
- The girl throws up then her head turns.

374
00:26:44,273 --> 00:26:45,647
Let’s go!

375
00:26:46,014 --> 00:26:49,003
We’re leaving! Come on!

376
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:51,071
You’re lucky.

377
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,484
I need to go home
now to watch T.G.I.S.

378
00:26:55,509 --> 00:26:57,436
- Come on!
- We’re not done yet!

379
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,655
T.G.I.S (Thank God It’s Saturday)?

380
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,420
Today’s not Saturday.

381
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:03,225
<i>Hasta la vista!</i>

382
00:27:03,676 --> 00:27:04,835
Bye.

383
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:06,795
Hey.

384
00:27:07,018 --> 00:27:08,103
Are you alright?

385
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,536
What’s the matter with you?

386
00:27:09,688 --> 00:27:12,190
Were you possessed
by the Child Jesus?

387
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:14,327
Maybe by Lucifer?

388
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:17,256
That was some great acting.
You even threw up.

389
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:20,116
I told you my ulcer
was acting up.

390
00:27:20,383 --> 00:27:23,108
I throw up when my tummy
becomes hyper-acidic.

391
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:24,561
Aren’t we going to eat yet?

392
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:26,092
Geez!

393
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,808
You scared me.
Come on, let’s eat.

394
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,060
I’ll pay for your snack.
Let’s go!

395
00:27:29,085 --> 00:27:30,639
- Pay for mine, too.
- No way!

396
00:27:30,664 --> 00:27:32,499
- Are you sure you weren’t possessed?
- You were great.

397
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:35,116
I told you Ellen’s
gang are wimps. Right?

398
00:27:35,515 --> 00:27:37,642
- Especially the short one.
- She’s cocky.

399
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:38,876
- But they’re scared of us, right?
- Hey!

400
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:41,836
We should have
an official name for our gang

401
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:44,288
that best represents us.

402
00:27:44,313 --> 00:27:45,702
What do you think?

403
00:27:45,727 --> 00:27:46,903
Right?

404
00:27:46,928 --> 00:27:50,147
What if it’s “Saved By The Spirit”?

405
00:27:50,172 --> 00:27:54,256
How about “The Beauty And The Best”?

406
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:57,131
I know. “Hungry Girls”.

407
00:27:57,386 --> 00:27:58,971
That’s just you.

408
00:27:59,901 --> 00:28:01,110
Hmm...

409
00:28:02,112 --> 00:28:04,721
How about “The Bombs”?

410
00:28:04,746 --> 00:28:05,997
“The Bombs”?

411
00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:10,818
Corny!
I have a better one. “Girllash”

412
00:28:10,843 --> 00:28:12,637
- “Girllash”?
- Nice, right?

413
00:28:12,662 --> 00:28:16,290
But it only represents you,
not all of us.

414
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:17,851
You’re tacky.

415
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:21,956
You’re a fine one to say.

416
00:28:22,013 --> 00:28:23,370
I’ve got it!

417
00:28:25,156 --> 00:28:26,323
“Sunny”.

418
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,471
Sanib? Possessed?
That’s just Annie.

419
00:28:28,704 --> 00:28:30,121
Sunny!

420
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:31,800
- My bad.
- Don’t you think it’s nice?

421
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:33,749
Sunny, it suits all of us.

422
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:36,902
We’re all warm, happy, and bright.

423
00:28:37,102 --> 00:28:38,748
What do you think?

424
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:40,245
Sue, what do you say?

425
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,355
Is it fine with you?

426
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:42,533
Whatever.

427
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,469
So it’s “Sunny,” then.

428
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:47,800
- Great! So everyone agrees then?
- Sunny?

429
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:50,714
- Sunny!
- Sunny!

430
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:53,386
- Let’s go.
- You’re a genius.

431
00:28:53,411 --> 00:28:58,691
[background chatter]

432
00:28:58,716 --> 00:29:00,839
Truth or Dare?

433
00:29:02,315 --> 00:29:03,393
Dare?

434
00:29:03,418 --> 00:29:05,042
Whoa!

435
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:06,234
Dance for us.

436
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:07,927
Yes, dance for us.

437
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:09,537
But there’s no music.

438
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:10,817
Don’t be picky!

439
00:29:10,842 --> 00:29:13,362
Dance now,
or you’ll get it from me.

440
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:15,522
- Come on.
- It’s just a dance.

441
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:17,206
- Go on!
- Here I go.

442
00:29:19,778 --> 00:29:20,822
Oh!

443
00:29:23,174 --> 00:29:24,387
Is that a dance?

444
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:28,363
What are you doing?

445
00:29:28,388 --> 00:29:29,784
- Huh?
- You can stop now.

446
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:32,096
That’s how we dance back home.

447
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:34,846
- Oh, I see.
- Ah...

448
00:29:34,871 --> 00:29:36,393
- Okay.
- That was a dance?

449
00:29:36,418 --> 00:29:37,502
Hey, Dang!

450
00:29:37,728 --> 00:29:38,841
What’s for snacks?

451
00:29:38,962 --> 00:29:42,948
For sure, you’ll have Mom’s cuss words
for snacks and dinner.

452
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:45,011
You played hooky again, didn’t you?

453
00:29:45,064 --> 00:29:47,112
No, I did not.

454
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:48,434
Whose snacks are those?

455
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:49,956
They’re ours.

456
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,472
You’re stingy.

457
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,708
Sue.

458
00:29:55,237 --> 00:29:56,264
Sue.

459
00:29:56,974 --> 00:29:58,002
What?

460
00:29:58,027 --> 00:29:59,821
I saw your face
on a new magazine cover.

461
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:00,917
You looked great.

462
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:02,814
Thanks.

463
00:30:03,028 --> 00:30:05,128
Come on, guys.
Let’s play some video games.

464
00:30:30,951 --> 00:30:32,853
- Hans.
- Hello.

465
00:30:33,296 --> 00:30:34,297
Hi.

466
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:35,890
Have you had eaten yet?

467
00:30:36,623 --> 00:30:37,657
No, thanks.

468
00:30:37,695 --> 00:30:38,750
I’m good.

469
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:40,610
Okay...

470
00:30:43,726 --> 00:30:44,852
Is she a new member?

471
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:47,657
She’s Annie, a transferee.

472
00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:50,227
She’s cute.

473
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,468
Just like the rest of you.

474
00:30:53,629 --> 00:30:56,299
Hans, come on.
Stop flirting with the girls.

475
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,524
Excuse me.

476
00:30:59,146 --> 00:31:00,282
Nice meeting you.

477
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,447
- He talked to me.
- You talked to him first.

478
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:17,594
Hey, are you alright?

479
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:19,319
Why are you blushing?

480
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:21,865
- Blushing?
- Yes.

481
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:26,045
Because it’s warm here.

482
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:29,318
And you’re flushed
because you’re white?

483
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:32,219
It’s kinda warm.

484
00:31:32,244 --> 00:31:34,412
Don’t you have an electric fan here?

485
00:31:34,437 --> 00:31:36,061
We’re keeping our electric bill low.

486
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,433
- Ouch!
- Sorry.

487
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:38,500
Hey, watch your step.

488
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,044
I heard it’s a good movie.

489
00:31:40,044 --> 00:31:41,962
- So okay, wait.
- Are we good?

490
00:31:41,962 --> 00:31:43,255
Let’s head to your place.

491
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:47,006
- Let’s go.
- Come on!

492
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:56,614
"Cool Ka Lang"
Sung by: Prettier Than Pink

493
00:32:13,216 --> 00:32:16,096
Go Chona!

494
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:18,458
Here they are.

495
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:19,943
Doesn’t she look like Cinderella?

496
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,177
Try another dress.

497
00:32:21,202 --> 00:32:22,614
Annie, try another one.

498
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:24,753
Go Dang!

499
00:32:25,464 --> 00:32:27,341
Sunny.

500
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:29,380
- How cute.
- Let me see.

501
00:32:34,574 --> 00:32:36,677
- Go, go!
- Let's go!

502
00:32:41,438 --> 00:32:44,200
You look like Cinderella now.

503
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,812
Hey!

504
00:33:24,384 --> 00:33:26,358
I thought it was something serious.

505
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:42,697
Class, start by determining
the center of your face.

506
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:47,861
For today, focus on the proportion
of your sketches.

507
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:50,259
Ma’am, it’s beautiful, right?

508
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,178
Well…

509
00:33:56,512 --> 00:33:59,173
Annie, that’s so good.

510
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:02,587
I think you should consider fine arts
for your major in college.

511
00:34:03,677 --> 00:34:05,345
Thank you, ma’am.

512
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:08,009
That’s actually my dream.

513
00:34:13,338 --> 00:34:15,101
Why is Sue staring down at you?

514
00:34:15,273 --> 00:34:17,642
If looks could kill,
you’d be dead now.

515
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:19,798
I don’t know, either.

516
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:26,142
There! You see?

517
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:28,446
She’s seen our message.

518
00:34:28,738 --> 00:34:32,659
She has but she hasn’t replied to us.

519
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:34,911
Look.

520
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:36,883
- Is that so?
- Yes.

521
00:34:39,784 --> 00:34:40,910
Hold on.

522
00:34:43,185 --> 00:34:44,806
Hey Gwen,

523
00:34:44,993 --> 00:34:46,915
don’t you ignore us.

524
00:34:48,657 --> 00:34:53,806
Your looks might have changed
but we know it’s you.

525
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:58,415
We know you’ve read our messages.

526
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:08,657
Reply to us unless you want your
before-and-after photos posted online.

527
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:13,905
We’ll let netizens know

528
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:21,220
that only your scalp
and throat remain unaltered.

529
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:24,361
Isn’t that a bit harsh?

530
00:35:25,117 --> 00:35:27,345
We’re doing this for Chona.

531
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,564
Send.

532
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:29,970
For Chona.

533
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,423
There! She replied.

534
00:35:34,575 --> 00:35:35,826
Sshhh!

535
00:35:37,491 --> 00:35:40,556
My bad.

536
00:35:41,593 --> 00:35:42,978
Let’s read it.
What did she say?

537
00:35:43,003 --> 00:35:44,462
She said,

538
00:35:44,624 --> 00:35:46,376
“Let’s meet.”

539
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,356
She wants to meet with us.

540
00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:05,329
I’m so sorry for not replying
to your messages.

541
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,543
That’s okay.

542
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:16,204
Help us find Janet,
Becky, and Sue.

543
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:20,501
Sure. I know where Janet lives.

544
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:23,705
Have you kept in touch?

545
00:36:23,945 --> 00:36:33,368
Well, she called me once
to borrow money out of the blue.

546
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:35,471
Ohh…

547
00:36:35,496 --> 00:36:36,790
Is she doing fine?

548
00:36:38,224 --> 00:36:39,767
I don’t think so.

549
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:43,474
I don’t think you look
like your old self either.

550
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:45,016
Stop it.

551
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,228
You look like the
eighth wonder of the world.

552
00:36:47,253 --> 00:36:51,275
I’ve always had a beautiful face.
I just had it enhanced a bit.

553
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:53,096
- Dang.
- What?

554
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:55,584
Stop mocking Gwen.

555
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:58,900
She might get offended by you.

556
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:00,563
Seriously?

557
00:37:00,782 --> 00:37:04,760
Now, I believe that money
can really buy beauty.

558
00:37:04,785 --> 00:37:07,095
I said, stop it!

559
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,148
Why you…

560
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:11,959
Hey! Don’t you dare touch my nose!

561
00:37:14,861 --> 00:37:16,992
There you go.

562
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:19,689
That’s the real Gwen.

563
00:37:20,858 --> 00:37:22,734
I thought you were serious.

564
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:24,821
We can’t be too loud here, can we?

565
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:28,853
So, why are looking
for the others?

566
00:37:28,878 --> 00:37:29,922
- Because—
- We need to—

567
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,070
- I’ll go first.
- Honey…

568
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:34,774
By the way, these are
my high school friends,

569
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,625
Dang, and Annie.

570
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,962
We were just catching up
but they’ll leave in a while.

571
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:41,837
Hi, I’m Paul.

572
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,929
- Hello.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

573
00:37:44,954 --> 00:37:46,532
Why are you in a hurry?

574
00:37:46,592 --> 00:37:48,290
You haven’t seen each other
for a while, right?

575
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,361
Can we spend more time
with Gwen?

576
00:37:50,386 --> 00:37:51,400
Go ahead.

577
00:37:51,622 --> 00:37:54,876
Honey, why don’t you go out with them?
Enjoy yourselves.

578
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:57,020
Don’t worry about me.
I’ll have a drink with the guys.

579
00:37:57,104 --> 00:37:58,522
Great.

580
00:37:58,547 --> 00:38:00,259
That settles it.

581
00:38:00,332 --> 00:38:05,337
You know, our friend here
hasn’t changed a bit since high school.

582
00:38:05,362 --> 00:38:09,212
When I saw her earlier,
I instantly recognized her.

583
00:38:09,237 --> 00:38:15,932
Always soft-spoken and demure.
She’s the epitome of a true Filipina.

584
00:38:15,957 --> 00:38:17,048
Let’s go.

585
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:18,884
That’s why I married her right away.

586
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,859
Alright, let’s go.

587
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,512
- It’s time to go.
- Come on.

588
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,289
- Enjoy and take care.
- See you again.

589
00:38:28,314 --> 00:38:30,040
Bye. Nice meeting you.

590
00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:31,509
We’ll go ahead.

591
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:33,906
- Come on, Gwen.
- Yeah.

592
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:37,794
- Take your time.
- Yeah, thanks.

593
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:40,387
- Hello.
- Hi.

594
00:38:40,907 --> 00:38:44,650
Hey, you better hurry and see Janet.
It’s getting late.

595
00:38:44,675 --> 00:38:46,179
Aren’t you coming with us?

596
00:38:46,204 --> 00:38:50,367
A got a call from a prospective client.
You go ahead without me.

597
00:38:50,392 --> 00:38:52,532
- Okay. Let's go.
- Come on.

598
00:38:55,817 --> 00:38:57,360
I think it’s around here somewhere.

599
00:38:57,385 --> 00:38:59,804
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I’m sure of it.

600
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:03,211
Why are you wearing stilettos, anyway?

601
00:39:03,236 --> 00:39:05,213
Don’t mind my shoes, okay?

602
00:39:05,238 --> 00:39:06,715
I don’t mind yours, right?

603
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,367
- Okay, fine.
- Here it is.

604
00:39:08,392 --> 00:39:11,520
- It’s 409.
- Let’s see.

605
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:14,954
Anybody home?

606
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,815
Anybody home?

607
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:18,322
Anybody—

608
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,814
Hey, we saw you.
Don’t avoid us.

609
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:25,032
Janet?

610
00:39:25,057 --> 00:39:26,111
Janet.

611
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,173
Janet.

612
00:39:29,684 --> 00:39:31,269
It’s Annie.

613
00:39:31,446 --> 00:39:33,115
Annie!

614
00:39:33,146 --> 00:39:36,423
Of course, I recognized you, Annie.

615
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:39,545
Gwen, do I still owe you money?

616
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:43,306
That’s not what we came here for.

617
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,486
- Come in.
- Okay.

618
00:39:48,964 --> 00:39:50,298
Wait.

619
00:39:50,323 --> 00:39:52,367
I can’t let you in.

620
00:39:52,812 --> 00:39:55,126
Why not?

621
00:39:56,758 --> 00:39:59,248
It’s my brother’s
in-laws’ house.

622
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:02,939
They’re quite strict
with letting guests in.

623
00:40:03,207 --> 00:40:10,064
Is that so?
We’re not staying for long.

624
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,540
What brought you here?

625
00:40:17,425 --> 00:40:22,759
It’s Chona. She’s sick.

626
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:26,712
She wants the gang
to have a reunion.

627
00:40:27,237 --> 00:40:28,462
Really?

628
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:40,818
I’ll see. I look after my brother’s kid,
so I can’t just leave.

629
00:40:41,532 --> 00:40:44,470
Are you in touch
with Becky and Sue?

630
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:49,227
Gwen, you know I don’t have a mobile phone
so how can I be in touch with them?

631
00:40:49,252 --> 00:40:50,415
Until now?

632
00:40:50,653 --> 00:40:53,782
You are the only person in the Philippines
without a mobile phone.

633
00:40:54,323 --> 00:40:57,076
I’ll send you one later
through my driver.

634
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,251
Janet!

635
00:41:00,397 --> 00:41:01,446
What are you doing?

636
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:04,537
You still have something
on the stove.

637
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,993
And your niece’s diapers need changing.

638
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:14,356
My goodness!
Can’t you spare us a few minutes?

639
00:41:15,944 --> 00:41:17,821
You better leave.
I’m really sorry.

640
00:41:17,846 --> 00:41:22,321
It’s fine. Once you get your phone,
give us a call, okay?

641
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:27,329
I will.
And I sincerely apologize.

642
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:28,837
Janet.

643
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:40,837
I don’t know your situation right now
but don’t let others treat you like this.

644
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:43,367
This is not the Janet I used to know.

645
00:41:44,687 --> 00:41:46,181
You deserve better.

646
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,977
That’s what I told her.
Oh, she’s here now.

647
00:41:55,002 --> 00:41:57,546
Bea, your dad wants to talk to you.

648
00:41:57,595 --> 00:41:59,970
Dad, I can’t talk to you right now.
I’m not feeling well.

649
00:42:00,641 --> 00:42:02,015
Honey, I’ll call you later.

650
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,181
Beatrice, when I’m talking to you...

651
00:42:04,206 --> 00:42:05,524
What’s that on your face?

652
00:42:05,549 --> 00:42:07,681
Nothing.
Just got hit by a volleyball.

653
00:42:07,706 --> 00:42:10,000
What volleyball?

654
00:42:10,025 --> 00:42:11,923
- Since when have you played volleyball?
- Stop!

655
00:42:11,948 --> 00:42:13,116
Bea!

656
00:42:13,272 --> 00:42:15,407
You don’t have to know everything.

657
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,876
Hell no!
I am your mother.

658
00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:21,202
Mom, please respect my privacy.

659
00:42:21,227 --> 00:42:23,604
I’ve respected your privacy
way too much.

660
00:42:23,629 --> 00:42:25,962
I don’t know anything
about you anymore.

661
00:42:25,987 --> 00:42:27,063
Bea!

662
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:10,462
Miss, are you looking for someone?

663
00:44:11,034 --> 00:44:12,672
No.

664
00:44:13,053 --> 00:44:14,173
Would you like to order something?

665
00:44:21,269 --> 00:44:22,516
Coffee, please.

666
00:44:23,611 --> 00:44:25,946
Would you like to try our specials?

667
00:44:27,255 --> 00:44:29,056
Where’s the washroom?

668
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,220
- This way.
- Okay.

669
00:44:57,806 --> 00:44:58,840
Hi.

670
00:45:01,227 --> 00:45:02,228
Hi.

671
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:05,790
It’s so nice to see you here.

672
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:08,476
Who are you with?

673
00:45:10,238 --> 00:45:11,290
No one.

674
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:13,947
Just me.

675
00:45:14,697 --> 00:45:15,790
Just me.

676
00:45:16,542 --> 00:45:18,345
What are you doing here, Annie?

677
00:45:19,267 --> 00:45:22,423
I’m having coffee.

678
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:29,919
Ma’am, here’s the sugar and cream.

679
00:45:33,281 --> 00:45:37,188
- May I have the bill?
- Yes, ma’am.

680
00:45:37,213 --> 00:45:39,220
- No need, bro. It’s on me.
- Okay, sir. Thanks.

681
00:45:39,245 --> 00:45:40,290
Are you sure?

682
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,515
Thank you.

683
00:45:42,759 --> 00:45:48,767
I need to go.
My parents might be looking for me. Bye.

684
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:49,832
I'll go ahed.

685
00:46:15,259 --> 00:46:17,177
Hey you, Miss Possessed!

686
00:46:18,552 --> 00:46:20,512
I don’t wanna fight you right now.

687
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:21,841
Come on!

688
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:25,744
- You have no choice.
- Come with us.

689
00:46:25,997 --> 00:46:28,532
- You have to come with us.
- Come with us.

690
00:46:28,557 --> 00:46:30,784
So, what now, huh?

691
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:32,656
I don’t wanna fight you now.
Let’s do it next time.

692
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:34,437
What the hell?
No, we’re doing it now.

693
00:46:34,437 --> 00:46:35,647
But I don’t want to.

694
00:46:35,647 --> 00:46:37,533
- Let’s fight next time.
- Fight us now.

695
00:46:37,558 --> 00:46:38,725
Now, you’re scared.

696
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:42,619
- Show us how tough you are.
- Let’s do it next time.

697
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:50,870
Take it easy.

698
00:46:52,618 --> 00:46:54,745
Mind your own business.

699
00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:56,220
This is between us girls.

700
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,516
You’re messing with my girlfriend.

701
00:46:59,665 --> 00:47:02,584
Huh? Why her?

702
00:47:05,634 --> 00:47:06,704
What’s this?

703
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:08,986
You can't carry this around!

704
00:47:11,886 --> 00:47:13,679
Do you want me to report you
to your school principal?

705
00:47:13,947 --> 00:47:17,212
He’s my godfather.

706
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:20,261
So you better leave my girl alone.

707
00:47:20,727 --> 00:47:21,977
We’re going out on a date.

708
00:47:25,697 --> 00:47:28,415
You’re lucky we’ll let you
off the hook.

709
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,275
But only for now.

710
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,926
Next time…

711
00:47:40,805 --> 00:47:44,434
Annie, is it okay
if I put my arms around you?

712
00:47:44,459 --> 00:47:45,540
What?

713
00:47:46,676 --> 00:47:48,261
They’re still staring at you.

714
00:47:48,513 --> 00:47:50,720
That way,
they won’t harass you anymore.

715
00:47:52,008 --> 00:47:53,051
Okay.

716
00:47:56,354 --> 00:47:57,923
I’ll bring you home.
Come on.

717
00:48:08,872 --> 00:48:11,080
Do you know why we’re here?

718
00:48:11,197 --> 00:48:12,395
Why?

719
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,751
We’re here because we know it’s not true
that the company is losing money.

720
00:48:15,776 --> 00:48:21,782
And so we shall demand benefits
for the health hazards we face everyday.

721
00:48:22,821 --> 00:48:26,200
- We shall demand!
- We shall demand!

722
00:48:26,225 --> 00:48:29,520
- We shall fight!
- What's wrong?

723
00:48:30,709 --> 00:48:31,962
What is it?

724
00:48:32,437 --> 00:48:36,233
Well, it’s late.
I need to get home.

725
00:48:38,287 --> 00:48:39,371
Okay.

726
00:48:40,616 --> 00:48:41,836
But hold on.

727
00:48:42,447 --> 00:48:43,447
What?

728
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:11,181
Ouch!

729
00:49:12,988 --> 00:49:14,095
There’s chewing gum on your hair.

730
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:18,938
Sorry.

731
00:49:19,954 --> 00:49:21,980
I’ll go ahead.

732
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,157
Annie,

733
00:49:30,312 --> 00:49:31,772
can I make a suggestion?

734
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:36,525
Ease up on the coffee-drinking.

735
00:49:45,011 --> 00:49:47,179
Oh, but our son
is not a union leader.

736
00:49:47,204 --> 00:49:50,540
And even if he was,
did he break the law?

737
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,096
What crime has
our son committed, huh?

738
00:49:53,135 --> 00:49:54,344
No case has been filed against him yet.

739
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:56,580
We’d just like to invite him
to the station.

740
00:49:56,618 --> 00:50:01,048
Invite him for what?
Your birthday party?

741
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:03,431
Ma’am, we just need to talk to him.

742
00:50:03,456 --> 00:50:05,958
So call him on the phone.

743
00:50:05,983 --> 00:50:07,485
You dimwit!

744
00:50:07,527 --> 00:50:09,533
Mom, calm down.

745
00:50:10,628 --> 00:50:12,213
May I have your number?

746
00:50:12,238 --> 00:50:14,572
I’ll tell him to call you
once he gets home.

747
00:50:14,828 --> 00:50:16,282
We’d appreciate that.

748
00:50:18,836 --> 00:50:21,255
Mom, don’t get worked up.

749
00:50:21,612 --> 00:50:24,198
And where have you been?

750
00:50:24,226 --> 00:50:27,705
I told you to come straight home
from school.

751
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:29,345
It’s dangerous out in the streets.

752
00:50:33,227 --> 00:50:34,437
Let’s get inside.

753
00:50:34,726 --> 00:50:41,399
- We’re on strike!
- We’re on strike!

754
00:50:41,492 --> 00:50:44,787
- Raise our wages!
- Lower the prices!

755
00:50:44,812 --> 00:50:48,009
- Raise our wages!
- Lower the prices!

756
00:50:48,034 --> 00:50:54,470
- We, the labor class!
- The army to freedom!

757
00:50:54,495 --> 00:50:58,869
- We’re on strike!
- We’re on strike!

758
00:50:58,894 --> 00:51:01,480
Chona, what are we doing here?

759
00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:03,462
Annie’s looking for her brother, right?

760
00:51:03,487 --> 00:51:04,814
We’re here to give her moral support.

761
00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:06,375
Comrades, let’s lock arms!

762
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,985
No one breaks ranks!

763
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,137
How does your brother look like?

764
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:12,899
Sunny, look.

765
00:51:12,924 --> 00:51:14,705
The shitfaces are here.

766
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:19,040
There they are.

767
00:51:24,814 --> 00:51:29,392
[protesters clamoring]

768
00:52:04,003 --> 00:52:05,546
What now, huh?

769
00:52:32,793 --> 00:52:34,501
I’m the one possessed now.

770
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:40,111
Are you trying to make me dizzy?

771
00:52:40,136 --> 00:52:42,029
No. I just don’t want a scratch
on my face.

772
00:52:42,054 --> 00:52:44,432
A beauty queen can’t have scars.

773
00:52:44,457 --> 00:52:45,499
Is that so?

774
00:52:51,087 --> 00:52:52,087
Hi!

775
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:56,066
You ugly face!
I’ll make you even uglier.

776
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:58,321
- Dumbass!
- At least, I can still get uglier.

777
00:52:58,346 --> 00:53:00,993
While you’re as ugly as it gets.

778
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,641
Come here.

779
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:17,126
Why did you slap me?
You bitch!

780
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:44,856
What are you trying to do, huh?

781
00:53:44,896 --> 00:53:48,065
Stop it. It’s not right anymore.

782
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:49,564
Stop it!

783
00:53:50,532 --> 00:53:52,875
Let me go!

784
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,501
Don’t let them defeat you!

785
00:53:56,829 --> 00:53:58,923
You can’t stop us.

786
00:53:58,948 --> 00:54:02,243
We won’t stop
until Esteban pays us the right wages.

787
00:54:02,268 --> 00:54:04,111
There's Annie.

788
00:54:04,136 --> 00:54:10,142
- Annie!
- Annie’s over there.

789
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:12,252
Chona!

790
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,719
Sunny, let’s go! Hurry!

791
00:54:16,195 --> 00:54:21,128
Annie, come on!

792
00:54:21,153 --> 00:54:24,048
Annie, come on!

793
00:54:24,073 --> 00:54:28,001
Annie, hurry!

794
00:54:28,484 --> 00:54:36,025
- Let’s go.
- Hurry!

795
00:54:36,548 --> 00:54:39,023
Hey! Let me go!

796
00:54:45,751 --> 00:54:48,564
Stop fidgeting.

797
00:54:49,677 --> 00:54:51,728
I’m almost done.

798
00:54:51,811 --> 00:54:54,681
Oh my, it’s beautiful.

799
00:54:54,706 --> 00:54:58,293
It’s never too late
to fulfill your dreams.

800
00:55:00,072 --> 00:55:04,493
You see, Bernard wanted me to be
hands-on in raising our kid.

801
00:55:05,421 --> 00:55:06,939
Can I relax now?

802
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,056
Sure. I can
finish this up later.

803
00:55:11,977 --> 00:55:13,520
But you know that...

804
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:18,400
you'll become a better mother
and wife if you’re fulfilled.

805
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:23,009
I know what you’re thinking.
The nerve of me to give you advice.

806
00:55:23,034 --> 00:55:25,079
As if I know what I’m talking about.

807
00:55:29,187 --> 00:55:31,861
We all have our own callings.

808
00:55:33,043 --> 00:55:34,127
Are you happy?

809
00:55:34,745 --> 00:55:35,853
Of course.

810
00:55:37,656 --> 00:55:38,697
How about you?

811
00:55:41,687 --> 00:55:44,501
Come to think of it,

812
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,251
I am!

813
00:55:46,913 --> 00:55:48,306
I'm happy.

814
00:55:48,896 --> 00:55:54,048
Because I’m able to do anything I like
without considering a husband.

815
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,220
Growing my business gave me
so much high.

816
00:55:58,245 --> 00:56:05,169
And my career achievements
were my children.

817
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:08,814
<b>But now, I realize</b>

818
00:56:09,819 --> 00:56:11,782
<b>I’m better off single</b>

819
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:15,384
because I’ll be leaving
my “children” soon anyway.

820
00:56:16,697 --> 00:56:21,197
Let’s just talk about something else.

821
00:56:28,915 --> 00:56:29,922
Hey!

822
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,353
Chona?

823
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,181
Chona?

824
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:44,028
- Chona?
- It’s not that.

825
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:50,931
Is she crying for real?
Is she shedding tears?

826
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,305
So, what now?

827
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,657
What?

828
00:56:57,299 --> 00:56:59,551
What are we going to do?

829
00:56:59,576 --> 00:57:03,997
- Huh?
- As I said, he’s got a mistress.

830
00:57:04,022 --> 00:57:08,540
Why are you surprised when you know that
your husband is such a flirt?

831
00:57:09,326 --> 00:57:10,798
That’s a cruel thing to say about him.

832
00:57:11,305 --> 00:57:12,514
Cruel?

833
00:57:12,765 --> 00:57:16,595
He was flirting like crazy
with that woman on the golf course.

834
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,680
Really?

835
00:57:17,705 --> 00:57:21,493
I saw him staring at the girl intently.

836
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:22,810
And I hate to say this but

837
00:57:22,835 --> 00:57:26,255
I caught him staring at me intently, too.

838
00:57:26,255 --> 00:57:29,091
Wow! Really now?

839
00:57:29,091 --> 00:57:30,593
I don’t think so.

840
00:57:30,593 --> 00:57:31,978
- Was I wrong?
- Staring at you?

841
00:57:32,003 --> 00:57:34,548
- He wasn’t?
- So, how can we help you?

842
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:36,595
I got it.

843
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,947
- Hm?
- You're too loud.

844
00:57:39,268 --> 00:57:41,220
- Have some.
- What is that?

845
00:57:42,427 --> 00:57:47,345
Get him an insurance policy from me.

846
00:57:47,484 --> 00:57:52,751
Then I’ll hire someone to kill him.

847
00:57:55,411 --> 00:57:57,246
That’s interesting.

848
00:57:58,972 --> 00:58:00,348
How about this?

849
00:58:00,797 --> 00:58:05,843
Why don’t we confront his mistress?

850
00:58:08,495 --> 00:58:14,907
No. The best thing to do is
get into a fight.

851
00:58:14,985 --> 00:58:19,547
Like what we used to do
with the bullies.

852
00:58:21,806 --> 00:58:23,103
A fight.

853
00:58:24,441 --> 00:58:28,028
If you need us,
we’re just here.

854
00:58:28,053 --> 00:58:30,782
- That’s right.
- That’s good.

855
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:35,470
What’s even better is
if one is at the losing end,

856
00:58:35,495 --> 00:58:37,853
the others help in.

857
00:58:37,878 --> 00:58:40,040
Fight, Sunny!

858
00:58:40,065 --> 00:58:42,234
Fight!

859
00:58:42,259 --> 00:58:43,385
That's it.

860
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:45,103
Give us your wallet.
Where is it?

861
00:58:45,128 --> 00:58:46,415
I don’t have money with me.

862
00:58:47,434 --> 00:58:49,611
Bea?

863
00:58:49,636 --> 00:58:51,251
Pull over.

864
00:58:52,145 --> 00:58:53,180
Bea…

865
00:58:55,257 --> 00:58:57,655
- I’ve spent it already.
- Don’t be stingy. Give us your money.

866
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,616
Give us your wallet.

867
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:03,001
What right do you have to
harass my daughter, huh?

868
00:59:03,117 --> 00:59:04,285
What’s your name?

869
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:06,251
- Let me see your ID card.
- Mom!

870
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,611
Stop meddling, please.

871
00:59:09,134 --> 00:59:12,449
- Go.
- I’m not letting you off the hook.

872
00:59:12,474 --> 00:59:13,907
I’m filing a complaint against you.

873
00:59:14,782 --> 00:59:16,189
These kids…

874
00:59:17,847 --> 00:59:18,891
Let’s go.

875
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:20,376
Mom,

876
00:59:20,645 --> 00:59:22,313
why did you do that?

877
00:59:22,338 --> 00:59:23,256
Do what?

878
00:59:23,317 --> 00:59:26,525
Had I not arrived in time,
they could have hurt you!

879
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:30,512
Because of what you did,
they’ll harass me even more tomorrow.

880
00:59:30,954 --> 00:59:33,373
Then I’ll get you a bodyguard.

881
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:34,829
You’re overreacting.

882
00:59:36,043 --> 00:59:38,546
I’ll transfer you to another school.

883
00:59:38,571 --> 00:59:41,095
And I’ll do that to protect you.

884
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:43,275
I can handle myself.

885
00:59:43,543 --> 00:59:44,878
Was that being able
to handle yourself?

886
00:59:45,444 --> 00:59:48,204
I’ll have the driver bring you to
and fetch you from school from now on.

887
00:59:48,267 --> 00:59:49,776
- Come on.
- I can walk.

888
00:59:49,801 --> 00:59:51,439
Bea.

889
01:00:00,474 --> 01:00:01,634
Hello?

890
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,423
I need help.

891
01:00:07,864 --> 01:00:10,134
Chona, come here.

892
01:00:12,031 --> 01:00:13,626
Are we really doing this?

893
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,962
I’m not sure.

894
01:00:15,325 --> 01:00:16,876
We’re doing this.

895
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,790
Are you sure it’s okay for you
to leave the hospital?

896
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:21,499
I’m sure it’s not okay.

897
01:00:21,655 --> 01:00:24,199
- My goodness.
- Your condition might worsen.

898
01:00:24,224 --> 01:00:26,228
Let me be.

899
01:00:26,253 --> 01:00:29,767
I don’t want the hospital to be
the last place I see before I go.

900
01:00:30,572 --> 01:00:31,572
Hey!

901
01:00:31,979 --> 01:00:38,235
Look, I’ve accepted my fate
so you better accept it as well.

902
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:41,530
I don’t want to accept it.

903
01:00:41,592 --> 01:00:44,553
I don’t want those girls
to disrespect me.

904
01:00:44,578 --> 01:00:45,798
Why should I accept that?

905
01:00:45,823 --> 01:00:47,450
- Oh, you mean the girls?
- My goodness.

906
01:00:47,475 --> 01:00:50,017
Don’t worry.
I’ll protect your nose job.

907
01:00:51,478 --> 01:00:53,021
That’s them.

908
01:00:53,046 --> 01:00:54,326
I'm pretty sure.

909
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:55,811
It's them.

910
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:58,781
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am.

911
01:00:58,806 --> 01:01:00,962
Yeah, exactly, that's them.

912
01:01:02,754 --> 01:01:04,337
Ew.

913
01:01:05,976 --> 01:01:07,034
We’ll just scare them.

914
01:01:07,059 --> 01:01:08,185
The one in the middle looks like
she got a nose job.

915
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:09,211
Okay.

916
01:01:10,259 --> 01:01:12,111
What was that?

917
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:14,228
- I tried to scare them.
- Were you scared?

918
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:17,478
Excuse me,
may we have a word with you?

919
01:01:17,503 --> 01:01:18,595
Actually, no.

920
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:21,623
Oh, the girl’s got some attitude.

921
01:01:21,805 --> 01:01:25,344
You can’t force us to talk to you.

922
01:01:25,369 --> 01:01:26,978
- That’s right.
- That’s harassment.

923
01:01:27,003 --> 01:01:29,906
We're not here to make trouble.

924
01:01:29,931 --> 01:01:34,204
We just want to ask you
to stop bullying Bea,

925
01:01:34,229 --> 01:01:36,251
- if possible.
- Please.

926
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,235
- She’s useless to us.
- What if we don’t want to?

927
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,471
Wait.

928
01:01:40,509 --> 01:01:43,251
Sit. Calm down.

929
01:01:43,276 --> 01:01:44,995
You know what?

930
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:51,420
Don’t wait for me to morph because
I really don’t like what you’re saying.

931
01:01:51,445 --> 01:01:52,863
Let’s go, girls.

932
01:01:54,054 --> 01:01:57,743
Then morph, old ugly lady.

933
01:01:57,923 --> 01:01:59,809
We’re much younger than you.

934
01:01:59,834 --> 01:02:02,329
We’re stronger and faster so...

935
01:02:02,631 --> 01:02:03,966
you’ll lose.

936
01:02:03,991 --> 01:02:09,430
- Oh my god, my nose!
- Safe! Safe! Don't worry!

937
01:02:09,455 --> 01:02:11,056
Your nose is fine.

938
01:02:11,081 --> 01:02:13,267
- Are you sure?
- Yes, it wasn't hit.

939
01:02:13,292 --> 01:02:15,189
- Okay.
- Hold on now!

940
01:02:15,214 --> 01:02:16,673
You’ve crossed the line.

941
01:02:16,698 --> 01:02:19,268
That really hurt.
You’re such a petite girl, but...

942
01:02:19,298 --> 01:02:22,307
- I must say, you’re strong.
- Wait.

943
01:02:22,332 --> 01:02:24,570
Sorry but we really don’t
want to make trouble.

944
01:02:24,595 --> 01:02:32,411
We’re here to ask you
to stop bullying Bea.

945
01:02:32,436 --> 01:02:33,760
You don’t get it, do you?

946
01:02:33,785 --> 01:02:35,689
We said we don’t want to.

947
01:02:35,689 --> 01:02:39,443
- Oh my god!
- Stop!

948
01:02:39,443 --> 01:02:51,163
[clamoring, screaming]

949
01:02:51,163 --> 01:02:52,289
Calm down!

950
01:02:52,289 --> 01:02:56,604
[clamoring, screaming]

951
01:02:56,694 --> 01:02:57,830
What happened?

952
01:02:58,587 --> 01:03:02,690
Ma’am, we just
wanted to talk to them.

953
01:03:02,715 --> 01:03:04,693
No, they were intimidating us.

954
01:03:04,718 --> 01:03:07,321
Girl, you hit me first.

955
01:03:07,346 --> 01:03:12,059
- You're the one who pushed us!
- It's your fault!

956
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,602
Hold on.

957
01:03:13,627 --> 01:03:15,315
Oh my goodness.

958
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:17,126
Ma'am,

959
01:03:17,256 --> 01:03:19,634
may I ask why did you want
to speak with her?

960
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:27,104
Yesterday evening,
I saw these girls bullying my daughter Bea.

961
01:03:27,326 --> 01:03:28,535
Is that true?

962
01:03:29,799 --> 01:03:31,301
Admit it.

963
01:03:32,146 --> 01:03:35,854
Ma’am, I saw these ladies
were just talking to them.

964
01:03:36,048 --> 01:03:37,588
That girl pushed them first.

965
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:40,002
We can review the CCTV footage.

966
01:03:40,777 --> 01:03:43,948
Okay. I would like to see
your parents tomorrow.

967
01:03:44,314 --> 01:03:45,971
And I’m sorry about this.

968
01:03:46,118 --> 01:03:49,744
Please be assured disciplinary action
will be imposed.

969
01:03:50,054 --> 01:03:51,338
Thank you, ma’am.

970
01:03:52,331 --> 01:03:54,990
- We’ll go ahead.
- Thank you.

971
01:03:57,896 --> 01:04:03,182
If you touch my daughter again,
we will see each other in court.

972
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,193
These kids…

973
01:04:09,733 --> 01:04:11,277
Not my nose.

974
01:04:17,284 --> 01:04:20,604
If you touch her daughter again…

975
01:04:26,228 --> 01:04:29,345
<b>- I like that song.
- Everyone must sing.</b>

976
01:04:29,386 --> 01:04:33,299
<i>♪ The traffic is so bad
A jeepney cut you off ♪</i>

977
01:04:33,324 --> 01:04:37,205

978
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:41,201
<i>♪ Your blood starts to boil ♪</i>

979
01:04:41,226 --> 01:04:45,244
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

980
01:04:45,277 --> 01:04:47,033
One, two, three, left.

981
01:04:47,058 --> 01:04:49,197
Five, six, seven, eight.
Turn, Annie.

982
01:04:49,197 --> 01:04:50,841
One, two, three, four...

983
01:04:50,866 --> 01:04:53,010
Five, six, seven.

984
01:04:53,035 --> 01:04:57,014
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, one more.

985
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,783
- One, two, three...
- What is wrong with you?

986
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,854
You’re just wasting my time.

987
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:11,445
Sue, let’s just do it again.
Come on.

988
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:12,613
- Ready?
- Ready.

989
01:05:12,638 --> 01:05:14,031
Okay, let's start over.

990
01:05:14,056 --> 01:05:15,565
- Do it yourselves.
- One, two, three...

991
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:17,300
You do it yourselves. I quit.

992
01:05:17,548 --> 01:05:20,133
Cut her some slack.

993
01:05:20,371 --> 01:05:21,791
I can’t stand her.

994
01:05:22,624 --> 01:05:25,168
You’re not looking for a gang member.
You’re looking for a clown.

995
01:05:26,424 --> 01:05:27,926
What the hell is your problem?

996
01:05:27,951 --> 01:05:30,631
Why is it that you
hate Annie so much?

997
01:05:30,655 --> 01:05:33,540
Why are you so mad at her?
What’s wrong with you?

998
01:05:33,658 --> 01:05:36,471
I don’t understand
why you like her that much.

999
01:05:37,699 --> 01:05:40,588
Maybe, you have a thing going on.

1000
01:05:40,816 --> 01:05:41,916
What?

1001
01:05:42,031 --> 01:05:44,492
What the hell are you talking about?

1002
01:05:44,908 --> 01:05:49,608
Sue, please don’t leave Sunny.
I’ll be the one to leave the gang.

1003
01:05:49,633 --> 01:05:51,291
No, Annie.
No one’s leaving.

1004
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:53,800
You’re the one with the problem.

1005
01:05:53,878 --> 01:05:57,173
You bully all of us into doing only
what you like to do.

1006
01:05:57,198 --> 01:06:01,612
Girls, stop it. Please.

1007
01:06:11,339 --> 01:06:12,346
Sue…

1008
01:06:12,772 --> 01:06:14,274
Let her be, Annie.

1009
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:45,362
What are you doing here?

1010
01:06:46,426 --> 01:06:50,674
The gang needs you.
You can’t leave.

1011
01:06:51,439 --> 01:06:52,557
I don’t care.

1012
01:06:55,909 --> 01:06:57,119
Good evening, ma’am.

1013
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:59,948
Good evening.

1014
01:06:59,973 --> 01:07:01,510
Come in.

1015
01:07:01,673 --> 01:07:04,541
Sorry, I used a dialect.

1016
01:07:05,511 --> 01:07:09,901
Thank you, ma’am,
but we’re good here.

1017
01:07:10,687 --> 01:07:12,648
You understood me?

1018
01:07:12,673 --> 01:07:14,760
- Yes, ma’am.
- Where are you from?

1019
01:07:15,085 --> 01:07:16,629
Himamaylan.

1020
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:19,776
I’m from Himamaylan, too.

1021
01:07:20,257 --> 01:07:21,300
We’re leaving.

1022
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:24,009
- We are?
- Sue, wait.

1023
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:25,728
We’ll go ahead, ma’am.

1024
01:07:53,886 --> 01:07:56,971
Sue, your mom is a nice lady.

1025
01:07:58,018 --> 01:08:01,682
She’s not my mom.
She’s my dad’s second wife.

1026
01:08:02,685 --> 01:08:05,432
She’s the reason why my mom
left the country.

1027
01:08:05,457 --> 01:08:09,338
Don’t comment on things
you have no knowledge about.

1028
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:12,509
- Waiter.
- Yes, ma’am.

1029
01:08:12,534 --> 01:08:13,868
One more pitcher.

1030
01:08:24,579 --> 01:08:25,744
Sue...

1031
01:08:28,132 --> 01:08:32,033
Why do you hate me so much?

1032
01:08:33,217 --> 01:08:35,678
Because you’re just like my stepmom.

1033
01:08:36,046 --> 01:08:38,965
Don’t you notice your similarities?

1034
01:08:39,768 --> 01:08:40,853
No.

1035
01:08:41,221 --> 01:08:44,729
You have the same eyes.
You talk the same.

1036
01:08:44,754 --> 01:08:46,190
You even have the same name.

1037
01:08:46,541 --> 01:08:48,043
Her name is also Annie?

1038
01:08:48,188 --> 01:08:51,900
No, it’s Amy.
It sounds the same, right?

1039
01:08:56,462 --> 01:09:03,928
What do I have to do
for you to like me?

1040
01:09:03,953 --> 01:09:05,369
I don’t know.

1041
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:09,151
I can’t change my name

1042
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:12,268
because I was named
after my granny Anita.

1043
01:09:12,293 --> 01:09:13,783
I really don’t know.

1044
01:09:13,808 --> 01:09:17,091
I can’t have my face changed

1045
01:09:17,116 --> 01:09:21,069
because we don’t have
the money for plastic surgery.

1046
01:09:21,094 --> 01:09:22,557
I said, I don’t know.

1047
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:29,627
But if I can have my face changed,
I want to look just like you.

1048
01:09:29,706 --> 01:09:32,625
Because your face is so beautiful.

1049
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:35,653
Don’t you dare do that
or I’ll hate you more.

1050
01:09:35,678 --> 01:09:37,330
Why is that?

1051
01:09:37,566 --> 01:09:39,318
Because I hate myself.

1052
01:09:39,727 --> 01:09:42,697
I hate my stepmom.
I hate my life.

1053
01:09:44,154 --> 01:09:45,196
Hey...

1054
01:09:47,033 --> 01:09:48,635
Don’t be like that, Sue.

1055
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:58,401
As they say, “Learning to love yourself
is the greatest love of all.”

1056
01:10:00,761 --> 01:10:02,137
I hate you.

1057
01:10:02,638 --> 01:10:05,229
Why are you so corny?
I hate that.

1058
01:10:05,254 --> 01:10:06,974
I don’t know.

1059
01:10:07,782 --> 01:10:11,828
Sue, what do I do for you
not to hate me?

1060
01:10:11,853 --> 01:10:15,065
I’m not even related to your stepmom.

1061
01:10:25,565 --> 01:10:27,150
We’re good.

1062
01:10:30,181 --> 01:10:31,974
- We are?
- We’re good.

1063
01:10:34,039 --> 01:10:35,979
For real, Sue?

1064
01:10:36,643 --> 01:10:42,471
You know why I want to be your friend?
Because you’re so beautiful.

1065
01:10:42,496 --> 01:10:44,674
- Really?
- Yes.

1066
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:47,323
- I’m beautiful?
- Yes.

1067
01:10:48,346 --> 01:10:55,306
I know, right? You’re beautiful as well
but I’m way more beautiful than you.

1068
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:35,412
Doc, I just want the meds
for pain management.

1069
01:11:35,437 --> 01:11:37,502
No sleeping pills.

1070
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:41,380
Yes, I will give oral medicine
for the pain.

1071
01:11:41,405 --> 01:11:42,775
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1072
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,603
Thank you, Doc.

1073
01:11:44,628 --> 01:11:46,964
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1074
01:11:50,884 --> 01:11:54,674
I have good news.
I’ve located Annie’s Hans.

1075
01:11:56,179 --> 01:11:59,975
What do you mean by “my Hans”?

1076
01:12:01,431 --> 01:12:03,533
My brother John’s gang
had a reunion recently

1077
01:12:03,558 --> 01:12:06,236
so I got all their contact numbers.

1078
01:12:06,525 --> 01:12:08,283
I plan to sell
insurance to all of them.

1079
01:12:08,308 --> 01:12:11,471
If only to recoup the cost of all
the snacks they ate in our house.

1080
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:14,532
Wish we could have a reunion like theirs.

1081
01:12:14,557 --> 01:12:15,596
Actually!

1082
01:12:15,776 --> 01:12:17,402
We’ll have ours as well.

1083
01:12:17,427 --> 01:12:19,252
So, what’s your good news?

1084
01:12:19,277 --> 01:12:20,533
I think I know...

1085
01:12:20,747 --> 01:12:21,958
Were you able to make a sale?

1086
01:12:21,983 --> 01:12:24,169
No, that’s not it.

1087
01:12:24,194 --> 01:12:27,906
Just get to the good news bit.

1088
01:12:28,012 --> 01:12:32,016
I was not able to make a sale
but I found Hans.

1089
01:12:32,637 --> 01:12:33,986
And?

1090
01:12:34,011 --> 01:12:35,533
Hans knows where Becky is.

1091
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:40,977
Why didn’t you say so?

1092
01:12:41,002 --> 01:12:44,931
I was about to
but you kept butting in.

1093
01:12:45,252 --> 01:12:48,026
Hey! Stop lounging about!
Get your hair and make-up done!

1094
01:12:48,051 --> 01:12:49,689
So, where’s Becky?

1095
01:12:49,714 --> 01:12:53,830
[woman nagging]

1096
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,572
And why are you wearing those glasses?

1097
01:12:56,597 --> 01:13:01,116
The clients here
might be my creditors.

1098
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:04,885
They might recognize me
without these.

1099
01:13:05,158 --> 01:13:06,673
Seriously...

1100
01:13:07,259 --> 01:13:09,173
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

1101
01:13:10,599 --> 01:13:13,227
Becky, have you been there long?

1102
01:13:13,252 --> 01:13:15,463
You might want to help set the place up.
We’re opening up the club soon.

1103
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:18,197
- Is that Becky?
- Move your ass. Now.

1104
01:13:18,318 --> 01:13:19,377
Becky?

1105
01:13:42,247 --> 01:13:44,958
We used to have fun
in high school, huh?

1106
01:13:44,983 --> 01:13:46,025
You’re right.

1107
01:13:46,351 --> 01:13:47,644
We were so happy.

1108
01:13:48,017 --> 01:13:51,354
You were the beauty queen
of the gang.

1109
01:13:51,456 --> 01:13:54,431
You won Miss Filipino Language Week.

1110
01:13:54,456 --> 01:13:55,535
Right?

1111
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,308
Miss United Nations.

1112
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:59,642
I was always the muse
in the intramurals.

1113
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:01,533
Beauty pageants was my life.

1114
01:14:01,558 --> 01:14:02,726
That’s right.

1115
01:14:04,641 --> 01:14:05,985
How are you doing?

1116
01:14:11,874 --> 01:14:13,125
I’m good.

1117
01:14:13,205 --> 01:14:14,736
- Really?
- Yeah.

1118
01:14:15,018 --> 01:14:16,186
And...

1119
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:17,541
I’m happy here.

1120
01:14:18,262 --> 01:14:19,384
Really?

1121
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:29,267
It’s still early but this place starts
jumping come night time.

1122
01:14:30,562 --> 01:14:34,485
How did you meet Hans again?

1123
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,721
Hans?

1124
01:14:36,956 --> 01:14:40,275
His friend had a birthday party here.

1125
01:14:41,494 --> 01:14:43,037
How’s your mom?

1126
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:49,705
She passed away.

1127
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:56,439
After we closed down her salon,
my sister went back to the province.

1128
01:14:57,229 --> 01:14:58,768
Sorry to hear that.

1129
01:14:59,278 --> 01:15:00,728
Hey, Becky!

1130
01:15:01,092 --> 01:15:07,275
It’s work hours now and you’re
loafing around with your friends.

1131
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:10,135
How much is the cover charge here?

1132
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,760
Three grand, minimum.

1133
01:15:12,785 --> 01:15:15,736
Three grand, minimum?

1134
01:15:16,292 --> 01:15:17,314
Can we afford that?

1135
01:15:17,339 --> 01:15:19,088
No sweat.

1136
01:15:19,334 --> 01:15:20,752
Oh, okay then.

1137
01:15:20,777 --> 01:15:27,075
We’d like to order all your specials.

1138
01:15:27,175 --> 01:15:28,494
That might be too much for us.

1139
01:15:28,531 --> 01:15:30,725
- Can we take away the leftovers?
- Sure.

1140
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:32,924
Half of the order is for take away.

1141
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:37,642
We’ll have red wine, please.

1142
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:42,892
We’ll open the bottle on the table
to make sure it’s not watered-down.

1143
01:15:43,447 --> 01:15:48,150
My friends just ordered so you
better smile at them. Treat them right.

1144
01:15:51,898 --> 01:15:55,885
They ordered the specials
plus red wine.

1145
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:59,915
So... Your...

1146
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,533
How’s your husband?

1147
01:16:09,655 --> 01:16:11,990
He left me for good.

1148
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:19,205
He never returned home.

1149
01:16:27,437 --> 01:16:29,022
How’s your kid?

1150
01:16:30,033 --> 01:16:34,158
My in-laws took my kid.

1151
01:16:34,183 --> 01:16:35,493
But why?

1152
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:37,879
- Why?
- Because...

1153
01:16:38,695 --> 01:16:45,305
Since I work here, they say I’m not
a good influence to my kid.

1154
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:46,900
They’re right.

1155
01:16:48,168 --> 01:16:56,415
So it’s much better for my kid to stay
with my in-laws to have a decent life.

1156
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:04,462
I’ll help you find a better job.

1157
01:17:05,883 --> 01:17:09,978
But how?
I didn’t finish college.

1158
01:17:11,022 --> 01:17:14,692
This is the only kind of work I know.

1159
01:17:14,717 --> 01:17:17,408
What can I do?

1160
01:17:21,616 --> 01:17:23,576
Leave this place.

1161
01:17:23,765 --> 01:17:25,392
Leave this place.

1162
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:32,540
But I don’t know how.

1163
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:39,048
I just want to be with my kid.

1164
01:17:39,714 --> 01:17:45,033
To do that,
you have to fix your life first.

1165
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,529
Why are you still up?

1166
01:18:16,853 --> 01:18:19,749
I’ve been sleeping all day.

1167
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:24,251
So, how’s Becky?

1168
01:18:27,926 --> 01:18:29,803
Let’s not talk about her for now.

1169
01:18:29,869 --> 01:18:32,989
I came over to check if you're okay.

1170
01:18:45,575 --> 01:18:46,826
Thank you.

1171
01:18:51,764 --> 01:18:53,332
I’m doing fine.

1172
01:18:55,759 --> 01:18:59,395
Annie, you’re really brilliant.

1173
01:19:02,257 --> 01:19:05,075
I would like to thank you for

1174
01:19:06,493 --> 01:19:08,847
pushing me to be an artist again.

1175
01:19:11,737 --> 01:19:13,707
It’s never too late, Annie.

1176
01:19:20,306 --> 01:19:22,637
Promise you’ll continue doing this.

1177
01:19:30,453 --> 01:19:31,621
Chona…

1178
01:19:33,729 --> 01:19:35,147
What is it, Annie?

1179
01:19:39,884 --> 01:19:41,303
Thank you.

1180
01:19:44,342 --> 01:19:45,559
For what?

1181
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,192
For a long time...

1182
01:19:50,942 --> 01:19:54,418
I have lived as a daughter,

1183
01:19:56,043 --> 01:19:59,231
as a wife, and as a mother.

1184
01:20:02,729 --> 01:20:09,504
I forgot who and what I really am.

1185
01:20:14,962 --> 01:20:16,738
I took the sideline.

1186
01:20:20,192 --> 01:20:26,032
Then I realized
I was the heroine in my life.

1187
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:37,801
Heroines never go out of style.

1188
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:45,348
They take a break
then make a comeback.

1189
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:52,075
You, Annie,
will always be a heroine.

1190
01:20:57,706 --> 01:21:04,301
All of Sunny are heroines.

1191
01:21:07,656 --> 01:21:08,871
I hope...

1192
01:21:10,834 --> 01:21:14,121
I hope you find our last heroine.

1193
01:21:20,753 --> 01:21:22,296
Sue.

1194
01:21:25,912 --> 01:21:28,582
I’ll find her for you.

1195
01:21:44,186 --> 01:21:45,520
What's this?

1196
01:21:47,656 --> 01:21:48,991
That’s for you.

1197
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:57,215
So you’ll always remember
who you are

1198
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,950
and what you really
want to do in life.

1199
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,559
- There you go! Start recording.
- Okay.

1200
01:22:22,584 --> 01:22:25,128
- Is it on?
- Okay. You can do it!

1201
01:22:25,153 --> 01:22:26,646
Hi, Chona. How are you doing?

1202
01:22:26,671 --> 01:22:28,043
I hope you’re doing well now.

1203
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:32,192
I hope you’ve fulfilled
all your dreams in life.

1204
01:22:32,457 --> 01:22:34,189
You’re probably
filthy rich by now.

1205
01:22:34,214 --> 01:22:38,278
Don’t forget to share
your blessings, and...

1206
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:42,201
- always remain a good leader to Sunny.
- Yes!

1207
01:22:42,226 --> 01:22:46,403
Right? Okay, your turn.

1208
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:56,879
Hi, Dang. You still have gorgeous lashes.
For sure, they’re permanent implants now.

1209
01:22:56,904 --> 01:22:58,965
- Transplant?
- Save money to get those implants

1210
01:22:58,990 --> 01:23:02,050
so you’ll become
more beautiful effortlessly.

1211
01:23:02,075 --> 01:23:03,099
Okay, go.

1212
01:23:03,124 --> 01:23:05,393
- Hi, Janet.
- Hi, Janet.

1213
01:23:05,418 --> 01:23:07,878
- May I have your autograph?
- May I have your autograph?

1214
01:23:07,903 --> 01:23:11,754
Your book is now
a number one bestseller...

1215
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:14,610
- and a famous movie company has acquired
- Wow!

1216
01:23:14,635 --> 01:23:17,888
- the rights to its film adaptation.
- Wow!

1217
01:23:17,913 --> 01:23:21,785
Oh my gosh! Let me join, Janet.

1218
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:22,934
Awesome!

1219
01:23:22,959 --> 01:23:25,207
You're awesome!

1220
01:23:25,232 --> 01:23:28,754
I hope your next book is about Sunny.

1221
01:23:31,614 --> 01:23:34,543
- Hi, Gwen. So, how’s life?
- You didn’t let me finish.

1222
01:23:34,568 --> 01:23:37,114
I’m sure you’re having problems now.

1223
01:23:37,139 --> 01:23:38,140
Why?

1224
01:23:38,533 --> 01:23:42,184
You’re bored stiff,
doing nothing but shop,

1225
01:23:42,388 --> 01:23:43,431
- because—
- Wow!

1226
01:23:43,456 --> 01:23:45,057
because you’ve married a rich guy.

1227
01:23:45,082 --> 01:23:46,950
Dream on. Is he handsome?

1228
01:23:46,975 --> 01:23:49,770
And he loves you to death.

1229
01:23:50,955 --> 01:23:53,207
You’re so full of yourself.

1230
01:23:53,254 --> 01:23:59,528
Keep an eye on him, though.
If he cheats on you, beat him to a pulp.

1231
01:23:59,598 --> 01:24:00,598
My turn!

1232
01:24:00,623 --> 01:24:04,035
It’s my turn.

1233
01:24:05,037 --> 01:24:12,020
Hi, Miss Universe Philippines!

1234
01:24:12,045 --> 01:24:13,629
- Oh my ears!
- Turn for us.

1235
01:24:13,676 --> 01:24:15,553
Is she Miss Philippines,
or Miss Universe?

1236
01:24:15,578 --> 01:24:17,204
What a dimwit.

1237
01:24:17,229 --> 01:24:19,051
- You can say that again.
- Pose!

1238
01:24:19,076 --> 01:24:21,190
- Who’s next?
- So fancy!

1239
01:24:21,215 --> 01:24:23,137
Sue!

1240
01:24:23,162 --> 01:24:24,663
Hold the camera.

1241
01:24:24,688 --> 01:24:26,098
Your turn, Sue.

1242
01:24:26,123 --> 01:24:28,584
Sue!

1243
01:24:28,722 --> 01:24:31,661
Go, Sue!

1244
01:24:31,686 --> 01:24:33,480
Don’t worry, you’re still pretty on camera.

1245
01:24:34,119 --> 01:24:37,539
If you’re still around
by now, congrats.

1246
01:24:37,564 --> 01:24:38,732
Congrats!

1247
01:24:38,757 --> 01:24:42,406
Congratulations!

1248
01:24:42,431 --> 01:24:44,617
- Your turn.
- Is it my turn now?

1249
01:24:44,642 --> 01:24:45,996
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1250
01:24:46,021 --> 01:24:47,543
Hi, future Annie.

1251
01:24:47,568 --> 01:24:51,614
I’m pretty sure you’re a successful
visual artist by now.

1252
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:54,262
You’ve done a lot of exhibits
of your artworks.

1253
01:24:54,287 --> 01:24:56,535
- Wow!
- But two of those are not for sale.

1254
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:01,621
One is for your kid.
And the other is for Sunny.

1255
01:25:01,646 --> 01:25:03,879
Aw, how sweet!

1256
01:25:03,904 --> 01:25:06,432
Because they’re priceless.

1257
01:25:06,457 --> 01:25:10,950
I have to go to the washroom now.

1258
01:25:10,975 --> 01:25:12,418
I love you.

1259
01:25:12,443 --> 01:25:13,762
What's up with that?

1260
01:25:13,787 --> 01:25:16,004
Hey, where are you going?

1261
01:25:16,029 --> 01:25:18,490
To the washroom
then drinking fountain.

1262
01:25:18,517 --> 01:25:19,762
Peace out!

1263
01:25:19,926 --> 01:25:21,971
To the washroom
then drinking fountain?

1264
01:25:21,971 --> 01:25:23,028
Seriously?

1265
01:25:23,139 --> 01:25:24,724
Hey, we have to say goodbye now.

1266
01:25:24,749 --> 01:25:26,000
Bye!

1267
01:25:26,025 --> 01:25:28,285
- Sue!
- Bye!

1268
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:29,603
Sue!

1269
01:25:29,628 --> 01:25:31,020
Bye!

1270
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:46,785
Ouch!

1271
01:25:48,106 --> 01:25:49,190
That hurts.

1272
01:25:51,515 --> 01:25:52,641
Ouch!

1273
01:25:59,983 --> 01:26:01,234
Are you alright?

1274
01:26:07,341 --> 01:26:10,052
Ellen, can we not fight anymore?

1275
01:26:10,077 --> 01:26:11,598
Do you really have
a beef with me?

1276
01:26:11,879 --> 01:26:14,576
You don’t wanna fight
because you’re alone.

1277
01:26:14,913 --> 01:26:18,386
I just don’t want any trouble. Please.

1278
01:26:18,643 --> 01:26:20,645
But you’re Chona’s friend.

1279
01:26:20,858 --> 01:26:22,410
That’s my beef with you.

1280
01:26:23,290 --> 01:26:25,292
Didn’t you used to be friends with Chona?

1281
01:26:25,317 --> 01:26:26,735
We used to be...

1282
01:26:27,395 --> 01:26:29,293
but she was a lousy friend.

1283
01:26:29,762 --> 01:26:30,792
You know,

1284
01:26:30,961 --> 01:26:33,848
one day, she’ll get rid of you, too.

1285
01:26:34,214 --> 01:26:36,921
Chona’s not that kind of friend.
In fact, she’s concerned about you...

1286
01:26:36,946 --> 01:26:39,114
You don’t know anything
so just shut up!

1287
01:26:39,339 --> 01:26:42,060
You know what, I’ll start with you.

1288
01:26:42,304 --> 01:26:44,222
Go, Ellen.
Give it to her!

1289
01:26:44,247 --> 01:26:45,387
Give it to her!

1290
01:26:45,412 --> 01:26:47,622
Stop it, please!

1291
01:26:47,647 --> 01:26:48,732
Wow!

1292
01:26:48,807 --> 01:26:51,501
- Stop it!
- You’ve made a lot of threats.

1293
01:26:53,662 --> 01:26:56,051
Just like villains in a movie.

1294
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:02,981
Get it over and done with like this.

1295
01:27:12,942 --> 01:27:14,500
Say you’re sorry.

1296
01:27:19,781 --> 01:27:21,074
Say you're sorry.

1297
01:27:23,172 --> 01:27:24,778
I’m sorry.

1298
01:27:25,799 --> 01:27:27,301
I can’t hear you.

1299
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:30,219
I’m sorry.

1300
01:27:35,778 --> 01:27:36,864
Ouch!

1301
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:48,072
Beg for forgiveness.

1302
01:27:51,353 --> 01:27:53,691
I said, beg.

1303
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,012
Sorry…

1304
01:28:01,254 --> 01:28:02,505
Sorry.

1305
01:28:20,861 --> 01:28:22,809
Ellen, are you alright?

1306
01:28:27,306 --> 01:28:28,308
Hey!

1307
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:29,848
You scared me.

1308
01:28:29,873 --> 01:28:31,869
Did you watch
Anna Karenina (TV drama) last night?

1309
01:28:31,869 --> 01:28:34,329
- It was awesome!
- I did.

1310
01:28:34,354 --> 01:28:37,301
- I went to bed early for my beauty sleep.
- What took you so long?

1311
01:28:39,419 --> 01:28:41,723
- I tripped and fell.
- Huh?

1312
01:28:41,748 --> 01:28:43,145
Are you alright?
Let me see your leg.

1313
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:45,028
I’m okay.

1314
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:48,520
My brother is inviting us
to their outing.

1315
01:28:48,617 --> 01:28:52,287
If we join them,
we should all go.

1316
01:28:52,508 --> 01:28:53,801
I’ll go.

1317
01:28:53,849 --> 01:28:55,700
Sue will go to get away
from their house.

1318
01:28:55,725 --> 01:28:56,731
I’ll go, too.

1319
01:28:56,756 --> 01:28:58,229
I’ll go.

1320
01:28:58,481 --> 01:29:02,121
Annie will go because of Hans.

1321
01:29:03,625 --> 01:29:04,877
Wait!

1322
01:29:04,902 --> 01:29:06,496
She’ll blush again.

1323
01:29:06,521 --> 01:29:09,298
- Hey, blushing!
- No!

1324
01:29:09,323 --> 01:29:11,742
- You’re blushing, white girl.
- No, I’m not.

1325
01:29:11,767 --> 01:29:14,353
Yes you are, white girl.

1326
01:29:15,551 --> 01:29:19,301
Wow! It’s so refreshing out here.

1327
01:29:19,326 --> 01:29:22,161
Come on. Hurry!

1328
01:29:22,186 --> 01:29:23,481
They're too excited.

1329
01:29:23,506 --> 01:29:25,325
Hey, be careful.

1330
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:27,278
They might trip.

1331
01:29:31,445 --> 01:29:33,215
We have food later.

1332
01:29:33,646 --> 01:29:35,606
How about now?

1333
01:29:35,631 --> 01:29:38,739
Sue, Annie, come over here.

1334
01:29:38,764 --> 01:29:39,778
Come on!

1335
01:29:40,724 --> 01:29:43,106
Later.

1336
01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:44,793
Come over here.

1337
01:29:44,818 --> 01:29:45,818
Come on!

1338
01:29:49,496 --> 01:29:51,970
Now wait, taste this.
It's good.

1339
01:29:51,995 --> 01:29:53,856
Get one stick.
Pass the rest around.

1340
01:29:54,229 --> 01:29:55,385
All good?

1341
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:56,512
Does everyone have a stick?

1342
01:29:56,537 --> 01:29:57,579
- Yeah!
- Okay let’s play.

1343
01:29:57,579 --> 01:29:58,580
Let's start the game.

1344
01:29:58,580 --> 01:29:59,879
- I don’t wanna join.
- Why not?

1345
01:29:59,904 --> 01:30:02,543
- You have to!
- I don’t want to.

1346
01:30:02,568 --> 01:30:04,436
You’re ever the killjoy.

1347
01:30:04,461 --> 01:30:06,505
Wait. Everyone must join.
Let’s start.

1348
01:30:06,505 --> 01:30:08,382
- Yup, you’re joining.
- Let’s start.

1349
01:30:08,382 --> 01:30:09,591
Who’ll spin the bottle?

1350
01:30:11,884 --> 01:30:13,282
Annie, you do it.

1351
01:30:15,362 --> 01:30:16,572
Spin the bottle.

1352
01:30:16,657 --> 01:30:18,534
- Go ahead. Spin it.
- Go, Annie.

1353
01:30:18,559 --> 01:30:19,588
Spin it.

1354
01:30:20,252 --> 01:30:21,252
Go!

1355
01:30:21,508 --> 01:30:23,997
The bottle will point at you.

1356
01:30:24,022 --> 01:30:29,010
Oohhh…

1357
01:30:29,059 --> 01:30:30,143
See, I told you.

1358
01:30:30,168 --> 01:30:31,525
Truth or dare?

1359
01:30:32,635 --> 01:30:33,657
Dare.

1360
01:30:33,657 --> 01:30:34,950
- Oh, dare.
- Dare.

1361
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:36,322
Let’s do truth instead.

1362
01:30:36,532 --> 01:30:38,409
Let’s do Truth.
Who’s your crush?

1363
01:30:38,434 --> 01:30:41,437
Hey, he said “Dare”.
Why insist on Truth?

1364
01:30:41,462 --> 01:30:42,922
- He said, “Dare.”
- Fine.

1365
01:30:42,958 --> 01:30:44,244
Let’s do dare then.

1366
01:30:44,269 --> 01:30:46,213
Hans, approach your crush.

1367
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:48,486
There you go, that was a Dare.

1368
01:30:48,511 --> 01:30:50,732
- Hurry now.
- Now that's a dare.

1369
01:30:50,757 --> 01:30:59,197
Who’s Hans’ crush?

1370
01:30:59,222 --> 01:31:01,850
- Okay, I’ll do it.
- Come on, stand up.

1371
01:31:01,875 --> 01:31:03,395
- There we go!
- Go!

1372
01:31:10,502 --> 01:31:13,611
Oh wow, I’m excited.

1373
01:31:20,931 --> 01:31:21,990
Wait.

1374
01:31:22,358 --> 01:31:24,193
It’s the same as truth, right?
That’s unfair.

1375
01:31:24,246 --> 01:31:26,059
- What?
- You’re unfair.

1376
01:31:26,084 --> 01:31:27,561
- You already stood up. Go for it.
- Just penalize me.

1377
01:31:27,586 --> 01:31:29,440
Actually, it’s unfair.

1378
01:31:29,465 --> 01:31:31,346
Let’s just spin the bottle again.

1379
01:33:27,046 --> 01:33:28,064
Hi.

1380
01:33:29,111 --> 01:33:30,612
Hi. Welcome.

1381
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:35,823
Man the kitchen.

1382
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:36,971
Okay, dad.

1383
01:33:37,303 --> 01:33:38,588
Come on, let’s go.

1384
01:33:42,223 --> 01:33:43,224
Annie?

1385
01:33:50,223 --> 01:33:54,971
I didn’t think
you’d still recognize me.

1386
01:33:55,807 --> 01:33:59,166
Who could ever forget your gang?

1387
01:33:59,881 --> 01:34:02,635
How long has it been?
Twenty-six years?

1388
01:34:03,329 --> 01:34:04,338
How have you been?

1389
01:34:05,063 --> 01:34:06,104
I’m doing fine.

1390
01:34:08,626 --> 01:34:10,510
So, what brings you here?

1391
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:12,620
Uh...

1392
01:34:14,452 --> 01:34:15,995
I found this.

1393
01:34:17,085 --> 01:34:19,947
I wasn’t able
to give it to you then.

1394
01:34:33,208 --> 01:34:34,284
Thank you.

1395
01:34:34,909 --> 01:34:36,160
Welcome.

1396
01:34:37,835 --> 01:34:39,174
Nice seeing you.

1397
01:34:41,923 --> 01:34:42,963
Annie,

1398
01:34:44,819 --> 01:34:46,612
thank you for keeping this.

1399
01:34:47,214 --> 01:34:48,345
You’re welcome.

1400
01:34:49,947 --> 01:34:51,588
I’ll go ahead. Bye.

1401
01:34:52,204 --> 01:34:53,245
Bye.

1402
01:34:57,386 --> 01:34:58,386
Um...

1403
01:34:59,174 --> 01:35:00,926
I want to ask you a question.

1404
01:35:01,004 --> 01:35:02,526
I hope you don’t mind.

1405
01:35:05,448 --> 01:35:07,783
Why did you choose Sue
and not me?

1406
01:35:17,562 --> 01:35:22,487
At that time,
Sue needed me more than you did.

1407
01:35:22,619 --> 01:35:23,838
She was troubled.

1408
01:35:25,025 --> 01:35:26,197
I was troubled, too.

1409
01:35:27,369 --> 01:35:31,221
So we just understood
each other well.

1410
01:35:33,076 --> 01:35:34,791
I didn’t want to mess up your life.

1411
01:35:36,985 --> 01:35:38,503
You were too good for me.

1412
01:37:17,998 --> 01:37:20,737
I think it suits my face to grace
the cover of a magazine.

1413
01:37:20,762 --> 01:37:23,674
It’s more like the cover
of a telephone directory.

1414
01:37:25,963 --> 01:37:27,732
You’re such a buzzkill.

1415
01:37:27,757 --> 01:37:30,677
You’ll start arguing again.
Stop that.

1416
01:37:30,702 --> 01:37:32,643
Let’s just prace.
The contest is about to start.

1417
01:37:32,668 --> 01:37:35,345
- Oh, relax!
- Game, game!

1418
01:37:35,370 --> 01:37:36,788
- You’re overly sensitive.
- Game, game!

1419
01:37:36,788 --> 01:37:38,832
- Places, everyone.
- Is everyone ready?

1420
01:37:38,832 --> 01:37:40,112
- Yes.
- Game!

1421
01:37:40,137 --> 01:37:42,306
Five, six, seven, eight.

1422
01:37:42,352 --> 01:37:44,396
One, two, three, four,

1423
01:37:44,421 --> 01:37:46,590
Five, six, seven, eight.

1424
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:48,550
One, two, three, four,

1425
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:50,518
- five, six, seven, eight.
- Wait. I’ll go to the cafeteria first.

1426
01:37:50,543 --> 01:37:54,065
I feel like my ulcer
is about to act up.

1427
01:37:54,090 --> 01:37:56,354
You might get possessed again.

1428
01:37:56,379 --> 01:37:58,476
Get me a can of juice, please.

1429
01:37:58,501 --> 01:38:02,143
- Me, too!
- Get me a bag of potato chips.

1430
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:03,169
Me, a bottle of water.

1431
01:38:03,194 --> 01:38:05,697
- Get me juice as well.
- Got it.

1432
01:38:05,722 --> 01:38:08,449
From the right.
Five, six, seven, eight.

1433
01:38:08,474 --> 01:38:12,479
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1434
01:38:20,207 --> 01:38:25,145
[chattering]

1435
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:28,088
I’ll have one of those.

1436
01:38:28,798 --> 01:38:30,775
And...

1437
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,802
a soda.

1438
01:38:38,433 --> 01:38:40,727
Then, maybe...

1439
01:38:42,771 --> 01:38:44,674
Don’t bother buying for yourself.

1440
01:38:44,699 --> 01:38:46,291
I’ll share this with you.

1441
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:48,453
No, thanks.

1442
01:38:49,072 --> 01:38:53,232
Come on! You want us
to be friends, right?

1443
01:38:53,257 --> 01:38:57,784
You better leave.
You’re drunk.

1444
01:38:57,827 --> 01:39:00,190
The school admin
might detain you.

1445
01:39:00,789 --> 01:39:02,999
You’re making me leave?

1446
01:39:03,442 --> 01:39:05,486
You arrogant bitch.

1447
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:09,172
Who the hell are you, anyway?

1448
01:39:09,534 --> 01:39:12,467
Who are you to refuse me?

1449
01:39:15,691 --> 01:39:18,569
Help! Ellen and Annie
are having a brawl.

1450
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:20,116
It's Annie and Ellen.

1451
01:39:20,157 --> 01:39:24,307
- What's happening?
- There’s trouble in the cafeteria.

1452
01:39:24,996 --> 01:39:27,374
It’s Annie and Ellen.

1453
01:39:27,399 --> 01:39:29,317
- Annie?
- It’s Annie.

1454
01:39:29,342 --> 01:39:31,094
Come on, hurry!

1455
01:39:31,455 --> 01:39:33,446
- Hurry!
- Go, hurry!

1456
01:39:33,846 --> 01:39:35,798
What's happening?

1457
01:39:43,963 --> 01:39:44,963
So!

1458
01:39:45,534 --> 01:39:50,174
You wanna fight me, huh?

1459
01:39:50,199 --> 01:39:53,619
You wanna mess with me, huh?

1460
01:39:53,726 --> 01:39:55,481
You’ll report me to the school admin?

1461
01:39:55,506 --> 01:40:00,596
Go ahead! I don’t care!

1462
01:40:01,116 --> 01:40:03,952
I don’t care anymore.

1463
01:40:03,977 --> 01:40:08,314
- Annie!
- What the hell are you doing here?

1464
01:40:09,682 --> 01:40:12,127
Put that down. Stop it.

1465
01:40:12,152 --> 01:40:14,821
Do you plan to save
your stupid friend?

1466
01:40:14,821 --> 01:40:16,416
No, Ellen.

1467
01:40:16,854 --> 01:40:18,150
That’s not really who you are.

1468
01:40:18,175 --> 01:40:20,362
You’re just intoxicated right now.

1469
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:22,429
Ellen, put that down.
Let’s fix this.

1470
01:40:22,454 --> 01:40:24,534
Let’s go back to the way
we used to be. Come on!

1471
01:40:24,732 --> 01:40:27,025
- To the way we used to––
- That’s enough.

1472
01:40:27,127 --> 01:40:28,328
Enough, please.

1473
01:40:28,353 --> 01:40:46,852
[girls clamoring, screaming]

1474
01:40:46,895 --> 01:40:48,313
Stop it!

1475
01:40:48,338 --> 01:41:14,564
[girls clamoring, screaming]

1476
01:41:14,589 --> 01:41:17,711
Do not involve yourself here.

1477
01:41:18,724 --> 01:41:21,601
Ellen, stop it. Please.

1478
01:41:47,413 --> 01:41:48,540
Sue!

1479
01:41:49,541 --> 01:41:51,042
Sue!

1480
01:41:51,417 --> 01:41:54,295
- Help!
- Help!

1481
01:41:56,339 --> 01:41:57,339
Sue...

1482
01:41:57,841 --> 01:42:01,524
Help! Somebody!

1483
01:42:01,549 --> 01:42:03,095
Sue…

1484
01:42:38,047 --> 01:42:39,299
Excuse me.

1485
01:42:39,488 --> 01:42:40,692
The nurse...

1486
01:42:40,717 --> 01:42:42,760
We’re here for Sue Bautista.

1487
01:42:42,785 --> 01:42:45,293
Sorry, no visitors allowed.

1488
01:42:45,496 --> 01:42:46,496
What?

1489
01:42:46,613 --> 01:42:47,672
Why not?

1490
01:42:48,356 --> 01:42:49,941
They’ll just stitch her up, right?

1491
01:42:50,241 --> 01:42:51,980
Miss, we’re friends of Sue.

1492
01:42:52,005 --> 01:42:54,777
For sure, she’d like to see us so
please give us her room number.

1493
01:42:54,802 --> 01:42:56,965
You need to keep your voices down.

1494
01:42:56,990 --> 01:42:58,450
You’ll disturb the other patients.

1495
01:42:58,475 --> 01:43:00,936
Miss, we’re begging you.

1496
01:43:00,961 --> 01:43:03,104
Doctor’s order. I’m sorry.

1497
01:43:03,473 --> 01:43:06,075
Doctor, they’re here for Suzanne Bautista.

1498
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:08,271
Doc, we’re Sue’s friends.

1499
01:43:08,309 --> 01:43:09,977
Can we see her?

1500
01:43:10,002 --> 01:43:11,355
Even just for a short while.

1501
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:16,504
She’s with her mom right now
in conversation with a psychiatrist.

1502
01:43:16,893 --> 01:43:20,559
After we stitched her wound,
she tried to slash her wrist.

1503
01:43:21,205 --> 01:43:26,043
When her doctor gives the go signal,
you may go see her.

1504
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:28,011
If you’ll excuse me…

1505
01:43:40,129 --> 01:43:53,629
"With A Smile"
Sung by: Shanne Dandan

1506
01:43:55,210 --> 01:43:57,261
We weren’t able to
do anything for her.

1507
01:44:00,407 --> 01:44:01,777
We did.

1508
01:44:03,485 --> 01:44:05,654
We’re here for her, right?

1509
01:44:07,531 --> 01:44:10,096
We’ll wait for Sue here.

1510
01:44:10,121 --> 01:44:12,512
We’ll stay here for her.

1511
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,715
Sunny forever?

1512
01:44:19,488 --> 01:44:20,722
Of course.

1513
01:44:21,930 --> 01:44:23,515
Sunny forever.

1514
01:44:23,854 --> 01:44:27,668
We should promise each other
that no matter what happens,

1515
01:44:27,693 --> 01:44:30,605
even when we grow old,
we’re still here for each other.

1516
01:44:33,902 --> 01:44:36,504
Sunny forever, right?

1517
01:44:45,904 --> 01:44:48,910
Sunny forever.

1518
01:45:03,041 --> 01:45:04,709
It’s nice.

1519
01:45:08,865 --> 01:45:10,033
And a perfect fit.

1520
01:45:10,058 --> 01:45:11,889
- Thanks, Dad.
- Sure.

1521
01:45:13,826 --> 01:45:15,381
How was your trip?

1522
01:45:15,934 --> 01:45:18,834
How’ve you been, my love?

1523
01:45:20,837 --> 01:45:23,216
We haven’t found everyone yet.

1524
01:45:26,859 --> 01:45:28,420
But you can still do it.

1525
01:45:30,203 --> 01:45:32,164
We can’t find Sue.

1526
01:45:32,189 --> 01:45:34,045
Nothing. Dead-end.

1527
01:45:34,105 --> 01:45:37,178
Easy-peasy. Social media.

1528
01:45:37,445 --> 01:45:38,446
Give me your phone.

1529
01:45:38,471 --> 01:45:39,647
You think you can find her?

1530
01:45:42,716 --> 01:45:45,530
What’s her name?
Any pictures of hers?

1531
01:45:46,579 --> 01:45:49,787
Sue Bautista.
Suzanne’s her real name.

1532
01:45:49,937 --> 01:45:52,356
Sue Bautista…

1533
01:45:52,637 --> 01:45:54,233
Who’s Sue?

1534
01:45:54,819 --> 01:45:56,733
Why is she hard to locate?

1535
01:45:57,264 --> 01:45:58,530
Were you close friends?

1536
01:45:59,121 --> 01:46:01,206
Actually,

1537
01:46:01,787 --> 01:46:03,991
she wasn’t close to any of us.

1538
01:46:04,206 --> 01:46:08,044
She’s the quiet type
who keeps everything to herself.

1539
01:46:08,333 --> 01:46:10,451
I hope you find Sue.

1540
01:46:10,597 --> 01:46:11,661
Thanks.

1541
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,912
Here.

1542
01:46:17,983 --> 01:46:19,217
Hello, Dang?

1543
01:46:20,659 --> 01:46:21,869
Annie...

1544
01:46:24,262 --> 01:46:25,733
Annie...

1545
01:48:08,421 --> 01:48:09,672
Chona,

1546
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:13,035
I’m sorry.

1547
01:48:14,899 --> 01:48:17,238
I wasn’t able to bring Sunny together.

1548
01:48:21,374 --> 01:48:23,871
But we tried our best, right?

1549
01:48:23,896 --> 01:48:24,926
Yeah.

1550
01:48:28,396 --> 01:48:29,523
Uhm…

1551
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:34,627
Hey, you’re here.

1552
01:48:35,378 --> 01:48:41,177
Bitch, finally you were able to escape
that old hag of an in-law of yours.

1553
01:48:41,202 --> 01:48:42,828
I didn’t bother asking for her permission.

1554
01:48:42,853 --> 01:48:44,410
I just left the house.

1555
01:48:44,435 --> 01:48:47,269
I’ll just ask you to adopt me.

1556
01:48:48,621 --> 01:48:52,308
You like adopting, right?
Adopt her.

1557
01:48:52,333 --> 01:48:53,785
Sure.

1558
01:49:00,356 --> 01:49:01,440
Hi.

1559
01:49:03,785 --> 01:49:04,911
Bitch,

1560
01:49:05,244 --> 01:49:07,538
why did you show up only now?

1561
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:10,839
How are you, Miss U?

1562
01:49:11,535 --> 01:49:15,660
Still a Miss U.
U for utang (debt).

1563
01:49:15,685 --> 01:49:17,309
Come here!

1564
01:49:21,899 --> 01:49:23,150
Where’s Sue?

1565
01:49:24,035 --> 01:49:25,621
We haven’t heard from her.

1566
01:49:27,188 --> 01:49:28,241
Wait.

1567
01:49:28,266 --> 01:49:30,601
Do you think she’s gone before Chona?

1568
01:49:30,626 --> 01:49:34,880
You and your foul mouth.
Everytime.

1569
01:49:35,273 --> 01:49:38,401
Chona, we’re here.
Come on.

1570
01:49:38,426 --> 01:49:41,363
These two are here as well.

1571
01:49:54,807 --> 01:49:56,360
Hello, everyone!

1572
01:49:57,663 --> 01:49:58,789
Who are you?

1573
01:49:59,107 --> 01:50:00,650
I am Attorney Martinez.

1574
01:50:00,675 --> 01:50:02,917
Is anyone facing a lawsuit here?

1575
01:50:02,942 --> 01:50:05,778
I am Chona dela Torre’s lawyer.

1576
01:50:06,197 --> 01:50:10,618
Who among you
five beautiful ladies is Annie?

1577
01:50:12,475 --> 01:50:15,869
In that case, this is for you.

1578
01:50:25,621 --> 01:50:27,289
Dear Sunny,

1579
01:50:30,091 --> 01:50:32,729
I missed you all so much.

1580
01:50:35,942 --> 01:50:38,320
By now, I have already gone.

1581
01:50:43,096 --> 01:50:48,401
Thank you, Annie,
for finding our friends.

1582
01:50:50,904 --> 01:50:53,532
I may not have lived a long life

1583
01:50:54,338 --> 01:50:58,501
but at least I was
the heroine in my life.

1584
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:03,448
You should be the heroines
in your own respective lives.

1585
01:51:05,385 --> 01:51:08,849
Annie is now the president of Sunny.

1586
01:51:08,874 --> 01:51:09,994
Wow.

1587
01:51:10,502 --> 01:51:11,502
Congrats!

1588
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:19,049
I want you all to be happy.

1589
01:51:19,970 --> 01:51:21,997
Sorry...

1590
01:51:23,406 --> 01:51:25,533
for having gone ahead.

1591
01:51:29,908 --> 01:51:35,477
I broke my promise of being there
for you all the time.

1592
01:51:35,514 --> 01:51:39,772
But I hope you’ll be there
for each other.

1593
01:51:39,797 --> 01:51:41,715
We will.

1594
01:51:46,303 --> 01:51:48,973
I love you all so much.

1595
01:51:49,594 --> 01:51:51,187
Chona.

1596
01:52:01,639 --> 01:52:06,328
Congratulations to the new president.

1597
01:52:06,353 --> 01:52:08,976
Congrats, Madam President.

1598
01:52:11,281 --> 01:52:14,296
Uh, excuse me ladies.

1599
01:52:14,321 --> 01:52:18,523
Miss dela Torre
left gifts for all of you.

1600
01:52:23,569 --> 01:52:24,614
Dang?

1601
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:26,633
- That’s me.
- Oh, sorry.

1602
01:52:28,154 --> 01:52:31,115
I am getting insurance policies
for all Sunny members so that...

1603
01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:34,015
- Wow!
- you’ll meet your sales quota.

1604
01:52:36,234 --> 01:52:43,484
Thank you.
You’re all insured now.

1605
01:52:43,509 --> 01:52:46,755
Winner!

1606
01:52:46,780 --> 01:52:49,116
- I met my quota.
- Then––

1607
01:52:52,019 --> 01:52:54,686
- Gwen?
- That’s me.

1608
01:52:55,244 --> 01:52:57,781
You’re already rich.
Give chance to others.

1609
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:02,375
One more thing. Sorry.

1610
01:53:03,063 --> 01:53:06,258
You're now the vice president
of Sunny.

1611
01:53:06,283 --> 01:53:09,858
I’ve always been the vice president, right?

1612
01:53:09,887 --> 01:53:13,307
I’m not sure.
You were the secretary, weren’t you?

1613
01:53:13,913 --> 01:53:15,648
Stop messing around!

1614
01:53:17,015 --> 01:53:18,103
Janet?

1615
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:20,320
- Yes.
- Finally, I’m correct.

1616
01:53:20,345 --> 01:53:23,071
- You majored in literature, right?
- Yes.

1617
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:26,086
I have a small digital publishing company.

1618
01:53:26,111 --> 01:53:30,591
You’ll start as intern head
for six months.

1619
01:53:30,616 --> 01:53:34,428
If you hit the sales quota
for the next two years,

1620
01:53:34,453 --> 01:53:36,492
you’ll be hired as––

1621
01:53:36,940 --> 01:53:38,608
Executive Manager.

1622
01:53:38,633 --> 01:53:41,761
Wow! Wow!

1623
01:53:41,786 --> 01:53:44,396
Wow! Oh my god!

1624
01:53:44,421 --> 01:53:46,607
Congrats!

1625
01:53:46,632 --> 01:53:50,250
Chona, thank you so much.

1626
01:53:51,742 --> 01:53:52,869
Becky?

1627
01:53:54,684 --> 01:54:00,094
I’m leaving you with an apartment
where you and your kid can live.

1628
01:54:00,321 --> 01:54:04,158
I’ll pay for your
kid’s schooling till college.

1629
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:07,736
You’re going back to school as well.

1630
01:54:07,761 --> 01:54:13,359
- Wow!
- You’ll train in running a beauty salon.

1631
01:54:14,172 --> 01:54:18,414
But before you do that,
you have to go

1632
01:54:19,185 --> 01:54:20,367
to rehab first.

1633
01:54:21,363 --> 01:54:27,234
Just do as I say because this is
for you and your kid’s welfare.

1634
01:54:28,611 --> 01:54:30,989
She’s right.

1635
01:54:34,179 --> 01:54:36,633
Thanks, Chona.

1636
01:54:36,658 --> 01:54:39,437
Thanks to all of you.

1637
01:54:42,354 --> 01:54:43,397
By the way,

1638
01:54:44,367 --> 01:54:49,444
before you receive the gifts
in Miss dela Torre’s will,

1639
01:54:49,504 --> 01:54:52,674
there is one condition.

1640
01:54:52,789 --> 01:54:53,789
What?

1641
01:54:54,157 --> 01:54:55,867
What could that be?

1642
01:55:01,015 --> 01:55:03,183
- Come on, let’s do it.
- I said I don’t want to.

1643
01:55:03,208 --> 01:55:05,002
- Do it for Chona.
- I don’t want to.

1644
01:55:05,027 --> 01:55:07,155
- Don’t make us beg.
- I practiced!

1645
01:55:07,911 --> 01:55:10,774
Come on, do a bit
of stretching.

1646
01:55:10,799 --> 01:55:12,593
- Let’s go.
- For Chona.

1647
01:55:12,618 --> 01:55:14,476
- Come on.
- We can do this.

Sue?

1662
01:56:47,854 --> 01:56:49,105
It’s Sue.

1663
01:56:52,424 --> 01:56:55,052
We tried so hard looking
for her, right?

1664
01:56:55,524 --> 01:56:57,726
- Are you real?
- She is.

1665
01:56:57,751 --> 01:57:00,033
I'm real.

1666
01:57:00,058 --> 01:57:02,314
You’re not an apparition?

1667
01:57:05,956 --> 01:57:08,792
Too bad Chona's gone but...

1668
01:57:08,792 --> 01:57:12,921
I’m sure she’s very happy
you’re here now.

1669
01:57:39,865 --> 01:57:42,826
We’re all here.

1670
01:57:51,935 --> 01:57:53,520
Here we go.

1671
01:57:53,545 --> 01:57:55,606
This is it.

1672
01:57:55,631 --> 01:57:56,982
We’re complete.

1673
01:57:57,007 --> 01:57:59,218
One, two, three...

1674
01:57:59,243 --> 01:58:02,079
Sunny!
