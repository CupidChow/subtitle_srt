Don't let them die out there!

15
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,306
Did they find my father?

16
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,394
They did.
Don't worry!

Please take care of Yeon-hee

25
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:39,216
Don't say that.
I'm getting you out of here.

00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,799
Get out of here.
Hurry.

67
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,417
Step aside!

68
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:05,171
Where do you get off trying
to sell fish

69
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,632
in front of someone else's
seafood restaurant?.

70
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,926
You're right.

71
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,004
What are you doing?.
Aren't you gonna apologize?.

72
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,430
- You got nothing to say have you?.
- She's got nothing.

73
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,927
You've got nothing to
say for yourself?.

74
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:16,929
No, nothing.

75
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,638
Orphaned children all seem to
act like that.

76
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,189
Don't talk that way.

77
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,310
How dare you look at me
like that?.

78
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,435
Stop glaring at her.

79
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,987
What?. You know I'm right!

80
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,190
When did I ever act like that?.

81
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,694
Stop talking back!

82
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,775
What did you just say?.

83
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:37,530
Did you ever support me
when my parents died?.

84
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,613
What?.

85
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,621
This bitch just doesn't get it.

86
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,203
Say it again!

87
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,998
Stop it, mom!

88
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,549
Y eon-hee, calm down!

89
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,720
Did you allow her to sell here?.

90
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,388
You bastard!

91
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,220
You stupid fool!

92
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:03,351
You're the chief of the
Prosperity Association!

93
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:07,522
Why do you always side with her?.
That's why she acts like this!

94
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,818
That's not it.

95
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,520
What do you mean,
that's not it?.

96
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,105
I'm not gonna put up with
this anymore!

97
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,906
Let's see this till the end.

98
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,825
Mom! Mom!

99
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,279
Mom! Stop it!

100
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,910
- Sit!
- Stop it!

101
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,286
Everyone, sit down!

102
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,916
I told you not to do that
around the arcade.

103
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:31,216
People see this, you setting up
shop in front of their arcade,

104
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,298
how do you think it will
affect my reputation?.

105
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,886
Anyhow, you should show
your elders some respect.

106
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,180
Your mom should know
how to behave, too!

107
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,104
Y eah, I know...
But...

108
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,106
even though I wanna
give you every convenience,

109
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,730
I never asked for any favors.

110
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,521
I didn't mean it.

111
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,527
Stubborn girl.

112
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,538
Hello, sir.

113
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,035
Hey.

114
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:09,292
Like you representatives
all know,

115
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:13,383
Haeundae is already a
world-class resort area.

116
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:20,386
It doesn't make sense not to have
a single mall in a place like...

117
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:24,390
Hey, you bastard!
You already made tons of money.

118
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,894
Now you want to destroy
this place!

119
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,482
Let's go.

120
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,392
Let me go!

121
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:35,401
Let me go!
Jerk!

122
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,402
Prof. Kim continues
with his talk of a mega tsunami,

123
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,488
can we get more specific
information?.

124
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,782
Before we do that, you'd
better explain tsunami jargon.

125
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,999
Would you mind refraining from
using the term, 'mega tsunami'?.

126
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,626
It makes everyone very uneasy.

127
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,300
In your hypothetical scenario,
a large chunk of islands break off

128
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,093
into the sea, causing a tidal wave
of unprecedented proportions.

129
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,013
Do you think
this is really possible?.

130
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,718
I'm suggesting that because
there's a possibility.

131
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:07,475
Didn't you see what happened
in Southeast Asia and China?.

132
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,478
Do natural disasters warn us
that they are coming?.

133
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,403
Some say that Korea is
a safety zone from earthquakes.

134
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,277
How many earthquakes you think
above 3.0 we have each year?.

135
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,199
An average of more than 30!

136
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,901
Is that what you call
an earthquake safety zone?.

137
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:26,615
Other experts say that
the possibility is very faint.

138
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,622
But you insist there's a strong
possibility of such an occurrence!

139
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:36,379
All I'm saying is we should
at least form a committee!

140
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,002
Can't you understand
what I'm saying?.

141
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,719
You should've just married
your earthquakes not me.

142
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,388
When did you get back
in the country?.

143
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,851
Do you actually have some
interest in me?.

144
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,644
When did you get here?.

145
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,104
Last year.

146
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,808
You could've at least called me.

147
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,733
Oh what,
You've got no hands?.

148
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,405
- You haven't changed a bit.
- You've got me beat.

149
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,905
Heard you're in charge of the
Haeundae Cultural Expo.

150
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,819
You really are a competent person.

151
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,416
- How's Ji-min?.
- Now you ask!

152
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,414
She'll be 3rd grade
next year.

153
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,996
Mommy!

154
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,419
Ji-min!

155
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,427
Who's that?.

156
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,473
This is a professor that
mommy knows. Say hi.

157
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,013
Hello.

158
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,181
Ji-min, go ahead and wait
in the car with Hae-chan.

159
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,397
Bye.

160
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,830
He's just someone that
I met back in America.

161
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,744
We're not together or anything.

162
00:11:56,341 --> 00:12:00,459
I didn't tell her about you.
It'd be better that way.

163
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:04,087
There's no need to confuse her.
Hope you understand.

164
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,301
I'd better get going.

165
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,226
- Take care of yourself.
- Okay.

166
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,023
Freak!

167
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,728
You're embarrassing us.

168
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,315
Why don't you
just study at home

169
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,492
instead of tagging along
on our vacation?.

170
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,488
Why didn't you just study harder
on your second try, loser.

171
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:33,082
People who can't study always
act like this.

172
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,826
Stop you nagging!

173
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,663
Get rid of the book now!
Guys aren't approaching us.

174
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,502
That's too hot.

175
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,299
Stop posing like that, dork!
Get back here!

176
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,503
How can you be so senseless?.

177
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:50,013
Can't you feel the guys
checking me out?.

178
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,600
- Who?.
- I'm done!

179
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,848
Is it just the three of you?.

180
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,276
What do you think?.
Is this worth your time?.

181
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,903
What number am I?.

182
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,410
If you count up all the girls that
have been on this yacht before me.

183
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,491
You're the first!

184
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:19,295
To be so stuck up and haughty
on my yacht.

185
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,666
Well, you're not so polite
yourself.

186
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,298
Shut up, bitch!

187
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,924
Do you wanna do a round shot?.

188
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,431
Nobody better break it up.

189
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,806
A real man can never be shy.
About anything!

190
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,016
It's your guts that will get you
through life.

191
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,818
- It's your what?.
- Guts!

192
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:47,695
That's right my boy! Guts!
Like a badass spirit!

193
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,570
- What kind of spirit?.
- Badass spirit!

194
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:52,821
That's right!

195
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,826
Now, from now on, you do
what I say.

196
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,832
- First, I want you to sing!
- Huh?.

197
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:05,337
You don't know any songs?.
A nursery rhyme or something.

198
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,838
I don't know any.

199
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:14,179
Come on you rascal!
Just sing anything!

200
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,394
- Pororo.
- What's that?.

201
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,179
Animation.

202
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,603
All right, that's good.

203
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,104
One-Two-Three-Four.

204
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:31,615
♪ Playtime is the best time.
Gather up your firiends.

205
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:38,701
♪ It's always so much fiun.
Trickster, Pororo.

206
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,331
Louder!

207
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:42,787
Go!

208
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,372
Mommy!

209
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,501
Alright, now I could go crazy.
T old you mommy's busy.

210
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,688
- Are You happy now?.
- Thank You mom.

211
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,489
Help!

212
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,500
Boy, I feel dizzy.

213
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,422
Help!

214
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,926
Somebody!

215
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,218
Hold tight!

216
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,220
Help...

217
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,572
Help!

218
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:59,289
Let go!

219
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,873
Let go of me!

220
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,579
You crazy!

221
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,618
What are you doing?.
Don't!

222
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:42,119
Stop! Stop!

223
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,041
Crazy...

224
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:02,761
Because you keep grabbing
my head...

225
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:08,099
- Who are you?.
- What?.

226
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,691
Yeon-hee!

227
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:18,242
Yeon-hee!

228
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,043
Yeon-hee!

229
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,129
What's all this?.

230
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,299
There were some veggies left
at the house.

231
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,593
- Where can I put this?.
- I don't need this much.

232
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,137
- Just Take it.
- Here.

233
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:44,599
Wait, I'll get you something
to drink.

234
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,240
- Was Seung-hyun here?.
- Yeah.

235
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,989
What's that?.
Did Seung-hyun draw that?.

236
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,404
Looks like it.
Where is he anyway?.

237
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,491
He was gone when I got back.
I thought he went home.

238
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,701
He didn't show up
at the house.

239
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,207
Then where did he go?.

240
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,879
Hello.

241
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,882
The police station?.

242
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,433
You'd better just tell us straight,
you scumbag.

243
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,807
I just tried to make a little
money on the side!

244
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,730
Do I look like a fraud?.

245
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,150
Stop crying and
tell him the truth!

246
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,603
Is he really your uncle?.

247
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,110
He said it's true.

248
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,317
He's my brother's son,
like I told you!

249
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,618
Seung-hyun!

250
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,490
Daddy!

251
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,787
Seung-hyun!

252
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,326
Are you Okay?.

253
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,706
Who did this to you?.

254
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,419
You Son of a bitch!

255
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,718
How could you do that to
a child?.

256
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,341
You wanna die?.

257
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:02,884
Man-sik!

258
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,726
- Stop it!
- My head, my head!

259
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,724
You can't do that here.

260
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,225
Kick his ass outside if you
want to.

261
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,898
How could you do this?.

262
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,774
All I'm saying is
he's a bastard!

263
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,398
I've known it
since we were young!

264
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,610
- Eat up!
- Okay.

265
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:30,784
Maybe it's because he's my boy,
but take a look at him!

266
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,706
Here it comes again.

267
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:38,793
Whenever he takes a test,
he always gets a perfect score.

268
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:44,301
Just to make others feel better,
he should at least get one wrong.

269
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,216
He still needs to learn
his manners.

270
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,686
Learn some manners,
okay?.

271
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,311
Y eon-hee!
I'm starved!

272
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,610
- Uncle!
- Come inside.

273
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:58,903
- You finished this late?.
- Yeah.

274
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,231
- Haven't eaten yet, have you?.
- No, give me anything.

275
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,532
Hey.

276
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,410
Where was I again?.

277
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,700
That I have no manners.

278
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,542
That's right!
You've got no manners.

279
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,919
What do we call an
ill-mannered boy?.

280
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,414
You little scoundrel.

281
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,420
Why don't you take it easy
with the alcohol?.

282
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,967
Is that your son?.

283
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:25,805
He's handsome.
Looks a lot like his mother.

284
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,882
She's not my mom.

285
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,890
She's my older sister
and he's my uncle!

286
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,305
My mom's left us.

287
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,316
Doctor! There's been another
earthquake on the seabed.

288
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,898
- An earthquake on the sea floor!
- Where?.

289
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,735
35 km off of the west coast
of Hokkaido.

290
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,820
- Intensity?.
- 3.6

291
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,075
- Depth?.
- An estimated 30km.

292
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,876
Since it's quiet in Japan, it's
unlikely there'll be a tidal wave.

293
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,791
- But something's strange.
- What?.

294
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:02,008
The epicenter's been moving toward us
since the beginning of this year.

295
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:13,436
Undersea near Tsushima Island

296
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,021
I'm sorry to bother you with this...

297
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,518
No, it's okay.

298
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,022
I'll trust you
Congressman Park.

299
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,522
I'll go ahead and do
all that I can.

300
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,696
But don't think that everything
is settled just yet.

301
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:27,401
Sometimes things work out,
and sometimes they don't.

302
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,076
Am I right?.

303
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,077
Let's get going.

304
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,333
You got everything
together alright?.

305
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,335
Y es, I put it in the car trunk.

306
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,009
Crazy bastard!

307
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,924
'some things don't work out'?.

308
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,509
There'll be no approval for the
Haeundae Golden Beach, right?.

309
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:56,103
If that's approved
we're not going to just watch.

310
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,523
You should ask the construction
division about that.

311
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,977
Don't worry. The ward head
swore on his position.

312
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,688
And you believe that?.
CHOI Eok-jo's not a pushover.

313
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:09,192
I told you not to talk about
that guy!!

314
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,535
Bottle's empty.

315
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:12,987
Y eon-hee,
bring some more drinks.

316
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,913
That's all there is.

317
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,537
Again?. You need to run your
business right.

318
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,994
- Keep some in stock.
- Shut up you jerk!

319
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,079
I'll buy some and be
back in a flash!

320
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,549
No, no, you stay here.
I'll go and borrow some.

321
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,547
Sit, sit.

322
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:28,923
Sit down, man!

323
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,680
Hey, isn't it about time
you two lived together?.

324
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,266
It's easy to see,
so stop denying it.

325
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,803
When her father died,
He left her under your care.

326
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:38,683
Knock it off!

327
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,602
- Stop talking and Just drink.
- Why?.

328
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,810
How could you say that to
someone who has a wife?.

329
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,190
What do you mean wife, shit!

330
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,900
It was just one night stand.
She doesn't deserve it.

331
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,201
Even so,
she gave him Seung-hyun!

332
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,200
So what?. Right after his birth,
she ran off with his money.

333
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,201
Hey!
I told you to stop!

334
00:22:56,292 --> 00:23:00,205
Every time someone talks about
his wife, he gets defensive.

335
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,127
To be frank, your wife...

336
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,499
I said shut up!

337
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,085
Sit down.

338
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,087
What kind of grades does
your son get?.

339
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,169
Sit down, man!

340
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:16,718
My son's a moron, you son's a
genius, you must be fucking proud.

341
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,178
Why are you being like this?.
Stop acting weird!

342
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:24,267
You're having
a grand old time here.

343
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:27,903
You! Give me back the plates that
you borrowed. I need them too.

344
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,114
I'll return them as soon as
these gentlemen leave.

345
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,736
What are you talking about?.

346
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,534
Our place is full of customers.
I need them now!

347
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,989
You've got to have a sense of
dignity before doing business.

348
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,790
Mom, please.
The chief is here.

349
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,160
She said she'll return them as soon
as we're done.

350
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,706
Crazy fool! Shut your mouth!

351
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,004
Got no place that'll serve you
so you've crawled in here?.

352
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,629
OK, I got it.
Let's go.

353
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,426
Chief, let's move to the
restaurant up there.

354
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,094
I'm alright...

355
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,513
Are you happy now?.

356
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,007
Y eah, I am.
You jerk!

357
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:05,732
Sorry about that.

358
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,104
It's too much.

359
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,694
- You serving dinner?.
- Of course. Have a seat!

360
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,529
What's good here?.

361
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,206
Pollack soup's fresh today.
Wanna try that?.

362
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,375
Give me some of that.
And a plate of raw fish too

363
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,705
Got it.

364
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:28,005
Don't make faces.
You're dying from eating here.

365
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,299
Of all the restaurants,
why does it have to be here?.

366
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,923
- Light!
- Here.

367
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,182
What's wrong with you today?.

368
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:50,899
Don't hold it all in,
just tell me what's going on.

369
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,106
I'll fix everything for you.

370
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,533
Is it because you're lonely
at night?.

371
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,369
What do you think of Man-sik?.

372
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,117
Man-sik?.

373
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,365
- CHOI Man-sik?.
- Yes.

374
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,627
- He's terrible.
- Why?.

375
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,296
He leaves a bad impression.
And on top of that his eyes slant.

376
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,919
And your eyes are that great?.

377
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,920
Enough.

378
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:20,516
When he was younger,
he was really handsome.

379
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,093
Handsome?.
Can you see out of those eyes?.

380
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:31,819
Are you insane?.
Why do I have to come with you?.

381
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,271
You've been eating on the house.
Now it's time to pay the price!

382
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,818
Is this why you fed me?.

383
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,400
- I told you I'm paying.
- Paying what?. 1 0,000won?.

384
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,404
Do you think money
just grows on trees...?.

385
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,280
You're really out of
your mind, aren't you?.

386
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:46,033
Stop messing around.
We're leaving.

387
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,039
Christ!

388
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,374
Yeon-hee!

389
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,293
Yeah?.

390
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,718
Wanna go see
a baseball game later?.

391
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:57,885
- Baseball?.
- Right, the Giants game.

392
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:04,306
I'm going with people from
the commerce association.

393
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:09,186
You can join and get to know
everyone.

394
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,398
No, I'm fine.

395
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,727
- I'll go! What time is it?.
- You just shut up.

396
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,650
How fortunate to get
to see a baseball game.

397
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,108
Yeon-hee!
Come with me!

398
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,409
He's lost it.

399
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,111
Please!

400
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,989
Please!

401
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:29,919
Jerk!

402
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,212
Come on!
You came here to get drunk?.

403
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:43,799
You're supposed to drink in
these kinds of places.

404
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,801
You want some?.

405
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,311
NO!

406
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,363
- You son of a bitch!
- Are You insane?.

407
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:02,367
Lotte is down 2 to 1 in the 5th.

408
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:05,363
It's one out, a runner at first,
and No.4 LEE is in the batter's box.

409
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,706
He doesn't look like he's in
good condition today.

410
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,121
In the 1 st inning, he struck out,
and in the 3rd he hit into a double play.

411
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:14,501
LEE Dae-ho hits the ball, PARK
catches it reaching first base.

412
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,999
He's out.
Double play out again.

413
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,626
What the hell!

414
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,714
Is it that hard to hit like this?.

415
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:24,931
This is how many today?.

416
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,634
What happened to your lips?.

417
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,935
This?.

418
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,808
It's nothing.

419
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,981
Well, it can't be nothing...

420
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,478
Give it to me straight.

421
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,982
Who's this crazy girl who
sucked on your face?.

422
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,983
You're not gonna tell us?.

423
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,906
I'm not crazy, all right?.

424
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,000
- Where's your Dad?.
- Over there!

425
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,594
Hey, Mr. Double Play!

426
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,472
LEE Dae-ho!

427
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,722
Come on!

428
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,810
Jerk!

429
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,105
You want me to come?.

430
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,810
Are you insane?.
Stop it now!

431
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:20,817
Damn! He's not gonna be easy
to brush off.

432
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,115
As a pair, they're out of
control...

433
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,110
Throw to first base!
He's out.

434
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,494
It's the third time LEE Dae-ho
is caught in a double play.

435
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,826
Consider yourself lucky I came in
person and not sued you instead.

436
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,127
You understand?.

437
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,920
No. What do you mean?.

438
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,790
Did you think you could
get away with this?.

439
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,292
You see this?.

440
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,803
Don't you think you should feel
responsible for my eye?.

441
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,298
How are you going to
compensate me?.

442
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,388
compensation...

443
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,392
- How much You get per life?.
- What?.

444
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,098
Don't they pay you by
the person?.

445
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,317
We get a salary.

446
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,610
Then how much do you make
per month?.

447
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,400
About a million won.

448
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,607
- Just one million?.
- Yeah.

449
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,029
That's how much they pay for
you to save people's lives?.

450
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,406
Well, I can't say...

451
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,997
Excuse me.

452
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,912
Yes, this is CHOI Hyung-sik.

453
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,495
Yes sir, I will return to base
immediately.

454
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,506
Hello.

455
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:26,303
Your employee won't be leaving
because he's made some commotion.

456
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,301
How the hell do you train
these guys?.

457
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,509
Jesus, you are not allowed to...
Hello?.

458
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:40,310
You pig!
Son of a bitch!

459
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,686
You funny?.

460
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:49,490
Garcia! Garcia!

461
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,286
You son of a bitch!

462
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,826
LEE, Dae-ho!

463
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,909
Wow, it's breathtaking!

464
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,418
What's did you say the name of
this place is?.

465
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,000
I-gi-dae!

466
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,000
I-gi-dae?.
Is that someone's name?.

467
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:05,668
It's an interesting name.

468
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,677
It's not a person's name.

469
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,590
Two geishas embraced an enemy
general and threw themselves

470
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,675
into the water below with them.
That's why.

471
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,218
So?.

472
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,472
I means 'two'
and Gi means 'Geisha'!

473
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,023
So?.

474
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,027
I is 'two', gi is 'geisha'!
Two geishas.

475
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,479
Is it that hard to understand...
- Yes?.

476
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,314
Where are you
Who are you with?.

477
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,695
Me?.
With the Prince of the Sea!

478
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,035
You mean the comedian
PARK Myung-soo?.

479
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,202
Is he in Busan now?.

480
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,412
Idiot.

481
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,706
Hey, Joon-ha is pissed off.

482
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,497
He won't hang out with us.
Get your ass over here, now!

483
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,703
No!

484
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,501
I'm going to stay here and
go back tomorrow.

485
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,422
What?.

486
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,471
Does the idea of sleeping with me
make your heart race?.

487
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,181
You're ridiculous.

488
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,926
Don't get carried away!
I'm gonna go back later!

489
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,012
I know. I thought so.

490
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,313
Your face turned red.

491
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,480
It's because I'm drinking.
It happens.

492
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:10,028
You know what.
You're very good-looking.

493
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,485
But when you open your mouth,
your accent ruins everything.

494
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:18,786
Actually, I can speak without
an ASSENT.

495
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,416
It's not ASSENT.

496
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,337
It's 'accent', got it?.

497
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,747
Do you usually suck at talking?.

498
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,940
Hey, Dae-ho!

499
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:48,396
You ain't a no.4 batter.

500
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,319
You make
double play records today?.

501
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:54,694
What are you looking at?.

502
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:59,198
You think you're batter?.

503
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,408
Go to hell, asshole!

504
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,120
Hey!

505
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,131
Can't stand this anymore!

506
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:11,293
You just wait,
I'm gonna kill you.

507
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:19,143
A man in the audience is stirring
up a commotion.

508
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,685
I think he's had too much
to drink.

509
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:24,432
There's a child watching all this.
It's not a good example.

510
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,313
Korean Baseball culture has
made such a progress

511
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,437
and we don't appreciate those
audience,

512
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,113
neither do the Giants fans.

513
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,028
Money makes the mare to go!

514
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,790
He'll get out soon.
Don't worry!

515
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,788
Thank you so much!

516
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,495
I'm sorry to
bother you with this.

517
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,046
It's no problem.

518
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:53,507
We've all got to look out for
each other.

519
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,426
Dae-ho's coming to
see me!

520
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,802
Man-sik, is that you?.

521
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,595
You idiot!

522
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,021
You!

523
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:08,191
- Mom!
- I'm not your mom anymore.

524
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,687
You'll be the death of me boy!

525
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,772
Do I still have to wipe
your ass too!

526
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,778
Don't talk like that
in front of my friends.

527
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:20,112
If you like baseball that much,
shut down the restaurant!

528
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,411
Starting tomorrow,
just play ball then!

529
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:27,040
Mom, you don't know a thing.

530
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,041
We're Busan citizens,
aren't we?.

531
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:33,045
A Giants' victory should be
more important than our lives.

532
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,761
Don't you know how to
bow to your uncle?.

533
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,307
You son of a dog!

534
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,510
Get out of here!

535
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,512
What?.

536
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,689
- Grow up!
- It hurts!

537
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,606
It really hurts!

538
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,309
Why you'd have to kick that dog?.

539
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,894
My skin's going to peel off.

540
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,113
It's food poisoning.

541
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,027
What?.

542
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,403
You said He Was fine
before dinner, right?.

543
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,617
Right

544
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,410
What did you guys have for
dinner?.

545
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,030
Raw fish?.

546
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,532
Anyways, he's one major
human fuck-up.

547
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:09,540
If I had a gun, I'd have
shot him on the spot.

548
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,955
Hey, get me some food.

549
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,296
Go to your own house and eat!
What am I, your wife?.

550
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:21,299
Where am I gonna go eat?.

551
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:30,981
From now on, don't borrow
from anyone.

552
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,688
And if you lend these out to
someone else, I'll be pissed.

553
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,396
What's this?.

554
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,985
Give it back to me!

555
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,820
Give me!

556
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,950
That crazy suck!

557
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,493
Come with us!

558
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,869
What are you doing?.

559
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,791
You're in big trouble.

560
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,414
Do you know who I am?.

561
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,585
How am I supposed to
know that?.

562
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,205
Hey!

563
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,710
What do you think you're doing?.

564
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,881
You know what's the worst thing
in the world?.

565
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,304
It's those bastards who play
with their food.

566
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,969
You need to get a proper taste of
life in a cell.

567
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:03,973
I don't know what you're
talking about.

568
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,600
Hey, son of bitch!

569
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,312
Shouldn't get someone when
they're off guard.

570
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,307
Crazy son of a bitch!

571
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,729
- Are you out of your mind?.
- Calm down, calm down.

572
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,730
Son of bitch!

573
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,107
Dong-choon!
Stop it!

574
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,863
- Follow me.
- Yeon-hee!

575
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,491
Hyung-sik!

576
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,620
- What's this?.
- You son of a bitch!

577
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,500
Don't!

578
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,879
Get up you bastards!

579
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,876
Why the fuck are you drunk and stirring
up shit?. I'll beat you to death!

580
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,727
Will you quiet down?.

581
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,226
You should learn to handle
your drink.

582
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:56,897
Do you have any stomach
medicine around?.

583
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,229
Check the drawer.

584
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,257
Man-sik!

585
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,800
- We've got a big problem!
- What is it?.

586
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,090
It's Hyung-sik and
Yeon-hee!

587
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,676
- What?.
- Come on! Hurry!

588
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,674
They're in fight.

589
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,600
I'm the one who got attacked!

590
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,307
Don't you see the blood?.?.

591
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:36,517
Call the chief of police!

592
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,521
Let's just go to the station
and sort it out there!

593
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,227
I didn't fight back!

594
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:42,905
Open up!

595
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,072
Man-sik!

596
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,701
- What's going on here?.
- Bro!

597
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:48,991
He made the report.

598
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:49,912
What report?.

599
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:53,537
Y eon-hee sold him spoiled food
and Hyung-sik beat him up.

600
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,538
It's hard to know
exactly what happened.

601
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,835
Look at my eyes, bastard!

602
00:36:55,922 --> 00:37:01,883
Can't we just settle it here?.

603
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,303
When a report's been made,
we've got to go to the station.

604
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,799
- Can't we work this out?.
- No!

605
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,232
Are you sick or something?.

606
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,899
I'm dying!

607
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,733
Hang in there!

608
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,611
- I'm dying, man!
- Hold on, we're almost there.

609
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,489
Where's he hurt?.

610
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,574
It's stomache poisoning.

611
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:35,496
What did he eat?.

612
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,999
- Shampoo!
- Shampoo?.

613
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,339
Stay calm!

614
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,711
Lie on your side!

615
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,087
Staly calm!

616
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:55,436
It's definitely blocked by
something. Don't think it'll work.

617
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,023
Use my hands?.

618
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,441
Hello...

619
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,522
Hello?.

620
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,076
How are preparations for the
event coming along?.

621
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:14,497
I'm not sure we'll be able to
even do the event right.

622
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,078
It's that bad?.

623
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,629
Now it's going down
just fine.

624
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,002
What kind of luxury hotel
has clogged up drains?.

625
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,710
Thanks, anyway.

626
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,930
What?.
Is there a problem?.

627
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:39,185
It's just that...

628
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,808
The hotel isn't paying you?.

629
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:46,063
Usually I get my travel cost
covered on a late call.

630
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,316
Hello!

631
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,992
I'm sorry. Never mind!

632
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,824
I'm sorry.

633
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,915
Unbelievable!

634
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:58,832
35km east of Haeundae

635
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,833
Do you think this'll take
the water pressure?.

636
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:06,087
This measuring unit could have
given early warning

637
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,005
of the tsunami 5 years ago.

638
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,711
- Are You ready?.
- Yes.

639
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:13,966
What we can only do is counter-
calculating Japan's figures

640
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,808
and just making wild guess.

641
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,511
If we wait for the Japanese to act
it's going to be too late.

642
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,891
I agree.

643
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,098
But do you think it'll work?.

644
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,807
What?.

645
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:27,104
Stop slacking, don't you want
to beat the Japanese to it?.

646
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,188
I'm very sorry.

647
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,903
Apology doesn't get you off.

648
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:36,534
When things are running smoothly,
you go and piss someone off.

649
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:42,540
The report's gone to the top so
there's nothing I can do about it.

650
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,497
Go to a quiet place and
stay there for a few days.

651
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,082
A quiet place?.

652
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,803
Stop crying and answer
the questions, ok?.

653
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:00,887
You sit down, boy!

654
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,266
I came with my mom and
her friend.

655
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,730
Mom's friend?.
What about your dad?.

656
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:11,030
No, but I know mom's
phone number.

657
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:16,453
We plan to restrict access and
have teatime here.

658
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:21,078
Coming out into a space like this
will leave an impression.

659
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,158
Excuse me.

660
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,705
When seeing this side...

661
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:29,632
Yes. This is she.
What?.

662
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,084
Incoming call: Yoo-jin

663
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:41,727
Professor.

664
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,643
We're getting continuous reports
of radon gas leaks!

665
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:45,814
What?.

666
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,021
You should come...

667
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,902
Hello?.

668
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,358
Ji-min!

669
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,209
Are you Ji-min's guardian?.

670
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,206
Yes.

671
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,289
She said that she didn't have
a father...

672
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:12,547
Her mom told me she'd be late
and asked me to come.

673
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,094
Would you mind waiting here
for a moment?.

674
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:18,090
We can only hand her over
to the official guardian.

675
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,386
I see.

676
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:32,813
What's this?.

677
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,698
Use that to help you move
your business.

678
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,990
That's all right.
Trying this on me is no use.

679
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:44,617
People died on the 'Eok-jo',
the families are all our members.

680
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:48,712
No matter how much you offer,
they'll never leave their stores.

681
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,921
Don't waste your energy.

682
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,545
Was it all my fault?.

683
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:57,800
You forced the ship out of the
port knowing a typhoon was coming.

684
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,384
Even the bodies weren't found.

685
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,594
What?. Does it sting a little?.

686
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,895
Don't contact me again!

687
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,269
Do you think you know all there is
to know about the world?.

688
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,604
Don't be fooled.

689
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:21,028
The only reason I'm not forcing
anyone out is you and Y eon-hee.

690
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:24,614
Go ahead and force us out then.

691
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,627
You can't come in here.

692
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,458
- Let me just sell one.
- Please leave!

693
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,375
Did you have anything to eat?.

694
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,631
Help!

695
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,008
- Stop!
- What do you want me to get for you?.

696
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,010
You can't sell these
inside the police station.

697
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,181
Excuse me!

698
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,892
- What can I offer you?.
- Please...

699
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:46,010
Y es?.

700
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,810
- give us a kimbap and a donut.
- Alright.

701
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,017
- How much is that?.
- 4,000 won.

702
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,901
Keep the change.

703
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:58,489
Thank you.
Thank you very much!

704
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,024
Have a nice day.

705
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,449
Thank you, officer!

706
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,074
- Ji-min!
- Mommy!

707
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,912
What happened?. You okay?.

708
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,371
I got lost.

709
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,923
I told you to stay
right next to Hae-chan!

710
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,711
Why you gotta go get lost and
make me sick with worry?.

711
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:21,922
Hey, this is your doing!
You don't get to cry.

712
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,928
Can't you see
mommy's busy working?.

713
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:26,801
Listen carefully!

714
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,224
I don't care who you meet or
who you date.

715
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:33,399
But if something happens to her,
I'm not gonna sit and watch.

716
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,611
Now you're the father of the year
after all those years of not caring?.

717
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,188
- What?.
- Don't worry about it!

718
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,899
We won't be meeting under these
circumstances ever again.

719
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,609
I've gotta leave.

720
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,830
Let's go.

721
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,492
Thank you.

722
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:05,139
If you were relocated,
you should have at least told me that!

723
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,509
I spent my whole day looking
for you!

724
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,385
What are you doing?.
Come out!

725
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:17,395
That's not going to be easy.
We know each other too well.

726
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:22,402
I'm asking you to do it,
because it isn't going to be easy.

727
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,575
You just have to persuade
Man-sik.

728
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,913
Don't worry about Man-sik.
I can handle him.

729
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,993
All right, then I won't say
anything anymore.

730
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:37,998
If you handle this well, I'll
make sure you get your own store.

731
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,466
What brought you to Haeundae?.

732
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:48,550
My name's not 'you'.
It's KIM Hi-mi!

733
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,808
And why d'you ask such
cliche questions?.

734
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:56,812
I came to have a
good time.

735
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,102
You said that you go to
Ewha Woman's University, right?.

736
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,900
That's right.

737
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,194
So, your major is...

738
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,908
I'm going to be in the theater
program.

739
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,411
I mean I'm in the program.

740
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:11,581
Then you must be good
at acting.

741
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:14,914
I'm not that great.

742
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:16,498
You wanna see?.

743
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,375
No, that's all right.

744
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,999
Hey, Hyung-sik...

745
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,927
He got a girl, you know?.
When did he...?.

746
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:27,221
Shut up, man!

747
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:29,094
You son of a bitch!

748
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:32,218
It's no use trying to
persuade me!

749
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:33,803
Is love just a game to you?.

750
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,229
You did everything to win me
over and you're ending it?.

751
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,809
Are you human?.

752
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,402
Why are you doing this to me?.

753
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,822
I'm never giving up our baby!
No, I can't!

754
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:49,740
I'll raise it on my own.

755
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,196
If you're going to go,
just go!

756
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,997
Get lost!

757
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,081
- My baby...
- Baby?.

758
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,085
I'm gonna kill myself.

759
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:03,503
Please, don't!

760
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:13,101
You're looking
really pretty today.

761
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,932
It took you long enough!

762
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,690
It's about time you got married.

763
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:23,228
Why don't you introduce me to
a good man first?..

764
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,903
Really?.

765
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,982
Should I find a guy for you?.

766
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,404
Enough of that!

767
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,484
I'm serious.

768
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,996
You know the chairman of
fishing village, Jin-seung?.

769
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:40,917
He got good education and his
personality seems pretty good.

770
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,497
Wanna give him a try?.

771
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,003
- Are you serious?.
- Huh?.

772
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,126
Are you being serious?.

773
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,299
No, I mean...

774
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,593
That's upsetting.

775
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,427
Hey Bro!

776
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,019
It's been a long time!

777
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,558
It's time for you to
clean up your act.

778
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:04,106
You're getting old,
aren't you worried?.

779
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:09,024
I'm actually planning to start up
my own business.

780
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:14,822
That's why I'm here to ask
Man-sik for some help.

781
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:20,202
By the way, your father's memorial
date is coming close, right?.

782
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,330
You even remember the date of
my father's memorial?.

783
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,211
That's really touching.

784
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,130
It's no big deal.

785
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:34,682
I was at his side when he died,
of course I remember the date.

786
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:40,020
Thanks to Man-sik, we were on
that fishing boat that day.

787
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,597
Bugger off!

788
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,324
Let me have some.

789
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,201
You're a big girl now!
Drinking booze and everything.

790
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,664
Do you still see me as a child?.

791
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,670
If not, then what?.

792
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,594
See, that's why it won't work

793
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,510
What?.

794
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,390
- Do You remember?.
- What?.

795
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:22,935
When you came to see dad on
your first deep-sea vessel ride.

796
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,107
Of course I remember!

797
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:28,315
I was a freshman in
high school then.

798
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,320
Was it that long ago?.

799
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,236
You didn't see me
before you left, right?.

800
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,534
- Were You home them?.
- Yeah.

801
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,656
Really?.

802
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,782
But I was too shy to come
out of my room.

803
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,292
- Why?.
- I don't know.

804
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,912
I guess I was going through
puberty.

805
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:49,791
Whenever I saw you,
my heart would beat so fast.

806
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,213
Your heart?.

807
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,142
What are you up to tomorrow?.

808
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,141
Tomorrow?. Why?.

809
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,522
Would you like to come with me
to my dad's grave site?.

810
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:14,190
I need to trim the grass around it
before the memorial ritual.

811
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,867
Sure. I'll go with you.

812
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,186
Fix the cage, right now!

813
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,312
Man-sik!
You have to grab this one first!

814
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,112
This is the one that
we have to fix first!!

815
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,488
If you undo that one,
the anchor will break!!

816
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,111
On land, you're the elder.

817
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:03,698
But out here, I'm your boss.
Just do as I say!

818
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:07,876
Don't you see that?. You've got
to release this right now.

819
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,038
Why do you keep talking?.

820
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,797
Just do what I say!

821
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:14,876
What are you doing?.
Aren't you gonna help?.

822
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:18,088
Don't go there!

823
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,681
Stop! Stop!

824
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,601
We don't have time!
Hurry up!

825
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,891
Don't pull that!

826
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,120
Daddy, I'm scared.

827
00:50:54,593 --> 00:51:00,589
It's all right.

828
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,967
You still mad at me?.

829
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,305
Christ!

830
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,811
That's an interesting watch.

831
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,236
Can I have it?.

832
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:17,237
What?.

833
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:20,817
Wanna switch with me?.
Mine is a really expensive one.

834
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,402
No way. I really need this
on rescue.

835
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,283
Alright, I don't want it.

836
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,408
Do know what they call
people like you?.

837
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,582
No, what?.

838
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:33,204
You're just like 3 o'clock!

839
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,288
What?.

840
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,212
You're very borderline.
Just like three in the afternoon.

841
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:42,510
Too late to go anywhere
but a waste not to do anything.

842
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:45,591
What do you mean?.

843
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:51,896
What?.

844
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,608
Wait!

845
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,318
Don't! Don't

846
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,607
Let go of me!

847
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:01,316
Don't move!

848
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,116
Oh my God!
Crazy bitch!

849
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,613
I'm so embarrassed.

850
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:07,117
The 'off to Seoul' Hi-mi is
here in Busan.

851
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,205
Maybe her identical twin?.

852
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:11,868
Slow it down!

853
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:32,388
Undersea near Tsushima Island

854
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:38,478
The figures are too similar to 2004
for it to be just a conincidence.

855
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:42,778
In 2004, the epicenter continued to
move to the right just like this.

856
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,320
Starting six months before the
tsunami, we measured

857
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,494
instances of earthquakes at a
depth of 30km on the sea floor.

858
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:49,488
How many earthquakes has it
been so far this year?.

859
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,081
More than 50.

860
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,082
Before the Southeast Asia
tsunami it was over 50 as well.

861
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,790
- What's the median severity?.
- 3

862
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,417
There's been another
earthquake on the sea floor!

863
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:00,420
- Where?.
- East of Tsushima Island!

864
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,092
- What's the magnitude?.
- 5.6.

865
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:04,511
They're getting bigger

866
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:12,220
This is a serious situation.

867
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:15,806
There's a million gathered at
Haeundae right now.

868
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,892
If a tsunami hits
under such circumstances...

869
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:23,401
Are there any chances of
a tsunami hitting Korea?.

870
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,909
How many earthquakes you think
occur around Korea per year?.

871
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,701
About three or four?.

872
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:31,618
30 of more than 3.0 in intensity.

873
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,700
So far this year,
we've already had 50.

874
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:37,704
And what's more important is the
epicenters are moving closer to Korea.

875
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:42,504
If Tsushima Island, between
Korean and Japan, collapses,

876
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:44,801
the chances of a mega-tsunami
are extremely high.

877
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:45,877
A mega-tsunami?.

878
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,104
Let's say that the bubbles are
about the size of a wave that

879
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,893
would arise in the event
of an earthquake.

880
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,521
If the western part of Tsushima
sinks into the water,

881
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:04,230
the shock from that would create
a wave of an unimaginable height.

882
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,319
That is a mega-tsunami.

883
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,451
The waves of the 2004 tsunami
were three to four meters.

884
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:13,080
If Tsushima Island collapses
the waves will top 50 meters.

885
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,407
Is that a real possibility?.

886
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,583
I'm talking about a minimum
of 50 meters.

887
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:18,710
A wave over 1 00 meters
is possible.

888
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:22,005
Then what is it we've got
to do to prepare?.

889
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,582
If the tsunami warning goes off,

890
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,880
we've got to evacuate people
within ten minutes.

891
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:29,096
Within that amount of time?.

892
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:33,017
A tsunami causes tidal wave
that travels 700 kilometers per hour.

893
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,013
700 kilometers?.

894
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:37,517
If a tsunami starts at Tsushima,
to get to Haeundae it would take...

895
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:40,350
- How long?.
- Less than ten minutes!

896
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:50,610
What you doin' there?.
Did you fight with my father?.

897
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,778
Get over here.

898
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:54,617
Alright...

899
00:54:56,168 --> 00:55:04,507
Father, I brought your favorite,
Man-sik here with me.

900
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,713
You happy?.

901
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:14,430
I wanted to tell you something
very important today.

902
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:22,309
He's taken care of me so well.
Now I wanna return the favor.

903
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:29,068
Sometimes, he even takes care
of me better than you did.

904
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:40,999
Well, I keep dropping hints but
that dullard never gets it.

905
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:46,086
So I"ve been a little
frustrated lately.

906
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:56,890
But I can't just bare my heart
to him first.

907
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:04,268
So you coach
that man over there well.

908
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:09,113
You were always popular with
the ladies.

909
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:16,529
Hey, you listen to what my father
tells you, all right?.

910
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,705
I'll be back in a sec.

911
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,275
How are you holding up?.

912
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,162
I'm so sorry.

913
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:11,626
I'm sorry.

914
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,795
I'm sorry.

915
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,805
I'm sorry.

916
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:23,637
What do you mean?.

917
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:26,807
What if...

918
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:34,361
in the future, Y eon-hee became
my wife, how would you feel?.

919
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,071
How much did you drink?.

920
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,779
Show some respect.

921
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,201
Are you serious?.

922
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:51,624
Listen carefully.
If there's a girl from Seoul

923
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,084
who goes to a good university

924
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:58,923
and is so hot and
from a rich family.

925
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:03,226
Could I go out with a girl like
that?. That make any sense?.

926
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,678
It does not.

927
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,685
Right?.
It doesn't, does it?.

928
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:11,276
Don't drink too much.

929
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,533
Think about it carefully.

930
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:26,534
What Y eon-hee's father's
last words were.

931
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,175
Run to the restaurant in 1 0 minutes,
or you'll be dead and so will I.

932
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,727
Can I...

933
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:52,397
be out for about an hour?.

934
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,609
Where are you going this time?.

935
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:57,732
Just an hour.
I have an important appointment.

936
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,402
CHOI Hyung-sik?.

937
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,383
...the fireworks display
of the World Culture Expo.

938
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:28,725
You're a natural.

939
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:31,724
How many girls did you get
with that act?.

940
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:37,650
But I cannot forgive you for
flirting with my fiancé.

941
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,026
What?.

942
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:47,206
You should know who she's with
before you flirt with her.

943
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:50,914
She's not the kind of girl
within your reach.

944
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,212
You're a real classy guy.

945
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:08,727
I hope this is the last time that
I see you.

946
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:14,104
If I catch you again,
I'll beat the shit out of you.

947
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,896
You look as if something good has
just happened to you.

948
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,821
Yep, that's right.

949
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:22,490
What happened?.

950
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:29,115
Today finally, Mipo, Golden Beach
has been approved.

951
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:34,919
But you don't need to worry
about it.

952
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,131
I promised your dad I'd
take care of you.

953
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:45,631
Drop by my office tomorrow.
I'll set you up with a good spot.

954
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,011
No that's all right.

955
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:52,730
You've already
helped me out a lot.

956
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,728
You leaving now?.

957
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:03,907
- Do you want me to call a taxi?.
- No, no. I'm fine.

958
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,276
Eok-jo!

959
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:10,281
I will send the rent fee for the boat
in a few days.

960
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:15,203
I don't spare money
when it comes to you.

961
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,837
So don't work too hard
for money.

962
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:22,584
Alright. Good-bye.

963
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,187
Why did that old man come here?.

964
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:37,398
Just to have dinner.

965
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:40,022
Don't serve him next time.
He pisses me off.

966
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:43,822
- What brings You so late?.
- Oh, right!

967
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,329
What's the special occasion?.

968
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,579
Wait a second.

969
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,466
Y eon-hee!

970
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:14,473
I love you!

971
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:18,022
I want you to be the mother
of my children!

972
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:21,943
What are you doing?.

973
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,314
I'm p p-pro-posing.

974
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,947
Why aren't you answering?.

975
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,662
- Answer What?.
- Say You will marry me.

976
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,915
- Let me think about it...
- think about What?.

977
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,368
You have to give me time
to think.

978
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:42,999
If it's a 'yes' it's a 'yes.'
What's there to think about?.

979
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:47,587
Early tomorrow morning,
come to my restaurant.

980
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:53,221
If there is a red ribbon tied to
my boat, it's a 'yes.'

981
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,517
Don't expect too much though.

982
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,310
Why don't you just give me
an answer now?.

983
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:04,649
Come, look!

984
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:11,919
Are you playing with me?.

985
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,097
I have been waiting for you
all day.

986
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:18,101
If you can't keep promises,
you shouldn't make one.

987
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:21,021
And if you can't keep a promise,
you should at least explain why.

988
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:25,104
Hey. Are you going to keep
ignoring me?.!

989
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:26,943
Hey, you!

990
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,034
Hey!

991
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,035
Don't fool around with me.

992
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:46,585
Don't come to see me.
I don't want to see you again.

993
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,377
What?.

994
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:54,670
What?. Interview?.

995
01:04:55,016 --> 01:05:00,101
It's a small company but the
salary's almost 2 million won.

996
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,686
I had a really hard time getting
someone I know to arrange it.

997
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:05,231
Stop it. How can I be doing
job interviews at my age.

998
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,934
Then are you going to live without
a job for your entire life?.

999
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:11,021
Who said I would be jobless for
the rest of my life?.

1000
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:14,108
Stubborn jackass!

1001
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,618
Anyway, I won't go.
Don't try to persuade me.

1002
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:22,290
I'm begging you.

1003
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:25,786
I don't even have an acceptable
pair of shoes.

1004
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:29,585
Will you go if I buy you shoes?.

1005
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:33,294
Just forget about it!

1006
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,297
Why is it so hard for you to go
to a job interview?.

1007
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,220
Go and at least try.

1008
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:43,303
Why don't you go?.
I'm too old for that.

1009
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,682
That attitude is the reason
you don't have a woman.

1010
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:50,106
Shit. I'll burn your mouth.

1011
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:53,029
Moron, you say that all the time.

1012
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:56,779
My skin doesn't look right.

1013
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:01,405
Are you insane?.
Why are you in such a good mood?.

1014
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,581
Why?. Do you want to know?.

1015
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,041
No way!

1016
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:06,288
Do you want me to tell you?.

1017
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:08,582
I didn't say I want to know.

1018
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:10,497
In fact...

1019
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,588
T oday Man-sik proposed to me!

1020
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,302
- What?.
- Isn't it funny?.

1021
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,138
I was so shocked.

1022
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,140
Embarrassed...

1023
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:27,689
Why?. Do you feel jealous?.

1024
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:31,184
This just isn't right.

1025
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,311
What do you mean?.

1026
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:36,774
What's he thinking?.

1027
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,404
What are you saying?.

1028
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:44,785
Do you know how your dad
passed away?.

1029
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,705
We've got major problems here.

1030
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:51,037
The path of the typhoon
has already shifted toward us.

1031
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:54,044
And underwater earthquakes are
occurring once every two days.

1032
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:56,672
Another earthquake happened off
the shore of Tsushima Island!

1033
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:58,754
This time it's 6.5.

1034
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:00,881
Doctor!
We are connected to Japan!

1035
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:04,225
This is KIM Hwi.

1036
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:07,603
What?. Has a tsunami warning
already been issued?.

1037
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:11,892
Under sea near Tsushima Island

1038
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,328
What are you doing here?.

1039
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,407
Nothing.

1040
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:32,288
You must be waiting for Yeon-hee.
But she won't be coming.

1041
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:33,371
What?.

1042
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:40,887
Thanks to you,
Eok-jo cussed me out.

1043
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:50,311
You act like you don't care about
justice at all,

1044
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,892
so I told her the truth!

1045
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:58,321
Since I was a kid, my nickname
was the 'guardian of justice.'

1046
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,528
You son of a bitch!

1047
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,203
You get here!

1048
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:07,201
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1049
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:08,407
Come here, you!

1050
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,495
You, scumbag!

1051
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,124
You killed her dad.

1052
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:20,301
Isn't it true?.
Take your hand off!

1053
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:34,975
What the hell...

1054
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:37,982
Haeundae Cultural Expo

1055
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:46,193
What?.

1056
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:48,488
Has he gone crazy?.

1057
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,865
Wait up.
I'm coming right now.

1058
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,993
What are you talking about?.

1059
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,121
How can we evacuate 1 million
people right now?.

1060
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:58,501
On top of that the 'Culture Expo'
opened today.

1061
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:01,627
If we put a halt to it, we'll
be the world's laughing stock!

1062
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:03,712
Then do you want all the
people here to die?.

1063
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:06,138
In Japan, the cautionary warning
has already been issued.

1064
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:09,342
In Japan, earthquakes happen
a lot.

1065
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,769
Do you have proof a tsunami
will be coming here?.

1066
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:15,686
Last night's 6.5 earthquake
occurred near Tsushima Island.

1067
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:18,314
There is a high chance a stronger
earthquake will hit soon.

1068
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:21,396
Moreover, if an earthquake over 7.0
occurs off the shore of Tsushima,

1069
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:23,231
Haeundae will be in grave danger.

1070
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,406
Didn't you see what happened
in Southeast Asia?.

1071
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,325
300,000 died in an hour!

1072
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,778
You're driving me crazy...

1073
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:32,411
Why are you doing this to me?.
Do you want to ruin my life?.

1074
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:34,917
I never wanted to interrupt
your work!

1075
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:36,999
I just told them because it is
a terribly dangerous situation.

1076
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:40,332
For the last year, I've been
risking my career over this!

1077
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,917
You think you are the only one
who is working?. I do too!

1078
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:46,379
Even if you try to get in my way,
I will continue.

1079
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:49,303
I'm not ignoring you,
so just calm down.

1080
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:50,804
Why don't you send Ji-min
to Seoul first.

1081
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,887
Don't boss me around.
I'll handle Ji-min on my own.

1082
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:56,063
She's with that strange jerk,
isn't she?.!

1083
01:09:56,693 --> 01:10:00,686
Watch your mouth. He is more
reliable than you'll ever be!

1084
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:06,067
Stay out of my life, alright?.

1085
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,005
What are you doing?.

1086
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:07,173
You guys go on ahead.
I can't go today.

1087
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:10,804
What?. You've already come
all this way.

1088
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,715
Next time!

1089
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:26,901
Oh, come on in.
You brought your legal seal, right?.

1090
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:29,399
What are you talking about?.

1091
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:33,699
I don't need a store.

1092
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:35,780
Why?.

1093
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,409
I've been thinking about it
since yesterday.

1094
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:47,627
You, my father and I,
are all people of Haeundae.

1095
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:53,344
Everyone here is
like family to me.

1096
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:59,896
Even if I get a new store,
And live off of it,

1097
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,314
dad would not be happy.

1098
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:09,523
Please consider Man-sik,
and think it over once again.

1099
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,612
I'm asking you as a favor.

1100
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:19,078
I'll be leaving now.

1101
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,089
And I...

1102
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,964
I'm leaving Haeundae
next week.

1103
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,905
Prince of the Sea

1104
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,822
Come on, Hi-mi!

1105
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,022
Let's go to the hot spring.

1106
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:01,301
Under sea near Tsushima Island

1107
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:07,727
West of Tsushima Island

1108
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:21,199
We can't wait any longer.

1109
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,201
First, we have to evacuate
the people on the beach.

1110
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,784
What are you talking about?.
There's been no directive yet.

1111
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,912
This is not the time for us to
just wait around for directives.

1112
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:29,916
Something's not right here.

1113
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:32,623
If we issue an evacuation order and
nothing happens,

1114
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:34,709
will you take
the responsibility for it?.

1115
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:36,927
What the hell...

1116
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,797
Director!
I've got the order,

1117
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:42,801
to issue the tsunami warning
and clear out immediately!

1118
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:45,345
What?.

1119
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:52,102
Hurry! Issue the warning and
make an announcement, now.

1120
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:59,367
Haeundae has one of the biggest
beaches in Asia along with

1121
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:06,375
Dongbaek Island, Moonrise Hill,
Hot spring, Oryuk Island.

1122
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:10,291
Busan, an internationally recognized
tourist attraction,

1123
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:13,999
is incomparable to any
other city in its cultural diversity.

1124
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:20,513
Also, as a port city, it has
strived to expand cultural...

1125
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:42,907
Could you wrap up here?.
I have to go check on Ji-min.

1126
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:47,616
35km east of Haeundae

1127
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:52,878
Where are you now?.

1128
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:56,170
I am going to get my car
repaired. Why?.

1129
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,084
What's your shoe size?.

1130
01:15:58,471 --> 01:15:59,802
Shoes?.

1131
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:03,882
Why are you asking?. Didn't
you go to a picnic today?.

1132
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:07,886
Just answer the question.
What size is it?.

1133
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:10,479
Whatever. I'm really busy
right now.

1134
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:15,818
Do you like fishing?.

1135
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:19,193
Did you plan this?.
All part of your scheme?.

1136
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:23,617
No, I'm just going by the plan
your friends came up with.

1137
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:27,078
Those losers...

1138
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:28,288
They must be having
a good time, right?.

1139
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,616
Don't worry. It's over now.

1140
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:35,080
Joon-ha always wins.

1141
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:37,002
That bitch is so lucky.

1142
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,630
You sound a little emotional
about it.

1143
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,085
No, I'm not.

1144
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:43,713
I'm going to the restroom.

1145
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:58,694
Y eon-hee...
I will explain everything.

1146
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:02,356
Can I just be alone today?.

1147
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:05,109
You can if you want, but...

1148
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:16,838
An earthquake warning was
issued as of 2:30 p.m.

1149
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:20,007
Everyone on the beach should
seek high ground immediately...

1150
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,133
What's wrong with you?.

1151
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:25,489
20km east of Haeundae

1152
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:29,909
Check out the situation in
Japan right now.

1153
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:31,324
How's the evacuation
situation?.

1154
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,825
We're preparing for it now.

1155
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:34,498
It is not easy to clear out
a crowd of one million.

1156
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:36,200
Doctor! It's serious.

1157
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:38,995
They're saying a tsunami is coming
toward Korea now.

1158
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:40,579
- the estimated time?.
- Around 1 0 minutes.

1159
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,081
- Height?.
- We Have yet to...

1160
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:43,799
Go and check it out immediately!

1161
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:48,303
Hello!

1162
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:49,930
Where is she?.

1163
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:54,594
I told you to
take good care of her.

1164
01:18:56,232 --> 01:19:00,020
First of all, get all the people
to high ground in 1 0 minutes.

1165
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:03,398
- Where Are You going?.
- I'll be back soon.

1166
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:08,945
1 5km east of Haeundae

1167
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:15,497
What are you going to do?.

1168
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:20,916
Can't you see that cracked
front screen?.

1169
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:22,837
Uncle Dong-choon!

1170
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:29,921
Well... we left Sooyoung Bay
two hours ago...

1171
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,300
Where the hell are we!

1172
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:05,580
Mommy...

1173
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:10,677
Anyone out there?.

1174
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:15,516
- Hello?.
- Which room is she in?.

1175
01:20:16,437 --> 01:20:18,803
- The 1 7thfloor, Room one.
- Room one on the 1 7th?.

1176
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:21,104
Okay, where are you?.

1177
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:22,897
I'm nearby.
I had a problem.

1178
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:26,394
Anyway, you need to get
to a high building!

1179
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:27,318
What?.

1180
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:29,021
A tsunami is headed straight for
Haeundae beach now.

1181
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:09,106
Man-sik...

1182
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:27,496
What's that?.

1183
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:46,689
Help! Rescue us!

1184
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:05,792
You-kyung!

1185
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,119
You-kyung!

1186
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:09,004
You-kyung!

1187
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,586
You-kyung!

1188
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:14,293
You-kyung!

1189
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,133
You-kyung!

1190
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,871
Uncle! Grandma!

1191
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:49,043
Ma'am!

1192
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:51,496
Ma'am!

1193
01:22:58,891 --> 01:22:59,880
Hurry!

1194
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:55,583
Help!

1195
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:59,500
There! Over there!

1196
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:03,804
Rescue ship found. We will
begin rescue work right away.

1197
01:25:06,727 --> 01:25:10,436
Hello! Is anyone here?.
Hello!

1198
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:35,793
Man-sik!

1199
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:39,502
Yeon-hee!

1200
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:55,689
Yeon-hee!

1201
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:11,075
Seung-hyun!

1202
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,241
Ma'am!

1203
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:16,251
Help!

1204
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:17,327
Basket!

1205
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:19,629
What basket?.

1206
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:21,707
Basket, you moron!

1207
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:25,386
I heard there are only two here.
I just brought a safety belt.

1208
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:26,879
You, fucking idiot!

1209
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:29,597
Throw it quickly.

1210
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:30,674
Alright!

1211
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:32,976
Help!

1212
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:34,519
Nobody there?.

1213
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:37,063
Hyung-sik! Hyung-sik!

1214
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:39,065
Seung-hyun!

1215
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:42,315
Haven't you seen
a little kid?.

1216
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:06,903
Man-sik!

1217
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:11,070
Yeon-hee! Climb up!

1218
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:15,699
Quickly!

1219
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:17,989
I'm fine. You go first.

1220
01:28:18,084 --> 01:28:19,995
Stop talking and just do it.

1221
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:22,168
Just do it!

1222
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:24,170
Step on my shoulder and
get up there fast!

1223
01:28:24,341 --> 01:28:27,003
We don't have time.

1224
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:36,807
Man-sik!

1225
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:39,056
Hurry!

1226
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:41,054
Hurry up!

1227
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:27,275
Mom! Mom!

1228
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:31,897
- Ji-min!
- Help!

1229
01:29:31,992 --> 01:29:35,530
Help!

1230
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:39,287
Help!

1231
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:44,079
Ji-min!

1232
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:46,586
Hold my hand tight.

1233
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:50,082
Ji-min!

1234
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:01,017
Nobody out there?.

1235
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,190
One by one!

1236
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:11,612
You son of a bitch!

1237
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:15,107
Don't!
Hi-mi!

1238
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:24,408
Hyung-sik!

1239
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:31,294
Good job, good job.

1240
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:32,924
Are you okay?.

1241
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:35,502
Arms! Arms! Okay!

1242
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:39,301
You first!

1243
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:40,932
What about you?.

1244
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:42,304
I'll take him and go.

1245
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,177
- Coming Right back?.
- Yeah.

1246
01:30:44,314 --> 01:30:46,805
Let me ask one thing.

1247
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:47,647
What?.

1248
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:49,645
Are you really engaged to him?.

1249
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:52,193
What?. We barely know
each other.

1250
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:54,983
That bastard!

1251
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:58,775
Go ahead.

1252
01:30:58,912 --> 01:30:59,901
Roll up!

1253
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:05,700
Come up quickly, okay?.
You got that?.

1254
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:21,635
Hello?. Where are you?.

1255
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,175
I'm fine.
What about Ji-min?.

1256
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:25,601
I'm with her on the roof.

1257
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:28,813
Where are you?.

1258
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:31,099
Tell me where you are!!

1259
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:32,692
Inside the elevator.

1260
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:33,355
What?.

1261
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:35,612
I'm stuck in
the hotel elevator.

1262
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:36,609
Which floor?.

1263
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:38,281
1 0th floor.

1264
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:41,617
Honey.

1265
01:31:43,123 --> 01:31:47,287
Honey, I gotta go.

1266
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:48,913
Wait! I will be there soon.

1267
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:54,124
No, don't come! It's too late.
The water's up to my neck.

1268
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:57,004
Y oo-jin!

1269
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:58,798
Hold yourself together!

1270
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:00,587
Ji-min's here!

1271
01:32:03,393 --> 01:32:05,509
It's mom.
Wait here for a second.

1272
01:32:05,812 --> 01:32:06,892
Mom!

1273
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:12,106
Mommy!

1274
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:14,809
Ji-min, are you all right?.
Are you hurt?.

1275
01:32:14,904 --> 01:32:18,271
No, I'm fine.
I'm with your friend!

1276
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:23,403
Ji-min, listen carefully to
what I'm about to say.

1277
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:25,028
Get out of my way!

1278
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:29,290
There's one thing I haven't been
able to tell you.

1279
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:35,998
The man you are with now
is your dad.

1280
01:32:37,719 --> 01:32:41,712
I was going to tell you
someday...

1281
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:46,467
Mom, why are you crying?.
Come here quickly. I miss you.

1282
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:49,306
I miss you, too.

1283
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,479
I miss you so much.

1284
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:54,399
I love you.

1285
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:56,734
I love you, too.

1286
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:59,646
I love you so much.

1287
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:06,195
Mom! Mom!

1288
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:10,456
Mom! Mom!

1289
01:33:21,387 --> 01:33:23,469
Yoo-jin!

1290
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:34,727
Yoo-jin!

1291
01:33:35,485 --> 01:33:36,645
Yoo-jin!

1292
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:09,307
Come outside quickly!

1293
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:33,716
Hold still!

1294
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:36,928
- Don't move!
- Help!

1295
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:49,740
Stupid bastard!

1296
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:53,987
The victim is fallen down!

1297
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:55,909
The victim is fallen down!

1298
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,365
No, don't go.

1299
01:35:57,502 --> 01:36:01,086
Hey! It's so dangerous!

1300
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:02,829
I'll be back soon!

1301
01:36:02,924 --> 01:36:04,209
No!

1302
01:36:05,218 --> 01:36:07,925
No, Hyung-sik!

1303
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:10,924
No, don't!

1304
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:20,852
Hold on a little longer!

1305
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:24,400
Grab my hand!
Hold on!

1306
01:36:25,405 --> 01:36:27,111
Grab my hand!

1307
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:30,273
Man-sik!

1308
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,222
Man-sik, hold my hand tight.

1309
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:57,096
If you let go of my hands,
you're a dead man!!

1310
01:37:00,023 --> 01:37:01,183
Yeon-hee!

1311
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:05,308
I want to tell you
one last thing!

1312
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:06,188
What is it?.

1313
01:37:06,321 --> 01:37:09,563
I was going to say this earlier...

1314
01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:15,027
But I couldn't bring myself
to do it.

1315
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:17,696
Shut your mouth and just
hold on.

1316
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,414
No, no.

1317
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:23,918
If I die like this, my soul will
never be at peace.

1318
01:37:24,714 --> 01:37:26,204
What are you talking about?.

1319
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:28,423
Aren't you going to marry me?.

1320
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:31,300
Were you just playing with me?.

1321
01:37:31,387 --> 01:37:35,175
No, I wasn't kidding.
I meant it.

1322
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:40,093
I really love you!

1323
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:43,100
Then live!

1324
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:46,475
Only when you live, we can get
married or whatever you want!

1325
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:49,397
Thanks...

1326
01:37:49,947 --> 01:37:51,312
Thank you so much...

1327
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:52,939
Stop!

1328
01:37:53,034 --> 01:37:58,495
If you die today,
I'll really kill you!!

1329
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:00,321
Hold tight.

1330
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:02,953
Hold tight.

1331
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:04,375
Yeon-hee!

1332
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:06,369
Live on.

1333
01:38:10,927 --> 01:38:12,508
Live on.

1334
01:38:13,304 --> 01:38:15,090
Yeon-hee, and be happy.

1335
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:19,007
Man-sik!

1336
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:25,097
Man-sik!

1337
01:38:28,778 --> 01:38:29,392
Man-sik!

1338
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:40,116
Wake up, man!

1339
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:42,117
Baby, hold tight!

1340
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:43,414
Come here!

1341
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:45,124
Come here, man!

1342
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:02,300
Hold on tight, man!

1343
01:39:07,692 --> 01:39:08,681
Man-sik!

1344
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:10,854
You alright?.

1345
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:18,195
Good. Good.

1346
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:20,572
Good. Good.

1347
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:27,788
Eok-jo!

1348
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:34,297
Eok-jo!

1349
01:39:36,596 --> 01:39:37,711
Uncle!

1350
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:41,047
Eok-jo!

1351
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:43,383
Uncle!

1352
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:49,389
Uncle!

1353
01:39:50,026 --> 01:39:51,766
Uncle!

1354
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:00,404
You okay?.

1355
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:07,206
What's happening?.

1356
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:08,871
I think it's too heavy!

1357
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:10,209
What are you doing?.

1358
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:12,044
What are you doing?.
Roll in the rope!

1359
01:40:12,131 --> 01:40:13,792
Wait a second!

1360
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:21,504
The rope is about to fall apart!

1361
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:23,214
Then what?.

1362
01:40:23,309 --> 01:40:24,515
Just a second!

1363
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:25,884
What's wrong?.

1364
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:29,763
The rope is about to fall apart.

1365
01:40:30,233 --> 01:40:32,394
- What?.
- Hold on just a second.

1366
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:50,666
What if it's just one person?.

1367
01:40:51,671 --> 01:40:54,879
Y eah, it may be able to handle
just one!

1368
01:40:55,967 --> 01:40:59,130
No, Hyung-sik, no!

1369
01:41:02,139 --> 01:41:03,879
Don't!

1370
01:41:40,303 --> 01:41:41,713
What are you doing?.

1371
01:41:45,433 --> 01:41:46,718
Hey...

1372
01:41:49,895 --> 01:41:54,434
Give this watch to Hi-mi
over there.

1373
01:41:58,696 --> 01:42:00,106
Hyung-sik, No.

1374
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:04,107
Don't!

1375
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:07,193
Do something!

1376
01:42:15,129 --> 01:42:16,209
Don't worry!

1377
01:42:18,507 --> 01:42:20,714
It's not three o'clock yet.

1378
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:24,718
No!

1379
01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:37,056
Are you crazy?.

1380
01:42:37,234 --> 01:42:38,223
Hyung-sik!

1381
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:39,892
Hey!

1382
01:42:41,906 --> 01:42:42,895
Don't!

1383
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:44,696
Hurry back and don't take
too long.

1384
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:48,697
You're gonna die
if you cut the rope!

1385
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:01,106
Hyung-sik!

1386
01:44:02,528 --> 01:44:04,439
No!

1387
01:44:12,413 --> 01:44:14,995
Women and children first!

1388
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:16,492
Here is a kid

1389
01:44:19,879 --> 01:44:21,790
Mommy!

1390
01:44:23,799 --> 01:44:25,505
- Yoo-jin!
- Mommy!

1391
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:29,339
Mommy!

1392
01:44:30,598 --> 01:44:33,886
- Are You okay?.
- I'm okay.

1393
01:44:35,895 --> 01:44:37,101
Okay!

1394
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:51,482
Here's a kid!

1395
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:52,904
Move!

1396
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:56,078
Please take her.

1397
01:44:56,165 --> 01:44:57,780
Move!
Move out the way!

1398
01:45:00,336 --> 01:45:06,002
This is my daughter.
Please take her.

1399
01:45:06,091 --> 01:45:07,171
Please take her!

1400
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:36,198
I'll take care of her,
don't worry.

1401
01:45:36,914 --> 01:45:38,324
I'll take care of her,
don't worry.

1402
01:45:49,218 --> 01:45:50,503
Ji-min!

1403
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:55,805
I'm your dad!!

1404
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,191
Daddy!

1405
01:46:18,539 --> 01:46:20,621
Daddy!

1406
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:31,058
And you call yourself a man?.

1407
01:47:34,990 --> 01:47:36,526
Yoo-jin...

1408
01:47:39,536 --> 01:47:44,371
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry...

1409
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:48,701
Me too.

1410
01:48:38,595 --> 01:48:40,005
Help!

1411
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:43,180
Help!
Grandma!

1412
01:48:43,809 --> 01:48:44,798
Seung-hyun!

1413
01:48:47,271 --> 01:48:49,512
Seung-hyun,
come on over here!

1414
01:48:50,274 --> 01:48:51,730
You should swim.

1415
01:48:52,109 --> 01:48:52,894
I can't swim.

1416
01:48:53,027 --> 01:48:56,190
What are you doing?.
Jump into the water.

1417
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:58,111
I'm not that good of
a swimmer.

1418
01:48:58,198 --> 01:49:00,405
- What?.
- I Can only Do the dog paddle.

1419
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:02,274
You crazy guy!

1420
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:15,079
Here! Help!

1421
01:49:42,743 --> 01:49:48,079
We should not forget the
sacrifice of ocean rescue workers

1422
01:49:49,083 --> 01:49:55,795
who put the lives of those
in danger ahead of their own.

1423
01:49:57,299 --> 01:50:03,716
In the face of such adversity,
they worked fearlessly

1424
01:50:03,806 --> 01:50:12,305
to secure the safety of
the people.

1425
01:50:13,107 --> 01:50:20,104
We express our deepest respect
and honor to them.

1426
01:50:20,697 --> 01:50:24,610
We bear the guilt of sending
them to their place of death

1427
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:31,197
when we look upon the faces
of their families.

1428
01:50:32,376 --> 01:50:39,293
We have gathered here today
to offer these heroes

1429
01:50:39,842 --> 01:50:46,714
a worthy send off to their
eternal resting place.

1430
01:51:16,753 --> 01:51:19,586
Then who saved you?.

1431
01:51:19,923 --> 01:51:20,833
Me?.

1432
01:51:20,924 --> 01:51:23,461
Mom's friend...

1433
01:51:24,178 --> 01:51:25,293
Friend?.

1434
01:51:27,097 --> 01:51:29,088
I mean, my dad.

1435
01:51:29,183 --> 01:51:30,548
Ji-min!

1436
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:34,556
- It's time to go.
- I'm coming!

1437
01:51:35,105 --> 01:51:38,188
- Good bye.
- Bye bye.

1438
01:51:41,904 --> 01:51:42,893
Hey!

1439
01:51:43,322 --> 01:51:46,029
Have we met before?.

1440
01:51:57,085 --> 01:52:00,202
Anyhow, don't you think
Eok-jo was great?.

1441
01:52:00,297 --> 01:52:01,457
Right!

1442
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:03,922
When did he go to the office
and cancel the license?.

1443
01:52:04,009 --> 01:52:06,375
I heard he went there when
earthquake was happening,

1444
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:07,926
just before the tsunami struck.

1445
01:52:08,013 --> 01:52:12,097
If he hadn't gone to the office,
he would still be alive.

1446
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:15,012
He is not the only one
who was unlucky.

1447
01:52:15,103 --> 01:52:16,388
Think about
Dong-choon's mother.

1448
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:20,814
She got off the picinic bus
to buy his shoes.

1449
01:52:21,401 --> 01:52:23,938
By the way, I heard that
Dong-choon won a prize?.

1450
01:52:24,029 --> 01:52:25,610
What Prize?.

1451
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:29,982
He got a
'Courageous Citizen Award.'

1452
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:32,910
He saved 1 3 people under
the Gwangan Bridge.

1453
01:52:33,497 --> 01:52:35,829
- That loser?.
- Y eah.

1454
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:39,659
Seung-hyun and Man-sik's mom
were saved by Dong-choon.

1455
01:52:39,836 --> 01:52:43,579
Wow, the world really is full
of surprises.

1456
01:52:44,841 --> 01:52:46,001
Aren't you gonna work?.

1457
01:52:46,843 --> 01:52:48,583
What the...

1458
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:11,986
Mom...

1459
01:53:18,417 --> 01:53:21,124
- Eat up.
- Thank You, aunt.

1460
01:53:21,211 --> 01:53:26,001
It would be great if things always
turned out like we want them to.

1461
01:53:26,508 --> 01:53:31,593
but sometimes couples
hate each other,

1462
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:35,673
and think 'How can I be living
with this kind of a person'.

1463
01:53:35,851 --> 01:53:38,308
- Mom, we're not like that.
- Shut your mouth!

1464
01:53:39,563 --> 01:53:45,479
But remember there's no special
man or woman out there.

1465
01:53:45,569 --> 01:53:47,901
Just take good care of
each other.

1466
01:53:50,574 --> 01:53:57,571
When you get old it's only your
spouse that you can depend on.

1467
01:53:58,415 --> 01:54:00,406
You know what I mean?.

1468
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:05,703
Y es, mother.
I will do my best.

1469
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:13,758
Thanks for accepting me despite
all my flaws and troubles.

1470
01:54:15,390 --> 01:54:19,679
No, no.
Come here, Yeon-hee.

1471
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:22,932
Thank you, mother.

1472
01:54:24,316 --> 01:54:29,936
You've had some hard times.
I understand.

1473
01:54:33,325 --> 01:54:34,940
Yeah, indeed.

1474
01:54:36,203 --> 01:54:38,615
You had hardtimes, Yeon-hee.

1475
01:54:43,502 --> 01:54:45,083
It hurts.

1476
01:55:20,664 --> 01:55:21,574
What's this?.

1477
01:55:21,665 --> 01:55:23,997
What are you doing?.
Give it back!

1478
01:55:24,126 --> 01:55:25,115
What's this?.

1479
01:55:26,503 --> 01:55:30,496
- Give it back!
- What is this?.

1480
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:31,670
Give it back!

1481
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,290
Please, give it to me!

1482
01:55:33,427 --> 01:55:34,792
What is this?.

1483
01:55:37,139 --> 01:55:38,504
Run and get it!

1484
01:55:39,307 --> 01:55:42,014
- What the hell is that?.
- Hurry up!Hurry.

1485
01:55:42,144 --> 01:55:43,680
Alright!

1486
01:55:43,812 --> 01:55:45,803
- Run!
- I AM running!

1487
01:55:45,939 --> 01:55:48,601
Run, Man-sik!

1488
01:55:48,692 --> 01:55:50,182
What's wrong with you!
