11
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:50,240
<font size="36">(turned towards Shin-hyang, not Soo-wan)</font>

12
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:55,899
<font size="36">In my heart, I thought I was very direct with Tak-soo</font>

13
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:59,200
<font size="36">Because I know Tak-soo's emotional state</font>

16
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:08,725
<font size="36">I don't want to bother them.</font>

17
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:12,500
<font size="36">Since they already have feelings for each other</font>

18
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,899
<font size="36">Actually, Soo-wan and I...</font>

19
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:19,135
<font size="36">couldn't talk much because we were on different teams.</font>

20
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:22,039

21
00:01:23,273 --> 00:01:27,277
<font size="36">Don't you feel regretful that you couldn't talk more with Soo-wan?</font>

22
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:30,546
<font size="36">If today...</font>

23
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:36,320
<font size="36">If there's a chance for a date, going with Soo-wan wouldn't be bad.</font>

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,719

29
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,019
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

30
00:01:58,108 --> 00:01:59,142
<font size="36">Oppa.</font>

31
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,019
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

32
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:02,599
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

33
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:10,987
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

34
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:12,155
<font size="36">Have you been waiting long?</font>

<font size="36">Tak-soo is still waiting for the other person</font>

36
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:19,819
<font size="36">The remaining people are Shin-hyang and Soo-wan</font>

37
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:23,819
<font size="36">Whose footsteps are heading towards Tak-soo?</font>

38
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:26,269
<font size="36">Well... What is this?</font>

39
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:26,739
<font size="36">Amazing.</font>

40
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,659
<font size="36">Like a trick of fate</font>

41
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:29,773
<font size="36">Hey, how did it turn out like this?</font>

42
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:31,808
<font size="36">Wow, that's amazing.</font>

43
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,918
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

44
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,990
<font size="36">Oh!!!! It's Soo-wan~!!!</font>

45
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,020
<font size="36">Wow, what is this?</font>

46
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,740
<font size="36">Is that... not really rigged?</font>

47
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,800
<font size="36">It's not rigged. It's not rigged.</font>

48
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,400
<font size="36">It's not rigged?</font>

49
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
<font size="36">Hey, if it was rigged, would the others just stand still?</font>

50
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,500
<font size="36">Would Shin-hyang just stand still?</font>

51
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,599
<font size="36">What is this?</font>

52
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,300
<font size="36">How did it turn out like this?</font>

53
00:02:59,302 --> 00:03:00,370
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

54
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:01,800
<font size="36">How did you get here?</font>

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,300
<font size="36">Huh? How did you get here?</font>

56
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,316
<font size="36">Ah, it's beautiful.</font>

57
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:06,316
<font size="36">Ah, it's really beautiful.</font>

58
00:03:07,716 --> 00:03:09,946
<font size="36">How did you choose this? How?</font>

59
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:11,381
<font size="36">Me? I don't know either.</font>

60
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:13,916
<font size="36">We chose like this. It's random.</font>

61
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:14,716
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

62
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:17,716
<font size="36">You chose.</font>

63
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:27,898
<font size="36">Back then, we only talked while eating, so I thought it would be good to talk today...</font>

64
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:30,067
<font size="36">and then you really came.</font>

65
00:03:33,116 --> 00:03:35,516
<font size="36">I also wanted to talk a bit today.</font>

66
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:36,116
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

67
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:36,316
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

68
00:03:38,316 --> 00:03:41,344
<font size="36">(Both of them had the same thought)</font>

69
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:43,516
<font size="36">I was very nervous and happy</font>

70
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:46,516
<font size="36">From the moment I chose Sokcho Beach</font>

71
00:03:47,116 --> 00:03:49,516
<font size="36">I always hoped it would be Tak-soo Oppa</font>

72
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:52,916
<font size="36">Actually, I really wanted to talk a lot with Soo-wan</font>

73
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,516
<font size="36">Because Tak-soo Oppa was there</font>

74
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:56,716
<font size="36">When Soo-wan came</font>

75
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,716
<font size="36">Is this what you call destiny...</font>

76
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,316
<font size="36">I truly thought it was destiny.</font>

77
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:08,316
<font size="36">I find it very beautiful here.</font>

78
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:08,838
<font size="36">It's my kind of place.</font>

79
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:10,172
<font size="36">Oh, isn't it beautiful over there?</font>

80
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,716
<font size="36">The weather is really nice here.</font>

<font size="36">Ah, that's right. Destiny.</font>

83
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,316
<font size="36">Destiny's fortune cookie... Destiny. Destiny.</font>

84
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:26,116
<font size="36">Today, I hoped Soo-wan would be the goddess of luck. Because it's time for a proper conversation.</font>

85
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:28,316
<font size="36">Wow, writing a drama script is this hard.</font>

86
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,460
<font size="36">No, but this...</font>

87
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:38,168
<font size="36">Soo-wan going to that beach and meeting Tak-soo might be interesting for the viewers, but...</font>

88
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:40,503
<font size="36">As a father,</font>

89
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:42,906
<font size="36">I'm really going crazy here.</font>

90
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,716
<font size="36">Nothing can be done. It's burning, it's burning.</font>

91
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:49,916
<font size="36">How can I express my feelings directly right away? I have to beat around the bush a bit.</font>

<font size="36">I don't know why he's not looking this way.</font>

93
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:53,916
<font size="36">Because Director Jeong is right next to him.</font>

94
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:54,516
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

95
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:57,253
<font size="36">A little later</font>

100
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:17,316
<font size="36">Anyway, I</font>

101
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:20,716
<font size="36">So Shin-hyang was decided to date Sun-jun.</font>

102
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:21,116
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

103
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:22,716
<font size="36">It would be good if they got to know each other, right?</font>

104
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:24,316
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

105
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,617
<font size="36">I also like it if Shin-hyang dates Sun-jun.</font>

106
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:29,316
<font size="36">Oh, yes, that's good.</font>

107
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:30,916
<font size="36">You never know, though.</font>

108
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,316
<font size="36">Ah, that's right. You never know how it will turn out.</font>

00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:43,916
<font size="36">Me?</font>

114
00:05:44,716 --> 00:05:45,516
<font size="36">This is it, right?</font>

115
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:46,516
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

116
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:49,516

<font size="36">Yes.</font>

118
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,316
<font size="36">Ah, I like this too.</font>

119
00:05:52,116 --> 00:05:52,516
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

120
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:53,316
<font size="36">I like Sun-jun.</font>

121
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:59,316
<font size="36">I saw Shin-hyang noona approaching from afar and</font>

122
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:00,516
<font size="36">And...</font>

123
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,716
<font size="36">approached and still greeted very warmly.</font>

125
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:07,655
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

126
00:06:08,155 --> 00:06:09,155
<font size="36">You came here?</font>

127
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:10,555
<font size="36">Why wasn't I chosen?</font>

128
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:12,055
<font size="36">Why, why, why</font>

129
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:13,162
<font size="36">Why!!!</font>

130
00:06:13,555 --> 00:06:15,064
<font size="36">Why!!! What is it! Are you scared?!</font>

131
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:17,955
<font size="36">Why are you afraid of Shin-hyang?</font>

132
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:18,555
<font size="36">What is it, both of you.</font>

133
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:20,855
<font size="36">He was very surprised.</font>

134
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:21,455
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

135
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:22,855

<font size="36">It's not like that.</font>

139
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:27,655
<font size="36">Why am I the one who came?</font>

143
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:35,955
<font size="36">I think I want to date Seok-joo noona the most.</font>

144

<font size="36">Ah, you were waiting for Seok-joo.</font>

145
00:06:38,855 --> 00:06:40,055
<font size="36">That's right. Anyway, it's my true feeling.</font>

213

214
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,908
<font size="36">Ah, Sa-yoon must have never surfed before.</font>

215
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:40,308
<font size="36">It's been over 10 years since I've been in the water.</font>

<font size="36">Wow.</font>

219
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:50,008

220

00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:03,708
<font size="36">I've prepared some things, but only Jun-ho doesn't come.</font>

222
00:10:04,408 --> 00:10:04,608
<font size="36">Why?</font>

223
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,008
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

224
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:11,008
<font size="36">I don't know if it's because Jun-ho likes to work alone, likes to compose music, but only Jun-ho doesn't go there.</font>

225
00:10:11,008 --> 00:10:15,808
<font size="36">So I took this opportunity to suggest he try it, because it coincidentally is Sokcho.</font>

226
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,208
<font size="36">But is surfing okay as a date spot?</font>

227
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:20,008
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

228
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:22,308
<font size="36">No, Sa-yoon was dressed so nicely earlier.</font>

229
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:24,108
<font size="36">That's right. Makeup and hair too.</font>

230
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,008
<font size="36">As I see it, it's all or nothing now.</font>

231
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:26,408
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

232
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:29,952
<font size="36">Because it's an active activity, the two will become closer.</font>

233
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:36,308
<font size="36">Because I've never surfed, and this is my first time swimming in the sea.</font>

234
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:40,008
<font size="36">I was both nervous and felt it would be fun.</font>

238
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:54,008

301
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:08,875
<font size="36">Oh, really?</font>

302
00:13:09,975 --> 00:13:10,775
<font size="36">That girl also did very well.</font>

303
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:11,575
<font size="36">Really?</font>

304
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:13,875
<font size="36">Hey, Sa-yoon surfed really well just now.</font>

305
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:16,775
<font size="36">You have to hold on tight to the board. Big waves are coming.</font>

306
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:19,475
<font size="36">Hold both sides. Hold both sides. Hold both sides. Hold on tight.</font>

307
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:23,775
<font size="36">Good, good, good.</font>

308
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:24,975
<font size="36">Up to there, up to there is still okay.</font>

309
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:25,775
<font size="36">Oh, that's right.</font>

310
00:13:25,775 --> 00:13:26,075
<font size="36">Sa-yoon.</font>

311
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:26,575
<font size="36">Good, well done.</font>

312
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:28,575
<font size="36">Balance. Ah, that's right, that's right, that's right. That's right.</font>

313
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,275
<font size="36">Ah!</font>

314
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,375
<font size="36">You did well anyway.</font>

315
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:31,875
<font size="36">Are you okay!?!?!</font>

316
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:33,675
<font size="36">Oh dear, what should I do?</font>

317
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,475
<font size="36">Wow, you shouldn't swallow water like that.</font>

318
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,675
<font size="36">She's tired. The girl is tired.</font>

319
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:39,875
<font size="36">Ah!</font>

320
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:41,075
<font size="36">Oh dear, I'm so tired.</font>

321
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:44,175
<font size="36">(But at this moment...)</font>

322
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:47,375
<font size="36">Wow, you're doing really well.</font>

323
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:48,775
<font size="36">Wow, you're doing really well.</font>

324
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:50,875
<font size="36">Wow!</font>

325
00:13:51,975 --> 00:13:52,275
<font size="36">Splash</font>

326
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:55,658
<font size="36">(The cold waves don't give any time for 'flirting'...)</font>

327
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:56,775
<font size="36">(What should I do about my daughter?)</font>

328
00:13:56,975 --> 00:13:57,875
<font size="36">Tired. Sa-yoon is tired.</font>

329
00:13:58,275 --> 00:13:59,175
<font size="36">Tired, tired.</font>

330
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,175
<font size="36">Ah, it's supposed to be a date, what should I do?</font>

331
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:01,775
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

332
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:03,775
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

333
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:09,175
<font size="36">Oh, now she's become an athlete.</font>

334
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:11,575
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

335
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:12,775
<font size="36">Oh, so cool.</font>

336
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:13,875
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

337
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:23,775
<font size="36">Ah, I came to park the car.</font>

338
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:24,775
<font size="36">Huh.</font>

339
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,475
<font size="36">Wow!</font>

340
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:30,975
<font size="36">Thrown</font>

341
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:32,275
<font size="36">Oh dear.</font>

342
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:35,865
<font size="36">What to do...</font>

343
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,267
<font size="36">Hey, don't you have the strength to stand up~ Kkyu.</font>

344
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:42,275
<font size="36">Surfing...</font>

345
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:44,507
<font size="36">is really tiring.</font>

346
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,377
<font size="36">I thought it would be fun, but it turned out to be more tiring than I expected, so</font>

347
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:49,779
<font size="36">it's a pity.</font>

348
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:52,982
<font size="36">Wow, it's really fun.</font>

349
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:54,975
<font size="36">I'm so happy.</font>

350
00:14:55,875 --> 00:15:03,359
<font size="36">So, I think even if it's just a hobby, he definitely has his father's blood.</font>

351
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,827
<font size="36">But the date</font>

352
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,020
<font size="36">What if you go on a date and just have fun by yourself?</font>

353
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,010
<font size="36">Is Dad like that too?</font>

354
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,740
<font size="36">When Dad dates, does he just have fun by himself?</font>

355
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,740
<font size="36">Oh dear, what should I do?</font>

356
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,160
<font size="36">Sa-yoon seems to have chosen the wrong fortune cookie.</font>

357
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,900
<font size="36">She should have gone to the movie theater.</font>

358
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,700
<font size="36">That's a movie theater style.</font>

359
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,630
<font size="36">Yes. What a pity.</font>

360
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,230
<font size="36">But was the movie good?</font>

361
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:22,580
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

362
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,580
<font size="36">I like movie theaters.</font>

363
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,560
<font size="36">Don't you want to go to any of the other locations?</font>

364
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:35,040
<font size="36">Among the four locations, I thought this was the most peaceful spot,</font>

365
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,660
<font size="36">but all I did here was physical activity.</font>

366
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:40,910
<font size="36">Ah, that's right, that's right.</font>

367
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,200
<font size="36">That's why I like it.</font>

368
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:42,820
<font size="36">Ah, so.</font>

369
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:50,900
<font size="36">Of course, I also like more active activities, but it's a bit of a pity to keep doing those things here,</font>

370
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,130
<font size="36">it must be good luck.</font>

371
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:52,900
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

372
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,820
<font size="36">Ah, for Lee Jong-won, it was the movie theater and then a Western restaurant.</font>

373
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,350
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

374
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,730
<font size="36">Yes, my first date with my wife was at the movie theater.</font>

375
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,620
<font size="36">That day, I proposed to my wife and asked her to marry me.</font>

376
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,690
<font size="36">Ah, you went on a movie date and then proposed right away?</font>

377
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,430
<font size="36">Yes, just like that.</font>

378
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,050
<font size="36">Oh. Wow.</font>

379
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,190
<font size="36">As soon as we left, it was 'Marry me. Now I'll call you my darling wife.'</font>

380
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,160
<font size="36">Oh. That must be it.</font>

381
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,460
<font size="36">Huh.</font>

382
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,470
<font size="36">What movie was it?</font>

383
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,610
<font size="36">The movie title. Do you remember the movie title?</font>

384
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,968
<font size="36">Actually, I don't remember the movie title.</font>

385
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,730
<font size="36">Didn't watch the movie. Didn't watch. Didn't watch.</font>

386
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,530
<font size="36">Didn't watch the movie.</font>

387
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,520
<font size="36">Aah!</font>

388
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,720
<font size="36">What's wrong? What's wrong?</font>

389
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,200
<font size="36">Oh, what's that?</font>

390
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,340
<font size="36">Oh, what's that?</font>

391
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,523
<font size="36">What's wrong? What, what, what?</font>

392
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,270
<font size="36">Ah! Ah!</font>

393
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,350
<font size="36">Why choose a movie like that, why?</font>

394
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,980
<font size="36">You have to cover your eyes like this.</font>

395
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,000
<font size="36">Are you okay?</font>

396
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,000
<font size="36">Seong-jun.</font>

397
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,290
<font size="36">Eating popcorn.</font>

398
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,030
<font size="36">Seems totally fine?</font>

399
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,010
<font size="36">Oh, hey, Seong-jun is really strange.</font>

400
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,000
<font size="36">The popcorn is delicious.</font>

401
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,330
<font size="36">He doesn't seem scared?</font>

402
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:12,950
<font size="36">Uh</font>

403
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,840
<font size="36">Oh, I can't open it.</font>

404
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,164
<font size="36">Is it funny?</font>

405
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,550
<font size="36">I find it funny.</font>

406
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:29,171
<font size="36">(The movie is gradually reaching its climax)</font>

407
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:34,210
<font size="36">(But the seat next to her is quiet)</font>

408
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,160
<font size="36">Oh, startled.</font>

409
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,880
<font size="36">Startled. Startled.</font>

410
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,480
<font size="36">It's really interesting.</font>

411
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,310
<font size="36">(Is that a date?)</font>

412
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,454
<font size="36">This is a punishment.</font>

413
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,060
<font size="36">It's really interesting.</font>

414
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,030
<font size="36">I thought my neck was twisted back.</font>

415
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,200
<font size="36">Huh.</font>

416
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,470
<font size="36">Ah, it's scarier here.</font>

417
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,800
<font size="36">I thought Seok-joo would watch it well, but on the contrary, she couldn't watch it.</font>

418
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,000
<font size="36">So I thought, 'Oh, she has an unexpected charm.'</font>

419
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,400
<font size="36">It's really interesting.</font>

420
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:04,816
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

421
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:08,411
<font size="36">Ah, if this were Sa-yoon, would things be different?</font>

422
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:08,845
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

423
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:09,125
<font size="36">Meaningful.</font>

424
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:11,055
<font size="36">Huh.</font>

425
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:13,215
<font size="36">Now, let's hear the master's story. Yes.</font>

426
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:13,655
<font size="36">Ah, me</font>

427
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:14,025
<font size="36">Me</font>

428
00:18:14,205 --> 00:18:16,365
<font size="36">Glamorous camping wasn't available back then.</font>

429
00:18:16,615 --> 00:18:18,345
<font size="36">Since there wasn't any, let's bring a tent and go to the East Coast.</font>

430
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:20,315
<font size="36">So, yes.</font>

431
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:23,155
<font size="36">Peel Dokdo shrimp or rock shrimp and feed them,</font>

<font size="36">and</font>

433
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:25,385
<font size="36">And nothing happened.</font>

434
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:27,763
<font size="36">(I thought something big happened haha)</font>

435
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:29,398
<font size="36">No, I thought something happened?</font>

436
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:33,736
<font size="36">Yes, yes. Nothing happened, and we folded the tent and went home again.</font>

437
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:34,145
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

438
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:35,675
<font size="36">Shin-hyang would love it. She likes glamping.</font>

439

<font size="36">Ah, she likes it.</font>

440
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:37,440
<font size="36">Yes, she likes it.</font>

441
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,508
<font size="36">(Will this date spot be effective...?)</font>

442
00:18:38,555 --> 00:18:39,815
<font size="36">Glamping site</font>

443
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,475
<font size="36">Let's see what's here.</font>

444
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,195
<font size="36">Didn't you prepare something?</font>

445
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:44,285
<font size="36">Oh, let's check.</font>

446
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:47,105
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

447
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:47,695
<font size="36">Shrimp.</font>

448
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:47,985
<font size="36">Amazing.</font>

449
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:50,425
<font size="36">And sausages, pork belly.</font>

450
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:52,145
<font size="36">Oh, you bought a lot of stuff.</font>

451
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:54,225

00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,619
<font size="36">Let me speak.</font>

757
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:18,573
<font size="36">Why are you talking in such a confrontational tone?</font>

758
00:30:18,673 --> 00:30:19,407
<font size="36">Ah, does it sound confrontational?</font>

759
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:20,442
<font size="36">Ah, that's scary.</font>

760
00:30:20,475 --> 00:30:22,277
<font size="36">Because I usually talk like this.</font>

761
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,319
<font size="36">Ah, really, really.</font>

762
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,346
<font size="36">No, no, really.</font>

763
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:26,381
<font size="36">You had a lot of fun, didn't you?</font>

764
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:29,584
<font size="36">(Someone please switch places with me)</font>

765
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:36,424
<font size="36">I'll eat well.</font>

766
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:40,929
<font size="36">How is it? Is it good?</font>

767
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:43,033
<font size="36">Oh</font>

768
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:50,333
<font size="36">Ah, Lee Jung-hyuk's first date spot with his wife, shown on screen, is an eel restaurant.</font>

769
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:50,833
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

770
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,333
<font size="36">Was there any intention behind the eel restaurant?</font>

771
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:55,633
<font size="36">A little bit of affection</font>

772
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:58,833
<font size="36">At that time, I was unknown, how could I have money when acting in plays?</font>

773
00:30:58,833 --> 00:30:59,333
<font size="36">Huh.</font>

774
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:03,633
<font size="36">I saved every penny to buy eel for you, don't you see.</font>

775
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:04,033
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

776
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,033
<font size="36">If I bought eel, I would have to starve for several days.</font>

777
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:06,633
<font size="36">Huh.</font>

778
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,633
<font size="36">What is that?</font>

779
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:12,333
<font size="36">You're still a bit disrespectful.</font>

780
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:15,196
<font size="36">Why eat eel? What's the point of eating eel?</font>

781
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:18,066
<font size="36">Ah, is eel like that again?</font>

782
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:20,869
<font size="36">The important thing is that I ate eel but did nothing.</font>

783
00:31:20,969 --> 00:31:22,170
<font size="36">Is that something to be proud of?</font>

784
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,272
<font size="36">Did nothing happen afterwards?</font>

785
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:24,833
<font size="36">Ah, of course not.</font>

786
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:25,974
<font size="36">Did you really just eat eel?</font>

787
00:31:26,074 --> 00:31:27,008
<font size="36">I truly restrained myself.</font>

788
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:30,512
<font size="36">Will this part be broadcast?</font>

789
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:31,947
<font size="36">Let's meet next time.</font>

790
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:34,033
<font size="36">I'm a person who can restrain myself even after eating eel.</font>

791
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:34,833
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

792
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,333
<font size="36">I'm cherishing you.</font>

793
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:37,833
<font size="36">Of course, of course.</font>

794
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,033
<font size="36">Ah, something like that. Yes.</font>

795
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:41,633
<font size="36">Is it good?</font>

796
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:48,833
<font size="36">It seems like we eat meat, and eel, all delicious food, every day.</font>

797
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:49,633
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

798
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:51,033
<font size="36">And this is the second time with you.</font>

799
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:53,833
<font size="36">We ate meat that day.</font>

800
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:03,633
<font size="36">Whose tape do you think this is?</font>

801
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,833
<font size="36">I think it's Soo-wan's.</font>

802
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:10,833
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

803
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:18,833
<font size="36">But I think it's good to have an opportunity to talk like this.</font>

804
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:29,033
<font size="36">The thing is, yesterday I sent the tape to oppa and oppa sent it to unnie (Shin-hyang).</font>

805
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:35,833
<font size="36">So I thought unnie (Shin-hyang) and oppa had already decided their feelings,</font>

806
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:46,833
<font size="36">I thought I shouldn't do this, and because of that, should I start a relationship with someone else? I've been thinking about that since yesterday.</font>

807
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:52,333
<font size="36">So I think that was also part of why my mind was complicated.</font>

808
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:54,333
<font size="36">It must have been very complicated.</font>

809
00:33:08,158 --> 00:33:10,028
<font size="36">When talking during dinner,</font>

810
00:33:11,438 --> 00:33:14,058
<font size="36">I didn't know how to say this,</font>

811
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,838
<font size="36">and I wondered if I should say it,</font>

812
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:19,978
<font size="36">so I hesitated a bit.</font>

813
00:33:20,857 --> 00:33:25,727
<font size="36">(Soo-wan is considering whether to express her feelings)</font>

814
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:30,732
<font size="36">- That's right. For Soo-wan, it could be like that.
- Now is the chance.</font>

815
00:33:30,738 --> 00:33:31,038
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

816
00:33:31,258 --> 00:33:31,498
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

817
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:37,515
<font size="36">Earlier...</font>

818
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:41,855
<font size="36">I talked to Shin-hyang noona.</font>

819
00:33:42,655 --> 00:33:43,055
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

820
00:33:44,335 --> 00:33:44,735
<font size="36">In the morning?</font>

821
00:33:45,005 --> 00:33:45,335
<font size="36">Oh, ah, oh.</font>

822
00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:48,116
<font size="36">Oh! I went up to the second-floor living room and talked</font>

823
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:49,935
<font size="36">With Shin-hyang noona, now...</font>

824
00:33:51,955 --> 00:33:52,365
<font size="36">Yesterday,</font>

825
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:52,645
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

826
00:33:53,035 --> 00:33:53,655
<font size="36">Well,</font>

827
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:58,293
<font size="36">Well, today will be the decision. I said something like that.</font>

828
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:03,035
<font size="36">Talking again today</font>

829
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:08,970
<font size="36">Still</font>

830
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:10,405
<font size="36">Well,</font>

831
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:14,335
<font size="36">The reason I chose yesterday was because noona occupies the most in my heart.</font>

832
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:14,605
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

833
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,955
<font size="36">I chose the tape...</font>

834
00:34:22,115 --> 00:34:22,735
<font size="36">Even so,</font>

835
00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:26,955
<font size="36">But...</font>

836
00:34:27,795 --> 00:34:32,835
<font size="36">I said I wanted to talk to Soo-wan a bit. I said something like that.</font>

837
00:34:33,735 --> 00:34:34,335
<font size="36">Ah, with unnie?</font>

838
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:34,845
<font size="36">Huh.</font>

839
00:34:35,045 --> 00:34:35,335
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

840
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:39,815
<font size="36">Because knowing this and then dating is different.</font>

841
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:41,515
<font size="36">I told unnie this.</font>

842
00:34:41,865 --> 00:34:42,437
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

843
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,240
<font size="36">Soo-wan still has a chance.</font>

844
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:45,905
<font size="36">Thank goodness.</font>

845
00:34:45,905 --> 00:34:47,245
<font size="36">Yes, both like it.</font>

846
00:34:47,345 --> 00:34:48,205
<font size="36">Thank goodness.</font>

847
00:34:49,335 --> 00:34:50,979
<font size="36">So now...</font>

848
00:34:54,185 --> 00:34:56,651
<font size="36">It will probably gradually sort itself out... because it's the final stage.</font>

849
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:58,620
<font size="36">Tomorrow, it has to be decided...</font>

850
00:35:03,615 --> 00:35:06,595
<font size="36">My situation is still complicated.</font>

851
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:11,185
<font size="36">My inability to clearly convey my unorganized thoughts.</font>

852
00:35:11,285 --> 00:35:15,837
<font size="36">I feel a little bad for not being able to make a clear decision yet.</font>

853
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:21,542
<font size="36">(Tak-soo is still unsure in his heart)</font>

854
00:35:22,515 --> 00:35:27,015
<font size="36">(Can Soo-wan win his heart?)</font>

855
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,450
<font size="36">Shall we go out?</font>

856
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:30,165
<font size="36">Yeah, let's go.</font>

857
00:35:31,815 --> 00:35:32,255
<font size="36">Oh, leaving already?</font>

858
00:35:32,515 --> 00:35:33,455
<font size="36">Hey, what's that?</font>

859
00:35:33,515 --> 00:35:35,215
<font size="36">Hey, you have to finish the story.</font>

860
00:35:36,015 --> 00:35:37,992
<font size="36">Hey, you have to fry the rice, kid.</font>

861
00:35:38,615 --> 00:35:41,215
<font size="36">You have to fry the rice and make time.</font>

862
00:35:41,615 --> 00:35:42,015
<font size="36">Huh.</font>

863
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,515
<font size="36">You have to fry the rice, what are you doing.</font>

864
00:35:43,815 --> 00:35:45,015
<font size="36">Ah... Did Dad fry rice?</font>

865
00:35:45,015 --> 00:35:45,515
<font size="36">Ah,</font>

866
00:35:45,815 --> 00:35:46,815
<font size="36">For me, it's freshwater eel, so...</font>

867
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:48,115
<font size="36">Ah, is it freshwater? It's freshwater eel.</font>

868
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:52,915
<font size="36">In today's random date,</font>

869
00:35:52,915 --> 00:35:53,115
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

870
00:35:53,115 --> 00:35:55,315
<font size="36">Will anyone change?</font>

871
00:35:56,515 --> 00:35:59,414
<font size="36">For us, on the contrary, we had a good time together but</font>

872
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,384
<font size="36">On the contrary, my mind became even more confused.</font>

873
00:36:02,484 --> 00:36:07,122
<font size="36">I think there might be people who change.</font>

874
00:36:09,448 --> 00:36:11,793
<font size="36">I didn't change at all.</font>

875
00:36:12,808 --> 00:36:15,128
<font size="36">I had nothing to worry about from the beginning.</font>

876
00:36:16,748 --> 00:36:20,448
<font size="36">I thought it would be good to date Tak-soo,</font>

877
00:36:21,218 --> 00:36:25,368
<font size="36">but I was sure that Tak-soo's feelings wouldn't change anymore</font>

878
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,978
<font size="36">because I felt it clearly,</font>

879
00:36:29,758 --> 00:36:31,768
<font size="36">so I'm not complicated anymore.</font>

880
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:35,983
<font size="36">Ah, Shin-hyang is very confident.</font>

881
00:36:36,518 --> 00:36:38,118
<font size="36">Ah, Shin-hyang has nothing to worry about.</font>

882
00:36:38,478 --> 00:36:40,418
<font size="36">That's right. I feel more at ease.</font>

883
00:36:41,508 --> 00:36:44,508
<font size="36">Meanwhile, Tak-soo X Soo-wan are strolling on the beach.</font>

884
00:36:45,058 --> 00:36:45,618
<font size="36">Wow, it's beautiful.</font>

885
00:36:47,798 --> 00:36:49,018
<font size="36">We have to eat dessert, don't we?</font>

886
00:36:49,118 --> 00:36:49,428
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

887
00:36:49,938 --> 00:36:51,348
<font size="36">Let's go eat dessert and talk.</font>

888
00:36:51,928 --> 00:36:52,668
<font size="36">It's not over yet!</font>

889
00:36:53,008 --> 00:36:53,698
<font size="36">Ice cream cone or popsicle.</font>

890
00:36:54,188 --> 00:36:54,508
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

891
00:36:55,608 --> 00:36:56,288
<font size="36">I'll have a popsicle.</font>

892
00:36:57,108 --> 00:36:59,108
<font size="36">Alright. Wait a moment.</font>

893
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,388
<font size="36">Wait for me here. I'll be right back.</font>

894
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:04,012
<font size="36">Ah, go...</font>

895
00:37:04,048 --> 00:37:05,458
<font size="36">Oh, let me go. You stay there.</font>

896
00:37:05,798 --> 00:37:08,038
<font size="36">Ah, why! We have to prolong our time together. That's right.</font>

897
00:37:08,898 --> 00:37:12,908
<font size="36">But when I'm alone here, I have to think and organize so I can talk a lot.</font>

898
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:13,268
<font size="36">Uh</font>

899
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:17,291
<font size="36">(The misunderstanding has been resolved, but he still can't express his feelings)</font>

900
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:24,065
<font size="36">He has to choose the right moment...</font>

901
00:37:29,148 --> 00:37:29,498
<font size="36">Come on.</font>

902
00:37:31,028 --> 00:37:32,318
<font size="36">Nothing fits better than this.</font>

903
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,328
<font size="36">It must be delicious.</font>

904
00:37:34,738 --> 00:37:39,648
<font size="36">I thought if I expressed myself first, oppa might feel more comfortable.</font>

905
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:42,798
<font size="36">I thought a lot about that while we were walking.</font>

906
00:37:43,768 --> 00:37:45,448
<font size="36">Normally, I finish this in just three bites.</font>

907
00:37:45,788 --> 00:37:46,308
<font size="36">Oh, really?</font>

908
00:37:46,868 --> 00:37:48,068
<font size="36">Am I eating slower now?</font>

909
00:37:48,408 --> 00:37:48,668
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

910
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:56,508
<font size="36">(Just kept walking)</font>

911
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:00,769
<font size="36">(The two just kept walking and then suddenly stopped)</font>

912
00:38:07,738 --> 00:38:13,668
<font size="36">I thought if I didn't say it this time, I would regret it forever.</font>

913
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:17,118
<font size="36">(When she first moved in)</font>

914
00:38:17,118 --> 00:38:18,418
<font size="36">Oh, it can't be cut short, right?</font>

915
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:24,692
<font size="36">(Soo-wan always lacked courage)</font>

916
00:38:25,908 --> 00:38:26,908
<font size="36">I really like it.</font>

917
00:38:27,768 --> 00:38:31,966
<font size="36">With someone I have feelings for, I always end up doing nothing.</font>

918
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,035
<font size="36">At least I tried</font>

919
00:38:34,135 --> 00:38:38,773
<font size="36">To hover around that person a little</font>

920
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:48,978
<font size="36">So this time, I thought I wanted to express my feelings to the person I like or have feelings for.</font>

921
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:52,453
<font size="36">(During the alternating conversation)</font>

922
00:38:52,738 --> 00:38:55,723
<font size="36">I'll probably decide while we're talking.</font>

923
00:38:57,218 --> 00:38:58,192
<font size="36">What about you?</font>

924
00:38:58,508 --> 00:38:59,508
<font size="36">(...)</font>

925
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:02,458
<font size="36">Ah, it's too difficult, somehow...</font>

926
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:06,401
<font size="36">(An opportunity arose, but he still hesitated)</font>

927
00:39:06,593 --> 00:39:08,503
<font size="36">Say it, Soo-wan!</font>

928
00:39:09,023 --> 00:39:10,605
<font size="36">Ugh... I'm so annoyed!!!</font>

929
00:39:10,643 --> 00:39:11,163
<font size="36">Soo-wan</font>

930
00:39:12,023 --> 00:39:13,023
<font size="36">Hey, you have to express your feelings.</font>

931
00:39:18,988 --> 00:39:19,888
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

932
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:23,188
<font size="36">For me, somehow...</font>

933
00:39:23,588 --> 00:39:23,888
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

934
00:39:25,388 --> 00:39:27,255
<font size="36">Anyway, from the very beginning, I already</font>

935
00:39:28,056 --> 00:39:31,593
<font size="36">From the start until now, it's always been oppa.</font>

936
00:39:31,626 --> 00:39:32,660
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

937
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:41,988
<font size="36">Ah!</font>

938
00:39:42,288 --> 00:39:43,188
<font size="36">Ah!</font>

939
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:43,588
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

940
00:39:43,788 --> 00:39:44,488
<font size="36">Ah, she did it, she did it.</font>

941
00:39:44,488 --> 00:39:45,339
<font size="36">Yeah, she did it.</font>

942
00:39:45,388 --> 00:39:46,188
<font size="36">She gathered all her courage.</font>

943
00:39:46,488 --> 00:39:48,109
<font size="36">Ah, she really gathered all her courage.</font>

944
00:39:53,388 --> 00:39:56,188
<font size="36">From the beginning until now, that's been the state of my heart.</font>

945
00:39:57,588 --> 00:39:58,588
<font size="36">Just say it.</font>

946
00:39:59,088 --> 00:40:00,388
<font size="36">Because oppa, anyway,</font>

947
00:40:00,788 --> 00:40:01,188
<font size="36">Uh-huh.</font>

00:40:01,788 --> 00:40:04,088
<font size="36">He's worried.</font>

949
00:40:04,588 --> 00:40:06,888
<font size="36">Just think carefully and decide.</font>

950
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,888
<font size="36">Anyway, it has to be done tomorrow.</font>

951
00:40:09,388 --> 00:40:10,588
<font size="36">That's how I feel.</font>

952
00:40:14,688 --> 00:40:15,188
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

953
00:40:19,288 --> 00:40:19,888
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

954
00:40:20,088 --> 00:40:21,309
<font size="36">Well done, well done.</font>

955
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:21,888
<font size="36">No regrets.</font>

956
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:22,188
<font size="36">Huh.</font>

957
00:40:22,188 --> 00:40:23,744
<font size="36">It's better to do it without regrets.</font>

958
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,546
<font size="36">Oh, I feel so relieved.</font>

959
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:31,288
<font size="36">Hmm, I also feel a bit shy</font>

960
00:40:32,788 --> 00:40:35,288
<font size="36">Oh, but those feelings were just worry and frustration,</font>

961
00:40:35,788 --> 00:40:37,488
<font size="36">but because I spoke my heart,</font>

962
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:43,688
<font size="36">I think I've done my part, so I feel very relieved.</font>

963
00:40:44,888 --> 00:40:48,688

964
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,965
<font size="36">And because she expressed her true feelings,</font>

965
00:40:53,048 --> 00:40:58,488
<font size="36">conversely, I had the opportunity to reorganize my feelings and find a direction.</font>

968
00:41:11,788 --> 00:41:12,860
<font size="36">Oh, the sun has set.</font>

969

1031
00:43:23,186 --> 00:43:23,766
<font size="36">That's right, you already mentioned that.</font>

1038
00:43:38,384 --> 00:43:40,074
<font size="36">By the way, did you talk a lot today?</font>

1039
00:43:40,094 --> 00:43:41,876
<font size="36">Wasn't this your first proper date?</font>

1040
00:43:42,404 --> 00:43:45,980
<font size="36">I said everything today.</font>

00:44:22,514 --> 00:44:23,194
<font size="36">That's right. I'm so jealous.</font>

1058
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:25,052
<font size="36">But who was it? I'm so curious.</font>

1059
00:44:25,152 --> 00:44:26,053
<font size="36">Sun-jun.</font>

1060
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:28,422
<font size="36">We really relaxed.</font>

1061
00:44:28,474 --> 00:44:29,423
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

1062
00:44:29,694 --> 00:44:30,994
<font size="36">Sun-jun and I really</font>

1063
00:44:31,864 --> 00:44:33,294
<font size="36">Became good friends.</font>

1064
00:44:33,774 --> 00:44:35,394
<font size="36">Oh, me too! I also became good friends today.</font>

1065
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:37,294
<font size="36">Oh, who is Soo-wan?</font>

1066
00:44:37,994 --> 00:44:39,300
<font size="36">I'm Tak-soo Oppa.</font>

1067
00:44:39,994 --> 00:44:42,536
<font size="36">Ah... that's good, really...</font>

1068
00:44:42,894 --> 00:44:43,194
<font size="36">Huh.</font>

1069
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:49,494
<font size="36">Even though he said it's good... he must be very worried...</font>

1070
00:44:50,294 --> 00:44:52,947
<font size="36">Ah... that's good, really...</font>

1071
00:44:53,394 --> 00:44:54,915
<font size="36">Where did you go? What did you do?</font>

1072
00:44:55,194 --> 00:44:58,577
<font size="36">I went to the beach, and what was it?</font>

1073
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:03,824
<font size="36">Walked a bit on the beach and then made phone cases like this with seashells.</font>

1074
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,270
<font size="36">Uh</font>

1075
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,728
<font size="36">Made this using seashells.</font>

1076
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:08,490
<font size="36">Ah, it must have been fun.</font>

1077
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,798
<font size="36">Made them and then gave them. We exchanged them.</font>

1078
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,410
<font size="36">Awesome.</font>

1079
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,010
<font size="36">It was so fun. Just placing things like this and making them.</font>

1080
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:15,350
<font size="36">Huh.</font>

1081
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,130
<font size="36">She really put all the seashells in without holding back.</font>

1082
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,530
<font size="36">I was a little regretful too. Like, that kind of thing.</font>

1083
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,310
<font size="36">When I heard about that date itinerary, it was very</font>

1084
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:31,550
<font size="36">Because it was a date I wanted to do.</font>

1085
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,740
<font size="36">Going to the beach and making things like that</font>

1086
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,570
<font size="36">Going to a decorative shop, looking around, and making things for each other</font>

1087
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,200
<font size="36">It must have been fun. I thought so.</font>

1088
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:47,168
<font size="36">A father caught between sadness and joy</font>

1089
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,200
<font size="36">Shin-hyang went to the common area.</font>

1090
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,260
<font size="36">Sun-jun went camping.</font>

1091
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,370
<font size="36">Ah, camping.</font>

1092
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:55,240
<font size="36">Hehe</font>

1093
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,080
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1094
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,310
<font size="36">I really love surfing. Ocean surfing.</font>

1095
00:45:59,680 --> 00:45:59,920
<font size="36">Surfing?</font>

1096
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:01,250
<font size="36">I went ocean surfing.</font>

1097
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,000
<font size="36">Oppa is really with the Sol-sol couple.</font>

1098
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,540
<font size="36">Oh. Surfing.</font>

1099
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,490
<font size="36">We practiced a bit on land and the instructor guided us through everything.</font>

1100
00:46:12,259 --> 00:46:14,461
<font size="36">(...)</font>

1101
00:46:18,366 --> 00:46:19,767
<font size="36">Lee Tak-soo.</font>

1102
00:46:21,669 --> 00:46:22,530
<font size="36">Look at the phone case.</font>

1103
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,239
<font size="36">Look at the phone case.</font>

1104
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,341
<font size="36">I don't have my phone case here. It's in the room.</font>

1105
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:27,810
<font size="36">Wow!</font>

1106
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,980
<font size="36">Look at Lee Tak-soo's case. What is this.</font>

1107
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,310
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

1108
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:31,800
<font size="36">Look at the phone case.</font>

1109
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,680
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1110
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:35,490
<font size="36">Ah, truly very proactive.</font>

1111
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,240
<font size="36">Show me the phone case!</font>

1112
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,150
<font size="36">Let me see it for a bit.</font>

1113
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:41,322
<font size="36">You dated Sun-jun, right?</font>

1114
00:46:41,422 --> 00:46:41,956
<font size="36">Uh</font>

1115
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:43,757
<font size="36">Is it hot?</font>

1116
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:44,230
<font size="36">Huh.</font>

1117
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,427
<font size="36">We were really under the scorching sun.</font>

1118
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,096
<font size="36">Did he really go just to show the phone case?!</font>

1119
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,330
<font size="36">I just kept spraying this on here.</font>

1120
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:52,540
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1121
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:53,400
<font size="36">What to do, what to do.</font>

1122
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:54,710
<font size="36">No way, no way.</font>

1123
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:55,160
<font size="36">That's terrible.</font>

1124
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,710
<font size="36">What is it, what is it.</font>

1125
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:56,430
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1126
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,710
<font size="36">As soon as we got back, we showered.</font>

1127
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:59,400
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1128
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,000
<font size="36">Oh, oh.</font>

1129
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:01,840
<font size="36">What to do.</font>

1130
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:02,790
<font size="36">I'm going crazy.</font>

1131
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:03,450
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1132
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:06,947
<font size="36">(...)</font>

1133
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,900
<font size="36">My heart would be complicated if it were like that.</font>

1134
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,010
<font size="36">I regret sleeping like this today.</font>

1135
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,520
<font size="36">Because it's the last day.</font>

1136
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:21,530
<font size="36">Go find the phone case.</font>

1137
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,931
<font size="36">(Meanwhile, the two have arrived at Tak-soo's room)</font>

1138
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,690
<font size="36">Hey, she even came to check this.</font>

1139
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,610
<font size="36">Hey, Shin-hyang. This Shin-hyang.</font>

1140
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,490
<font size="36">She came to check and then showed it.</font>

1141
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,400
<font size="36">This... Soo-wan made it for me.</font>

1142
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:36,470
<font size="36">I made Soo-wan's.</font>

1143
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,370
<font size="36">It must have been fun.</font>

1144
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:40,830
<font size="36">It was fun.</font>

1145
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:42,990
<font size="36">It must have been fun.</font>

1146
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,818
<font size="36">Just talking... talked a lot.</font>

1147
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,480
<font size="36">What to do.</font>

1148
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,490
<font size="36">Hey, looking at these pictures, it's going to be a commotion.</font>

1149
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:47,870
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1150
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,600
<font size="36">Oh, he already reported it.</font>

1151
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,500
<font size="36">Look at the pictures once.</font>

1152
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:51,490
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1153
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:52,660
<font size="36">That's scary.</font>

1154
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:53,710
<font size="36">Oh, look at this too.</font>

1155
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,370
<font size="36">He said it's scary. He said it's scary.</font>

1156
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,850
<font size="36">It's a bit scary, isn't it? Yes.</font>

1157
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,840
<font size="36">He didn't ask her to bring it, but followed her all the way to her room.</font>

1158
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,260
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1159
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,035
<font size="36">This is a bit uncomfortable even after getting married.</font>

1160
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:02,410
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1161
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:02,710
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1162
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:04,420
<font size="36">He has to confirm the clear evidence.</font>

1163
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,516
<font size="36">That's an action that would really make someone angry.</font>

1164
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:10,286
<font size="36">Matching items like this.</font>

1165
00:48:11,126 --> 00:48:11,736
<font size="36">Ah, hey.</font>

1166
00:48:11,736 --> 00:48:14,526
<font size="36">But now, he still hasn't released the photos, has he?</font>

1167
00:48:14,526 --> 00:48:14,826
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1168
00:48:14,826 --> 00:48:17,136
<font size="36">But if phone cases are mentioned,</font>

1169
00:48:17,576 --> 00:48:18,536
<font size="36">Tak-soo also took pictures.</font>

1170
00:48:18,536 --> 00:48:21,216
<font size="36">Shouldn't Tak-soo be the one to speak up first?</font>

1171
00:48:21,546 --> 00:48:22,926
<font size="36">Ah, if there's no awkwardness at all.</font>

1172
00:48:22,926 --> 00:48:23,226
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1173
00:48:23,226 --> 00:48:26,166
<font size="36">Honestly, Tak-soo doesn't have an obligation to show those pictures.</font>

1174
00:48:26,806 --> 00:48:28,406
<font size="36">They're not dating or anything, not yet.</font>

1175
00:48:28,866 --> 00:48:31,916
<font size="36">But why report? Nothing has been decided yet.</font>

1176
00:48:32,516 --> 00:48:36,216
<font size="36">No, Professor, anyway, Seong-jun is successful now, that's why he's saying that.</font>

1177
00:48:36,216 --> 00:48:38,846
<font size="36">If you look at it from Seong-jun's third-party perspective.</font>

1178
00:48:38,846 --> 00:48:39,356
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1179
00:48:39,526 --> 00:48:41,316
<font size="36">Ah, this love story is getting hot.</font>

1180
00:48:41,316 --> 00:48:42,926
<font size="36">The atmosphere is getting too hot.</font>

1181
00:48:42,926 --> 00:48:44,226
<font size="36">What am I doing sitting in the middle here?</font>

1182
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:46,106
<font size="36">Session adjourned for 5 minutes.</font>

1183
00:48:46,106 --> 00:48:46,406
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1184
00:48:46,406 --> 00:48:49,216
<font size="36">No, then how can we make the final choice?</font>

1185
00:48:49,216 --> 00:48:49,826
<font size="36">Ah, that's right.</font>

1186
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,446
<font size="36">If we make the final choice now, there'll probably be a fight.</font>

1187
00:48:52,446 --> 00:48:54,126
<font size="36">We have to make the final choice without meeting.</font>

1188
00:48:54,126 --> 00:48:56,016
<font size="36">Ah, this is complicated now.</font>

1189
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:14,620
<font size="36">When I dated Soo-wan and looked at the phone case, Shin-hyang must have also worried if my feelings would change.</font>

1190
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,910
<font size="36">So I was worried about Shin-hyang.</font>

1191
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,080
<font size="36">Oh, Tak-soo must be so tired.</font>

1192
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:24,510
<font size="36">Will it return to the original state?</font>

1193
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:25,740
<font size="36">What to do?</font>

1194
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:32,460
<font size="36">One day before the final selection
Everyone's anxiety heightens</font>

1195
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,050
<font size="36">Or maybe everyone just sits comfortably?</font>

1196
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,380
<font size="36">Wow, but it was so fun.</font>

1197
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:40,990
<font size="36">Yeah, thankfully.</font>

1198
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,210
<font size="36">I didn't expect noona to be able to let out such a high-pitched scream.</font>

1199
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,140
<font size="36">Don't say it anymore, don't say it anymore.</font>

1200
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,660
<font size="36">That person is telling me this for the fourth time.</font>

1201
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,010
<font size="36">It must be impressive.</font>

1202
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:56,016
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1203
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:56,920
<font size="36">Anything else?</font>

1204
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,560

<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1359
00:56:10,107 --> 00:56:10,647
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1360
00:56:11,507 --> 00:56:12,107
<font size="36">Indeed.</font>

1361

<font size="36">Ah, this one</font>

1362
00:56:14,527 --> 00:56:16,367
<font size="36">Yes, Seok-joo is curious.</font>

1363

<font size="36">Hey, this</font>

1364
00:56:21,537 --> 00:56:23,470
<font size="36">It's Sa-yoon and you.</font>

1365

1368
00:56:29,037 --> 00:56:30,437
<font size="36">Sa-yoon was mentioned first.</font>

1369
00:56:30,827 --> 00:56:32,367

1370

1377
00:56:52,527 --> 00:56:55,727
<font size="36">So, you just mentioned two people,</font>

00:56:57,397 --> 00:56:58,797
<font size="36">If we talk percentages</font>

1379

1385
00:57:19,725 --> 00:57:19,985
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1386
00:57:20,095 --> 00:57:20,395
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1387
00:57:20,545 --> 00:57:21,155
<font size="36">60, 40.</font>

1388
00:57:21,155 --> 00:57:21,795
<font size="36">Ah, 60, 40.</font>

1389
00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:22,305
<font size="36">It's been designated.</font>

<font size="36">60%.</font>

1394
00:57:28,455 --> 00:57:28,965
<font size="36">Ah...</font>

1395
00:57:30,095 --> 00:57:34,825
<font size="36">I wanted to get a slightly higher percentage.</font>

1396
00:57:35,835 --> 00:57:39,005
<font size="36">6 to 4 is almost... fifty-fifty, isn't it?</font>

1397
00:57:39,765 --> 00:57:44,551
<font size="36">Ah, I thought 'this might be a bit dangerous'.</font>

1398
00:57:44,865 --> 00:57:45,865
<font size="36">You can think that way.</font>

1399
00:57:46,355 --> 00:57:49,155
<font size="36">It's not dangerous. Just trust and move forward...</font>

1400

<font size="36">Ah, that's right.</font>

1401
00:57:50,505 --> 00:57:51,665

1474
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:27,030
<font size="36">It's about speaking cautiously, cautiously.</font>

1475
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:27,830
<font size="36">It's answering.</font>

1476
