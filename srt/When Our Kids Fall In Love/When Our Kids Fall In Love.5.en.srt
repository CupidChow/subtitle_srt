<font size="36">This program contains content [themes, language, imitation risk] unsuitable for teenagers under 15,</font>

2
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:05,019
<font size="36">so guardian guidance is required when watching.</font>

3
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:17,056
<font size="36">DAY 2 Night</font>

4
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:21,056
<font size="36">Tape sent to Sa-yoon</font>

5
00:00:22,498 --> 00:00:22,899
<font size="36">Uh...</font>

6
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:25,498
<font size="36">Uh... I thought about it a lot, but</font>

7
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,199
<font size="36">I could only think of one person...</font>

8
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,598
<font size="36">I packed the Basque cheesecake and salted sesame bread that you didn't eat earlier.</font>

9
00:00:40,198 --> 00:00:43,290
<font size="36">(Sun-jun secretly packed dessert for Sa-yoon)</font>

10
00:00:43,598 --> 00:00:44,899
<font size="36">If you want to eat it,</font>

11
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:48,499
<font size="36">please let me know.</font>

12
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:52,899
<font size="36">During our date, (Sa-yoon) said she liked tulips, so</font>

13
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:57,999
<font size="36">I tried to recall... and drew tulips that looked similar.</font>

14
00:00:58,098 --> 00:01:02,923
<font size="36">(Sun-jun remembered Sa-yoon's words and drew tulips on the tape)</font>

15
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,723
<font size="36">(Sun-jun's sincerity brought tears to everyone's eyes)</font>

16
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,198
<font size="36">No, I wasn't going to cry at all.</font>

17
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:10,099
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

18
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:11,899
<font size="36">Sun-jun.</font>

19
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,656
<font size="36">(The emotion spread to the watching father)</font>

20
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:20,998
<font size="36">No, I'm just watching as a father.</font>

21
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,899
<font size="36">I see my child's expressions that only a father and mother can understand.</font>

22
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,099
<font size="36">Ah, that's right.</font>

23
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:29,899
<font size="36">But when I opened it, um, when I wasn't chosen,</font>

24
00:01:31,498 --> 00:01:33,690
<font size="36">I saw my child wavering gently like that.</font>

25
00:01:33,698 --> 00:01:35,099
<font size="36">That confused look.</font>

26
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,899
<font size="36">Hey, Sun-jun there, um, trying to endure,</font>

27
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,899
<font size="36">I'm very grateful.</font>

28
00:01:44,923 --> 00:01:47,956
<font size="36">(Sa-yoon returned after listening to the tape)</font>

29
00:01:56,498 --> 00:02:00,799
<font size="36">Listening to both (tapes), I felt very uneasy.</font>

30
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:06,023
<font size="36">(2 tapes sent to Sa-yoon)</font>

31
00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:09,556
<font size="36">(The voice she wanted to hear)
Let's definitely do it together next time.</font>

32
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:12,323
<font size="36">(And the voice containing sincerity)
I support you.</font>

33
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:20,223
<font size="36">However, Sa-yoon, who harbored misunderstandings, sent the tape to Jun-ho</font>

34
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:26,756
<font size="36">(Sa-yoon's complicated expression)</font>

35
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:35,923
<font size="36">(Sa-yoon left immediately)</font>

36
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:42,423
<font size="36">(Sun-jun watched Sa-yoon's retreating back)</font>

37
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,299
<font size="36">After choosing the level of affection,</font>

38
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:52,490
<font size="36">Sa-yoon, after listening to the recording, her expression seemed a bit...</font>

39
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:57,799
<font size="36">she seemed to be having many complex thoughts</font>

40
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:01,799
<font size="36">and didn't seem to have a cheerful expression.</font>

41
00:03:05,756 --> 00:03:11,123
<font size="36">(Sun-jun also thought a lot while looking at Sa-yoon's expression)</font>

42
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:20,156
<font size="36">- Track 5 -
I Tried</font>

43
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:21,261
<font size="36">Good night.</font>

44
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:21,981
<font size="36">Good night.</font>

45
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:23,990
<font size="36">(And then everyone went to sleep)</font>

46
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:28,556
<font size="36">(The three remaining people stayed in the same spot)</font>

47
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:31,351
<font size="36">Now, Seok-joo, Seong-jun, and Sun-jun.</font>

48
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,156
<font size="36">(...?)</font>

49
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:36,556
<font size="36">Zero-vote club?</font>

50
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:38,589
<font size="36">It is indeed the zero-vote club.</font>

51
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,823
<font size="36">Ah, we're still the zero-vote club.</font>

52
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,981
<font size="36">I can't sleep~ How can I sleep~</font>

53
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:44,751
<font size="36">Can't sleep. Ah.</font>

54
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:48,890
<font size="36">The zero-vote club trio can't sleep (?)</font>

55
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:56,190
<font size="36">Sun-jun with a complicated expression</font>

56
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,923
<font size="36">You have a lot of worries.</font>

57
00:03:59,946 --> 00:04:00,946
<font size="36">It's hard to say...</font>

58
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:01,566
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

59
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:04,623
<font size="36">I also thought about it a lot on my own.</font>

60
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:07,023
<font size="36">Was it right to do that with Sa-yoon...</font>

61
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:11,023
<font size="36">Ah, I already knew the result from the day before...</font>

62
00:04:11,326 --> 00:04:15,323
<font size="36">Because she's young and seems to be struggling.</font>

63
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:17,990
<font size="36">Because she seems to be struggling?</font>

64
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:21,256
<font size="36">I feel very sorry...</font>

65
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:33,056
<font size="36">I thought that continuously showing affection like that might make Sa-yoon feel pressured.</font>

66
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:36,223
<font size="36">Uh, no, that's not it.</font>

67
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:37,023
<font size="36">He's truly a good person.</font>

68
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:38,390
<font size="36">Why is he like that?</font>

69
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:40,556
<font size="36">- So kind
- Because he thinks it's his fault.</font>

70
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:47,223
<font size="36">So I also felt very confused.</font>

71
00:04:49,346 --> 00:04:52,690
<font size="36">I even thought about whether I should give up.</font>

72
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:55,356
<font size="36">Ah... no no no no.</font>

73
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:56,271
<font size="36">Son-in-law Ahn.</font>

74
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:57,201
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

75
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:03,623
<font size="36">Is the way I'm showing affection causing Sa-yoon trouble?</font>

76
00:05:04,156 --> 00:05:09,656
<font size="36">Honestly, I feel comfortable. Even if I'm rejected, I feel comfortable.</font>

77
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:18,156
<font size="36">In many ways, I feel like I'm putting a burden on others...</font>

78
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:24,023
<font size="36">You are truly... sunshine.</font>

79
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:27,290
<font size="36">You are truly the sunshine of spring.</font>

80
00:05:33,026 --> 00:05:38,156
<font size="36">But at that time, it was very difficult to bear it alone,</font>

81
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:43,518
<font size="36">anyway, sister Seok-joo listened and gave a lot of advice,</font>

82
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:47,485
<font size="36">which made me feel much relieved</font>

83
00:05:47,495 --> 00:05:50,357
<font size="36">so I was very grateful at that time.</font>

84
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:54,041
<font size="36">When you're having a hard time, having someone to talk to makes you feel so relieved~</font>

85
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:58,623
<font size="36">You yourself need comfort, but you want to comfort others.</font>

86
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:01,023
<font size="36">That's mutual comfort, isn't it~</font>

87
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:07,786
<font size="36">(A moment of mutual comfort)</font>

88
00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:12,890
<font size="36">(Night gradually deepens)</font>

89
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,496
<font size="36">Meanwhile, two hours earlier on the 2nd floor</font>

90
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,576
<font size="36">I have a vague feeling that today</font>

91
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:31,776
<font size="36">no tape will come from Tak-soo.</font>

92
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,856
<font size="36">After the changed date, seeing the two become closer,</font>

93
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:40,556
<font size="36">emotions became even more complex</font>

94
00:06:41,823 --> 00:06:47,023
<font size="36">(And Tak-soo's feelings were conveyed to Soo-wan)</font>

95
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:49,366
<font size="36">I think he sent it to Soo-wan.</font>

96
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,976
<font size="36">Actually, I was very bothered by that too.</font>

97
00:06:56,766 --> 00:07:03,390
<font size="36">(Shin-hyang, feeling uncomfortable with the situation, left first)</font>

98
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,566
<font size="36">Since I share a room with Soo-wan,</font>

99
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:12,566
<font size="36">I was worried that the situation might seem uncomfortable.</font>

100
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:19,023
<font size="36">She quickly got ready for bed before Soo-wan arrived</font>

101
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,123
<font size="36">Oh? You're here? What's wrong?</font>

102
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:24,166
<font size="36">Going to shower.</font>

103
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:28,766
<font size="36">Ah, Shin-hyang is going to sleep before Soo-wan arrives now.</font>

104
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:33,623
<font size="36">(The sound of brushing hair fills the quiet room)</font>

105
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,590
<font size="36">Ah. What should I say?</font>

106
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:46,166
<font size="36">I think Shin-hyang also has feelings for Tak-soo, and so do I, but since we're roommates,</font>

107
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:52,056
<font size="36">I was worried that we might hurt each other's feelings.</font>

108
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,956
<font size="36">I also... feel uncomfortable right now..!</font>

109
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:59,066
<font size="36">My heart is also choked up. Ugh.</font>

110
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:04,623
<font size="36">A day passed with worries</font>

111
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:10,256
<font size="36">DAY 3</font>

112
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:14,566
<font size="36">Well, what will happen today?</font>

113
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,457
<font size="36">The two prepared in silence</font>

114
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,566
<font size="36">Hmm. There was no conversation.</font>

115
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:36,866
<font size="36">If you go on a date today, who would you want to go with?</font>

116
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:39,690
<font size="36">(Shin-hyang's blunt question)</font>

117
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:40,566
<font size="36">Hmm? Hmm?</font>

118
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:44,790
<font size="36">If you go on a date today, who would you want to go with?</font>

119
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:45,766
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

120
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,490
<font size="36">Tak-soo?</font>

121
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:54,256
<font size="36">What about you, unnie?</font>

122
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,566
<font size="36">Me? I... um.</font>

123
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:57,066
<font size="36">I'm also Tak-soo.</font>

124
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,066
<font size="36">I also Tak-soo.</font>

125
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:01,366
<font size="36">Ah, I don't know.</font>

126
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:04,890
<font size="36">(Shin-hyang replied vaguely)</font>

127
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:09,766
<font size="36">Actually, I thought it would be good to go on a date with Tak-soo,</font>

128
00:09:10,636 --> 00:09:15,790
<font size="36">both of us have feelings for Tak-soo, even if we don't say it, we actually know.</font>

129
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:19,676
<font size="36">Therefore, I can't talk more easily.</font>

130
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:20,306
<font size="36">It's very difficult.</font>

131
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:22,626
<font size="36">(Shin-hyang didn't say it out of deference to Soo-wan)</font>

132
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:24,766
<font size="36">Ay, just say it. Ay.</font>

133
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:25,226
<font size="36">Ay.</font>

134
00:09:25,646 --> 00:09:28,856
<font size="36">No, that's not it. I already said Tak-soo, wouldn't it be weird if I said Tak-soo again?</font>

135
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:30,989
<font size="36">What's weird? It's possible.</font>

136
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:34,823
<font size="36">Sigh, I feel so bad, as a father.</font>

137
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:38,456
<font size="36">But Soo-wan is much younger than Shin-hyang.</font>

138
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:38,766
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

139
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:41,076
<font size="36">There will be many more opportunities later, this time...</font>

140
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:41,486
<font size="36">What did you say?</font>

141
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:43,586
<font size="36">Ay, you shouldn't say that.</font>

142
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:44,826
<font size="36">Do you mean to give way?</font>

143
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:45,076
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

144
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:47,166
<font size="36">Love isn't like that.</font>

145
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:49,556
<font size="36">Yes, I'm sorry. I just felt so bad.</font>

146
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:56,823
<font size="36">(Sa-yoon finished getting ready and came to the common area)</font>

147
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:04,166
<font size="36">Hello~</font>

148
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:08,223
<font size="36">(Just as Sun-jun entered the living room)</font>

149
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,923
<font size="36">The cheesecake was really delicious.</font>

150
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:11,836
<font size="36">It was really delicious.</font>

151
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:13,506
<font size="36">From early morning?</font>

152
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:15,766
<font size="36">Eating sweets on an empty stomach.</font>

153
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:16,446
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

154
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:19,790
<font size="36">This morning</font>

155
00:10:20,023 --> 00:10:22,723
<font size="36">Taking the cake that Sun-jun packed yesterday</font>

156
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:25,466
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

157
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:27,966
<font size="36">(Sa-yoon ate it very deliciously from early morning)</font>

158
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:28,766
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

159
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:32,290
<font size="36">(Another bite)</font>

160
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:36,290
<font size="36">(The cake was eaten clean before anyone knew it)</font>

161
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,366
<font size="36">It's delicious with coffee.</font>

162
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:42,466
<font size="36">It seems like a good restaurant.</font>

163
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:42,966
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

164
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:43,766
<font size="36">Good restaurant.</font>

165
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:49,766
<font size="36">What to do now.</font>

166
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:58,790
<font size="36">(Sun-jun did not continue the conversation)</font>

167
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:07,190
<font size="36">Q: Who do you want to date today?</font>

168
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:07,766
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

169
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:14,266
<font size="36">Ah, I can't... I can't choose.</font>

170
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:16,266
<font size="36">What to do now.</font>

171
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,166
<font size="36">(Sun-jun found it harder to approach Sa-yoon)</font>

172
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:20,290
<font size="36">(Sun-jun found it harder to approach Sa-yoon)
What about Sun-jun now.</font>

173
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,123
<font size="36">After a brief conversation with Sa-yoon</font>

174
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:26,166
<font size="36">Oh, he's gone.</font>

175
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:27,766
<font size="36">Oh, he just left.</font>

176
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:28,266
<font size="36">Ah, that's right.</font>

177
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:33,656
<font size="36">(Sa-yoon remained in the common area)</font>

178
00:11:34,766 --> 00:11:37,790
<font size="36">(Seong-jun arrived in the common area)</font>

179
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:50,256
<font size="36">Not even a greeting?</font>

180
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:53,456
<font size="36">At least say something when you arrive...</font>

181
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,766
<font size="36">The atmosphere is completely different from yesterday, isn't it?</font>

182
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:57,466
<font size="36">Ah, truly.</font>

183
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:04,866
<font size="36">Hey, but Seong-jun gave a tape to Sa-yoon yesterday. But Sa-yoon gave it to Jun-ho.</font>

184
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:05,856
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

185
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:19,861
<font size="36">When I opened the mailbox yesterday,</font>

186
00:12:20,301 --> 00:12:23,961
<font size="36">there was nothing, so I was worried if she had changed her mind.</font>

187
00:12:24,471 --> 00:12:30,456
<font size="36">I felt like she was interested in someone else.</font>

188
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:33,356
<font size="36">So I was also very worried.</font>

189
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:38,618
<font size="36">Is anyone inside?</font>

190
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:39,198
<font size="36">No.</font>

191
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:40,018
<font size="36">No one?</font>

192
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:43,018
<font size="36">Do you want to listen?</font>

193
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:43,568
<font size="36">No.</font>

194
00:12:43,808 --> 00:12:44,118
<font size="36">No?</font>

195
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:45,148
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,990
<font size="36">(Seong-jun went to the LP room)
Oh, shouldn't Sa-yoon follow?</font>

197
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:50,017
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

198
00:12:56,872 --> 00:12:59,882
<font size="36">Because I wanted to talk to Seong-jun,</font>

199
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:05,362
<font size="36">I just sat in the living room and waited until I was alone.</font>

200
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:06,922
<font size="36">Oh, what's that?</font>

201
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:09,472
<font size="36">Oh, that's right.</font>

202
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:09,912
<font size="36">Me?</font>

203
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:11,822
<font size="36">So, are there any singers I know?</font>

204
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:14,872
<font size="36">Ah, earlier I also checked if there were any singers I knew?</font>

205
00:13:15,222 --> 00:13:15,472
<font size="36">No?</font>

206
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:16,012
<font size="36">No?</font>

207
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:18,452
<font size="36">Uh. Just sneezing from the dust.</font>

208
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:21,522
<font size="36">There's ABBA. ABBA.</font>

209
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:23,292
<font size="36">Shall we listen?</font>

210
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:23,772
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

211
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:25,056
<font size="36">(Talking as if nothing happened)</font>

212
00:13:25,156 --> 00:13:28,123
<font size="36">(And opened the LP record)</font>

213
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:35,523
<font size="36">He came next to Sa-yoon but just stood there awkwardly...</font>

214
00:13:37,722 --> 00:13:37,922
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

215
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:38,742
<font size="36">Next to her.</font>

216
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:39,632
<font size="36">Next to her, oh?</font>

217
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:42,023
<font size="36">(And he sat in the front seat (?) instead of next to Sa-yoon)</font>

218
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:45,056
<font size="36">It seems that not receiving the tape has deeply affected him.</font>

<font size="36">(The atmosphere is completely different from yesterday)</font>

220
00:13:50,672 --> 00:13:50,922
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

221
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:04,002
<font size="36">Seong-jun</font>

222
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:04,942
<font size="36">Is he sulking?</font>

223
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:05,432
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

224
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:09,390
<font size="36">But Seong-jun also seems a bit... sulking!?</font>

225
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:09,712
<font size="36">A bit</font>

226
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:11,123
<font size="36">No, no, not at all.</font>

227
00:14:11,223 --> 00:14:13,623
<font size="36">He's not that kind of person.</font>

228
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:17,056
<font size="36">Seong-jun is a child who opened up, but now I only see his back.</font>

229
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,423
<font size="36">No, Dad, that's just what you think, but we think he's sulking.</font>

230
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:20,590
<font size="36">Not at all, not at all.</font>

231
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:21,522
<font size="36">I already sent the tape, though.</font>

232
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,012
<font size="36">You haven't sent it yet.</font>

233
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:23,812
<font size="36">No, no.</font>

234
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:25,222
<font size="36">He wanted me to know his feelings, but.</font>

235
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:25,812
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

236
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:26,782
<font size="36">Could it be that he couldn't...</font>

237
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,132
<font size="36">Everyone here says he's sulking!!!</font>

238
00:14:28,462 --> 00:14:29,232
<font size="36">Only he says he's not.</font>

239
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:29,862
<font size="36">No, it's not. It's not.</font>

240
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:30,782
<font size="36">Not at all. Not at all.</font>

241
00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:31,432
<font size="36">Not?</font>

242
00:14:39,183 --> 00:14:39,983
<font size="36">One thing I'm curious about</font>

243
00:14:40,193 --> 00:14:40,383
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

244
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:43,253
<font size="36">Yesterday, yesterday who did you send it to?</font>

245
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:43,843
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

246
00:14:44,413 --> 00:14:44,923
<font size="36">Yesterday...</font>

247
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:48,143
<font size="36">I sent it to Jun-ho.</font>

248
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:51,223
<font size="36">But I thought about it a lot.</font>

249
00:14:51,843 --> 00:14:52,563
<font size="36">really</font>

250
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:58,723
<font size="36">I thought you wanted to get to know many other people.</font>

251
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,223
<font size="36">- Me?
- Uh.</font>

252
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:06,879
<font size="36">Ah, so you thought I chose Soo-wan.</font>

253
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:08,839
<font size="36">Of course.</font>

254
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,979
<font size="36">And it seemed that way. Uh. Uh.</font>

255
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:12,039
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

256
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:12,729
<font size="36">Completely.</font>

257
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:16,859
<font size="36">I mean, I was going to invite you when I first signed up, right?</font>

258
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,719
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

259
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:18,849
<font size="36">Oh? Really?</font>

260
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:19,229
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

261
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:22,590
<font size="36">Then why didn't you come?</font>

262
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:23,139
<font size="36">It was late.</font>

263
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:24,829
<font size="36">I waited.</font>

264
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:25,979
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

265
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:26,639
<font size="36">But.</font>

266
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:28,629
<font size="36">It was so late that</font>

267
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:31,809
<font size="36">as soon as I saw the message, I was going to do it with you.</font>

268
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:32,629
<font size="36">As soon as you saw it?</font>

269
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:33,199
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

270
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,823
<font size="36">- Is that so?
- No need to think at all.</font>

271
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:41,839
<font size="36">Here's what happened, I opened the door and walked in. I was going to talk.</font>

272
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:46,219
<font size="36">But I heard Sun-jun talking.</font>

273
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,169
<font size="36">Knock knock knock and</font>

274
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:52,223
<font size="36">When I opened the door, I heard Sa-yoon's name being called.</font>

275
00:15:52,323 --> 00:15:55,523
<font size="36">So I closed the door and left immediately.</font>

276
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:57,559
<font size="36">Now I understand.</font>

277
00:15:58,049 --> 00:15:58,429
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

278
00:15:58,729 --> 00:15:59,939
<font size="36">Finally, the misunderstanding was resolved.</font>

279
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:06,669
<font size="36">So I kept thinking that of course you wouldn't send it to me yesterday, right?</font>

280
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:08,369
<font size="36">Ah, it was truly obvious.</font>

281
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:11,849
<font size="36">That's why yesterday, after listening to the tape,</font>

282
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:14,649
<font size="36">my thoughts were very complex.</font>

283
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:17,919
<font size="36">Don't overthink. Overthinking seems to twist things.</font>

284
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,729
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

285
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:24,229
<font size="36">Like how yesterday I changed my answer that I was confused about until the last minute,</font>

286
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:27,609
<font size="36">I kept thinking and actually used two tapes.</font>

287
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:28,019
<font size="36">But</font>

288
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:33,090
<font size="36">but the answer changed at the last minute was still wrong.</font>

289
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,769
<font size="36">So I...</font>

290
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:37,919
<font size="36">I'm still as I was before.</font>

291
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:41,279
<font size="36">I was going to do it that way.</font>

292
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:45,069
<font size="36">Here</font>

293
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:45,949
<font size="36">Here, so frankly like this</font>

294
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:47,879
<font size="36">Oh, I'm giving up too!</font>

295
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:49,109
<font size="36">Ah, I don't know.</font>

296
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,019
<font size="36">Ah, I don't know either.</font>

297
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,229
<font size="36">End? End here?</font>

298
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:53,423
<font size="36">- Isn't this a confession?
- It's definitely a confession atmosphere.</font>

299
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,049
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

300
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:54,649

360
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:09,056
<font size="36">No, from the fact that Soo-wan didn't hear the message, it seems things are a bit complicated.</font>

361
00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:16,833
<font size="36">I think I was hoping Soo-wan would also come to the date today.</font>

362
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:27,533

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,682
<font size="36">Now switch hands</font>

449
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:14,190
<font size="36">They must feel very comfortable.</font>

450
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,542
<font size="36">Currently, they are competing with each other.</font>

451
00:24:17,912 --> 00:24:19,192
<font size="36">They are pushing each other.</font>

452
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:21,790
<font size="36">(Feels more like competing than a couple...?)</font>

453
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:28,382
<font size="36">Both must have equal pushing force to stand up.</font>

454
00:24:29,182 --> 00:24:30,682
<font size="36">Will stand up by pushing with their feet.</font>

455
00:24:31,392 --> 00:24:32,182
<font size="36">Where are you going!</font>

456
00:24:33,192 --> 00:24:33,552
<font size="36">Slowly.</font>

457
00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:34,552
<font size="36">Push, push, push.</font>

458
00:24:35,382 --> 00:24:35,852
<font size="36">Stand up.</font>

459
00:24:37,072 --> 00:24:37,292
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

460
00:24:37,682 --> 00:24:38,292
<font size="36">Oh! Well done.</font>

461
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:39,052
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

462
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:40,032
<font size="36">Oh. Yes.</font>

463
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:41,212
<font size="36">Oh, well done.</font>

464
00:24:42,142 --> 00:24:42,892
<font size="36">Seok-joo is really strong.</font>

465
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:47,682
<font size="36">I don't think it was too awkward.</font>

466
00:24:48,082 --> 00:24:49,382
<font size="36">Rather, I felt more comfortable.</font>

467
00:24:50,152 --> 00:24:51,452
<font size="36">Maybe it's because there's no romantic interest?</font>

468
00:24:52,002 --> 00:24:52,902
<font size="36">Maybe it's because there's no romantic interest.</font>

469
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:54,682
<font size="36">The back-to-back thing or whatever,</font>

470
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:55,502
<font size="36">It's just</font>

471
00:24:56,382 --> 00:24:57,672
<font size="36">There's someone behind me.</font>

472
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:01,112
<font size="36">And I want to do well.</font>

473
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:02,842
<font size="36">Have to do it properly?</font>

474
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:04,312
<font size="36">Have to show off a bit?</font>

475
00:25:06,012 --> 00:25:06,902
<font size="36">Oh, over there it's just a game.</font>

476
00:25:07,152 --> 00:25:07,502
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

477
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:09,032
<font size="36">It's not a date, but</font>

478
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:09,682
<font size="36">it's turned into a game...</font>

479
00:25:10,932 --> 00:25:11,602
<font size="36">Not doing anything.</font>

480
00:25:15,023 --> 00:25:18,256
<font size="36">(What is it)</font>

481
00:25:18,532 --> 00:25:19,592
<font size="36">They're probably playing a game too.</font>

482
00:25:22,012 --> 00:25:22,856
<font size="36">This is it, right?</font>

483
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:23,732
<font size="36">That's right. That's right.</font>

484
00:25:25,652 --> 00:25:27,342
<font size="36">One. Let go of your hands and slowly stand up.</font>

485
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:30,552
<font size="36">I thought they were really having fun, so</font>

486
00:25:30,992 --> 00:25:33,102
<font size="36">I didn't care about Seok-joo.</font>

487
00:25:34,982 --> 00:25:35,992
<font size="36">Instead,</font>

488
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,123
<font size="36">What if they don't switch partners midway?</font>

489
00:25:40,032 --> 00:25:41,682
<font size="36">I wanted to do it with Tak-soo too, so</font>

490
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:42,502
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

491
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,682
<font size="36">They have to switch partners, right? I don't know.</font>

492
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:48,512
<font size="36">Did the instructor forget? They have to switch partners, I thought.</font>

493
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,892
<font size="36">Ah, switch partners.</font>

494
00:25:51,262 --> 00:25:52,242
<font size="36">Yes, yes. Switch.</font>

495
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:52,932
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

496
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:54,392
<font size="36">Switch.</font>

497
00:25:54,682 --> 00:25:55,052
<font size="36">Let's go.</font>

498
00:25:55,252 --> 00:25:55,682
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

499
00:25:56,832 --> 00:25:58,256
<font size="36">Shin-hyang brightened up immediately.</font>

500
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:01,889
<font size="36">(Father's expression is not good)</font>

501
00:26:02,092 --> 00:26:02,832
<font size="36">When switching partners,</font>

502
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:08,392
<font size="36">Great~ I get to do it too, couple's yoga~ I thought, so I was very happy.</font>

503
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:10,972
<font size="36">Yes. And nervous.</font>

504
00:26:11,382 --> 00:26:11,832
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

505
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:14,282
<font size="36">It's clearly visible on her face.</font>

506
00:26:15,832 --> 00:26:17,562
<font size="36">She really can't hide her emotions.</font>

507
00:26:19,052 --> 00:26:20,912
<font size="36">Gentlemen, completely wrap your arms around the ladies' shoulders.</font>

508
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:22,832
<font size="36">The lady is below. The lady is below.</font>

509
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:24,052
<font size="36">Ah, hands below.</font>

510
00:26:26,382 --> 00:26:28,072
<font size="36">Stretch your legs and arms.</font>

511
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:29,832
<font size="36">Once, once, once.</font>

512
00:26:30,062 --> 00:26:30,672
<font size="36">Down.</font>

513
00:26:31,432 --> 00:26:32,682
<font size="36">Ah, I'll go down there.</font>

514
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:33,632
<font size="36">Ah, it hurts so much.</font>

515
00:26:35,812 --> 00:26:36,522
<font size="36">Relax your strength.</font>

516
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:38,462
<font size="36">Relax your legs.</font>

517
00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:39,542
<font size="36">Oh, leading.</font>

518
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,832
<font size="36">You can do it without putting pressure on the other person.</font>

519
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:44,102
<font size="36">Sitting back-to-back.</font>

520
00:26:44,632 --> 00:26:45,102
<font size="36">Back-to-back.</font>

521
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:46,072
<font size="36">Back-to-back.</font>

522
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:48,192
<font size="36">So fun.</font>

523
00:26:50,032 --> 00:26:50,262
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

524
00:26:53,102 --> 00:26:54,602
<font size="36">Straight up above your head.</font>

525
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:57,682
<font size="36">Now let go of your hands.</font>

526
00:26:58,502 --> 00:26:59,482
<font size="36">Let go of your hands.</font>

527
00:26:59,872 --> 00:27:01,990
<font size="36">- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

528
00:27:02,312 --> 00:27:04,690
<font size="36">(Shin-hyang, Dad's not okay)
Still no hand-holding, but</font>

529
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,012
<font size="36">No hand-holding! Not hands yet.</font>

530
00:27:08,272 --> 00:27:10,872
<font size="36">We're holding wrists. The man holds the woman's wrist.</font>

531
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,132
<font size="36">Man, hold the woman's wrist.</font>

532
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:14,132
<font size="36">Like this.</font>

533
00:27:14,422 --> 00:27:15,122
<font size="36">Wrist, wrist.</font>

534
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:17,642
<font size="36">Hold hands.</font>

535
00:27:19,632 --> 00:27:20,002
<font size="36">That's not it.</font>

536
00:27:20,232 --> 00:27:20,932
<font size="36">Ah, my wrist got held.</font>

537
00:27:21,232 --> 00:27:22,032
<font size="36">Ah, like this.</font>

538
00:27:23,002 --> 00:27:23,302
<font size="36">Oh, oh, oh.</font>

539
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:24,902
<font size="36">Oh, oh, oh, oh.</font>

540
00:27:25,302 --> 00:27:25,602
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

541
00:27:26,002 --> 00:27:27,202
<font size="36">This will go fast.</font>

542
00:27:27,302 --> 00:27:28,002
<font size="36">Quickly.</font>

543
00:27:28,202 --> 00:27:29,902
<font size="36">Hey, they're holding hands now.</font>

544
00:27:30,302 --> 00:27:30,602
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

545
00:27:31,202 --> 00:27:32,002
<font size="36">Shin-hyang's dad.</font>

546
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:34,890
<font size="36">You have to take responsibility!</font>

547
00:27:40,602 --> 00:27:41,002
<font size="36">Wait a minute.</font>

548
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:42,502
<font size="36">Ah, wait. I really won't do it.</font>

549
00:27:44,602 --> 00:27:46,602
<font size="36">Whoa.</font>

550
00:27:46,602 --> 00:27:47,202
<font size="36">Oh, hey.</font>

551
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:48,702
<font size="36">Oh, physical contact.</font>

552
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,902
<font size="36">It seems like I can balance, but I'm leaning a bit.</font>

553
00:27:52,202 --> 00:27:53,656
<font size="36">Intentionally leaning.</font>

554
00:27:54,602 --> 00:27:56,102
<font size="36">It's all messed up, it's all messed up.</font>

555
00:27:59,602 --> 00:28:04,090
<font size="36">Q: What moment made your heart flutter?
All of it...</font>

556
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,802
<font size="36">It seems like everything made my heart flutter.</font>

557
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:12,002
<font size="36">Because I thought the feeling of holding hands or wrists like that was different.</font>

558
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:15,102
<font size="36">At that time, yes, my heart fluttered.</font>

559
00:28:16,202 --> 00:28:19,202
<font size="36">Oh, at that time it was a little different from Seok-joo nuna.</font>

560
00:28:19,602 --> 00:28:20,602
<font size="36">Oh. That.</font>

561
00:28:21,002 --> 00:28:21,502
<font size="36">What should I call it?</font>

562
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:24,002
<font size="36">I think I did it more carefully.</font>

563
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:27,902
<font size="36">Anyway, after it's over, Tak-soo's dad, talk to me a bit.</font>

564
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:29,223
<font size="36">Yes, yes.</font>

565
00:28:37,302 --> 00:28:38,302
<font size="36">Isn't it too much?</font>

566
00:28:39,902 --> 00:28:40,902
<font size="36">Can't breathe.</font>

567
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:43,056
<font size="36">He says he can't breathe.</font>

568
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:44,802
<font size="36">(Oh, our son)</font>

569
00:28:58,502 --> 00:29:00,802
<font size="36">We'll sit with our knees touching. Knees touching.</font>

570
00:29:01,602 --> 00:29:03,202
<font size="36">Again, what are they going to do...</font>

571
00:29:07,502 --> 00:29:08,202
<font size="36">Close your eyes.</font>

572
00:29:08,202 --> 00:29:08,502
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

573
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:11,202
<font size="36">Close your eyes.</font>

574
00:29:16,802 --> 00:29:17,302
<font size="36">Hello?</font>

575
00:29:17,502 --> 00:29:19,002
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

576
00:29:20,602 --> 00:29:21,902
<font size="36">Oh dear, what about our Sun-jun.</font>

577
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:25,302
<font size="36">Whoa.</font>

578
00:29:27,502 --> 00:29:28,202
<font size="36">Too close.</font>

579
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:28,502
<font size="36">No.</font>

580
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:30,002
<font size="36">This is too awkward. Too awkward.</font>

581
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,002
<font size="36">I don't know where to look.</font>

582
00:29:33,602 --> 00:29:39,002
<font size="36">We'll place our right hand right across, just below the other person's collarbone.</font>

583
00:29:39,602 --> 00:29:40,602
<font size="36">Collar... where's the collarbone?</font>

584
00:29:40,702 --> 00:29:42,002
<font size="36">Place your hand on the collarbone.</font>

585
00:29:42,002 --> 00:29:42,302
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

586
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:42,602
<font size="36">Where?</font>

587
00:29:42,602 --> 00:29:42,802
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

588
00:29:42,802 --> 00:29:43,002
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

589
00:29:43,102 --> 00:29:43,402
<font size="36">Oh dear, oh dear.</font>

590
00:29:43,402 --> 00:29:44,002
<font size="36">You have to put it there.</font>

591
00:29:44,302 --> 00:29:44,902
<font size="36">Oh dear, oh dear.</font>

592
00:29:45,902 --> 00:29:46,602
<font size="36">Lady, you do it too.</font>

593
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:48,402
<font size="36">Oh dear, oh dear.</font>

594
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:51,202
<font size="36">Oh dear, oh dear.</font>

595
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:56,702
<font size="36">Your own left hand, place it on the back of the other person's hand.</font>

596
00:29:58,602 --> 00:29:59,602
<font size="36">Come up from underneath. From underneath.</font>

597
00:29:59,602 --> 00:29:59,902
<font size="36">Anyway.</font>

598
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:01,399
<font size="36">Right hand comes from underneath, from underneath.</font>

600
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:04,499
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

601
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:05,799
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

602
00:30:06,499 --> 00:30:06,999
<font size="36">It's truly amazing.</font>

603
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:11,999
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

604
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:12,999
<font size="36">Hey, the eyebrows keep</font>

605
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:13,999
<font size="36">Going up and down.</font>

606
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:14,499
<font size="36">What's wrong with it...</font>

607
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:15,799
<font size="36">Isn't the heart rate soaring?</font>

608
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:20,999
<font size="36">The other person's heartbeat on my palm,</font>

609
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:22,799
<font size="36">Oh, Sun-jun's heartbeat,</font>

610
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,799
<font size="36">I can hear it, I can hear it.</font>

611
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:26,499
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

612
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,999
<font size="36">Slowly open your eyes and look at the other person.</font>

613
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:32,999
<font size="36">Can't open my eyes.</font>

614
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,999
<font size="36">Sun-jun must feel that Seok-joo is different.</font>

615
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:39,799
<font size="36">Hmm, it was a novel experience and</font>

616
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:44,499
<font size="36">when I did that move, my heart really fluttered,</font>

617
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:48,999
<font size="36">Hmm, this heartbeat,</font>

618
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:50,999
<font size="36">I don't know why it was beating so fast,</font>

619
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:54,799
<font size="36">whether it was due to physical contact or nervousness,</font>

620
00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:56,499
<font size="36">I was just curious and</font>

621
00:30:57,999 --> 00:30:59,999
<font size="36">my mood probably became strange.</font>

622
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:02,999
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

623
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:04,799
<font size="36">Hmm. Hey, her heart has fluttered.</font>

624
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,999
<font size="36">Oh, I'm not looking anymore!</font>

625
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:08,799
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

626
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:11,499
<font size="36">Hey, this one, yes.</font>

627
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:16,499
<font size="36">Use your right palm to place it on the other person's collarbone.</font>

628
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:17,799
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

629
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:18,499
<font size="36">You have to put it there.</font>

630
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:18,999
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

631
00:31:19,499 --> 00:31:19,999
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

632
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,499
<font size="36">Lady, you do it too.</font>

633
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:23,799
<font size="36">Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness.</font>

634
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:24,999
<font size="36">It's bare skin.</font>

635
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:26,499
<font size="36">What should I do.</font>

636
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:27,499
<font size="36">Shin-hyang's dad.</font>

637
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:28,799

644
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:52,999

652
00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:26,999
<font size="36">But it was beating so fast.</font>

653
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:28,499
<font size="36">But,</font>

654
00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:32,399
<font size="36">I think there was a slight flutter.</font>

<font size="36">Yes. Oh, truly honest. Yes.</font>

00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:57,999
<font size="36">at that moment, more than anything else,</font>

662
00:33:01,499 --> 00:33:02,799
<font size="36">Just like?</font>

663
00:33:03,486 --> 00:33:03,886
<font size="36">Like.</font>

664
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,186
<font size="36">I think I thought that.</font>

<font size="36">That's right.</font>

667
00:33:26,346 --> 00:33:28,166
<font size="36">While doing yoga,</font>

668
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,346
<font size="36">Only one person,</font>

669
00:33:29,346 --> 00:33:29,916
<font size="36">And,</font>

670
00:33:30,186 --> 00:33:33,206
<font size="36">This feeling isn't simply just</font>

671
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:37,346
<font size="36">liking a younger sibling or liking an ordinary person, but</font>

672
00:33:38,076 --> 00:33:42,266
<font size="36">I think I realized it was a deeper emotion.</font>

673
00:33:42,924 --> 00:33:44,304
<font size="36">Ah. Hey.</font>

674
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:45,984
<font size="36">Deeper emotion.</font>

675
00:33:46,314 --> 00:33:47,344
<font size="36">It's really hard. Too hard.</font>

676
00:33:47,344 --> 00:33:47,644
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

677
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:49,284
<font size="36">It's almost decided.</font>

678
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:54,144
<font size="36">Hey, I thought this yoga date would just be gentle meditation.</font>

679
00:33:54,914 --> 00:33:59,674
<font size="36">Now, especially with lasers shooting from our Lee Cheolmin's eyes.</font>

680
00:34:00,214 --> 00:34:02,844
<font size="36">I wonder if it's necessary to go this far.</font>

681
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:03,544
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

682
00:34:04,654 --> 00:34:07,244
<font size="36">I don't like this situation at all.</font>

683
00:34:07,444 --> 00:34:07,844
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

684
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,164
<font size="36">But seeing my daughter happy,</font>

685
00:34:13,014 --> 00:34:15,344
<font size="36">I hope she continues to be happy like this until the end.</font>

686
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:16,014
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

687
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:19,444
<font size="36">It's hard to say. I think her heart really did flutter, but</font>

688
00:34:20,164 --> 00:34:25,444
<font size="36">anyway, wouldn't Tak-soo think it would be better if Soo-wan did yoga with him instead of Shin-hyang?</font>

689
00:34:25,714 --> 00:34:26,204
<font size="36">Ah, what about Tak-soo?</font>

690
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:26,844
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

691
00:34:27,344 --> 00:34:27,754
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

692
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:29,194
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

693
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,744
<font size="36">No, I think Tak-soo's heart is really strange.</font>

694
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:32,344
<font size="36">I don't understand.</font>

695
00:34:32,664 --> 00:34:33,944
<font size="36">That is, for example,</font>

696
00:34:34,444 --> 00:34:35,174
<font size="36">Wait. Why is it strange?</font>

697
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:36,164
<font size="36">Ah, no, no.</font>

698
00:34:36,904 --> 00:34:38,444
<font size="36">It has to be precise. That's the feeling.</font>

699
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:40,184
<font size="36">If it's a yes, it's a yes, if it's a no, it's a no.</font>

700
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:43,444
<font size="36">It's fine to do it here, or fine to do it there. This is a bit</font>

701
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:47,056
<font size="36">No, but it's only been 3 days, 3 days.</font>

702
00:34:47,156 --> 00:34:48,689
<font size="36">It's only been two days, about two days.</font>

703
00:34:48,784 --> 00:34:51,214
<font size="36">It's only been two days, it's the third day already, and to make a decision right here...</font>

704
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,194
<font size="36">From a father's perspective, 3 days feel like 3 years.</font>

705
00:34:53,534 --> 00:34:54,194
<font size="36">It's so difficult, look.</font>

706
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:55,134
<font size="36">(In other words, he's too invested...)</font>

707

709
00:35:00,946 --> 00:35:01,666
<font size="36">Oh! Is it a karaoke place?</font>

710
00:35:01,896 --> 00:35:02,336
<font size="36">Karaoke place.</font>

711
00:35:04,906 --> 00:35:06,176

<font size="36">I'll go first.</font>

718
00:35:24,466 --> 00:35:26,166
<font size="36">Okay. Oh, that's something to look forward to.</font>

719
00:35:27,706 --> 00:35:28,956
<font size="36">I'll actually rap a song for you.</font>

720

<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

721
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,466

729
00:36:17,953 --> 00:36:20,353
<font size="36">I couldn't think of those things.</font>

<font size="36">(Oh Seong-jun~)</font>

731
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,523

<font size="36">Something that lingers in memory</font>

902
00:44:13,056 --> 00:44:16,656
<font size="36">It's... that place near the other person's heart.</font>

903
00:44:16,756 --> 00:44:18,889
<font size="36">Putting your hand there like this...</font>

904
00:44:20,763 --> 00:44:22,257
<font size="36">Both of them like this,</font>

905
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,656
<font size="36">Feeling each other's hearts.</font>

906
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,556
<font size="36">Heartbeat.</font>

907
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:26,426
<font size="36">That must have left a very strong impression.</font>

908
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:27,656
<font size="36">Sun-jun must remember it a lot.</font>

909
00:44:27,996 --> 00:44:29,690
<font size="36">This will probably appear in his dreams too~</font>

910
00:44:30,226 --> 00:44:33,156
<font size="36">From my perspective, Sun-jun will probably dream about this.</font>

911
00:44:33,523 --> 00:44:36,123
<font size="36">Isn't this "Solo Inferno"?</font>

912
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,056
<font size="36">I... I... I can't do it...</font>

913
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,620
<font size="36">But couple yoga is really unimaginable.</font>

914
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,260
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

915
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,010
<font size="36">I kept thinking we'd do something dynamic.</font>

916
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:47,290
<font size="36">I can't imagine it either.</font>

917
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:52,156
<font size="36">(But) today, it really got sorted out.</font>

918
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,190
<font size="36">Sigh...</font>

919
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,730
<font size="36">Ah! Ah, (Tak-soo) hasn't sorted things out yet, right?</font>

920
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:03,723
<font size="36">Still hesitating between two people? Or does someone have stronger feelings?</font>

921
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:06,490
<font size="36">I should talk a bit...</font>

922
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:08,989
<font size="36">I still want to talk more...</font>

923
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:12,889
<font size="36">I think today's date was very good.</font>

924
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,990
<font size="36">But today I talked to Soo-wan...</font>

925
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:20,629
<font size="36">I wanted to talk, but it's a bit regrettable that I couldn't.</font>

926
00:45:22,749 --> 00:45:26,690
<font size="36">(Tak-soo is concerned because he couldn't talk to Soo-wan)</font>

927
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:36,223
<font size="36">Everyone, please gather in the common living room.</font>

928
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:39,099
<font size="36">My children have gathered in the common living room.</font>

929
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:41,919
<font size="36">What were they talking about?</font>

930
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:44,649
<font size="36">We had a heartfelt conversation.</font>

931
00:45:44,649 --> 00:45:46,199
<font size="36">Oh! Were they talking about girls over there too?</font>

932
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:47,799
<font size="36">Girls?</font>

933
00:45:48,399 --> 00:45:49,299
<font size="36">We had a Gangster Talk.</font>

934
00:45:49,299 --> 00:45:50,499
<font size="36">Ah, Gangster Talk.</font>

935
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:54,523
<font size="36">- All four of you together?
- Yeah. It was really frank.</font>

936
00:45:56,399 --> 00:45:57,756
<font size="36">[Glances]</font>

937
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,890
<font size="36">[Notices]</font>

938
00:46:06,799 --> 00:46:07,099
<font size="36">Oh dear.</font>

939
00:46:07,399 --> 00:46:08,099
<font size="36">That's coming again.</font>

940
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,799
<font size="36">Ah, my heart is really pounding.</font>

941
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:12,099
<font size="36">Oh my.</font>

942
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:12,399
<font size="36">Again?</font>

943
00:46:12,899 --> 00:46:16,899
<font size="36">You will have 10 minutes for individual 1:1 conversations. During this time, express your true feelings.</font>

944
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,599
<font size="36">Ladies, please take your pre-assigned seats.</font>

945
00:46:18,899 --> 00:46:20,899
<font size="36">Oh. Snow.</font>

946
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:24,999
<font size="36">The daughters took their seats first.</font>

947
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:29,899
<font size="36">Oh, the sons will have a 10-minute rotation opportunity.</font>

948
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:35,399
<font size="36">Rotate like this?</font>

949
00:46:35,799 --> 00:46:36,699
<font size="36">Rotate like this.</font>

950
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:37,599
<font size="36">Thank goodness. Thank goodness.</font>

951
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:38,899
<font size="36">Like a waltz?</font>

952
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:42,999
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

953
00:46:44,899 --> 00:46:48,223
<font size="36">Thankfully, there's an opportunity to talk to each person individually.</font>

954
00:46:48,323 --> 00:46:50,790
<font size="36">Oh, such a relief. I need to talk a lot during this opportunity.</font>

955
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:57,699
<font size="36">Yes, I wanted to talk 1:1 with Tak-soo, but I thought I wouldn't be able to initiate it.</font>

956
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:04,199
<font size="36">I wanted to have some time where we could talk openly before it was too late.</font>

957
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:07,499
<font size="36">Hey, what kind of luck does Tak-soo have?</font>

958
00:47:08,299 --> 00:47:10,599
<font size="36">Ah, Tak-soo, wow.</font>

959
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:20,851
<font size="36">Today, I've sorted out my feelings quite a bit,</font>

960
00:47:20,861 --> 00:47:26,799
<font size="36">and I feel like I can gain clarity through this conversation.</font>

961
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:30,299
<font size="36">Oh, seems like he's feeling more comfortable.</font>

962
00:47:30,899 --> 00:47:32,799
<font size="36">It's getting clearer. Sun-jun.</font>

963
00:47:32,799 --> 00:47:33,099
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

964
00:47:33,299 --> 00:47:33,599
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

965
00:47:36,799 --> 00:47:37,399
<font size="36">Shall we go?</font>

966
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:37,699
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

967
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:41,199
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

968
00:47:42,499 --> 00:47:44,199
<font size="36">Isn't Seong-jun the most awkward one with me?</font>

969
00:47:44,399 --> 00:47:46,823
<font size="36">- Uh. Aren't you the nuna I've talked to the least?
- That's right.</font>

970
00:47:47,399 --> 00:47:47,699
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

971
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,299
<font size="36">Oh, the atmosphere is so good.</font>

972
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:49,599
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

973
00:47:51,699 --> 00:47:53,999
<font size="36">Because this is the first time having a heartfelt conversation.</font>

974
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:54,499
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

975
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:59,199
<font size="36">Somehow, this morning when I talked to Sa-yoon,</font>

976
00:47:59,199 --> 00:47:59,499
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

977
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:01,499
<font size="36">Uh, then</font>

978
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:04,790
<font size="36">What's left is Sa-yoon and Sun-jun.</font>

979
00:48:05,473 --> 00:48:08,690
<font size="36">(The inevitable conversation between the two)
Wow. This is a very important position for Sun-jun.</font>

980
00:48:08,793 --> 00:48:09,433
<font size="36">Go, Sun-jun, go.</font>

981
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:13,223
<font size="36">(What kind of certainty will Sun-jun get?)
I'm very curious about Sun-jun's decision.</font>

982
00:48:14,453 --> 00:48:17,790
<font size="36">First 1:1 rotating conversation
Kim Sa-yoon X</font>

983
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:20,357
<font size="36">Kim Sa-yoon X Ahn Sun-jun</font>

984
00:48:20,703 --> 00:48:25,303
<font size="36">They exchanged the tape last night, but the two haven't clearly spoken to each other yet.</font>

985
00:48:25,533 --> 00:48:25,863
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

986
00:48:26,433 --> 00:48:28,456
<font size="36">Hello...</font>

987
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:33,357
<font size="36">- I didn't expect something like this. Right?
- Yeah.</font>

988
00:48:33,863 --> 00:48:35,263
<font size="36">Ah... But I think it's good.</font>

989
00:48:35,653 --> 00:48:35,893
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

990
00:48:38,193 --> 00:48:40,456
<font size="36">(The morning passed in silence)</font>

991
00:48:40,613 --> 00:48:42,283
<font size="36">Yeah, that's right. I couldn't speak.</font>

992
00:48:45,023 --> 00:48:48,013
<font size="36">Ah, and the Basque cheesecake was really delicious.</font>

993
00:48:48,283 --> 00:48:48,903
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

994
00:48:48,903 --> 00:48:49,143
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

995
00:48:50,173 --> 00:48:52,193
<font size="36">I didn't expect you to wrap it like that. Thank you.</font>

996
00:48:55,203 --> 00:48:56,633
<font size="36">Anyway, I like bread.</font>

997
00:48:56,823 --> 00:48:57,063
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

998
00:48:58,433 --> 00:48:59,933
<font size="36">Well, that's Sun-jun for you.</font>

999
00:49:04,433 --> 00:49:06,133
<font size="36">How is it? Have you sorted things out?</font>

1000
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:06,833
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1001
00:49:10,233 --> 00:49:11,033
<font size="36">Uh, I...</font>

1002
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:15,433
<font size="36">Until yesterday, I thought a lot.</font>

1003
00:49:16,633 --> 00:49:18,433
<font size="36">Now... a little bit...</font>

1004
00:49:20,533 --> 00:49:22,833
<font size="36">Now I feel like there's not much time left, so</font>

1005
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:24,133
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1006
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:29,790
<font size="36">So now I'm going to focus on one person.</font>

1007
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:32,033
<font size="36">Ah, she's saying it.</font>

1008
00:49:33,133 --> 00:49:36,656
<font size="36">(Sa-yoon's answer seems to imply Seong-jun)</font>

1009
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:37,833
<font size="36">Ah, that really stings.</font>

1010
00:49:40,433 --> 00:49:42,433
<font size="36">So now I'm going to focus on one person.</font>

1011
00:49:42,433 --> 00:49:45,623
<font size="36">Feelings that could only be guessed
Now heard directly</font>

1012
00:49:51,433 --> 00:49:53,833
<font size="36">As I said in the recording...</font>

1013
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:54,933
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1014
00:49:55,633 --> 00:49:57,490
<font size="36">I will support you.</font>

1015
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:00,833
<font size="36">Oh! Ah, that hurts.</font>

1016
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:03,433
<font size="36">(Sun-jun decided to give up)</font>

1017
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:04,933
<font size="36">Hey, this is not easy.</font>

1018
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:06,433
<font size="36">So good, so good.</font>

1019
00:50:06,733 --> 00:50:09,933
<font size="36">Ah, really... Ah. I feel so...</font>

1020
00:50:11,733 --> 00:50:13,433
<font size="36">I will support you.</font>

1021
00:50:13,433 --> 00:50:15,956
<font size="36">(Sun-jun's calm encouragement after sorting out his feelings)</font>

1022
00:50:21,533 --> 00:50:23,723
<font size="36">But, thanks to you,</font>

1023
00:50:25,533 --> 00:50:26,833
<font size="36">I gained more courage.</font>

1024
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:27,133
<font size="36">Yeah, yeah.</font>

1025
00:50:28,133 --> 00:50:31,033

1027
00:50:37,156 --> 00:50:41,089
<font size="36">(He bravely initiated asking for a date)</font>

1028
00:50:42,133 --> 00:50:43,233
<font size="36">Hmm, goodbye.</font>

1029
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:44,433
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1030
00:50:44,433 --> 00:50:53,256
<font size="36">(Sincere moments conveyed with a trembling voice)
I hope you act according to your heart's calling.</font>

1031

<font size="36">(Even though he was never reciprocated)</font>

1032
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:03,056
<font size="36">(He always sincerely expressed his feelings to Sa-yoon)</font>

1033
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:05,833
<font size="36">He's also matured a lot.</font>

1034
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:06,133
<font size="36">Yeah, yeah.</font>

1035
00:51:07,818 --> 00:51:11,988
<font size="36">I think I've found a truly honest version of myself.</font>

<font size="36">When we talked,</font>

1040
00:51:23,049 --> 00:51:28,399
<font size="36">I also heard that I shouldn't feel pressured or guilty.</font>

<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1042

1051
00:51:46,959 --> 00:51:49,259
<font size="36">Oppa also said he would act according to his heart's calling.</font>

1052
00:51:49,259 --> 00:51:49,549
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1053
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:51,669
<font size="36">So I heard that and</font>

1054
00:51:52,969 --> 00:51:55,289
<font size="36">Thought it was really cool.</font>

1055
00:51:55,999 --> 00:51:56,299
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1056
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:57,369
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1057
00:51:57,659 --> 00:51:58,009
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1058
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:59,209
<font size="36">Really cool.</font>

1059

<font size="36">Very mature.</font>

1061
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:03,189
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1062
00:52:03,189 --> 00:52:04,899
<font size="36">Because they're mature, it feels even cooler.</font>

1063
00:52:04,899 --> 00:52:05,199
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1064
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:05,679
<font size="36">Seriously.</font>

1065
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:07,489
<font size="36">Seriously, Sun-jun is also very cool.</font>

1066
00:52:07,489 --> 00:52:09,079
<font size="36">Hey, it's not easy at this age.</font>

1067
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:09,339
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1068
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:14,539
<font size="36">I think I was very grateful.</font>

1069
00:52:16,149 --> 00:52:20,199
<font size="36">I kept thinking I was bothering her, but</font>

1070
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:25,290
<font size="36">Sa-yoon didn't feel bothered either. She was comfortable. Thanks to that,</font>

1071
00:52:25,539 --> 00:52:30,599
<font size="36">Being able to resolve all misunderstandings so well makes it even better.</font>

<font size="36">Ah, that was truly wonderful.</font>

1078
00:53:08,399 --> 00:53:08,699
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1079
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:09,299
<font size="36">So cool.</font>

1080
00:53:09,669 --> 00:53:10,099
<font size="36">That's how it is.</font>

1081
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:11,799
<font size="36">You raised your son very well.</font>

00:53:16,899 --> 00:53:21,649
<font size="36">At first, when my son wasn't chosen, he was very sad, and it pained me too,</font>

1085

1201
00:57:25,499 --> 00:57:27,799
<font size="36">Ah, I want to record it again. Like that.</font>

1202
00:57:29,499 --> 00:57:29,999
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1203
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:31,499
<font size="36">I see.</font>

1204
00:57:33,499 --> 00:57:35,799
<font size="36">Jeon Soo-wan is amazing...!</font>

1205
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,999
<font size="36">Oh, so straightforward.</font>

1206
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:37,999
<font size="36">So straightforward.</font>

1207
00:57:38,999 --> 00:57:39,799
<font size="36">How can my daughter be like that...!</font>

1208
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:41,999
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1209
00:57:41,999 --> 00:57:42,499
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1210
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,890
<font size="36">Her words are even better than mine.</font>

1211
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:47,523
<font size="36">(With Soo-wan's courage,)</font>

1212
00:57:47,999 --> 00:57:50,823
<font size="36">(She finally learned about last night's story)</font>

1213
00:57:51,499 --> 00:57:52,499
<font size="36">That's right, so</font>

1214
00:57:52,999 --> 00:57:53,999
<font size="36">That's why I...</font>

1215
00:57:54,799 --> 00:58:01,499
<font size="36">I put the tape in, thinking that if I sent it, I'd have more chances to talk the next day,</font>

1216
00:58:01,999 --> 00:58:03,999
<font size="36">but today it was divided into teams and it's a bit...</font>

1217
00:58:05,799 --> 00:58:06,499
<font size="36">Anyway...</font>

1218
00:58:07,499 --> 00:58:09,499
<font size="36">Anyway, we can still talk now.</font>

1219
00:58:10,499 --> 00:58:10,999
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1220
00:58:11,799 --> 00:58:12,499
<font size="36">It seems like...</font>

1221
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:12,999
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1222
00:58:14,499 --> 00:58:15,199
<font size="36">Have you made up your mind?</font>

1223
00:58:15,799 --> 00:58:16,199
<font size="36">I</font>

1224
00:58:16,999 --> 00:58:19,956
<font size="36">- I think I'll be able to decide after everything is over.
- Will you be able to decide?</font>

1225
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:20,499
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1226
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:27,999
<font size="36">So, is there anyone you're currently unsure about?</font>

1227
00:58:28,499 --> 00:58:28,999
<font size="36">Like,</font>

1228
00:58:29,499 --> 00:58:29,999
<font size="36">Huh? Huh!</font>

1229
00:58:29,999 --> 00:58:30,199
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

1230
00:58:30,499 --> 00:58:30,999
<font size="36">Ah, ask quickly then.</font>

1231
00:58:33,499 --> 00:58:38,390
<font size="36">So, is there anyone you're currently unsure about?</font>

1232
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:39,199
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1233
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:39,499
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

1234
00:58:40,499 --> 00:58:40,999
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

1235
00:58:41,499 --> 00:58:42,199
<font size="36">Very surprising.</font>

1236
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:43,999
<font size="36">Anyway, a little later,</font>

1237
00:58:43,999 --> 00:58:45,499
<font size="36">I still think there's a direction here.</font>

1238
00:58:45,499 --> 00:58:45,999
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1239
00:58:48,999 --> 00:58:50,499
<font size="36">If I speak honestly,</font>

1240
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:55,499
<font size="36">On the first day, I talked a lot with Shin-hyang.</font>

1241
00:58:55,499 --> 00:58:56,499
<font size="36">Yeah, it seems so.</font>

1242
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:56,999
<font size="36">So,</font>

1243
00:58:56,999 --> 00:58:58,799
<font size="36">Our hobbies also matched very well.</font>

1244
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:02,499
<font size="36">But very quickly, it became like this...</font>

1245
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:04,799
<font size="36">In just 2, 3 days, it was very...</font>

1246
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:08,699
<font size="36">(After meeting you) things seem to have become more complicated.</font>

1247
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:09,799
<font size="36">It seems he spoke in a roundabout way.</font>

1248
00:59:09,999 --> 00:59:10,499
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1249
00:59:12,499 --> 00:59:12,999
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1250
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:14,999
<font size="36">Oh, her face suddenly darkened again.</font>

1251
00:59:20,499 --> 00:59:20,999
<font size="36">What to do.</font>

1252
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:22,799
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1253
00:59:24,499 --> 00:59:29,799
<font size="36">Perhaps because I thought Tak-soo had strong feelings for Shin-hyang, so</font>

1254
00:59:30,999 --> 00:59:36,999
<font size="36">Now Tak-soo seems to have made up his mind a bit before speaking.</font>

1255
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:38,799
<font size="36">This is very easily misunderstood.</font>

1256
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:39,199
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1257
00:59:40,499 --> 00:59:40,999
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1258
00:59:41,799 --> 00:59:42,499
<font size="36">I thought I had him.</font>

1259
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:42,799
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1260
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:48,999
<font size="36">Ah, unfortunately, today's date was so sweet too.</font>

1261
00:59:49,499 --> 00:59:50,799
<font size="36">Hello, hello.</font>

1262
00:59:51,499 --> 00:59:51,999
<font size="36">Just arrived now?</font>

1263
00:59:51,999 --> 00:59:52,999
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1264
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:56,199
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1265
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:56,999
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1266
01:00:01,157 --> 01:00:01,507
<font size="36">First of all...</font>

1267
01:00:01,927 --> 01:00:04,837
<font size="36">Now it's time for everyone to talk in turn, so</font>

1268
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:08,017
<font size="36">I think I'll talk and then make a decision.</font>

1269
01:00:09,027 --> 01:00:09,307
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1270
01:00:10,017 --> 01:00:10,527
<font size="36">What about you?</font>

1271
01:00:16,667 --> 01:00:18,997
<font size="36">Ah, it's hard, like...</font>

1272
01:00:20,327 --> 01:00:20,897
<font size="36">Huh? Huh!</font>

1273
01:00:22,547 --> 01:00:23,627
<font size="36">Ah, you have to say it.</font>

1274
01:00:26,017 --> 01:00:26,617
<font size="36">Hmm...</font>

1275
01:00:33,017 --> 01:00:35,367
<font size="36">I'm a bit worried because it seems I didn't convey it clearly.</font>

1276
01:00:36,017 --> 01:00:38,847
<font size="36">It seems I tried to speak as subtly as possible, but</font>

1277
01:00:39,757 --> 01:00:43,027
<font size="36">I don't think I was able to speak clearly, so</font>

1278
01:00:44,187 --> 01:00:46,487
<font size="36">Is there anyone you're currently unsure about?</font>

1279
01:00:46,637 --> 01:00:47,387
<font size="36">Like,</font>

1280
01:00:47,607 --> 01:00:49,187
<font size="36">A little later, so I still think there's a direction.</font>

1281
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:49,637
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1282
01:00:51,617 --> 01:00:54,597
<font size="36">It seems there's only one specific direction, from my feeling.</font>

1283
01:00:55,327 --> 01:00:56,897
<font size="36">Is it one of those two people first?</font>

1284
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:57,447
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1285
01:00:58,307 --> 01:00:59,423
<font size="36">It'll probably be like that.</font>

1286
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:06,957
<font size="36">So I feel a bit regretful.</font>

1287
01:01:08,407 --> 01:01:12,290
<font size="36">That is, the direction here is 'either Soo-wan or Shin-hyang' but</font>

1288
01:01:12,387 --> 01:01:15,827
<font size="36">Since he said his first meeting with Shin-hyang was good, so</font>

1289
01:01:16,407 --> 01:01:21,187
<font size="36">Soo-wan might think, 'Ah, the direction is already set as Shin-hyang.'</font>

1290
01:01:21,987 --> 01:01:22,687
<font size="36">She might think that, yes.</font>

1291
01:01:22,687 --> 01:01:24,117
<font size="36">Soo-wan misunderstood a bit.</font>

1292
01:01:24,417 --> 01:01:24,687
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1293
01:01:24,937 --> 01:01:26,937
<font size="36">It could be you. Tak-soo said so.</font>

1294
01:01:27,387 --> 01:01:28,487
<font size="36">That's right. That's right.</font>

1295
01:01:29,187 --> 01:01:30,337
<font size="36">It's easy to misunderstand.</font>

1296
01:01:30,657 --> 01:01:30,917
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1297
01:01:34,747 --> 01:01:36,887
<font size="36">I also don't know if I conveyed it accurately, but</font>

1298
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:44,517
<font size="36">Tak-soo, you decide.</font>

1299
01:01:46,477 --> 01:01:46,847
<font size="36">I don't know.</font>

1300
01:01:47,177 --> 01:01:48,487
<font size="36">No one knows what's happening.</font>

1301
01:01:48,647 --> 01:01:49,187
<font size="36">What, it's over?</font>

1302
01:01:49,317 --> 01:01:50,987
<font size="36">Ah, what is this.</font>

1303
01:01:51,187 --> 01:01:52,887
<font size="36">(The second conversation has ended.)</font>

1304
01:01:52,887 --> 01:01:53,887
<font size="36">(Gentlemen, please move to the next location.)</font>

1305
01:01:56,017 --> 01:01:56,657
<font size="36">Anyway...</font>

1306
01:01:57,987 --> 01:01:58,737
<font size="36">Anyway... I'm leaving.</font>

1307
01:02:00,647 --> 01:02:01,297
<font size="36">Go safely.</font>

1308
01:02:01,587 --> 01:02:02,390
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1309
01:02:14,817 --> 01:02:16,787
<font size="36">Ah, what is this. I can't leave like this.</font>

1310
01:02:17,497 --> 01:02:18,737
<font size="36">Ah, this is awkward. So awkward.</font>

1311
01:02:25,037 --> 01:02:26,657
<font size="36">It's like there's nothing left...</font>

1312
01:02:27,117 --> 01:02:31,657
<font size="36">The other person's feelings or other people's gazes don't matter now.</font>

1313
01:02:32,277 --> 01:02:33,877
<font size="36">I have to follow my heart.</font>

1314
01:02:34,027 --> 01:02:36,647
<font size="36">I want to speak clearly before it's too late.</font>

1315
01:02:38,017 --> 01:02:39,287
<font size="36">Oh, this is a good opportunity for Shin-hyang.</font>

1316
01:02:39,287 --> 01:02:41,047
<font size="36">Hey, it's truly dramatic.</font>

1317
01:02:41,047 --> 01:02:41,577
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1318
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:46,367
<font size="36">Ah, what to do.</font>

1319
01:02:47,287 --> 01:02:48,017
<font size="36">Look outside.</font>

1320
01:02:50,017 --> 01:02:52,547
<font size="36">If I said I didn't care, it would probably be a lie,</font>

1321
01:02:53,017 --> 01:02:56,847
<font size="36">It seems I have the most affection for Tak-soo,</font>

1322
01:02:57,027 --> 01:03:00,637
<font size="36">I think it would be better if I showed that a little.</font>

1323
01:03:01,681 --> 01:03:04,189
<font size="36">At the same time,</font>

1324
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:06,833
<font size="36">The two of them made different decisions.</font>

1325
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,833
<font size="36">After talking to the two ladies,</font>

1326
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:15,490
<font size="36">What decision will Tak-soo make?</font>

1327
01:03:17,133 --> 01:03:17,833
<font size="36">Next story</font>

1328
01:03:18,102 --> 01:03:18,872
<font size="36">Why choose?</font>

1329
01:03:19,232 --> 01:03:21,172
<font size="36">At that time, you were the person I was most curious about, so I just...</font>

1330
01:03:21,652 --> 01:03:23,152
<font size="36">Do you feel like it will change?</font>

1331
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:23,562
<font size="36">Me?</font>

1332
01:03:23,692 --> 01:03:23,922
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1333
01:03:23,982 --> 01:03:24,252
<font size="36">Why?</font>

1334
01:03:24,922 --> 01:03:25,722
<font size="36">Hey, Jun-ho is really surprising.</font>

1335
01:03:25,722 --> 01:03:26,292
<font size="36">That's Jun-ho.</font>

1336
01:03:26,722 --> 01:03:27,222
<font size="36">I don't think I can do it.</font>

1337
01:03:28,022 --> 01:03:29,222
<font size="36">I don't want to deliberately obstruct...</font>

1338
01:03:29,982 --> 01:03:30,652
<font size="36">It was very complicated.</font>

1339
01:03:31,082 --> 01:03:33,782
<font size="36">If there's a chance, dating Soo-wan wouldn't be bad either.</font>

1340
01:03:35,182 --> 01:03:36,182
<font size="36">It's a random date day.</font>

1341
01:03:36,952 --> 01:03:39,552
<font size="36">Please move to the date location where your fated man is.</font>

1342
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:40,982
<font size="36">Wow, will it turn out like this?</font>

1343
01:03:41,752 --> 01:03:42,082
<font size="36">Who is it?</font>

1344
01:03:42,282 --> 01:03:43,182
<font size="36">Oh, hey, smile, smile.</font>

1345
01:03:43,682 --> 01:03:44,052
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1346
01:03:44,252 --> 01:03:44,582
<font size="36">Oh my goodness!</font>

1347
01:03:44,712 --> 01:03:44,912
<font size="36">Huh?</font>
