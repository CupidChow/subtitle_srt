155
00:07:03,816 --> 00:07:07,183
<font size="36">She brightly greets someone.</font>

156
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:07,616
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

157
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:09,716
<font size="36">Hello~</font>

158
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:15,449
<font size="36">Sa-yoon's expression says it all!</font>

159
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,666
<font size="36">By the way, do you usually wear glasses?</font>

160
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,949
<font size="36">No, I had laser eye surgery, so I don't need glasses.</font>

161
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:23,016
<font size="36">It's just to look cool.</font>

162
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,649
<font size="36">Ah~ to look cool~?</font>

163
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:26,666
<font size="36">I don't know.</font>

164
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,466
<font size="36">To look smarter.</font>

165
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:27,866
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

166
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:29,583
<font size="36">To look smarter haha.</font>

167
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,466
<font size="36">Yesterday when you wore them, I was surprised.</font>

168
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:32,916
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

169
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:35,316
<font size="36">Because you don't always wear them.</font>

170
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,166
<font size="36">To show off.</font>

171
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:38,666
<font size="36">Ah, it looks cool.</font>

172
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,166
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

173
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,216
<font size="36">Have you sorted things out? How is it?</font>

174
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:46,149
<font size="36">As for me... What about you, Oppa?</font>

175
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:47,183
<font size="36">Me?</font>

176
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,166
<font size="36">If I speak honestly,</font>

177
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,666
<font size="36">Because of Sun-jun's feelings...</font>

178
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,149
<font size="36">Sun-jun?</font>

179
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:55,666
<font size="36">Hm.</font>

180
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,166
<font size="36">So also...</font>

181
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,166
<font size="36">Ah, uh.</font>

182
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,749
<font size="36">Since it was also complicated,</font>

183
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:02,649
<font size="36">There was something,</font>

184
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,116
<font size="36">It was also like that.</font>

185
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,166
<font size="36">Oh, oh, oh.</font>

186
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:11,216
<font size="36">So I didn't act on my own terms.</font>

187
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,166
<font size="36">(Because Sun-jun) has feelings, so I know.</font>

188
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:13,666
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

189
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,666
<font size="36">Ah, that's right. It's getting tangled again.</font>

190
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:15,666
<font size="36">Oh, honestly.</font>

191
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,166
<font size="36">Oh, oh.</font>

192
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:17,666
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

193
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,166
<font size="36">But,</font>

194
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,666
<font size="36">Hm.</font>

195
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,666
<font size="36">After talking,</font>

196
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,166
<font size="36">Everything has been sorted out clearly.</font>

197
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,166
<font size="36">Misunderstandings have also been cleared.</font>

198

<font size="36">(This morning in the LP room)</font>

199
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:34,149
<font size="36">As soon as I saw that message, I decided (to date).</font>

200
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:34,666
<font size="36">As soon as you saw it?</font>

201
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,166
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

202
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:40,166
<font size="36">I think I have to make a decision today.</font>

203
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:46,616
<font size="36">After the double date, I... well, I decided.</font>

204
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:47,666
<font size="36">Ah, really? Oh.</font>

205
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,049
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

206
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:50,316
<font size="36">Hm.</font>

00:08:50,616 --> 00:08:51,983
<font size="36">As for me...</font>

208
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:53,149
<font size="36">Hm, me too.</font>

209
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,116
<font size="36">(The two confirm their feelings for each other)</font>

210
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:58,483
<font size="36">Great~ What more could there be at this point~</font>

211
00:08:58,516 --> 00:08:59,449
<font size="36">Hey, straight to the point?</font>

212
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:00,166
<font size="36">Even more?</font>

213
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:10,750
<font size="36">He suddenly said such confident words, I felt very happy.</font>

214
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:12,416
<font size="36">I am very grateful.</font>

215
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:18,441
<font size="36">When misunderstandings were cleared,
I wanted to be more proactive,</font>

216
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,659
<font size="36">and expressed everything honestly.</font>

217
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,016

219
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,450
<font size="36">What is that?</font>

00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:36,049
<font size="36">Okay.</font>

224
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,480
<font size="36">Morning?</font>

225
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:36,900
<font size="36">What time?</font>

226
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,080
<font size="36">What time?</font>

227
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,360
<font size="36">You'll be sleeping at 4 o'clock.</font>

228
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,749

239
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:18,149

241

<font size="36">Wow.</font>

242
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:25,683

243
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:28,174
<font size="36">Because it's in the middle of the number of days living together,</font>

244
00:10:28,257 --> 00:10:35,431
<font size="36">and I thought it was the last chance for me to decide
my feelings or for there to be a change.</font>

247
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:44,151

248
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:47,681

<font size="36">It feels like being rejected.</font>

308
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,599
<font size="36">Now I find it unreasonable.</font>

309
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:57,399
<font size="36">Ah, seriously.</font>

310
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,199
<font size="36">I think it's like a failed confession, rejected once.</font>

311
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,999
<font size="36">No, Jun-ho took a long time to explore.</font>

312
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:06,399
<font size="36">Director Jeon,</font>

313
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,399
<font size="36">Even when playing basketball,</font>

314
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,599
<font size="36">There are quarters 1, 2 and quarters 3, 4</font>

315
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,799
<font size="36">If everything was said in quarters 1 and 2, what should Jun-ho do?</font>

316
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,399
<font size="36">This isn't quite right, is it?</font>

317
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,249
<font size="36">I, as Shin-hyang's father,</font>

318
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:21,316
<font size="36">Jun-ho is the oldest here, right?</font>

319
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:24,399
<font size="36">I think he treated her very well as an oppa, an older brother.</font>

320
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:29,483
<font size="36">Soo-wan felt comfortable, so she mentioned Tak-soo's name.</font>

321
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,599
<font size="36">She couldn't confess to Tak-soo.</font>

322
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,999
<font size="36">The situation is probably like that.</font>

323
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:35,916
<font size="36">Can none of this comfort me?</font>

324
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:38,799
<font size="36">This shouldn't just end with being a kind oppa.</font>

325
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,399
<font size="36">Jun-ho's father is really too understanding.</font>

326
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:41,999
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

327
00:13:42,283 --> 00:13:44,883
<font size="36">Ah, what did Seok-joo say, Seok-joo?</font>

328
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:49,799
<font size="36">Today, in a way, is right in the middle of our time together.</font>

329
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,999
<font size="36">Hm. How do you feel?</font>

330
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:54,199
<font size="36">First, I'm questioning the MC. Even the question itself.</font>

331
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:58,799
<font size="36">I'm talking to each person, so</font>

332
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,799
<font size="36">Hm.</font>

333
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:04,199
<font size="36">I'm naturally the type of person who needs time.</font>

334
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:04,999
<font size="36">So similar.</font>

335
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:05,399
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

336
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,799
<font size="36">Oh, they're similar.</font>

337
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,399
<font size="36">There's someone here.</font>

338
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,999
<font size="36">Seok-joo, there's Seok-joo.</font>

339
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:11,399
<font size="36">Ah, I'm so amused.</font>

340
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,399
<font size="36">So I have one thing I'm very curious about with you,</font>

341
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,999
<font size="36">At that time, you had just left the crab restaurant, right before leaving the crab restaurant.</font>

342
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:23,199
<font size="36">We should have talked more.</font>

343
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:23,799
<font size="36">Hm.</font>

344
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,199
<font size="36">I regret it so much.</font>

345
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:25,999
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

346
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,199
<font size="36">Oh, really? Were you planning to talk while eating?</font>

347
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:28,999
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

348
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:29,599
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

349
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:30,199
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

350
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:34,399
<font size="36">I really had something to ask, but you said you'd talk about it next time and then left.</font>

351
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,799
<font size="36">Hm. What was it?</font>

352
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:40,599
<font size="36">Actually, it was simply why you chose me.</font>

353
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:40,999
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

354
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:43,199
<font size="36">Because I was surprised.</font>

355
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,799
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

356
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,599
<font size="36">That's right, that's right.</font>

357
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:44,999
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

358
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:46,599
<font size="36">Oh. Hm.</font>

359
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:54,199
<font size="36">And maybe a bit awkward, but I didn't know if it was a one-time thing, a hit-and-run.</font>

360
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:54,999
<font size="36">No way.</font>

361
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:58,799
<font size="36">Ah, I was the first of the four to suggest a date.</font>

362
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,799
<font size="36">Ah, really? Oh.</font>

363
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:00,799
<font size="36">The fastest one.</font>

364
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:01,929
<font size="36">But it's quite surprising, isn't it?</font>

365
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:03,799
<font size="36">As for me, that's exactly right.</font>

366
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:06,799
<font size="36">So I was most curious, and went first.</font>

367
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:07,259
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

368
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,419
<font size="36">Hm.</font>

369
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:09,929
<font size="36">Okay. Hey.</font>

370
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:10,979
<font size="36">That's Jun-ho alright.</font>

371
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:14,283
<font size="36">(A new possibility opening up for the two?)</font>

372
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:15,189
<font size="36">First of all,</font>

373
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,009
<font size="36">It's that.</font>

374
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:17,299
<font size="36">But I also regret that it was</font>

375
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:19,099
<font size="36">Not very clear.</font>

376
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,099
<font size="36">That's all.</font>

377
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:21,189
<font size="36">What</font>

378
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:21,629
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

379
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:21,889
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

380
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:22,649
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

381
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:27,359
<font size="36">Anyway, there was a slight flutter due to awkwardness.</font>

382
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,129
<font size="36">But that awkward flutter</font>

383
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:30,009
<font size="36">Was a bit,</font>

384
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,429
<font size="36">Ah, I don't know if it's a flutter because of that person.</font>

385
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,529
<font size="36">There was a bit of such confusion, fluctuation.</font>

386
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:36,089
<font size="36">But now it seems like</font>

387
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:37,399
<font size="36">This fluctuation has turned into</font>

388
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:40,019
<font size="36">A feeling of being enveloped by friendship?</font>

389
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:40,689
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

390
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,539
<font size="36">Hm.</font>

391
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,299
<font size="36">So,</font>

392
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:43,459
<font size="36">A bit, ah, that's right,</font>

393
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:47,983
<font size="36">It's been reset. Completely.</font>

394
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:49,009
<font size="36">That</font>

395
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:51,969
<font size="36">It feels like returning to a state of nothingness?</font>

396
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:54,249
<font size="36">Something like that.</font>

397
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:54,889
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

398
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,889
<font size="36">Oh? What is it?</font>

399
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,609
<font size="36">According to oppa, everything has been reset today.</font>

400
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:03,019
<font size="36">So what does that mean?</font>

401
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:07,869
<font size="36">Ah, what does that mean? What does reset mean?</font>

402
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:09,359
<font size="36">Are you going to start over?</font>

403
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:09,619
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

404
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:10,009
<font size="36">What now?</font>

405
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,129
<font size="36">Many people have already decided on their feelings.</font>

406
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:13,983
<font size="36">I don't know that either.</font>

407
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:17,750
<font size="36">It's still not clear who Jun-ho is interested in. I haven't seen it.</font>

408
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:18,716
<font size="36">Really?</font>

409
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:20,249
<font size="36">I'm also confused.</font>

410
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:21,783
<font size="36">My thoughts are getting more complicated.</font>

411
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:24,929
<font size="36">Seok-joo also seems to be getting complicated.</font>

412
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,399
<font size="36">Oh my. Yes.</font>

413
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:29,283
<font size="36">(The conversation time has ended)</font>

414
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,099
<font size="36">They said we have to go.</font>

415
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:31,819
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

416
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:33,009
<font size="36">Go on in.</font>

417
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:35,009
<font size="36">Goodbye.</font>

418
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:35,359
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

419
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,989
<font size="36">There wasn't much time to talk here either.</font>

420
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,416
<font size="36">I don't think I was able to talk enough.</font>

421
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:47,099
<font size="36">So, even if it's not the allotted time,</font>

422
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:49,629
<font size="36">I want to talk privately during free time.</font>

423
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:50,889
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

424
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:52,459
<font size="36">Alright, give it a try.</font>

425
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:52,809
<font size="36">Alright.</font>

426
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:53,829
<font size="36">We have to talk.</font>

427
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:56,299
<font size="36">(And another person has entered Seok-joo's heart)</font>

428
00:16:56,719 --> 00:17:00,589
<font size="36">Yes, I started to become curious and interested in Sun-jun.</font>

429
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:02,629
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

430
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:03,199
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

431
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,083
<font size="36">Sun-jun?</font>

432
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,239
<font size="36">Although it wasn't an action directed at me,</font>

433
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:11,399
<font size="36">But when I heard about his actions and how he treated Sa-yoon,</font>

434
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:14,569
<font size="36">I felt that person was very gentle,</font>

435
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:16,779
<font size="36">Oh, I'm a little curious.</font>

436
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:20,739
<font size="36">Because I really think gentleness is a great strength.</font>

437
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:21,329
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

438
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:22,799
<font size="36">Wow, you have to find someone as sincere and gentle as that.</font>

439
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,559
<font size="36">Wow, Seok-joo recognized that sincerity.</font>

440
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,009
<font size="36">Hm.</font>

441
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:26,579
<font size="36">Ah, that's</font>

442
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,899
<font size="36">Seok-joo has good judgment.</font>

443
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:30,399
<font size="36">Seok-joo is very good. Broad vision.</font>

444
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:30,649
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

445
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:35,099
<font size="36">How well Seok-joo nuna listened,</font>

446
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:38,949
<font size="36">And made me feel comfortable,</font>

447
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:41,599
<font size="36">She's sunshine.</font>

448
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,699
<font size="36">She's the sunshine of spring.</font>

449
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:45,599
<font size="36">Sunshine everywhere. Everywhere.</font>

450
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,599
<font size="36">I'm very grateful that she tried to lead everything so brightly.</font>

451
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:55,699
<font size="36">So I thought I wanted to talk even more.</font>

452
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:05,183
<font size="36">Sun-jun is carrying something.</font>

453
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:08,416
<font size="36">He's carrying something.</font>

454
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:09,133
<font size="36">Oh, what is it?</font>

455
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,549
<font size="36">(Hidden behind his back)</font>

456
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,549
<font size="36">Welcome ~</font>

457
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:16,816
<font size="36">I brought a gift.</font>

458
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,449
<font size="36">Oh? Suddenly?</font>

459

915
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:45,506
<font size="36">I think the past times were not in vain, and someone recognized me.</font>

916
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:48,706
<font size="36">Seok-joo.</font>

917
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:49,506
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

918
00:38:50,506 --> 00:38:52,049
<font size="36">[Glancing]</font>

919
00:38:54,183 --> 00:38:56,350
<font size="36">[Smug (?)]</font>

920
00:38:56,906 --> 00:38:59,183
<font size="36">Oh~ Sun-jun feels quite confident.</font>

921
00:38:59,516 --> 00:39:01,749
<font size="36">Sun-jun changed after receiving the tape (?)</font>

922
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:03,181
<font size="36">Did you see, nuna? Did you see, nuna?</font>

923
00:39:03,181 --> 00:39:03,983
<font size="36">It's not like before now.</font>

924
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:05,271
<font size="36">There's confidence now.</font>

925
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:06,430
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

926
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,540
<font size="36">Dad, that's your moved expression.</font>

927
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,080
<font size="36">Yes, yes.</font>

928
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:10,510
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

929
00:39:10,939 --> 00:39:15,539
<font size="36">I was very worried inside.</font>

930
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:21,559
<font size="36">I thought if I would finish this show without receiving any tape.</font>

931
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:28,249
<font size="36">I feel this feeling is like when I made food and received my first order.</font>

932
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:28,613
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

933
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:33,213
<font size="36">Ah. Today my heart was pounding, that's exactly the feeling.</font>

934
00:39:33,213 --> 00:39:34,043
<font size="36">Ah, that kind of fluttery feeling.</font>

935
00:39:34,553 --> 00:39:35,393
<font size="36">Yeah, a fluttery feeling.</font>

936
00:39:35,783 --> 00:39:36,273
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

937
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:41,883
<font size="36">Hey, finally Sun-jun received a tape, and the recipient was Seok-joo.</font>

938
00:39:41,883 --> 00:39:42,172
<font size="36">Seok-joo.</font>

939
00:40:11,183 --> 00:40:11,412
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

940
00:40:15,443 --> 00:40:16,162
<font size="36">Ah, her expression...</font>

941
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:17,712
<font size="36">Oh, how complicated.</font>

942
00:40:20,323 --> 00:40:21,393
<font size="36">Tak-soo must be suffering a lot too.</font>

943
00:40:21,393 --> 00:40:21,782
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

944
00:40:22,032 --> 00:40:22,333
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

945
00:40:22,562 --> 00:40:24,242
<font size="36">Someone has to get hurt.</font>

946
00:40:24,242 --> 00:40:24,833
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

947
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:25,232
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

948
00:40:29,632 --> 00:40:31,072
<font size="36">At first, it was very fun.</font>

949
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:34,249
<font size="36">At first, it was like, “Huh, what is this? There are two people?”, but then...</font>

950
00:40:34,283 --> 00:40:38,813
<font size="36">Gradually, as time passed, it turned out like this.</font>

951
00:40:39,712 --> 00:40:41,613
<font size="36">Anyway, I have to choose one person.</font>

952
00:40:42,363 --> 00:40:54,822
<font size="36">Actually, my feelings are what matter here, but this situation makes me think more about the feelings and positions of others than my own.</font>

953
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:59,223
<font size="36">So it's a bit difficult.</font>

954
00:41:00,072 --> 00:41:03,783
<font size="36">I also don't know what's right, nor what to prioritize.</font>

955
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:05,733
<font size="36">Yeah, he must be in a lot of pain.</font>

956
00:41:06,253 --> 00:41:06,563
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

957
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:08,333
<font size="36">(My son must be having a hard time)</font>

958
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:10,262
<font size="36">Seriously, oh, I'm so tired.</font>

959
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:11,753
<font size="36">Ah, dad is tired too.</font>

960
00:41:11,753 --> 00:41:12,882
<font size="36">Yeah, it's really tiring.</font>

961
00:41:12,882 --> 00:41:13,503
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

962
00:41:21,572 --> 00:41:28,233
<font size="36">Today, when talking 1:1, I was happy because I could speak a bit more honestly.</font>

963
00:41:29,992 --> 00:41:35,762
<font size="36">Um, so I also want to talk more in the remaining days.</font>

964
00:41:36,993 --> 00:41:38,322
<font size="36">Speak a bit longer, Soo-wan.</font>

965
00:41:38,322 --> 00:41:38,822
<font size="36">No.</font>

966
00:41:38,822 --> 00:41:39,033
<font size="36">No way.</font>

967
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:40,332
<font size="36">No, even brief words conveyed everything.</font>

968
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:40,632
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

969
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:41,802
<font size="36">The meaning is still intact.</font>

970
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:05,683
<font size="36">Hello. Do you know who I am?</font>

971
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:08,733
<font size="36">Um...</font>

972
00:42:12,441 --> 00:42:13,633
<font size="36">It's just that</font>

973
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:16,100
<font size="36">I have always been,</font>

974
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:19,633
<font size="36">My feelings have never changed and have always been certain.</font>

975
00:42:19,941 --> 00:42:20,301
<font size="36">Um.</font>

976
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,110
<font size="36">Ah...</font>

977
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,450
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

978
00:42:27,551 --> 00:42:29,921
<font size="36">I hope we continue to be close in the future.</font>

979
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:37,349
<font size="36">I need to be bold too. Goodbye.</font>

980
00:42:37,841 --> 00:42:38,480
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

981
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,091
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

982
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,050
<font size="36">Hey, she's really strong. Shin-hyang is really strong.</font>

983
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,250
<font size="36">Shin-hyang,</font>

984
00:42:49,661 --> 00:42:55,091
<font size="36">On that tape, next to my name, she wrote 'Idiot.' She even joked like that.</font>

985
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:58,940
<font size="36">I felt that kind of 'Will you choose me too?'</font>

986
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:01,970
<font size="36">When listening to Soo-wan's tape,</font>

987
00:43:02,851 --> 00:43:06,283
<font size="36">I saw she tried her best not to pressure me.</font>

988
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:12,683
<font size="36">I sensed that nuance of not pressuring but still wanting to convey her feelings.</font>

989
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:13,691
<font size="36">Ah. Oh.</font>

990
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,101
<font size="36">The atmosphere of the two is completely different.</font>

991
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:17,991
<font size="36">Completely different.</font>

992
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,450
<font size="36">This is important.</font>

993
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,961
<font size="36">This is important. If Tak-soo feels that way,</font>

994
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,001
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

995
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,870
<font size="36">Oh. Where will the feelings go?</font>

996
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:26,810
<font size="36">So curious.</font>

997
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:28,961
<font size="36">If there are many people, the heart will lean towards the more proactive person.</font>

998
00:43:29,351 --> 00:43:30,351
<font size="36">Ah, that's right. Anyway, it could be like that.</font>

999
00:43:30,751 --> 00:43:31,090
<font size="36">It could be.</font>

1000
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,010
<font size="36">I'm the opposite.</font>

1001
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:34,961
<font size="36">I'm the opposite.</font>

1002
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:37,251
<font size="36">I'm the opposite.</font>

1003
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:42,616
<font size="36">If I were Tak-soo, if someone proactively approached, I would feel a bit uncomfortable.</font>

1004
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:45,001
<font size="36">That's Soo-wan's dad's thought.</font>

1005
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,491
<font size="36">Ah, that's right, that's my thought, my thought.</font>

1006
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:52,090
<font size="36">But it's really uncomfortable.</font>

1007
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:53,851
<font size="36">Me, I...</font>

1008
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:56,010
<font size="36">Difficult. If it's like that, men will find it difficult.</font>

1009
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,051
<font size="36">I think Director Jeong's words also make sense.</font>

1010
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,051
<font size="36">(Difficult x3)</font>

1011
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,241
<font size="36">Do you know what I really liked about Shin-hyang when watching this scene?</font>

1012
00:44:02,521 --> 00:44:04,961
<font size="36">Ah, so hard~! Ah, just thinking about it makes it hard. My head wants to explode.</font>

1013
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:12,116
<font size="36">- Actually, Soo-wan was already very brave.
- That's right, that's right.</font>

1014
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,883
<font size="36">Ah, that's already very brave.</font>

1015
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,921
<font size="36">There are still two days left. Let's talk more.</font>

1016
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:18,090
<font size="36">She was already brave.</font>

1017
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:19,940
<font size="36">Both of them were brave.</font>

1018
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:20,641
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1019
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,720
<font size="36">Now only Tak-soo needs to be brave.</font>

1020
00:44:30,761 --> 00:44:32,761
<font size="36">Now we can see the direction. It's somewhere.</font>

1021
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,840
<font size="36">Oh. Did Soo-wan run away?</font>

1022
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,316
<font size="36">I think Tak-soo sent it to Shin-hyang.</font>

1023
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:53,090
<font size="36">My feelings for Tak-soo are growing stronger and more certain, but the fear of not having that tape? It's much less.</font>

1024
00:44:53,511 --> 00:44:53,991
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1025
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,216
<font size="36">One of the two won't have it.</font>

1026
00:45:09,218 --> 00:45:09,658
<font size="36">Ah, that's right.</font>

1027
00:45:10,048 --> 00:45:11,228
<font size="36">Not looking anymore. Not looking anymore.</font>

1028
00:45:11,618 --> 00:45:12,038
<font size="36">Oh my.</font>

1029
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,008
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1030
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:16,128
<font size="36">Who is it?</font>

1031
00:45:21,998 --> 00:45:23,749
<font size="36">Ah! Ah, it's Shin-hyang.</font>

1032
00:45:23,878 --> 00:45:25,368
<font size="36">There's a tape in Shin-hyang's locker.</font>

1033
00:45:41,288 --> 00:45:44,116
<font size="36">Now...</font>

1034
00:45:49,348 --> 00:45:55,248
<font size="36">We've talked a lot about hobbies and such already,</font>

1035
00:45:56,098 --> 00:46:09,368
<font size="36">Let's talk more deeply about what we haven't finished discussing yet.</font>

1036
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,083
<font size="36">Goodbye.</font>

1037
00:46:16,628 --> 00:46:18,716
<font size="36">There's no 'nuna' feeling anymore. It's been erased.</font>

1038
00:46:18,878 --> 00:46:19,838
<font size="36">Ah, he saw that.</font>

1039
00:46:20,118 --> 00:46:20,788
<font size="36">I saw that too.</font>

1040
00:46:23,218 --> 00:46:24,228
<font size="36">I'm really happy.</font>

1041
00:46:28,628 --> 00:46:30,618
<font size="36">Until we talked 1:1,</font>

1042
00:46:30,618 --> 00:46:34,188
<font size="36">Of course, I felt like I had opened up a lot,</font>

1043
00:46:34,938 --> 00:46:38,948
<font size="36">But Tak-soo's feelings were still vague. However,</font>

1044
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:41,038
<font size="36">As soon as I heard the content of that tape,</font>

1045
00:46:41,538 --> 00:46:51,278
<font size="36">I felt hopeful that if I continue to convey my sincerity, this friend will also continue to open up.</font>

1046
00:46:51,928 --> 00:46:52,788
<font size="36">Hey, this worked.</font>

1047
00:46:53,108 --> 00:46:54,418
<font size="36">Even though it was that certain,</font>

1048
00:46:54,418 --> 00:46:55,298
<font size="36">Yes. It happened once.</font>

1049
00:46:55,778 --> 00:46:57,588
<font size="36">Ah, creating certainty can also be important.</font>

1050
00:46:57,588 --> 00:46:58,248
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1051
00:46:58,818 --> 00:46:59,078
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1052
00:47:00,633 --> 00:47:05,950
<font size="36">Like the first day,
The two chose each other again.</font>

1053
00:47:09,998 --> 00:47:10,418
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1054
00:47:10,818 --> 00:47:12,168
<font size="36">Relaxed, relaxed.</font>

1055
00:47:12,678 --> 00:47:12,898
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1056
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:14,108
<font size="36">Look at that expression.</font>

1057
00:47:16,528 --> 00:47:19,218
<font size="36">I know Shin-hyang is three years older than Tak-soo,</font>

1058
00:47:20,048 --> 00:47:24,348
<font size="36">How can Tak-soo overcome the age gap and treat Shin-hyang like that?</font>

1059
00:47:24,658 --> 00:47:27,318
<font size="36">Ah, Park Ho San grasped that exactly. Right?</font>

1060
00:47:28,238 --> 00:47:28,758
<font size="36">Speaking informally.</font>

1061
00:47:29,048 --> 00:47:30,878
<font size="36">Yes. The 'nuna' feeling has been erased.</font>

1064
00:47:38,748 --> 00:47:42,358

1213
00:55:16,173 --> 00:55:18,473

1215

1217

1239
00:56:17,473 --> 00:56:17,973

1247
00:56:35,973 --> 00:56:37,273

1248

1355
01:02:09,606 --> 01:02:10,506
<font size="36">Oh, sure.</font>

1356
01:02:10,506 --> 01:02:10,706
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1357
01:02:14,006 --> 01:02:14,506
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1358
01:02:14,506 --> 01:02:15,406
<font size="36">Whoa.</font>

1359
01:02:16,906 --> 01:02:17,906
<font size="36">This is the first time sitting here, isn't it?</font>

1360
01:02:17,906 --> 01:02:18,206
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1361
01:02:27,706 --> 01:02:29,406
<font size="36">He has to make the final choice, after all.</font>

1362
01:02:29,406 --> 01:02:29,706
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1363
01:02:30,406 --> 01:02:36,106
<font size="36">So, wouldn't it be more careful to talk to both of them and then make a choice?</font>

1364
01:02:36,306 --> 01:02:36,806
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1365
01:02:37,706 --> 01:02:40,906
<font size="36">Because of those thoughts, I wanted to talk.</font>

1366
01:02:42,406 --> 01:02:42,906
<font size="36">Why?</font>

1367
01:02:44,006 --> 01:02:49,506
<font size="36">I always chose the tape for only one person.</font>

1368
01:02:50,306 --> 01:02:55,706
<font size="36">But there are two cassette tapes in my locker.</font>

1369
01:02:55,706 --> 01:02:56,006
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1370
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:59,606
<font size="36">I don't know how to react.</font>

1371
01:02:59,606 --> 01:03:00,006
<font size="36">Um.</font>

1372
01:03:00,506 --> 01:03:02,306
<font size="36">Tak-soo is being cautious.</font>

1373
01:03:03,306 --> 01:03:04,406
<font size="36">Tak-soo must be having a hard time.</font>

1374
01:03:05,906 --> 01:03:11,006
<font size="36">On the first day, he chose nuna, but on the second day, he wanted to talk to Soo-wan, so he chose her.</font>

1375
01:03:12,896 --> 01:03:15,883
<font size="36">If you look at it a certain way, I could be seen as fickle.</font>

1376
01:03:15,983 --> 01:03:17,383
<font size="36">But that's not it.</font>

1377
01:03:17,526 --> 01:03:19,206
<font size="36">But I think it probably is.</font>

1378
01:03:19,706 --> 01:03:20,386
<font size="36">If I were...</font>

1379
01:03:20,876 --> 01:03:23,586
<font size="36">Nuna said she would only look at one person when dating.</font>

1380
01:03:25,006 --> 01:03:27,726
<font size="36">So if you look at it from that person's perspective,</font>

1381
01:03:28,126 --> 01:03:31,346
<font size="36">I don't think they'd be happy.</font>

1382
01:03:31,756 --> 01:03:33,376
<font size="36">Even if I were in that situation.</font>

1383
01:03:33,756 --> 01:03:34,086
<font size="36">Really?</font>

1384
01:03:34,336 --> 01:03:34,466
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1385
01:03:34,756 --> 01:03:39,583
<font size="36">It seems you've also been agonizing over it.</font>

1386
01:03:39,706 --> 01:03:41,756
<font size="36">When we're together, I don't know what to do.</font>

1387
01:03:42,156 --> 01:03:42,556
<font size="36">I don't know.</font>

1388
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:43,585
<font size="36">Oh, that's right.</font>

1389
01:03:43,955 --> 01:03:45,545
<font size="36">That's right. Because they hear and see everything.</font>

1390
01:03:47,516 --> 01:03:50,546
<font size="36">I also want you to get to know all the other people.</font>

1391
01:03:51,196 --> 01:03:54,586
<font size="36">That, for both you and me,</font>

1392
01:03:55,636 --> 01:03:56,906
<font size="36">Is the right thing to do.</font>

1393
01:03:57,906 --> 01:04:00,266
<font size="36">You don't just stay with me,</font>

1394
01:04:01,056 --> 01:04:02,756
<font size="36">After you've gotten to know everyone else,</font>

1395
01:04:03,476 --> 01:04:04,576
<font size="36">Whoever you choose,</font>

1396
01:04:05,006 --> 01:04:06,506
<font size="36">That's the...</font>

1397
01:04:08,006 --> 01:04:10,256
<font size="36">Anyway, I think that's respect.</font>

1398
01:04:10,676 --> 01:04:11,076
<font size="36">Um...</font>

1399
01:04:11,406 --> 01:04:13,636
<font size="36">That's right, what you're doing could actually be...</font>

1400
01:04:14,276 --> 01:04:14,486
<font size="36">Um.</font>

1401
01:04:15,165 --> 01:04:16,665
<font size="36">That's right, that's right. She read him completely.</font>

1402
01:04:17,035 --> 01:04:17,965
<font size="36">Then Tak-soo will feel more relieved.</font>

1403
01:04:18,215 --> 01:04:18,445
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1404
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:18,895
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1405
01:04:19,435 --> 01:04:20,995
<font size="36">It's like being understood.</font>

1406
01:04:21,455 --> 01:04:23,995
<font size="36">It could also be because she's that confident.</font>

1407
01:04:24,325 --> 01:04:24,555
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1408
01:04:25,095 --> 01:04:25,325
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1409
01:04:26,505 --> 01:04:26,755
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1410
01:04:28,606 --> 01:04:29,286
<font size="36">That, however,</font>

1411
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:31,006
<font size="36">But when I gave the tape yesterday,</font>

1412
01:04:32,106 --> 01:04:32,976
<font size="36">The most important thing,</font>

1413
01:04:34,556 --> 01:04:35,636
<font size="36">The most important thing in my heart was,</font>

1414
01:04:36,116 --> 01:04:37,166
<font size="36">I think it was nuna.</font>

1415
01:04:38,756 --> 01:04:39,906
<font size="36">So I made that decision.</font>

1416
01:04:43,756 --> 01:04:45,586
<font size="36">“But it's not (finally) decided yet”</font>

1417
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:48,449
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

1418
01:04:55,276 --> 01:04:57,096
<font size="36">That's right...</font>

1419
01:04:58,216 --> 01:04:59,626
<font size="36">Honestly, if I...</font>

1420
01:05:01,066 --> 01:05:02,146
<font size="36">Talked more with Soo-wan,</font>

1421
01:05:09,006 --> 01:05:11,716
<font size="36">“Could it change...?”</font>

1422
01:05:12,445 --> 01:05:13,683
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1423
01:05:15,365 --> 01:05:16,345
<font size="36">Such dangerous words.</font>

1424
01:05:16,895 --> 01:05:19,095
<font size="36">Yes. Hey, could it change, it could change. Oh.</font>

1425
01:05:20,035 --> 01:05:21,983
<font size="36">It could change right now.</font>

1426
01:05:24,099 --> 01:05:27,849
<font size="36">(A variable has arisen)</font>

1427
01:05:29,286 --> 01:05:32,706
<font size="36">But anyway, honestly,</font>

1428
01:05:34,086 --> 01:05:36,549
<font size="36">Because I haven't talked much with Soo-wan,</font>

1429
01:05:36,726 --> 01:05:38,116
<font size="36">Are you regretting it?</font>

1430
01:05:43,246 --> 01:05:44,046
<font size="36">If today...</font>

1431
01:05:45,016 --> 01:05:47,749
<font size="36">Had a chance for a date,</font>

1432
01:05:48,756 --> 01:05:52,149
<font size="36">“Dating Soo-wan wouldn't be bad either”</font>

1433
01:05:53,195 --> 01:05:53,395
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1434
01:05:53,725 --> 01:05:54,565
<font size="36">Ah, how generous.</font>

1435
01:05:55,295 --> 01:05:56,816
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

1436
01:05:57,695 --> 01:05:59,345
<font size="36">Those words, were they sincere?</font>

1437
01:06:00,595 --> 01:06:03,283
<font size="36">Oh, I don't know if they were sincere.</font>

1438
01:06:08,769 --> 01:06:09,583
<font size="36">Um.</font>

1439
01:06:09,919 --> 01:06:11,369
<font size="36">I think you should talk.</font>

1440
01:06:13,059 --> 01:06:15,549
<font size="36">You, that...</font>

1441
01:06:15,589 --> 01:06:18,049
<font size="36">I think you need to clear that up.</font>

1442
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:22,016
<font size="36">Ah, my head hurts.</font>

1443
01:06:22,989 --> 01:06:25,816
<font size="36">No need for a headache. That's the right thing to do.</font>

1444
01:06:28,839 --> 01:06:29,716
<font size="36">Let's go talk.</font>

1445
01:06:29,816 --> 01:06:30,583
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1446
01:06:30,683 --> 01:06:31,849
<font size="36">(Shin-hyang gave Tak-soo a chance to talk to Soo-wan)</font>

1447
01:06:31,959 --> 01:06:33,289
<font size="36">Was it right for Shin-hyang to do that?</font>

1448
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:34,639
<font size="36">I think it was right.</font>

1449
01:06:35,299 --> 01:06:37,559
<font size="36">No, no! Not me.</font>

1450
01:06:37,979 --> 01:06:38,629
<font size="36">Why? Why?</font>

1451
01:06:38,939 --> 01:06:39,259
<font size="36">Isn't it?</font>

1452
01:06:39,259 --> 01:06:43,339
<font size="36">It seems like if I just let go, I'll...</font>

1453
01:06:43,999 --> 01:06:44,729
<font size="36">Fly away?</font>

1454
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:49,739
<font size="36">Because now, meeting this person, meeting that person. Yes, it could be like that. To say...</font>

1455
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,849
<font size="36">Actually, I feel like I don't have much time myself.</font>

1456
01:06:51,849 --> 01:06:52,479
<font size="36">Ah, that's right, that's right.</font>

1457
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:53,909
<font size="36">So accurate.</font>

1458
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:55,639
<font size="36">Too accurate. He has to stay put here.</font>

1459
01:06:55,939 --> 01:06:56,259
<font size="36">And,</font>

1460
01:06:56,529 --> 01:06:58,149
<font size="36">The 'nuna' way of addressing her is starting to appear again.</font>

1461
01:06:59,259 --> 01:07:00,879
<font size="36">Ah, that's right. 'Nuna' is appearing again.</font>

1462
01:07:00,879 --> 01:07:01,279
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1463
01:07:01,516 --> 01:07:02,149
<font size="36">That's right...</font>

1464
01:07:02,169 --> 01:07:03,199
<font size="36">Tak-soo just needs to look at that.</font>

1465
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:03,629
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1466
01:07:03,999 --> 01:07:07,099
<font size="36">Whether to call Shin-hyang 'nuna' or to drop 'nuna' and talk,</font>

1467
01:07:07,099 --> 01:07:07,529
<font size="36">That's right. That's right.</font>

1468
01:07:07,529 --> 01:07:09,416
<font size="36">'Nuna' appeared again.</font>

1469
01:07:09,739 --> 01:07:10,469
<font size="36">Yes, Dad.</font>

1470
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:12,539
<font size="36">I think he's thinking very carefully.</font>

1471
01:07:13,059 --> 01:07:14,083
<font size="36">But me, I...</font>

1472
01:07:14,269 --> 01:07:18,389
<font size="36">I understand Tak-soo's heart, and I also understand Jong Hyuk's heart,</font>

1473
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,019
<font size="36">If Tak-soo changes again here,</font>

1474
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:21,559
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1475
01:07:22,009 --> 01:07:22,489
<font size="36">The name...</font>

1476
01:07:23,069 --> 01:07:24,849
<font size="36">Shouldn't it be changed from Tak-soo to Byun Su (Variable)?</font>

1477
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:27,349
<font size="36">Lee Byun Su (Variable Lee).</font>

1478
01:07:27,709 --> 01:07:29,759
<font size="36">Why does he change so often?</font>

1479
01:07:29,759 --> 01:07:29,959
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1480
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:32,739
<font size="36">I, I really...</font>

1481
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:33,959
<font size="36">Changes again here?</font>

1482
01:07:33,959 --> 01:07:34,259
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1483
01:07:34,939 --> 01:07:36,983
<font size="36">I'll call him Byun Su (Variable).</font>

1484
01:07:37,059 --> 01:07:39,649
<font size="36">Lee Byun Su. Change. Variable.</font>

1485
01:07:39,699 --> 01:07:42,499
<font size="36">He's speaking on behalf of his daughter right now.</font>

1486
01:07:43,069 --> 01:07:43,939
<font size="36">Tak-soo's variable.</font>

1487
01:07:44,669 --> 01:07:46,539
<font size="36">Seriously, Se Baek Seong hyung speaks so well.
(Se Baek Seong - Strong Person)</font>

1488
01:07:47,539 --> 01:07:49,639
<font size="36">Ah, Lee Cheol Min -> Se Baek Seong. Yes.</font>

1489
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:52,939
<font size="36">Lee Byun Su appears, so Se Baek Seong, yes, Lee Cheol Min. Yes.</font>

1490
01:07:52,939 --> 01:07:53,639
<font size="36">Ah, I'm sorry.</font>

1491
01:07:53,759 --> 01:07:54,309
<font size="36">I'm sorry.</font>

1492
01:07:54,309 --> 01:07:56,339
<font size="36">Se Baek Seong. I like it. It's okay.</font>

1493
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:56,759
<font size="36">Se Baek Seong.</font>

1494
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:57,939
<font size="36">He's being cautious.</font>

1495
01:07:58,139 --> 01:07:59,516
<font size="36">- My son is being cautious.
- Ah, of course.</font>

1496
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:03,039
<font size="36">Because he cares about everyone, he doesn't want anyone to get hurt.</font>

1497
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:03,539
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1498
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:04,239
<font size="36">Therefore,</font>

1499
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:07,283
<font size="36">Anyway, it's a variable situation, why is it a variable name?</font>

1500
01:08:07,439 --> 01:08:09,739
<font size="36">Yes, ah, hey, it's so hard. So hard.</font>

1501
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:12,239

- No.</font>

1674
01:15:20,407 --> 01:15:22,849

1675
01:15:22,949 --> 01:15:24,649
<font size="36">Would Shin-hyang stay quiet?</font>

1676
01:15:24,707 --> 01:15:25,683
<font size="36">What is this?</font>

1677
01:15:26,707 --> 01:15:27,983
<font size="36">Shall we open them at the same time?</font>

1678
01:15:29,707 --> 01:15:30,816
<font size="36">Surfing?</font>

1679
01:15:32,807 --> 01:15:33,916
<font size="36">Movie theater.</font>

1680
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:37,583

01:15:50,407 --> 01:15:51,183
<font size="36">How did you do it?</font>

1686
01:15:51,207 --> 01:15:51,607
<font size="36">Me?</font>

1687
01:15:51,607 --> 01:15:52,716
<font size="36">I don't know either.</font>

1688
01:15:53,207 --> 01:15:54,216
<font size="36">Don't know, just came?</font>

1689
01:15:54,607 --> 01:15:55,749
<font size="36">Isn't that one pretty?</font>

1690
01:15:56,007 --> 01:15:57,007
<font size="36">The weather is perfectly beautiful, isn't it?</font>

1691
01:15:57,507 --> 01:15:59,549
<font size="36">We drew lots randomly like this.</font>

1692
01:15:59,607 --> 01:16:00,283
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1693
01:16:00,416 --> 01:16:05,216
<font size="36">What will happen to them?</font>

1694
01:16:05,316 --> 01:16:06,607
<font size="36">I thought so too.</font>

1695
01:16:07,107 --> 01:16:10,207
<font size="36">From the beginning, I still feel the same about oppa now.</font>

1696
01:16:10,407 --> 01:16:11,207
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1697
01:16:11,907 --> 01:16:13,616
<font size="36">Look at Lee Tak-soo's phone case.</font>

1698
01:16:14,007 --> 01:16:14,907
<font size="36">The one Soo-wan made for him.</font>

1699
01:16:14,907 --> 01:16:16,207
<font size="36">He must be very happy.</font>

1700
01:16:17,207 --> 01:16:18,707
<font size="36">Now we will start the game of truth.</font>

1701
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:19,307
<font size="36">How will it be done?</font>

1702
01:16:19,907 --> 01:16:20,407
<font size="36">Rank 1, 2</font>

1703
01:16:20,707 --> 01:16:22,907
<font size="36">The two ranked 1st and 2nd, not in order.</font>

1704
01:16:23,607 --> 01:16:24,407
<font size="36">I'm Tak-soo.</font>

1705
01:16:25,007 --> 01:16:26,549
<font size="36">And there's no one else left.</font>

1706
01:16:26,907 --> 01:16:27,649
<font size="36">What will I do?</font>

1707
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,016
<font size="36">Is it decided?</font>

1708
01:16:29,116 --> 01:16:29,907
<font size="36">Um, yeah.</font>

1709
01:16:30,107 --> 01:16:31,207
<font size="36">I will ask Tak-soo.</font>

1710
01:16:31,407 --> 01:16:32,407
<font size="36">Wow, asking like this?</font>
