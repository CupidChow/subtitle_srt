43

<font size="36">This tall.</font>

44
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:57,518
<font size="36">Ah, that's why you always wear flats.</font>

45
00:01:58,287 --> 00:02:00,018
<font size="36">They're all low shoes. Even the high heels are low.</font>

46
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:01,787
<font size="36">I think this height is just right.</font>

47
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:04,888
<font size="36">If I wore even taller shoes, I'd feel a bit awkward myself...</font>

<font size="36">It's really fun.</font>

154
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:18,733
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

155
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:19,733
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

156
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:20,533
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

157
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:22,943
<font size="36">Ah, do I have to keep watching this?</font>

158
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:24,443
<font size="36">Ah, I really...</font>

159
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:26,173
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

160
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:28,913
<font size="36">Talking definitely makes a difference.</font>

161
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:33,673
<font size="36">Uh, I feel something very new</font>

162
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:34,873
<font size="36">has emerged.</font>

163
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:37,653
<font size="36">I thought she was very shy,</font>

164
00:06:38,203 --> 00:06:39,953
<font size="36">would be a bit awkward,</font>

165
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:42,013
<font size="36">but after talking for a bit,</font>

166
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,453
<font size="36">from the moment we started speaking informally, I felt very comfortable.</font>

167
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:45,803
<font size="36">I also found it very strange.</font>

168
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,823
<font size="36">Much more comfortable than I thought.</font>

169
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,302
<font size="36">Hobbies and such didn't match as well as with Shin-hyang,</font>

170
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:53,863
<font size="36">but I still felt very comfortable.</font>

171
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:58,813
<font size="36">The two quickly became close.</font>

172
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:00,643
<font size="36">Tak-soo leads the conversation well.</font>

173
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:01,143
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

174
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:02,143
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

175
00:07:02,543 --> 00:07:05,143
<font size="36">But earlier when Shin-hyang and Tak-soo were together,</font>

176
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:09,243
<font size="36">Shin-hyang seemed a bit more proactive,</font>

177
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:11,943
<font size="36">but here Tak-soo is very proactive.</font>

178
00:07:12,143 --> 00:07:14,943
<font size="36">Uh, he proactively led the atmosphere, did you feel that?</font>

179
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,943
<font size="36">Yes. Yes, I completely felt it.</font>

180
00:07:18,243 --> 00:07:20,143
<font size="36">Suggesting a drink on the first date is a bit...</font>

181
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:20,643
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

182
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:22,843
<font size="36">That means he's already completely leaned towards that side.</font>

183
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:23,843
<font size="36">Which side?</font>

184
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:24,343
<font size="36">Which side is that?</font>

185
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,843
<font size="36">His heart. His heart now...</font>

186
00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:26,143
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

187
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:28,543
<font size="36">Uh, suggesting a drink on the first date...</font>

188
00:07:28,543 --> 00:07:32,143
<font size="36">Because, it's the same for men, when they meet someone they like for the first time, they'll say, 'Shall we have a drink?'</font>

189
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:32,543
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

190
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:35,243
<font size="36">When you have a drink like that, people's hearts open up.</font>

191
00:07:35,243 --> 00:07:35,843
<font size="36">Yes, yes.</font>

192
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:40,443
<font size="36">But this feels like he also wants to do something proactively.</font>

193
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:41,343
<font size="36">That's the feeling.</font>

194
00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:42,943
<font size="36">Because there are feelings. Uh, I think so.</font>

195
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:47,443
<font size="36">Personally, I find that proactive side of Tak-soo very appealing, and I really like it.</font>

196
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:48,043
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

197
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:48,443
<font size="36">Very proactive.</font>

198
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:50,443
<font size="36">As a father with a daughter, I feel quite sad.</font>

199
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:50,843
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

200
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:52,443
<font size="36">I don't think it's a problem, why?</font>

201
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:53,343
<font size="36">Ah, really? Ah, yes, yes.</font>

202
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,843
<font size="36">I don't see a problem. I don't see any problem at all.</font>

203
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:03,223
<font size="36">Oh...</font>

204
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:05,423
<font size="36">Wow...</font>

205
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:12,223
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

206
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:17,723
<font size="36">Personally, Shin-hyang</font>

207
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:21,723
<font size="36">seems to drain energy in real-time so</font>

208
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:24,223
<font size="36">Drain energy? What do you mean drain energy!</font>

209
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:26,523
<font size="36">Brother, I'm sorry.</font>

210
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:29,023
<font size="36">No, no, my son is a bit...</font>

211
00:08:29,523 --> 00:08:30,723
<font size="36">That's the ideal type I pursue.</font>

212
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:32,323
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

213
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:38,941
<font size="36">I'll try eating it.</font>

214
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:41,310
<font size="36">Ah, she hates king crab.</font>

215
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:46,123
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

216
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:48,723
<font size="36">Is it good?</font>

217
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:49,023
<font size="36">Uh, yes.</font>

218
00:08:49,423 --> 00:08:50,123
<font size="36">Is it really king crab?</font>

219
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:50,923
<font size="36">Wait a minute.</font>

220
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:52,723
<font size="36">Did she say she can't eat king crab?</font>

221
00:08:53,623 --> 00:08:54,623
<font size="36">She absolutely can't eat it.</font>

222
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:56,523
<font size="36">I didn't know anything.</font>

223
00:08:57,423 --> 00:08:58,723
<font size="36">I think who you eat with is what's important.</font>

224
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:01,731
<font size="36">She doesn't eat it, that kid is funny.</font>

225
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:02,765
<font size="36">So funny.</font>

226
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:05,989
<font size="36">Mm.</font>

227
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:11,608
<font size="36">Anyway, I almost had to eat a lonely meal.</font>

228
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,377
<font size="36">- Is that possible?
- It could be.</font>

229
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:15,939
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

230
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:16,929
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

231
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:18,829
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

232
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:26,089
<font size="36">I wanted to try talking to her once.</font>

233
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:26,889
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

234
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,429
<font size="36">Oh, thankfully.</font>

235
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:33,419
<font size="36">So normally, what do you do when you're resting?</font>

236
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:34,619
<font size="36">When resting?</font>

237
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:35,019
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

238
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,619
<font size="36">Mainly listening to music and watching movies.</font>

239
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,770
<font size="36">You're very into cultural life.</font>

240
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:41,319
<font size="36">Mm, I really like it.</font>

241
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:42,019
<font size="36">Mm.</font>

242
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:44,819
<font size="36">Ah, performances too? Like plays, musicals?</font>

243
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,219
<font size="36">I like watching them.</font>

244
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,019
<font size="36">Oh, really?</font>

245
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:47,919
<font size="36">Mm.</font>

246
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:51,519
<font size="36">I've watched quite a lot of plays and musicals in Daehangno.</font>

247
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,419
<font size="36">Huh? Really?</font>

248
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,019
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

249
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:55,419
<font size="36">Brave Brothers.</font>

250
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:56,219
<font size="36">Laundry.</font>

251
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,019
<font size="36">Laundry?</font>

252
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:57,919
<font size="36">Laundry is good!</font>

253
00:09:58,319 --> 00:09:58,919
<font size="36">Laundry is fun.</font>

254
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:03,719
<font size="36">The musical Laundry has such good songs that I sometimes rewatch them on YouTube.</font>

255
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:05,919
<font size="36">That one? How many years has it been since you lived in Seoul?</font>

256
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:07,319
<font size="36">If it's a rainy day</font>

257
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:08,519
<font size="36">You really know that.</font>

258
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:09,719
<font size="36">I really like that one.</font>

259
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:11,019
<font size="36">Mm.</font>

260
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:13,603
<font size="36">Hey, now you two understand each other, you understand each other.</font>

261
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:14,019
<font size="36">Understand each other.</font>

262
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:14,719
<font size="36">Understood.</font>

263
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:15,419
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

264
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:19,119
<font size="36">Ah, I really enjoyed watching it.</font>

265
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:19,919
<font size="36">Really?</font>

266
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:22,119
<font size="36">I really enjoyed watching it.</font>

267
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,019
<font size="36">[Miraculous]</font>

268
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:26,019
<font size="36">That one and ah, that one</font>

269
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:27,119
<font size="36">Almost, Maine?</font>

270
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,186
<font size="36">- You also know Almost, Maine?
- Have you seen that?</font>

271
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,419
<font size="36">This kind of anthology</font>

272
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:32,019
<font size="36">Play.</font>

273
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:32,919
<font size="36">Yes, that one.</font>

274
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,619
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

275
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,219
<font size="36">Oh, you know that.</font>

276
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:39,619
<font size="36">I enjoyed watching that.</font>

277
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:40,519
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

278
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,619
<font size="36">Oh. Oh, what's wrong with you two~</font>

279
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:44,919
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

280
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,019
<font size="36">They have something in common.</font>

281
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:49,119
<font size="36">Everyone has something in common.</font>

282
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:52,319
<font size="36">Ah, that's right. Ah, now it's all fathers of actors here.</font>

283
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,119
<font size="36">Both of them.</font>

284
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,119
<font size="36">Since they are actors, they have many common points to connect on.</font>

285
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:59,919
<font size="36">Mostly now, these are performances I've done.</font>

286
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,119
<font size="36">Ah, I see.</font>

287
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:05,719
<font size="36">They must have watched performances really often. Since childhood.</font>

288
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:06,919
<font size="36">Mm.</font>

289
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:11,561
<font size="36">It's miraculous to know that, but because it's Jun-ho, I feel even more miraculous.</font>

290
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:13,119
<font size="36">Ah, surprised?</font>

291
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:13,819
<font size="36">Seriously too surprised.</font>

292
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:14,519
<font size="36">Completely surprised.</font>

293
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:15,819
<font size="36">Mm.</font>

294
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:18,019
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

295
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,319
<font size="36">That's good. When dating like this, I can learn more about the person.</font>

296
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,719
<font size="36">It's miraculous.</font>

297
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:33,311
<font size="36">When I talk to other people in daily life</font>

298
00:11:33,321 --> 00:11:35,780
<font size="36">and ask 'Do you know this work?'</font>

299
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,919
<font size="36">no one has ever shared such a strong common interest in plays or musicals.</font>

300
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:43,919
<font size="36">So, I think the conversation itself was very interesting.</font>

301
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:54,819
<font size="36">What I thought was, the initial impression was very strong that they had very high energy and this style probably wouldn't match uncomfortably.</font>

302
00:11:55,319 --> 00:12:01,319
<font size="36">But after talking for a bit, I felt completely the opposite of what I had thought.</font>

303
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:04,119
<font size="36">So, I thought that point was quite interesting.</font>

304
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:08,050
<font size="36">There was something surprising that we matched on.</font>

305
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,735

313
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:25,925

00:18:59,571 --> 00:18:59,951
<font size="36">Mm.</font>

458
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:06,597
<font size="36">Speaking informally... it's true that it's the first time they spoke informally.</font>

459
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:09,571
<font size="36">Because the first day was the first time the two of them talked privately.</font>

460
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:13,571
<font size="36">So they're a bit closer than others already.</font>

461
00:19:17,931 --> 00:19:18,431
<font size="36">But</font>

462
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:25,821
<font size="36">I still feel comfortable now?</font>

463
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:27,571
<font size="36">What a relief...</font>

464
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:29,651
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

465
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:31,101
<font size="36">Oh, hey, what's this.</font>

466
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:33,071
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

467
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:36,051
<font size="36">Oh, his expression seems to like it.</font>

468
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:40,201
<font size="36">When I heard those words from Tak-soo,</font>

469
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:46,411
<font size="36">I felt a little relieved and my mood was more comfortable as the atmosphere was lightened.</font>

470
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,321
<font size="36">Now, when we go home, I wonder if anyone will be there?</font>

471
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:52,141
<font size="36">Aren't we the first ones back?</font>

472
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:55,411
<font size="36">Can I ask something?</font>

473
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:55,911
<font size="36">Uh, uh.</font>

474
00:19:57,211 --> 00:19:59,771
<font size="36">In a way, you went on two dates today, right?</font>

475
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:00,101
<font size="36">Mm.</font>

476
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:02,031
<font size="36">Me and Tak-soo-nim</font>

477
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:02,251
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

478
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:04,771
<font size="36">Who had more fun? Hahaha.</font>

479
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,071
<font size="36">Asking like this?</font>

480
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:09,371
<font size="36">You can ask.</font>

481
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:09,971
<font size="36">Truly amazing.</font>

482
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:12,771
<font size="36">No, can you answer?</font>

483
00:20:13,871 --> 00:20:20,771
<font size="36">For me, I just, between Seok-joo and Shin-hyang today, I liked Shin-hyang a bit more.</font>

484
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:22,771
<font size="36">I preferred the date with Shin-hyang.</font>

485
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:23,771
<font size="36">Really?</font>

486
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:25,571
<font size="36">Oh! My goodness.</font>

487
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:26,771
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

488
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:37,254
<font size="36">Today, I think it was the calmest conversation I've had since coming here,</font>

489
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:39,629
<font size="36">out of all the times,
so I liked Shin-hyang a bit more.</font>

490
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:40,971
<font size="36">Mm... the conversation...</font>

491
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:41,371
<font size="36">Yeah, yes.</font>

492
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:45,171
<font size="36">I, I really had a lot to say.</font>

493
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:46,171
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

494
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:48,971
<font size="36">Then I'll hear the answer privately.</font>

495
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:50,771
<font size="36">For now, let's go home and...</font>

496
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:53,771
<font size="36">Let's make it 'To be continued'.</font>

497
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:54,171
<font size="36">Okay, okay.</font>

498
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:55,571
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

499
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:57,671
<font size="36">Jun-ho and Shin-hyang</font>

500
00:20:58,071 --> 00:20:58,771
<font size="36">It could work out.</font>

501
00:20:58,771 --> 00:20:59,371
<font size="36">Yes, today was fun...</font>

502
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:00,351
<font size="36">It's possible.</font>

503
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:00,981
<font size="36">Wow!</font>

504
00:21:02,618 --> 00:21:05,154
<font size="36">(After the emotional switch-pair date ends)</font>

505
00:21:05,191 --> 00:21:06,001

507
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:12,721
<font size="36">What are you doing?</font>

508
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:18,434
<font size="36">Are Seok-joo and Sa-yoon both in the room?</font>

509
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:20,271
<font size="36">Didn't you go with Seok-joo?</font>

510
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:22,431
<font size="36">I went with Seok-joo and then in the middle</font>

511
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:23,401
<font size="36">Ah, yes.</font>

512
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:25,041
<font size="36">Shin-hyang came.</font>

513
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:25,801
<font size="36">Mm...</font>

514
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:26,601
<font size="36">Shin-hyang came.</font>

515
00:21:27,081 --> 00:21:28,281
<font size="36">Shin-hyang came to your place, right.</font>

516
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:29,231
<font size="36">Ah, I see.</font>

517
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:30,691
<font size="36">Got it.</font>

518
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,301
<font size="36">Actually, I had anticipated Jun-ho.</font>

519
00:21:33,831 --> 00:21:37,431
<font size="36">Because I said that when I look at Jun-ho, that's my ideal type.</font>

520
00:21:38,691 --> 00:21:41,081
<font size="36">So I was confident that it would lead to Jun-ho.</font>

521
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:43,201
<font size="36">How was it with Jun-ho?</font>

522
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:44,691
<font size="36">It must have been fun, right?</font>

523
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:45,221
<font size="36">I think so.</font>

524
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:45,561
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

525
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:47,281
<font size="36">Being noticed, right.</font>

526
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:50,411
<font size="36">How was it?</font>

527
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:52,521
<font size="36">Uh, but it's definitely</font>

528
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:56,439
<font size="36">- My first impression of everyone...
- That's right. Too different.</font>

529
00:21:56,571 --> 00:21:57,601
<font size="36">Because that was too different so</font>

530
00:21:57,601 --> 00:21:58,071
<font size="36">It's really very</font>

531
00:21:58,071 --> 00:21:59,691

533

<font size="36">Oh, guitar.</font>

534
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:12,691
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

535
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:15,481
<font size="36">Ah, it seems like he's showing something off?</font>

536
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:16,691
<font size="36">Guitar.</font>

537
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:26,801
<font size="36">Ah, I also want to try playing the guitar.</font>

538
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:27,601
<font size="36">Guitar?</font>

539
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:30,861
<font size="36">Oh, he tried his best to match it.</font>

540
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:34,151
<font size="36">I, I... shall I?</font>

541
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:35,051
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

542
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:38,791
<font size="36">Actually, when playing guitar, the nails of the four fingers must be short.</font>

543
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:40,691
<font size="36">Because you have to press with this part.</font>

544
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:41,351
<font size="36">Like this?</font>

545
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:42,101
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

546
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,111
<font size="36">Hey, you have to hold the chord, what are you doing~</font>

547
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:47,091
<font size="36">Ah, guitar, guitar, guitar.</font>

548
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:48,821
<font size="36">B7 is like this.</font>

549
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:49,601
<font size="36">Then.</font>

550
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:52,521
<font size="36">Hey, you have to make your left finger press like this.</font>

551
00:23:04,071 --> 00:23:05,561
<font size="36">I talked like that.</font>

552
00:23:05,971 --> 00:23:09,121
<font size="36">I want to talk to other people too.</font>

553
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:11,511
<font size="36">Because he told me this</font>

554
00:23:12,301 --> 00:23:13,821
<font size="36">How was the date</font>

555
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:19,421
<font size="36">I'm curious who took over and continued the date.</font>

556
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:21,021
<font size="36">Curious~</font>

557
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:26,381
<font size="36">But this isn't hard.</font>

558

00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:41,431
<font size="36">Shin-hyang, don't come.</font>

563
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:47,691
<font size="36">The timing is really...</font>

<font size="36">The timing is really...</font>

565
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:49,191
<font size="36">No!!!</font>

566
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:50,691
<font size="36">Why look at that exact moment...</font>

567
00:23:51,091 --> 00:23:51,991
<font size="36">Hey, the scene is too much...</font>

568
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:54,091
<font size="36">Hey, look at this. Amazing.</font>

569
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:57,691
<font size="36">As soon as she went down to the first floor and into the living room</font>

579
00:24:14,678 --> 00:24:21,917

00:25:31,608 --> 00:25:32,108
<font size="36">A little</font>

609
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:36,608
<font size="36">I think the biggest thing was the awkwardness, the awkwardness due to surprise.</font>

610
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:39,108
<font size="36">Unbelievable.</font>

611
00:25:39,108 --> 00:25:40,429
<font size="36">Awkward about what?</font>

612
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:46,701
<font size="36">I was playing the guitar and Soo-wan said, 'Oh, I want to see too?', maybe she said that so I showed her.</font>

613
00:25:48,108 --> 00:25:49,908
<font size="36">I don't even know what I played. I felt a bit embarrassed.</font>

614
00:25:50,608 --> 00:25:52,908
<font size="36">It's clearly not something to apologize for, but I still feel guilty.</font>

615
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:55,108
<font size="36">Too hard.</font>

616
00:25:57,508 --> 00:25:58,408
<font size="36">I'm a bit bothered.</font>

617
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:03,146
<font size="36">I think Shin-hyang also
has feelings for Tak-soo,</font>

618
00:26:03,156 --> 00:26:07,008
<font size="36">and I also have feelings,
but since we're roommates</font>

619
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,008
<font size="36">I feel a bit uncomfortable.</font>

620
00:26:10,308 --> 00:26:12,308
<font size="36">Ah, why is it exactly with roommates.</font>

621
00:26:13,308 --> 00:26:14,308
<font size="36">I'll go change for a bit.</font>

622
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,400
<font size="36">Ah, (Leaves) avoid X2</font>

623
00:26:27,608 --> 00:26:28,908
<font size="36">Gone, gone</font>

624
00:26:29,308 --> 00:26:30,108
<font size="36">Why go there!</font>

625
00:26:31,608 --> 00:26:33,108
<font size="36">Why go.</font>

626
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:34,108
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

627
00:26:34,308 --> 00:26:36,552
<font size="36">(Completely unaware that Shin-hyang is there...)
Uh, Tak-soo still hasn't seen behind him.</font>

628
00:26:36,608 --> 00:26:37,108
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

629
00:26:37,608 --> 00:26:38,108
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

630
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:42,608
<font size="36">Jun-ho suddenly disappeared.</font>

631
00:26:42,608 --> 00:26:43,108
<font size="36">[Startled!]</font>

632
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,108
<font size="36">No, uh, no.</font>

633
00:26:46,608 --> 00:26:46,908
<font size="36">The two of them facing each other for the first time</font>

634
00:26:46,908 --> 00:26:48,530
<font size="36">Probably in the room?</font>

635
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,108
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

636
00:26:51,608 --> 00:26:52,308
<font size="36">Probably a private space.</font>

637
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:53,908
<font size="36">Isn't it? I don't know.</font>

638
00:26:58,608 --> 00:26:59,308
<font size="36">Was the meat delicious?</font>

639
00:26:59,608 --> 00:27:00,108
<font size="36">Was the meat delicious?</font>

640
00:27:01,608 --> 00:27:02,908
<font size="36">Ah!</font>

641
00:27:04,108 --> 00:27:06,915
<font size="36">Ah, why make others uncomfortable!</font>

642
00:27:06,945 --> 00:27:09,918
<font size="36">- Why?
- Hey, I understand. I understand.</font>

643
00:27:10,018 --> 00:27:13,522
<font size="36">- Ah, it makes others uncomfortable.
- You've already expressed your feelings, right?</font>

644
00:27:13,605 --> 00:27:16,191
<font size="36">Ah, participating in a dating show, you can do that.</font>

645
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:19,727
<font size="36">The two of them ate their fill of meat and then came back to play guitar.</font>

646
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:22,405
<font size="36">Doesn't he understand Shin-hyang's feelings?</font>

647
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:24,466
<font size="36">Ah, for me</font>

648
00:27:24,566 --> 00:27:27,570
<font size="36">I really think Shin-hyang has a very good personality.</font>

649
00:27:28,137 --> 00:27:30,606
<font size="36">- If I were her, I'd
- Ah. Spill it?</font>

650
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:32,941
<font size="36">Smash the guitar</font>

651
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,545
<font size="36">He just came and strummed the guitar.</font>

652
00:27:34,545 --> 00:27:35,275
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

653
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:36,565
<font size="36">He didn't sing.</font>

654
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:39,085
<font size="36">No, he didn't sing any serenade, I just.</font>

655
00:27:39,085 --> 00:27:39,635
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

656
00:27:39,635 --> 00:27:42,315
<font size="36">Uh. It could just be a continuation.</font>

657
00:27:42,315 --> 00:27:45,555
<font size="36">I hope you all open your eyes a bit wider.</font>

658
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:46,515
<font size="36">Mr. Lee Cheol-min.</font>

659
00:27:46,515 --> 00:27:48,135
<font size="36">Did you try your best to open them wide?</font>

660
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:49,225
<font size="36">Yes, yes, yes.</font>

661
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:50,585
<font size="36">Our Mr. Lee Cheol-min</font>

662
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:56,615
<font size="36">Mr. Lee Jong-hyuk also met Tak-soo at this age, right?</font>

663
00:27:56,615 --> 00:27:57,955
<font size="36">Ah, of course. Met him when he was just over 20.</font>

664
00:27:57,955 --> 00:27:59,235
<font size="36">At that time, how was it?</font>

665
00:27:59,235 --> 00:28:01,285
<font size="36">Tak-soo is still very humane.</font>

666
00:28:01,285 --> 00:28:04,825
<font size="36">Even if he talks to many people, he still meets each person individually to talk.</font>

667
00:28:04,825 --> 00:28:08,215
<font size="36">But Mr. Jong-hyuk always gathers everyone to talk.</font>

668
00:28:08,215 --> 00:28:09,035
<font size="36">All at once.</font>

669
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:12,435
<font size="36">Ah, not meeting each person but not having time?</font>

670
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:17,605
<font size="36">Ah, back then, sometimes a few people, two or three, would come at once, and then leave.</font>

671
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:18,035
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

672
00:28:18,035 --> 00:28:23,759
<font size="36">Or what if some girls call 'oppa' while passing by, 'sit down for a bit'?</font>

673
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:24,165
<font size="36">Tak-soo is indeed a kind person.</font>

674
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:26,425
<font size="36">Uh. Uh.</font>

675
00:28:27,395 --> 00:28:28,895
<font size="36">As feelings deepen</font>

676
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,025
<font size="36">The night is also getting late</font>

677
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:37,555
<font size="36">(My children gathered in the living room)</font>

678
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:38,655
<font size="36">Everyone has arrived.</font>

679
00:28:38,655 --> 00:28:39,725
<font size="36">I'm sorry.</font>

680
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:40,825
<font size="36">It's okay.</font>

681
00:28:40,825 --> 00:28:45,725
<font size="36">(The three of them are still thinking about each other)</font>

682
00:28:48,655 --> 00:28:50,585
<font size="36">(That moment)</font>

683
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:53,088
<font size="36">(A message also arrived)</font>

684
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54,235
<font size="36">Huh? Wow.</font>

685
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:54,635
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

686
00:28:54,957 --> 00:28:55,558
<font size="36">[Surprised]</font>

687
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:57,325
<font size="36">Ah, something else has arrived. What is it?</font>

688
00:28:57,325 --> 00:28:59,294
<font size="36">[Curious]</font>

689
00:28:59,725 --> 00:29:02,665
<font size="36">Now, reveal your age and profession.</font>

690
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:05,325
<font size="36">Hey. Oh, it's being revealed now.</font>

691
00:29:05,325 --> 00:29:08,325
<font size="36">With this, can the image change?</font>

692
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:09,025
<font size="36">Of course.</font>

693
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:13,909
<font size="36">Yes. When you know someone's age and profession, your thoughts can change.</font>

694
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:15,525
<font size="36">Probably. That's right. It's changing again.</font>

695
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:15,725
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

696
00:29:15,725 --> 00:29:16,925
<font size="36">It's almost like starting over.</font>

697
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:19,725
<font size="36">This cannot but be influenced.</font>

698
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,250
<font size="36">(Parents are also half expecting, half worried)</font>

699
00:29:22,025 --> 00:29:23,351
<font size="36">Like this?</font>

700
00:29:26,825 --> 00:29:29,658
<font size="36">(Tense)</font>

701
00:29:30,225 --> 00:29:33,061
<font size="36">For someone, it's a variable</font>

702
00:29:33,161 --> 00:29:36,566
<font size="36">for others, it's an opportunity</font>

703
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,825
<font size="36">Finally.</font>

704
00:29:39,668 --> 00:29:41,569
<font size="36">[Sigh]</font>

705
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:46,425
<font size="36">I guessed I might be the oldest.</font>

706
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:54,916
<font size="36">Because now we know each other's information and met, it feels like starting over.</font>

707
00:29:55,117 --> 00:29:57,386
<font size="36">- Can you reveal (first)?
- Ah, me?</font>

708
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:59,721
<font size="36">It's fine if I reveal first.</font>

709
00:30:00,025 --> 00:30:02,103
<font size="36">Guessing age first...</font>

710
00:30:02,763 --> 00:30:04,403
<font size="36">Please be gentle with your guesses.</font>

711
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:06,995
<font size="36">Ah, should I subtract? Subtract a little?</font>

712
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:08,403
<font size="36">Please poke gently.</font>

713
00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:10,103
<font size="36">Ah, Seok-joo and Jun-ho match really well.</font>

714
00:30:10,913 --> 00:30:11,533
<font size="36">Twenty-seven?</font>

715
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:12,023
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

716
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:17,439
<font size="36">I was born in 1999, making me 27 years old.</font>

717
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,433
<font size="36">Wow, nice to meet you.</font>

718
00:30:21,173 --> 00:30:22,153
<font size="36">Nice to meet you, little brother.</font>

719
00:30:22,763 --> 00:30:23,433
<font size="36">Noona!</font>

720
00:30:26,373 --> 00:30:31,219
<font size="36">And I am a music-making rapper.</font>

721
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:32,643
<font size="36">You know it well, right.</font>

722
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:35,413
<font size="36">I'm a huge fan of .</font>

723
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:36,933
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

724
00:30:37,553 --> 00:30:38,333
<font size="36">I know it too.</font>

725
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:38,933
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

726
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:39,783
<font size="36">I know it too.</font>

727
00:30:39,783 --> 00:30:40,113
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

728
00:30:40,913 --> 00:30:42,623
<font size="36">That's right. There's no way he wouldn't make music.</font>

729
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:44,603
<font size="36">Noona!</font>

730
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:47,133
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

731
00:30:48,103 --> 00:30:49,404
<font size="36">My age?</font>

732
00:30:49,504 --> 00:30:51,639
<font size="36">- Twenty-seven?
- Really?</font>

733
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,543
<font size="36">26?</font>

734
00:30:55,393 --> 00:30:57,746
<font size="36">Only deduct that much?</font>

735
00:30:59,383 --> 00:30:59,783
<font size="36">For me</font>

736
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:02,933
<font size="36">Born in '01, 25 years old</font>

737
00:31:03,123 --> 00:31:03,593
<font size="36">Oh~</font>

738
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:04,663
<font size="36">25 years old.</font>

739
00:31:06,393 --> 00:31:06,933
<font size="36">Therefore,</font>

740
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:09,533
<font size="36">Also, if I add more, well that is</font>

741
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,823
<font size="36">This is also the time to reveal</font>

742
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:14,933
<font size="36">No, that is</font>

743
00:31:16,153 --> 00:31:17,933
<font size="36">Actually, it's not our first time meeting.</font>

744
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:18,483
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

745
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:19,033
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

746
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:20,533
<font size="36">As for us</font>

747
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:21,533
<font size="36">Same school</font>

748
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:23,204
<font size="36">We studied together from elementary, middle, to high school.</font>

749
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:23,933
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

750
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,407
<font size="36">We studied together from elementary, middle, to high school</font>

751
00:31:26,808 --> 00:31:29,433
<font size="36">That is, because our families are close so</font>

752
00:31:29,433 --> 00:31:29,933
<font size="36">Mm.</font>

753
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:31,633
<font size="36">That's why they were teasing like that</font>

754
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:33,733
<font size="36">No, it's not like that.</font>

755
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:35,033
<font size="36">It must be.</font>

756
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,733
<font size="36">That's why they talked so comfortably.</font>

757
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:41,133
<font size="36">Thinking back, people might find it a bit strange later,</font>

758
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,933
<font size="36">So before things get stranger, I wanted to quickly</font>

759
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:45,633
<font size="36">Say it. That's what I thought.</font>

760
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:50,933
<font size="36">On the first day, when Seok-joo talked one-on-one with Tak-soo,</font>

761
00:31:51,633 --> 00:31:53,933
<font size="36">At that time, I also felt very jealous</font>

762
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:56,733
<font size="36">He seemed interested. That's what I thought,</font>

763
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:03,533
<font size="36">But thinking back, maybe it's because they're old friends that they talked like that, so I felt more relieved.</font>

764
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:04,933
<font size="36">Soo-wan likes it now.</font>

765
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:05,633
<font size="36">Likes, likes it now.</font>

766
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:07,133
<font size="36">She's feeling relieved now.</font>

767
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:08,833
<font size="36">For now, one person has been eliminated.</font>

768
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:11,133
<font size="36">Initially, she was on guard</font>

769
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:11,833
<font size="36">Ah, one person has been eliminated.</font>

770
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,133
<font size="36">Uh, those two can't become a couple anymore.</font>

771
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:14,633
<font size="36">Uh. Yes.</font>

772
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:15,533
<font size="36">Alright.</font>

773
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:17,333
<font size="36">Sun-jun.</font>

774
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,533
<font size="36">I guess around twenty-four?</font>

775
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:22,033
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

776
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:22,433
<font size="36">Huh, is that right?</font>

777
00:32:22,433 --> 00:32:22,833
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

778
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:23,033
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

779
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:24,633
<font size="36">Born in 2002, 24 years old.</font>

780
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:25,233
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

781
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:26,033
<font size="36">Born in 2002?</font>

782
00:32:26,033 --> 00:32:26,833
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

783
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:27,133
<font size="36">Born in 2002.</font>

784
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:31,733
<font size="36">And I am currently attending a cooking school.</font>

785
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:33,333
<font size="36">Ah, what!</font>

786
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:33,733
<font size="36">Yes!</font>

787
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:35,133
<font size="36">Wow!</font>

788
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:36,633
<font size="36">Sa-yoon is also very surprised right now.</font>

789
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:37,833
<font size="36">Yes, yes, yes.</font>

790
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:38,133
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

791
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:41,433
<font size="36">When this is all done, you'll make this for me, right?</font>

792
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:42,433
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

793
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:43,333
<font size="36">Ah, that's amazing.</font>

794
00:32:43,633 --> 00:32:45,633
<font size="36">As long as I have ingredients, I'll make anything.</font>

795
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:47,733
<font size="36">Wow, that looks so cool.</font>

796
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:49,233
<font size="36">Amazing.</font>

797
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:52,533
<font size="36">Sa-yoon.</font>

798
00:32:53,033 --> 00:32:53,333
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

799
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:54,833
<font size="36">Truly curious.</font>

800
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:58,433
<font size="36">I was born in 2006, 20 years old</font>

801
00:32:59,133 --> 00:32:59,433
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

802
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,433
<font size="36">The youngest has grown up.</font>

803
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:02,233
<font size="36">So young.</font>

804
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:02,533
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

805
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:04,133
<font size="36">Sun-jun is surprised now.</font>

806
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:05,133
<font size="36">Sun-jun.</font>

807
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:05,896
<font size="36">Uh, now</font>

808
00:33:06,516 --> 00:33:08,116
<font size="36">Sun-jun is very surprised.</font>

809
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:08,516
<font size="36">Eyes.</font>

810
00:33:08,516 --> 00:33:09,016
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

811
00:33:09,616 --> 00:33:10,916
<font size="36">Born in 2006?</font>

812
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:12,016
<font size="36">Can you drink alcohol?</font>

813
00:33:15,716 --> 00:33:18,016
<font size="36">Uh, but I had guessed he would be young,</font>

814
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:20,416
<font size="36">But I didn't expect him to be completely 20 years old.</font>

815
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:23,216
<font size="36">I thought 21 or 22.</font>

816
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:27,216
<font size="36">What's the difference between 21, 22, or 20?</font>

817
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:27,816
<font size="36">It's different.</font>

818
00:33:27,816 --> 00:33:28,516
<font size="36">At that age</font>

819
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:28,816
<font size="36">Different?</font>

820
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:29,816
<font size="36">It's different. One year</font>

821
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:32,016
<font size="36">For us, 50, 51, or 52 is all the same.</font>

822
00:33:32,516 --> 00:33:34,016
<font size="36">Ah, just being that cautious.</font>

823
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:36,771
<font size="36">Seong-jun's 'cautious (?)' information revealed</font>

824
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,840
<font size="36">24.</font>

825
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:39,616
<font size="36">Is 24 years old.</font>

826
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:40,416
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

827
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:40,616
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

828
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:42,410
<font size="36">24 years old</font>

829
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:46,016
<font size="36">Actually, I thought he would be older than 24.</font>

830
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:48,016
<font size="36">Does he look old?</font>

831
00:33:48,716 --> 00:33:49,416
<font size="36">Sa-yoon.</font>

832
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:52,316
<font size="36">Ah, meaning he's that mature.</font>

833
00:33:52,316 --> 00:33:53,316
<font size="36">He looks that mature.</font>

834
00:33:55,716 --> 00:33:56,816
<font size="36">Since he said he was 24</font>

835
00:33:57,516 --> 00:33:58,616
<font size="36">I thought it was lucky.</font>

836
00:33:58,616 --> 00:33:59,816
<font size="36">Anyway.</font>

837
00:34:00,816 --> 00:34:01,516
<font size="36">Soo-wan.</font>

838
00:34:01,516 --> 00:34:02,316
<font size="36">It's Soo-wan's turn</font>

839
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:03,016
<font size="36">For me</font>

840
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:07,116
<font size="36">Tak-soo is 23 years old</font>

841
00:34:08,716 --> 00:34:10,705
<font size="36">'04, 22 years old.</font>

842
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,116
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

843
00:34:13,616 --> 00:34:14,816
<font size="36">Actually, I thought we were friends,</font>

844
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:16,516
<font size="36">But when he said he was one year younger than me</font>

845
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:18,116
<font size="36">Does it feel a bit like being deceived?</font>

846
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:19,216
<font size="36">Why?</font>

847
00:34:19,616 --> 00:34:20,316
<font size="36">Why? Who deceived?</font>

848
00:34:20,816 --> 00:34:21,516
<font size="36">Because he spoke informally?</font>

849
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:25,216
<font size="36">What are you going to do with Shin-hyang like this, here.</font>

850
00:34:26,116 --> 00:34:27,516
<font size="36">Finally Shin-hyang reveals</font>

851
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:28,316
<font size="36">For me</font>

852
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,816
<font size="36">Completely didn't think she was a noona</font>

853
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:34,116
<font size="36">Twenty-six.</font>

854
00:34:34,716 --> 00:34:35,416
<font size="36">26?</font>

855
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:35,616
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

856
00:34:36,216 --> 00:34:37,116
<font size="36">Oh, Tak-soo is surprised now.</font>

857
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:39,016
<font size="36">Oh, she's definitely a noona.</font>

858
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:40,416
<font size="36">I'll trust you.</font>

859
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:42,116
<font size="36">I'll follow your choice.</font>

860
00:34:43,116 --> 00:34:46,116
<font size="36">(My past self from my naive days flashed through my mind...)</font>

861
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:48,316
<font size="36">You, you're in big trouble.</font>

862
00:34:48,316 --> 00:34:49,116
<font size="36">In trouble.</font>

863
00:34:49,116 --> 00:34:50,816
<font size="36">You, you, you, you feel betrayed.</font>

864
00:34:51,816 --> 00:34:53,116
<font size="36">Born in 2000.</font>

865
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:53,716
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

866
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:55,016
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

867
00:34:55,816 --> 00:34:57,116
<font size="36">Born in 2000 and</font>

868
00:34:58,516 --> 00:35:01,116
<font size="36">Actually, I thought we were the same age, meaning friends,</font>

869
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:04,116
<font size="36">But since you're a bit older than me</font>

870
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:07,116
<font size="36">Suddenly felt a bit awkward.</font>

871
00:35:07,716 --> 00:35:08,416
<font size="36">Should I call her noona?</font>

872
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,116
<font size="36">A little bit, well, I'm a little</font>

873
00:35:10,716 --> 00:35:14,516
<font size="36">Anyway, if someone is older, I feel more comfortable treating them with respect.</font>

874
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:16,816
<font size="36">I also thought she was younger,</font>

875
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:19,816
<font size="36">But when she said she was a noona, it was quite a shock.</font>

876
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:22,316
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

877
00:35:24,216 --> 00:35:27,115
<font size="36">- 23.
- I'm 23 too</font>

878
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:32,316
<font size="36">That's right. He's 23 years old.</font>

879
00:35:34,116 --> 00:35:35,116
<font size="36">23 years old and</font>

880
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:36,116
<font size="36">Born in 2003?</font>

881
00:35:36,516 --> 00:35:36,816
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

882
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:40,116
<font size="36">Suddenly switched to honorifics immediately.</font>

883
00:35:40,116 --> 00:35:40,516
<font size="36">After that</font>

884
00:35:40,816 --> 00:35:42,016
<font size="36">Suddenly raised it quite a lot.</font>

885
00:35:42,716 --> 00:35:45,116
<font size="36">I was a bit surprised to hear Tak-soo's age.</font>

886
00:35:45,816 --> 00:35:48,116
<font size="36">I thought he was the same age or one year older?</font>

887
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:52,316
<font size="36">Honestly, at most, I thought he was only two years younger.</font>

888
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:58,316
<font size="36">When I heard the phrase 'born in 2003', oh, so young.</font>

889
00:35:58,316 --> 00:36:02,250
<font size="36">I think I thought that at that moment.</font>

890
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:05,720
<font size="36">(Very different expressions of the two daughters)</font>

891
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:06,091
<font size="36">Very.</font>

892
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:08,191
<font size="36">Very nice to meet you.</font>

893
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:08,891
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

894
00:36:12,191 --> 00:36:12,991
<font size="36">Wow, so fresh.</font>

895
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:14,591
<font size="36">Does it feel like starting over?</font>

896
00:36:14,991 --> 00:36:16,991
<font size="36">Uh, it seems like he just appeared for the first time.</font>

897
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:19,291
<font size="36">I thought we were friends.</font>

898
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:21,491
<font size="36">Ah, that's why he spoke informally.</font>

899
00:36:21,491 --> 00:36:25,339
<font size="36">Call her noona again, call her noona again.</font>

900
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,691
<font size="36">Wow, so it's been revealed.</font>

901
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,291
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

902
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:36,291
<font size="36">Age and occupation will definitely have an influence.</font>

903
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:38,491
<font size="36">I think there will be a huge divide.</font>

904
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:42,991
<font size="36">Ding dong</font>

905
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:44,291
<font size="36">Huh? What is it?</font>

906
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:45,291
<font size="36">Who's coming again?</font>

907
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:47,991
<font size="36">Huh? Do we have to go out?</font>

908
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:49,691
<font size="36">It's probably not a person, right?</font>

909
00:36:49,691 --> 00:36:50,991
<font size="36">It's probably not a person.</font>

910
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:53,291
<font size="36">So, we probably have to go out? Just one representative?</font>

911
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:55,291
<font size="36">Oh, who's coming again?</font>

912
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:55,691
<font size="36">Really?</font>

913
00:36:55,991 --> 00:36:56,491
<font size="36">No way.</font>

914
00:36:56,991 --> 00:36:57,691
<font size="36">Ah, who's coming again?</font>

915
00:36:57,691 --> 00:36:58,291
<font size="36">Who else is coming?</font>

916
00:36:58,491 --> 00:36:59,291
<font size="36">Another catfish?</font>

917
00:36:59,491 --> 00:36:59,991
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

918
00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:00,991
<font size="36">So, who else is coming here?</font>

919
00:37:01,491 --> 00:37:02,291
<font size="36">Open this door?</font>

920
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:02,991
<font size="36">No way.</font>

921
00:37:03,491 --> 00:37:04,991
<font size="36">Who else is coming?</font>

922
00:37:10,691 --> 00:37:11,491
<font size="36">Ah, a package.</font>

923
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:12,291
<font size="36">A package.</font>

924
00:37:18,491 --> 00:37:18,691
<font size="36">Two of them?</font>

925
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:19,291
<font size="36">So many things.</font>

926
00:37:19,691 --> 00:37:20,291
<font size="36">So many things?</font>

927
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:20,991
<font size="36">What else is this...</font>

928
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:21,491
<font size="36">What is it.</font>

929
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:21,691
<font size="36">What the.</font>

930
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:22,691
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

931
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,991
<font size="36">A recommendation letter written by your best friend has arrived.</font>

932
00:37:27,491 --> 00:37:27,691
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

933
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:28,991
<font size="36">Best friend?</font>

934
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:30,691
<font size="36">Friend... Best friend?</font>

935
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:31,491
<font size="36">Best friend?</font>

936
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,991
<font size="36">Each person, please read your recommendation letter in turn.</font>

937
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:37,291
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

938
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:38,991
<font size="36">My best friend wrote it?</font>

939
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:39,491
<font size="36">My friend?</font>

940
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:40,491
<font size="36">My best friend?</font>

941
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:41,491
<font size="36">Who is my best friend?</font>

942
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:42,491
<font size="36">Who wrote it???</font>

943
00:37:42,491 --> 00:37:42,991
<font size="36">Let's see.</font>

944
00:37:43,491 --> 00:37:44,491
<font size="36">Did that boy write it?</font>

945
00:37:44,991 --> 00:37:45,691
<font size="36">Uh, so surprised.</font>

946
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:46,991
<font size="36">Everyone is really frozen.</font>

947
00:37:47,991 --> 00:37:49,991
<font size="36">Uh, already too worried.</font>

948
00:37:50,991 --> 00:37:51,491
<font size="36">Too shocked.</font>

949
00:37:51,491 --> 00:37:51,991
<font size="36">Curious.</font>

950
00:37:52,491 --> 00:37:53,991
<font size="36">Ah, that's right. Unimaginable.</font>

951
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:55,491
<font size="36">Ah, I</font>

952
00:37:55,491 --> 00:37:56,491
<font size="36">Then, in turn</font>

953
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:57,991
<font size="36">Shall we read them one by one?</font>

954
00:37:58,691 --> 00:37:59,991
<font size="36">And I don't know who the best friend is.</font>

955
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:00,491
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

956
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:02,491
<font size="36">Meaning the person who knows themselves well wrote it, right?</font>

957
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:02,991
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

958
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:04,991
<font size="36">Who could it be?</font>

959
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,491
<font size="36">Shall I read first?</font>

960
00:38:11,991 --> 00:38:12,991
<font size="36">Our Tak-soo is,</font>

961
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:19,991
<font size="36">He might be a bit passive or observant, but he's a very charming person.</font>

962
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:21,291
<font size="36">That's right, he's charming.</font>

963
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:24,491
<font size="36">Tak-soo is a child who cares about others but doesn't express himself much.</font>

964
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:28,491
<font size="36">So, give him alcohol. You don't know how he'll change.</font>

965
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:32,991
<font size="36">And Tak-soo isn't picky about food.</font>

966
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:35,491
<font size="36">Just give him anything to eat. Even if it's bad, he'll say it's delicious.</font>

967
00:38:35,991 --> 00:38:37,991
<font size="36">His best friend seems a bit blunt, huh.</font>

968
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,991
<font size="36">Finally, Tak-soo is already weak, so I'm very worried.</font>

969
00:38:41,491 --> 00:38:45,991
<font size="36">Please treat him roughly so he can grow strong. Please help.</font>

970
00:38:50,991 --> 00:38:51,991
<font size="36">Give him alcohol.</font>

971
00:38:51,991 --> 00:38:55,490
<font size="36">- Just feed him.
- Just feed him anything.</font>

972
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:57,991
<font size="36">Best friend?</font>

973
00:38:58,491 --> 00:38:59,991
<font size="36">Can't figure it out. Can't figure it out.</font>

974
00:39:00,991 --> 00:39:01,491
<font size="36">I'll do it.</font>

975
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:02,491
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

976
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:06,034
<font size="36">Seong-jun is a friend with a very warm heart.</font>

977
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:09,971
<font size="36">He was sad for a while because he felt for the polar bears threatened with extinction.</font>

978
00:39:11,928 --> 00:39:14,498
<font size="36">He is a friend who worries about global warming and loves animals.</font>

979
00:39:15,218 --> 00:39:21,328
<font size="36">A man like a stone snail that only lives in pristine, quiet but not silent, first-grade water sources, always manages himself strictly.</font>

980
00:39:22,108 --> 00:39:23,648
<font size="36">Introducing Lee Seong-jun.</font>

981
00:39:25,598 --> 00:39:27,768
<font size="36">Seems to know him very well, right? Right?</font>

982
00:39:29,398 --> 00:39:30,648
<font size="36">Can't guess who it is.</font>

983
00:39:32,158 --> 00:39:34,178
<font size="36">Can't deduce anything at all.</font>

984
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,108
<font size="36">But the polar bear story is from a very long time ago, so</font>

985
00:39:38,798 --> 00:39:42,108
<font size="36">To the point where I don't even remember it clearly, it's a very vague memory.</font>

986
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:44,368
<font size="36">I'm curious who it is.</font>

987
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:46,698
<font size="36">It's an old friend anyway.</font>

988
00:39:48,308 --> 00:39:50,448
<font size="36">I'll read the short one.</font>

989
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:50,858
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

990
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:51,578
<font size="36">It's really short.</font>

991
00:39:51,888 --> 00:39:53,728
<font size="36">It's really short. Not even half a page.</font>

992
00:39:54,328 --> 00:39:54,758
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

993
00:39:55,598 --> 00:39:59,508
<font size="36">Seok-joo is a romantic child who likes to dance and sing.</font>

994
00:40:00,538 --> 00:40:05,478
<font size="36">He likes the group EXO and Taeyeon, and also drinks high-end alcohol like EXO calmly (Taeyeon = calm).</font>

995
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:12,958
<font size="36">It seems like the humor is a bit classic.</font>

996
00:40:13,158 --> 00:40:13,358
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

997
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:14,108
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

998
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:16,004
<font size="36">[Pressing lips together]</font>

999
00:40:16,104 --> 00:40:18,708
<font size="36">However, he's not an alcoholic. *chuckles*</font>

1000
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:26,108
<font size="36">Like aged whiskey with a rich flavor, you will feel the humanity and deep charm of Red Seok-joo over time, more so than at first.</font>

1001
00:40:26,548 --> 00:40:26,848
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1002
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:34,658
<font size="36">I was sure it was Dad.</font>

1003
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:38,408
<font size="36">There's Dad's joke too.</font>

1004
00:40:38,508 --> 00:40:38,708
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1005
00:40:39,108 --> 00:40:43,908
<font size="36">He likes the group EXO and Taeyeon, and also drinks high-end alcohol like EXO calmly (Taeyeon = calm).</font>

1006
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:45,898
<font size="36">You can probably feel it from that.</font>

1007
00:40:46,438 --> 00:40:47,708
<font size="36">It seems like a joke Dad wrote, right?</font>

1008
00:40:48,108 --> 00:40:48,308
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1009
00:40:48,608 --> 00:40:49,408
<font size="36">Caught red-handed.</font>

1010
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:56,848
<font size="36">So, I was sure 'This is Dad' right from the second sentence.</font>

1011
00:40:57,438 --> 00:40:58,768
<font size="36">I'm 200% sure.</font>

1012
00:41:05,328 --> 00:41:10,628
<font size="36">Ah, actually, the children's oldest best friends are their parents.</font>

1013
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:17,968
<font size="36">This best friend recommendation letter is a self-written introduction to their children by the parents here.</font>

1014
00:41:21,928 --> 00:41:22,738
<font size="36">Next is Sa-yoon.</font>

1015
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:27,778
<font size="36">Allow me to introduce Kim Sa-yoon, a very special friend to us.</font>

1016
00:41:28,608 --> 00:41:32,208
<font size="36">Sa-yoon is a friend with immense passion for what he loves.</font>

1017
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:35,848
<font size="36">His continuous learning attitude is also something to emulate.</font>

1018
00:41:36,508 --> 00:41:44,608
<font size="36">Even as a friend, seeing him not falter in the face of difficulties but persevering, I sometimes feel admiration and pride.</font>

1019
00:41:45,908 --> 00:41:50,408
<font size="36">As the eldest child, Sa-yoon is a friend with a strong sense of responsibility and loves his family very much.</font>

1020
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:57,108
<font size="36">He has so much love and responsibility for his family that he says he could die for his younger siblings.</font>

1021
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,783
<font size="36">I hope everyone will recognize his sincerity, warm personality, and serious charm.</font>

1022
00:42:06,502 --> 00:42:07,782
<font size="36">Too much.</font>

1023
00:42:08,402 --> 00:42:09,202
<font size="36">So much praise.</font>

1024
00:42:10,682 --> 00:42:12,320
<font size="36">This is like...</font>

1025
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,422
<font size="36">- A father's wedding speech?
- Right?</font>

1026
00:42:15,372 --> 00:42:17,425
<font size="36">He really wrote it with tears.</font>

1027
00:42:17,512 --> 00:42:19,022
<font size="36">When I wrote that, I wrote it with tears.</font>

1028
00:42:19,022 --> 00:42:19,382
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1029
00:42:19,652 --> 00:42:20,482
<font size="36">That's right, that's right.</font>

1030
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:20,902
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1031
00:42:21,202 --> 00:42:23,332
<font size="36">You can take this and reuse it at the wedding.</font>

1032
00:42:24,212 --> 00:42:25,782
<font size="36">Did Sa-yoon recognize it?</font>

1033
00:42:26,422 --> 00:42:28,362
<font size="36">I really can't guess who wrote it.</font>

1034
00:42:29,002 --> 00:42:29,492
<font size="36">Doesn't he know?</font>

1035
00:42:29,962 --> 00:42:33,382
<font size="36">When they said a best friend wrote it, I had best friends that immediately came to mind.</font>

1036
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:34,632
<font size="36">Uh, but</font>

1037
00:42:35,332 --> 00:42:37,282
<font size="36">Did he write it?</font>

1038
00:42:37,282 --> 00:42:38,132
<font size="36">It doesn't seem like... What is it?</font>

1039
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:39,282
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1040
00:42:39,552 --> 00:42:40,382
<font size="36">Didn't recognize it.</font>

1041
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:42,882
<font size="36">Uh, nothing special.</font>

1042
00:42:43,222 --> 00:42:44,222
<font size="36">Sa-yoon didn't recognize it at all.</font>

1043
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:46,202
<font size="36">No, he said he wrote it with tears.</font>

1044
00:42:46,532 --> 00:42:46,902
<font size="36">What do we do now?</font>

1045
00:42:47,152 --> 00:42:48,382
<font size="36">Only Dad cried.</font>

1046
00:42:48,382 --> 00:42:50,424
<font size="36">(Dad cries again)</font>

1047
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:52,482
<font size="36">Did Soo-wan recognize it?</font>

1048
00:42:52,782 --> 00:42:53,202
<font size="36">I</font>

1049
00:42:53,982 --> 00:42:56,382
<font size="36">Hello. I am Soo-wan's best friend.</font>

1050
00:42:57,082 --> 00:43:01,130
<font size="36">Soo-wan is usually a calm
and graceful friend in every aspect,</font>

1051
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,873
<font size="36">every action is slow but
shows grace and refined beauty.</font>

1052
00:43:06,582 --> 00:43:10,882
<font size="36">When talking, he isn't fast but has a style that clearly expresses what he wants to say.</font>

1053
00:43:14,382 --> 00:43:15,482
<font size="36">Soo-wan suddenly stopped</font>

1054
00:43:15,782 --> 00:43:16,582
<font size="36">Why, why?</font>

1055
00:43:16,882 --> 00:43:17,192
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1056
00:43:22,782 --> 00:43:25,582
<font size="36">Also, true to his nickname 'bed sloth', he loves his bed, even having cute aspects where he can do everything in bed.</font>

1057
00:43:25,582 --> 00:43:26,082
<font size="36">Ah...
Also, true to his nickname 'bed sloth', he loves his bed, even having cute aspects where he can do everything in bed.</font>

1060
00:43:39,482 --> 00:43:40,682
<font size="36">Do you know who it is?</font>

1061
00:43:42,482 --> 00:43:42,882
<font size="36">Uh...</font>

1062
00:43:43,682 --> 00:43:43,982
<font size="36">Really?</font>

1063
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:44,882
<font size="36">I know, I know, I know.</font>

1064
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:45,282
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1065
00:43:45,682 --> 00:43:47,982
<font size="36">Only Dad uses the term 'bed sloth' with me.</font>

1066
00:43:48,482 --> 00:43:49,282
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

1067
00:43:50,582 --> 00:43:53,121
<font size="36">(Moved)</font>

1068
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:54,082
<font size="36">Hey, that daughter recognized it.</font>

1069
00:43:54,482 --> 00:43:56,082
<font size="36">You have to give a hint.</font>

1070
00:43:57,282 --> 00:43:59,293
<font size="36">[Emotional]</font>

1071
00:43:59,482 --> 00:44:05,182
<font size="36">At first, I kept thinking my best friend wrote it,</font>

1072
00:44:05,582 --> 00:44:12,982
<font size="36">My friends know I like to lie in bed and such, but they don't call me 'bed sloth',</font>

1073
00:44:13,482 --> 00:44:19,082
<font size="36">That's a term only my dad uses specifically for me, so when I saw it, I thought it was Dad.</font>

1074
00:44:19,682 --> 00:44:20,582
<font size="36">So she's already touched.</font>

1075
00:44:20,982 --> 00:44:21,282
<font size="36">She's already touched.</font>

1076
00:44:21,282 --> 00:44:21,882
<font size="36">Because it was moving.</font>

1077
00:44:22,182 --> 00:44:22,582
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1078
00:44:23,482 --> 00:44:27,182
<font size="36">The sentence that touched my heart was at the very end</font>

1079
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:30,582
<font size="36">Please love Soo-wan, who is graceful and beautiful.</font>

1080
00:44:31,482 --> 00:44:34,382
<font size="36">That sentence, I felt most clearly that Dad wrote it,</font>

1081
00:44:35,782 --> 00:44:46,682
<font size="36">Uh, I was also a bit emotional, but they were all words Dad usually says to me so I was very familiar with them.</font>

1082
00:44:47,682 --> 00:44:49,182
<font size="36">It must be very touching.</font>

1083
00:44:49,282 --> 00:44:52,282
<font size="36">(Daughter also moved)</font>

1084
00:44:52,282 --> 00:44:54,481
<font size="36">(Dad also moved)</font>

1085
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:56,082
<font size="36">Next</font>

1086
00:44:57,282 --> 00:45:01,682
<font size="36">Next is Sun-jun's recommendation letter</font>

1087
00:45:02,082 --> 00:45:02,482
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1088
00:45:02,944 --> 00:45:07,014
<font size="36">Sun-jun is a warm friend, you'll feel comfortable when you're with him.</font>

1089
00:45:07,314 --> 00:45:07,844
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1090
00:45:09,114 --> 00:45:13,284
<font size="36">He always cares for and looks after his friends around him more than himself.</font>

1091
00:45:14,264 --> 00:45:19,524
<font size="36">Seeing Sun-jun give each friend a bouquet of flowers on graduation day shows</font>

1092
00:45:19,524 --> 00:45:20,024
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1093
00:45:20,444 --> 00:45:22,644
<font size="36">Uh, brings happiness to others and</font>

1094
00:45:23,144 --> 00:45:27,534
<font size="36">I think he's a friend who knows how to share joy.</font>

1095
00:45:28,014 --> 00:45:29,483
<font size="36">That's right, Son-in-law Ahn.</font>

1096
00:45:29,634 --> 00:45:33,434
<font size="36">Uh, now Sun-jun is in Japan so we can't meet often,</font>

1097
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:38,144
<font size="36">But the image of him striving to pursue his dream of becoming a chef looks truly wonderful.</font>

1098
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:42,714
<font size="36">Living abroad is certainly not easy,</font>

1099
00:45:43,844 --> 00:45:45,544
<font size="36">But if there's ever a difficult time,</font>

1100
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:50,644
<font size="36">Don't try to endure it alone for fear of worrying those around you,</font>

1101
00:45:51,444 --> 00:45:53,374
<font size="36">Instead, say that you're having a hard time.</font>

1102
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,684
<font size="36">Uh, kind and humorous</font>

1103
00:45:56,084 --> 00:46:01,084
<font size="36">No matter where Sun-jun is humorous, live comfortably like a friend, Sun-jun.</font>

1104
00:46:01,484 --> 00:46:02,974
<font size="36">Always supporting you.</font>

1105
00:46:04,024 --> 00:46:04,424
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1106
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:06,844
<font size="36">Ah, I feel a father's love.</font>

1107
00:46:13,274 --> 00:46:15,584
<font size="36">Now, because of the distance, the father cannot meet often,</font>

1108
00:46:15,584 --> 00:46:17,584
<font size="36">It seems there was a special emotion.</font>

1109
00:46:18,224 --> 00:46:20,634
<font size="36">But now, when I do business,</font>

1110
00:46:20,634 --> 00:46:25,234
<font size="36">When they were young, I left my children at home and went off to do business,</font>

1111
00:46:25,234 --> 00:46:29,834
<font size="36">So the children cooked for themselves and did everything well on their own.</font>

1112
00:46:30,234 --> 00:46:32,844
<font size="36">Therefore, when sending that child to Japan,</font>

1113
00:46:33,114 --> 00:46:34,844
<font size="36">Just looking at him makes me sad.</font>

1114
00:46:34,844 --> 00:46:39,114
<font size="36">Sad, but watching this show and seeing him grow up is so lovely,</font>

1115
00:46:40,514 --> 00:46:42,114
<font size="36">There's no other Sun-jun like him.</font>

1116
00:46:42,114 --> 00:46:42,514
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1117
00:46:42,814 --> 00:46:43,414
<font size="36">Yes, yes.</font>

1118
00:46:43,944 --> 00:46:44,344
<font size="36">I know.</font>

1119
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:45,514
<font size="36">Knows better than anyone.</font>

1120
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:47,314
<font size="36">Knows better than anyone, better than anyone.</font>

1121
00:46:48,844 --> 00:46:51,544
<font size="36">Ah, truly leaving him alone in Change Date.</font>

1122
00:46:51,544 --> 00:46:51,844
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1123
00:46:51,844 --> 00:46:54,244
<font size="36">Children don't always follow your wishes.</font>

1124
00:46:55,014 --> 00:46:57,114
<font size="36">Here, all the fathers with daughters chose Sun-jun as number one.</font>

1125
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:57,514
<font size="36">That's right, that's right.</font>

1126
00:46:59,244 --> 00:47:00,144
<font size="36">Sun-jun truly.</font>

1127
00:47:03,224 --> 00:47:05,294
<font size="36">Ah, there was a challenge to hold back tears.</font>

1128
00:47:05,624 --> 00:47:06,424
<font size="36">Uh, truly.</font>

1129
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:07,624
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1130
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:08,024
<font size="36">Tears?</font>

1131
00:47:08,424 --> 00:47:08,724
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1132
00:47:09,324 --> 00:47:11,024
<font size="36">Ah, that means I know who wrote it.</font>

1133
00:47:11,224 --> 00:47:12,024
<font size="36">Who wrote it?</font>

1134
00:47:12,824 --> 00:47:14,324
<font size="36">Why don't I know who wrote it?</font>

1135
00:47:14,924 --> 00:47:15,924
<font size="36">I just thought it was the parents.</font>

1136
00:47:17,624 --> 00:47:18,724
<font size="36">Sun-jun also seems to have recognized it.</font>

1137
00:47:18,724 --> 00:47:19,524
<font size="36">Seems to have recognized it.</font>

1138
00:47:21,224 --> 00:47:26,524
<font size="36">Knows everything in great detail from when he was very young until now,</font>

1139
00:47:26,824 --> 00:47:27,424
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1140
00:47:28,624 --> 00:47:30,524
<font size="36">And this joke, only my dad could say it.</font>

1141
00:47:33,724 --> 00:47:35,124
<font size="36">So I</font>

1142
00:47:35,124 --> 00:47:37,524
<font size="36">Hearing that made me very emotional.</font>

1143
00:47:38,224 --> 00:47:38,924
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1144
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,724
<font size="36">That was a difficult part.</font>

1145
00:47:45,124 --> 00:47:45,624
<font size="36">Ah, like this?</font>

1146
00:47:45,924 --> 00:47:47,924
<font size="36">Hey, Shin-hyang knows Dad wrote it,</font>

1147
00:47:47,924 --> 00:47:50,024
<font size="36">Now, uh, she knows.</font>

1148
00:47:51,024 --> 00:47:53,824
<font size="36">Hello. I am Shin-hyang's neighbor.</font>

1149
00:47:55,024 --> 00:47:59,100
<font size="36">Shin-hyang, an intelligent elementary school student who always tried her best,</font>

1150
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,371
<font size="36">a middle school student in conflict with her parents about her career path,</font>

1151
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:08,342
<font size="36">a passionate high school student, commuting three hours round trip every day,</font>

1152
00:48:08,442 --> 00:48:12,279
<font size="36">Until the present, one who cried and laughed in the battle against failure,</font>

1153
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,616
<font size="36">I have always watched.</font>

1154
00:48:14,316 --> 00:48:17,116
<font size="36">Honestly, I was envious. The fact of having dreams and things you want to do.</font>

1155
00:48:17,216 --> 00:48:18,419
<font size="36">Smiling</font>

1156
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:19,253
<font size="36">Huh?.</font>

1157
00:48:19,516 --> 00:48:20,916
<font size="36">My friend Shin-hyang,</font>

1158
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:24,916

1159
00:48:25,716 --> 00:48:26,316
<font size="36">Warm</font>

1160
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:33,116
<font size="36">I really like Shin-hyang, who is warm, knows how to listen, and shares others' stories.</font>

1161
00:48:35,716 --> 00:48:40,916
<font size="36">Now, I hope Shin-hyang will meet someone warm, who listens to Shin-hyang more than anyone else.</font>

1162
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:44,316
<font size="36">Shin-hyang, just try it. Just meet him.</font>

1163
00:48:44,316 --> 00:48:47,016
<font size="36">It's okay to fail. Haven't we failed once or twice already?</font>

<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1168
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,516

00:49:26,816 --> 00:49:27,416
<font size="36">Don't cry.</font>

1173
00:49:30,616 --> 00:49:31,916

1174
00:49:33,716 --> 00:49:42,216
<font size="36">At that time, I felt a bit complicated inside, and it was actually a bit hard to adapt too,</font>

1175
00:49:43,616 --> 00:49:50,516
<font size="36">But Seok-joon said that Dad probably wrote it,</font>

00:49:51,016 --> 00:50:00,216
<font size="36">When I thought that and read it, I suddenly felt very comforted,</font>

1177
00:50:02,116 --> 00:50:07,516
<font size="36">Those contents were really the words I needed,</font>

1178
00:50:08,316 --> 00:50:16,216
<font size="36">They were very warm words, and Dad's image appeared in my mind.</font>

1179
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:17,416
<font size="36">With such a heart.</font>

1180
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:21,216
<font size="36">So, I think I was very emotional at that moment.</font>

1194

<font size="36">Actually, for me,</font>

1195
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,191
<font size="36">When Shin-hyang was young,</font>

1196
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:06,991
<font size="36">I always felt guilty for not being able to give my child as much as other children.</font>

1197
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:14,191
<font size="36">Now, seeing her, she has grown up so much better than what I couldn't do, so I am truly grateful.</font>

<font size="36">Yes.</font>

<font size="36">What are you talking about? You raised him well.</font>

1202
00:51:25,991 --> 00:51:27,391
<font size="36">I wrote it a bit excessively.</font>

1203
00:51:28,991 --> 00:51:30,191
<font size="36">What about our Jun-ho?</font>

1204
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:31,191
<font size="36">Ah, finally.</font>

1205
00:51:32,391 --> 00:51:33,591
<font size="36">But for me, this is a bit</font>

1206
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:37,891
<font size="36">Anyone who sees it will only think of one person.</font>

1207
00:51:37,891 --> 00:51:38,391
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1208
00:51:38,591 --> 00:51:41,391
<font size="36">Uh, does Jun-ho think of Dad?</font>

1209
00:51:42,591 --> 00:51:44,191
<font size="36">Jun-ho is my close younger brother.</font>

1210
00:51:44,891 --> 00:51:48,191
<font size="36">Jun-ho, in short, is a wild beast. Be careful.</font>

1211
00:51:49,891 --> 00:51:53,391
<font size="36">Although he looks gentle, he is very resilient.</font>

1212
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:57,191
<font size="36">Although he looks skinny, he's very good at exercising.</font>

1213
00:51:57,891 --> 00:52:02,591
<font size="36">Even if he pretends to listen to everything, he is a person with strong leadership, always leading things his way.</font>

1214
00:52:03,191 --> 00:52:03,891
<font size="36">Terrible perseverance.</font>

1215
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:07,391
<font size="36">The weakness is that sometimes it becomes stubbornness.</font>

1216
00:52:10,391 --> 00:52:12,191
<font size="36">Bro, good luck.</font>

1217
00:52:12,891 --> 00:52:16,591
<font size="36">Ah, he absolutely hates littering or spitting.</font>

1218
00:52:16,891 --> 00:52:19,891
<font size="36">He adheres to public ethics and manners very strictly.</font>

1219
00:52:19,891 --> 00:52:20,391
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1220
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:25,391
<font size="36">Anyone who doesn't want to be close to Jun-ho, just spit on the street every time you meet Jun-ho.</font>

1221
00:52:26,891 --> 00:52:27,391
<font size="36">That's it.</font>

1222
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:29,391
<font size="36">Hey, that's Park Hosan's style.</font>

1223
00:52:33,391 --> 00:52:35,191
<font size="36">This isn't my younger brother? It's my older brother?</font>

1224
00:52:35,591 --> 00:52:36,891
<font size="36">It seems like a close older brother wrote it.</font>

1225
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:37,391
<font size="36">Older brother?</font>

1226
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:39,391
<font size="36">He's the closest older brother but the tone.</font>

1227
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:42,891
<font size="36">From this text, the tone is very clear.</font>

1228
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:43,591
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1229
00:52:43,891 --> 00:52:45,391
<font size="36">It's not Dad, but a close older brother.</font>

1230
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:48,191
<font size="36">Didn't he realize it even after I said it earlier?</font>

1231
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:55,391
<font size="36">When the question 'Didn't your parents write it?' was first asked, I actually reread it five times.</font>

1232
00:52:55,891 --> 00:52:58,391
<font size="36">But no matter how many times I read it, I still felt it was that older brother.</font>

1233
00:52:58,891 --> 00:52:59,891
<font size="36">It's perfect~</font>

1234
00:52:59,891 --> 00:53:00,891
<font size="36">That older brother, it's definitely that older brother.</font>

1235
00:53:01,591 --> 00:53:03,391
<font size="36">Ah, it's that older brother. Not Dad.</font>

1236
00:53:03,391 --> 00:53:04,191
<font size="36">It's perfect.</font>

1237
00:53:05,191 --> 00:53:13,891
<font size="36">Just by looking at the choice of words and the text, I was sure my closest older brother, Oh Jaemu, wrote it.</font>

1238
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:15,391
<font size="36">Truly 100%.</font>

1239
00:53:17,391 --> 00:53:18,391
<font size="36">Oh Jaemu hyung.</font>

1240
00:53:19,891 --> 00:53:22,191
<font size="36">I looked at it five times. Even after five times, I still</font>

1241
00:53:22,591 --> 00:53:26,391
<font size="36">But on graduation day, did you give flowers to all your classmates?</font>

1242
00:53:26,391 --> 00:53:27,391
<font size="36">Uh, that's right.</font>

1243
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:29,591
<font size="36">I found that quite impressive.</font>

1244
00:53:29,891 --> 00:53:31,894
<font size="36">Not all classmates,</font>

1245
00:53:31,904 --> 00:53:37,299
<font size="36">but some friends
whose circumstances I knew,</font>

1246
00:53:37,309 --> 00:53:43,004
<font size="36">for example, their parents were busy or something,</font>

1247
00:53:43,014 --> 00:53:46,108
<font size="36">- so I thought they might not be able to come.
- This makes me even more emotional.</font>

1248
00:53:46,118 --> 00:53:47,391
<font size="36">Wow, what a warm heart.</font>

1249
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,391
<font size="36">That's why everyone's so smitten with Sun-jun.</font>

1250
00:53:50,391 --> 00:53:51,191
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1251
00:53:51,891 --> 00:53:53,391
<font size="36">What about Seong-jun?</font>

1252
00:53:54,191 --> 00:53:55,391
<font size="36">He seems to be the least reactive person.</font>

1253
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:57,891
<font size="36">I can't guess who it is.</font>

1254
00:53:58,391 --> 00:53:59,591
<font size="36">I don't know who it is either.</font>

1255
00:53:59,591 --> 00:54:01,191
<font size="36">Still don't know.</font>

1256
00:54:05,264 --> 00:54:06,174
<font size="36">No way!!!</font>

1257
00:54:06,174 --> 00:54:07,774
<font size="36">No! Didn't AI write it?</font>

1258
00:54:08,544 --> 00:54:08,924
<font size="36">No.</font>

1259
00:54:09,404 --> 00:54:11,274
<font size="36">Uh, too, too, ah...</font>

1260
00:54:12,433 --> 00:54:13,503
<font size="36">But, this tone,</font>

1261
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:18,463
<font size="36">The choice of words is exactly like my closest older brother,</font>

1262
00:54:19,063 --> 00:54:19,543
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

1263
00:54:19,543 --> 00:54:23,743
<font size="36">So, yes, I think if it's not that older brother, I'll get goosebumps from Dad.</font>

1264
00:54:23,923 --> 00:54:25,363
<font size="36">I'll get goosebumps from Dad.</font>

1265
00:54:25,883 --> 00:54:26,923
<font size="36">Ah, if it really is</font>

1266
00:54:27,703 --> 00:54:28,763
<font size="36">If Dad wrote it</font>

1267
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:30,923
<font size="36">Ah, I'm surprised but very happy.</font>

1268
00:54:31,373 --> 00:54:32,033
<font size="36">Uh, ah, so?</font>

1269
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:32,893
<font size="36">It's perfect now.</font>

1270
00:54:33,433 --> 00:54:33,923
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1271
00:54:35,403 --> 00:54:37,063
<font size="36">Personally, I'm too...</font>

1272
00:54:38,163 --> 00:54:39,123
<font size="36">Disappointed, disappointed with Sa-yoon</font>

1273
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,063
<font size="36">Is there GPT?</font>

1274
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:42,783
<font size="36">Too, too disappointed. Too disappointed.</font>

1275
00:54:43,193 --> 00:54:44,793
<font size="36">Dad tried very hard to write it.</font>

1276
00:54:45,223 --> 00:54:49,923
<font size="36">Seriously, because normally she says, 'If it's for my siblings, I can die instead',</font>

1277
00:54:50,383 --> 00:54:53,923
<font size="36">And it was written so specifically,</font>

1278
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,763
<font size="36">How would AI know that?</font>

1279
00:54:56,253 --> 00:54:56,733
<font size="36">Ah, that's right.</font>

1280
00:54:57,063 --> 00:55:00,423
<font size="36">At that point, Sa-yoon should have shown some tears.</font>

1281
00:55:00,523 --> 00:55:03,163
<font size="36">He chose that part as the emotional highlight,</font>

1282
00:55:03,163 --> 00:55:04,963
<font size="36">If my daughter says it's AI there, what more is there to say?</font>

1283
00:55:04,963 --> 00:55:08,163
<font size="36">If she says AI wrote it there, oh, I'd be so disappointed.</font>

1284
00:55:08,893 --> 00:55:09,963
<font size="36">It's always too much.</font>

1285
00:55:10,513 --> 00:55:14,173
<font size="36">No, I don't know about other parents, but I didn't think of any emotional points.</font>

1286
00:55:14,173 --> 00:55:18,238
<font size="36">I just wrote it simply as an introduction to a friend.</font>

1287
00:55:18,473 --> 00:55:19,963
<font size="36">The content over there seems too long.</font>

1288
00:55:19,963 --> 00:55:21,473
<font size="36">Fathers with sons and fathers with daughters are different.</font>

1289
00:55:21,473 --> 00:55:21,963
<font size="36">That's truly why.</font>

1290
00:55:22,473 --> 00:55:22,963
<font size="36">It's miraculous.</font>

1291
00:55:24,431 --> 00:55:25,201
<font size="36">I have to change clothes.</font>

1292
00:55:25,541 --> 00:55:26,911
<font size="36">I have to change clothes.</font>

1293
00:55:28,796 --> 00:55:29,926
<font size="36">Are you very shocked?</font>

1294
00:55:30,386 --> 00:55:31,156
<font size="36">Are you very shocked?</font>

1295
00:55:31,556 --> 00:55:32,796
<font size="36">Uh... Uh...</font>

1296
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:34,855
<font size="36">Anyway, are they speaking informally?</font>

1297
00:55:36,296 --> 00:55:37,796
<font size="36">I need to keep some distance now.</font>

1298
00:55:40,226 --> 00:55:42,926
<font size="36">Ah, I also thought they were the same age.</font>

1299
00:55:44,806 --> 00:55:45,916
<font size="36">I'm so dazed.</font>

1300
00:55:47,756 --> 00:55:48,456
<font size="36">Born in 2000, right?</font>

1301
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:49,096
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1302
00:55:58,256 --> 00:56:00,796
<font size="36">Ah, but am I the only one who feels awkward again?</font>

1303
00:56:01,156 --> 00:56:02,515
<font size="36">Ah, I'm also a little</font>

1304
00:56:02,956 --> 00:56:03,756
<font size="36">It's starting over now.</font>

1305
00:56:04,156 --> 00:56:06,620
<font size="36">It feels like a fresh start, so</font>

1306
00:56:08,056 --> 00:56:09,456
<font size="36">If it starts over like this,</font>

1307
00:56:11,795 --> 00:56:16,830
<font size="36">How will their information affect each other?</font>

1308
00:56:19,145 --> 00:56:24,738
<font size="36">The deeper the night,</font>

1309
00:56:25,485 --> 00:56:25,785
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1310
00:56:25,785 --> 00:56:26,125
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1311
00:56:26,485 --> 00:56:26,915
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1312
00:56:27,345 --> 00:56:28,785
<font size="36">Ah, hey, the radio is starting to play again.</font>

1313
00:56:28,925 --> 00:56:31,845
<font size="36">Today, my children gathered in front of the radio again.</font>

1314
00:56:31,925 --> 00:56:37,484
<font size="36">I wonder what story will be told today.</font>

1315
00:56:39,155 --> 00:56:42,915
<font size="36">We often feel fluttery with the word 'first'.</font>

1316
00:56:43,915 --> 00:56:47,415
<font size="36">Is the reason 'first' makes us flutter because we are all clumsy?</font>

1317
00:56:49,115 --> 00:56:52,415
<font size="36">Did you also have an unforgettable 'first date' today?</font>

1318
00:56:54,115 --> 00:56:56,715
<font size="36">If someone crosses your mind right now,</font>

1319
00:56:56,915 --> 00:57:01,942
<font size="36">Record and send the tape containing your heart into their locker.</font>

1320
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:04,144
<font size="36">It's starting.</font>

1321
00:57:05,302 --> 00:57:06,112
<font size="36">The second tape.</font>

1322
00:57:06,432 --> 00:57:07,612
<font size="36">Now this is the real deal.</font>

1323
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:09,560
<font size="36">This, this is the real deal.</font>

1324
00:57:10,822 --> 00:57:12,722
<font size="36">Hey, now we know the ages too.</font>

1325
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:14,982
<font size="36">Now we have to address each other according to our ages.</font>

1326
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:19,102
<font size="36">Tak-soo was the first to record.</font>

1327
00:57:21,052 --> 00:57:22,912
<font size="36">Since he had two dates again today,</font>

1328
00:57:23,872 --> 00:57:26,882
<font size="36">I wonder how his heart will change.</font>

1329
00:57:27,537 --> 00:57:28,917
<font size="36">Sigh~ Here it comes again.</font>

1330
00:57:31,507 --> 00:57:31,807
<font size="36">Sigh.</font>

1331
00:57:36,457 --> 00:57:36,757
<font size="36">Sigh.</font>

1332
00:57:37,627 --> 00:57:39,327
<font size="36">Tak-soo keeps sighing.</font>

1333
00:57:44,397 --> 00:57:45,927
<font size="36">I think I thought more.</font>

1334
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:48,997
<font size="36">Talking with Shin-hyang,</font>

1335
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,417
<font size="36">When talking about areas of interest, they talked very well together.</font>

1336
00:57:51,737 --> 00:57:53,947
<font size="36">When talking with Soo-wan, I felt a bit more relaxed.</font>

1337
00:57:54,377 --> 00:57:55,877
<font size="36">Felt very comfortable.</font>

1338
00:57:56,427 --> 00:57:58,847
<font size="36">Ah, it's really hard, I don't know what to do.</font>

1339
00:58:00,721 --> 00:58:04,471
<font size="36">Shin-hyang also fell into thought.</font>

1340
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:08,001
<font size="36">When dating, during dinner,</font>

1341
00:58:08,471 --> 00:58:10,701
<font size="36">I thought I should try it once.</font>

1342
00:58:11,411 --> 00:58:13,071
<font size="36">Just then, I had to go out.</font>

1343
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:16,111
<font size="36">Conversely, talking with Jun-ho,</font>

1344
00:58:17,101 --> 00:58:18,901
<font size="36">It seems to have made me feel refreshed.</font>

1345
00:58:19,901 --> 00:58:21,721
<font size="36">I was very conflicted.</font>

1346
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:25,101
<font size="36">Ah, I don't know anymore.</font>

1347
00:58:26,491 --> 00:58:27,101
<font size="36">I don't know.</font>

1348

1501
01:06:38,433 --> 01:06:39,533
<font size="36">But I couldn't hear it.</font>

1502
01:06:40,233 --> 01:06:40,633

<font size="36">What's wrong?</font>

1505
01:06:43,133 --> 01:06:45,933

So I seemed a bit conflicted.</font>

1608

1610

01:16:21,133 --> 01:16:26,605
<font size="36">(Lost in thought for a long time)</font>

1643
01:16:27,463 --> 01:16:30,943
<font size="36">(Sun-jun couldn't record immediately)</font>

1644
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:32,783
<font size="36">Sun-jun must have had a really hard time.</font>

1645
01:16:33,033 --> 01:16:33,453
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1646
01:16:35,433 --> 01:16:38,117
<font size="36">(Today, morning)</font>

1647
01:16:38,217 --> 01:16:42,833
<font size="36">(When Sa-yoon and Seong-jun became close)</font>

1648
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:48,127
<font size="36">(Sun-jun could only watch)</font>

1649
01:16:48,633 --> 01:16:54,099
<font size="36">I felt that goodwill was heading in a different direction, so</font>

1650
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:55,933
<font size="36">Should I give up?</font>

1651
01:16:57,133 --> 01:17:00,033
<font size="36">Anyway, I still followed my heart.</font>

1652
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:04,833
<font size="36">..Sun-jun prepared for the date in the best way.</font>

1653
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:12,151
<font size="36">But it's inevitable that hearts don't align.</font>

1654
01:17:19,746 --> 01:17:20,296
<font size="36">Uh...</font>

1655
01:17:21,116 --> 01:17:22,826
<font size="36">I really thought a lot.</font>

1656
01:17:23,976 --> 01:17:24,546
<font size="36">Hmm...</font>

1657
01:17:28,606 --> 01:17:31,876
<font size="36">There's only one person I think of.</font>

1658
01:17:34,976 --> 01:17:36,916
<font size="36">When we're together,</font>

1659
01:17:37,216 --> 01:17:41,416
<font size="36">He's the most comfortable and fun person, so...</font>

1660
01:17:43,836 --> 01:17:46,576
<font size="36">I will also follow my heart.</font>

1661
01:17:48,986 --> 01:17:50,216
<font size="36">And act.</font>

1662
01:17:52,836 --> 01:17:54,916
<font size="36">So, if today,</font>

1663
01:17:55,646 --> 01:17:56,976
<font size="36">or</font>

1664
01:17:57,530 --> 01:18:01,316
<font size="36">If something happens later, I'm sorry.</font>

1665
01:18:02,116 --> 01:18:08,416
<font size="36">In case you have any other feelings, even the slightest possibility,</font>

1666
01:18:09,416 --> 01:18:11,216
<font size="36">Just follow your heart.</font>

1667
01:18:12,216 --> 01:18:15,616
<font size="36">I hope you act accordingly.</font>

1668
01:18:16,116 --> 01:18:17,116
<font size="36">I support you.</font>

1669
01:18:20,618 --> 01:18:21,338
<font size="36">Ah, what is this.</font>

1670
01:18:22,188 --> 01:18:23,718
<font size="36">So loyal until now.</font>

1671
01:18:29,116 --> 01:18:32,416
<font size="36">And now the food you didn't eat earlier.</font>

1672
01:18:35,116 --> 01:18:37,216
<font size="36">Pound cheesecake and</font>

1673
01:18:38,916 --> 01:18:40,816
<font size="36">I packed the salted sesame bread here.</font>

1674
01:18:41,716 --> 01:18:48,916
<font size="36">Uh, the cheesecake I hid behind the spaghetti plate in the refrigerator.</font>

1675
01:18:49,716 --> 01:18:51,216
<font size="36">If you want to eat it,</font>

1676
01:18:52,516 --> 01:18:56,616
<font size="36">Please let me know, thank you.</font>

1677
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:16,916
<font size="36">Because you said you liked tulips during our date,</font>

1678
01:19:19,316 --> 01:19:20,016
<font size="36">to remember it.</font>

1679
01:19:20,416 --> 01:19:22,816
<font size="36">I drew tulips trying to make them look similar.</font>

1680
01:19:37,868 --> 01:19:38,338
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

1681
01:19:38,638 --> 01:19:39,138
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

1682
01:19:58,616 --> 01:20:02,616
<font size="36">So, did I leave without dating?</font>

1683
01:20:03,016 --> 01:20:05,424
<font size="36">Knowing that,</font>

1684
01:20:05,524 --> 01:20:07,636
<font size="36">I feel unhappy. Moreover.</font>

1685
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:10,036
<font size="36">And the most precious thing is gratitude.</font>

1686
01:20:10,236 --> 01:20:14,136
<font size="36">He really packed everything like that.</font>

1687
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:19,436
<font size="36">Even though he might feel unhappy about not being able to date.</font>

1688
01:20:19,936 --> 01:20:21,836
<font size="36">You did very well.</font>

1689
01:20:22,436 --> 01:20:23,836
<font size="36">So, it was the same when I returned.</font>

1690
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:25,836
<font size="36">And it was the same when I heard the message.</font>

1691
01:20:26,236 --> 01:20:28,336
<font size="36">I think I thought a lot.</font>

1692
01:21:05,936 --> 01:21:06,436
<font size="36">Why.</font>

1693
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:07,336
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

1694
01:21:07,636 --> 01:21:08,336
<font size="36">But why didn't you come?</font>

1695
01:21:08,736 --> 01:21:09,936
<font size="36">I was waiting for you.</font>

1696
01:21:10,536 --> 01:21:11,736
<font size="36">We were going to hang out. Luckily.</font>

1697
01:21:12,336 --> 01:21:13,936
<font size="36">Hey, it changed in just one day.</font>

1698
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:15,136
<font size="36">The reason is too strange.</font>

1699
01:21:16,736 --> 01:21:17,136
<font size="36">Uh.</font>

1700
01:21:17,736 --> 01:21:20,036
<font size="36">It feels like they're sticking together.</font>

1701
01:21:20,936 --> 01:21:22,936
<font size="36">I guess they'll decide after talking.</font>

1702
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:24,636
<font size="36">Oppa sent the tape, right?</font>

1703
01:21:25,036 --> 01:21:25,236
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1704
01:21:26,436 --> 01:21:27,936
<font size="36">I'll just keep showing it.</font>

1705
01:21:28,436 --> 01:21:29,336
<font size="36">A little worried.</font>

1706
01:21:29,636 --> 01:21:30,836
<font size="36">I guess I'll watch something.</font>

1707
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,936
<font size="36">Wow! Oh!</font>
