00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:21,003
<font size="36">Message to everyone</font>

2
00:00:21,303 --> 00:00:23,634
<font size="36">Today is the first date day where the guys will ask people out.</font>

3
00:00:24,143 --> 00:00:25,734
<font size="36">Dates will be in order of who arrives first,</font>

4
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:28,993
<font size="36">If the person you want is already matched, you must ask someone else.</font>

5
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:31,724
<font size="36">However, the girls cannot refuse a date invitation.</font>

6
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,133
<font size="36">Ah!</font>

7
00:00:35,343 --> 00:00:35,953
<font size="36">Oh, it's first come, first served?</font>

8
00:00:36,423 --> 00:00:36,982
<font size="36">I guess I have to be fast.</font>

9
00:00:37,182 --> 00:00:38,012
<font size="36">Oh, if it's first come, first served, then...</font>

10
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:41,423
<font size="36">If I want to date the woman I like, I have to be quick.</font>

11
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:48,753
<font size="36">As soon as I read the message, the first person I thought of was...</font>

12
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,298
<font size="36">Do you want to go bowling?</font>

13
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:52,899
<font size="36">Bowling?</font>

14
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:53,118
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

15
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:55,198
<font size="36">I'm really going to beat you.</font>

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,014
<font size="36">I'll beat you.</font>

17
00:00:58,198 --> 00:00:58,759
<font size="36">See you.</font>

18
00:01:00,323 --> 00:01:01,813
<font size="36">Oh, how lucky.</font>

19
00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:07,018
<font size="36">Who did you ask out?</font>

20
00:01:07,227 --> 00:01:07,617
<font size="36">Seok-joo.</font>

21
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:08,117
<font size="36">Seok-joo.</font>

22
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:13,878
<font size="36">Are you on the 1st or 2nd floor?</font>

23
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:15,668
<font size="36">Me?</font>

24
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:16,018
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

25
00:01:20,457 --> 00:01:20,888
<font size="36">Where are you?</font>

26
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:21,457
<font size="36">Down here?</font>

27
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:22,328
<font size="36">Ah, I'm on the 1st floor.</font>

28
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:29,188
<font size="36">Oh, I'm Sa-yoon.</font>

29
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:30,013
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

30
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:32,716
<font size="36">- 1st floor.
- Sa-yoon.</font>

31
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:38,957
<font size="36">Oh, when I received the message, I thought I had to go see Sa-yoon.</font>

32
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:41,018
<font size="36">Sun-jun.</font>

33
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:46,438
<font size="36">Ah, hey, is it Sun-jun or Seong-jun?</font>

34
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:51,347
<font size="36">Sun-jun has a slight advantage. Because he's on the same 1st floor.</font>

35
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:52,388
<font size="36">I'm counting on you.</font>

36
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:54,087
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

37
00:01:54,537 --> 00:01:55,188
<font size="36">Let's go, let's go.</font>

38
00:01:55,558 --> 00:01:55,817
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

39
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:58,867
<font size="36">Okay, Seong-jun is gone.</font>

40
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:00,018
<font size="36">Gone, gone, gone.</font>

41
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:01,018
<font size="36">Gone, gone, gone.</font>

42
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:02,248
<font size="36">What should I do?</font>

43
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:03,048
<font size="36">Sun-jun.</font>

44
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:03,888
<font size="36">You have to leave the room, Sun-jun.</font>

45
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:05,018
<font size="36">Outside the door</font>

46
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:05,487
<font size="36">Sun-jun.</font>

47
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:07,018
<font size="36">You have to open the door, you have to open the door.</font>

48
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:07,438
<font size="36">No, Sun-jun.</font>

49
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:09,448
<font size="36">You're still very flustered.</font>

50
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:12,018
<font size="36">You have to open the door and go out for things to happen.</font>

51
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:13,288
<font size="36">Ah, that's right. Hurry up.</font>

52
00:02:14,578 --> 00:02:15,568
<font size="36">That's right. You have to open the door and go out.</font>

53
00:02:15,788 --> 00:02:16,008
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

54
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:16,388
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

55
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:16,687
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

56
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:18,617
<font size="36">Seong-jun was faster.</font>

57
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:20,027
<font size="36">Sun-jun.</font>

58
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:20,818
<font size="36">You have to go out, that's right. You have to go out, you have to go out.</font>

59
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:21,788
<font size="36">Go out, go out.</font>

60
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:22,798
<font size="36">Is it Sun-jun?</font>

61
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:23,768
<font size="36">It's Sun-jun.</font>

62
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:24,818
<font size="36">No, no, no. Still...</font>

63
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:25,867
<font size="36">No, no, still.</font>

64
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:28,187
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

65
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:29,388
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

66
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:29,888
<font size="36">Oh, what is it?</font>

67
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:32,068
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

68
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:40,288
<font size="36">Sa... Sa-yoon.</font>

69
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:42,018
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

70
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:42,388
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

71
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:44,018
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

72
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:44,388
<font size="36">Sun-jun arrived first</font>

73
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:45,888
<font size="36">Sun-jun was one step faster!</font>

74
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:47,918
<font size="36">Oh, the difference was truly by a hair's breadth.</font>

75
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:49,397
<font size="36">Ah, Seong-jun is too late.</font>

76
00:02:50,568 --> 00:02:51,288
<font size="36">Sun-jun was faster.</font>

77
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:52,018
<font size="36">Ah, too late, too late.</font>

78
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:53,207
<font size="36">That's my son.</font>

79
00:02:53,518 --> 00:02:55,198
<font size="36">That's my son~</font>

80
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:56,828
<font size="36">Sa... Sa-yoon.</font>

81
00:02:58,747 --> 00:03:01,598
<font size="36">Can we talk for a bit?</font>

82
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:01,948
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

83
00:03:02,397 --> 00:03:03,487
<font size="36">Talk for a bit...</font>

84
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,091
<font size="36">Can we?</font>

85
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:05,721
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

86
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:06,941
<font size="36">Ah!</font>

87
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,279
<font size="36">They're listening.</font>

88
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:10,701
<font size="36">They're eavesdropping.</font>

89
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:13,031
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

90
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:14,041
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

91
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:16,531
<font size="36">Sa... Sa-yoon.</font>

92
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:19,441
<font size="36">Can we talk for a bit?</font>

93
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:20,141
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

94
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:25,531
<font size="36">Today...</font>

95
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:27,941
<font size="36">Do you want to go eat something delicious?</font>

96
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:29,381
<font size="36">Sure, delicious food.</font>

97
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:30,101
<font size="36">Ah, yes.</font>

98
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:30,361
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

99
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:31,181
<font size="36">Great.</font>

100
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:32,221
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

101
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:34,441
<font size="36">Oh, Sa-yoon's expression is fine, isn't it?</font>

102
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:35,531
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

103
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:36,671
<font size="36">No, she seems very happy, doesn't she?</font>

104
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:37,361
<font size="36">Her expression is quite good.</font>

105
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:51,971
<font size="36">Oh Seong-jun, oh oh Seong-jun, oh.</font>

106
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:52,411
<font size="36">What should Seong-jun do?</font>

107
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:53,671
<font size="36">What is he doing...</font>

108
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:54,711
<font size="36">Seong-jun.</font>

109
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:55,531
<font size="36">Ah, what should Seong-jun do?</font>

110
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:56,771
<font size="36">Seong-jun...</font>

111
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:57,591
<font size="36">Ah, what should Seong-jun do?</font>

112
00:03:57,591 --> 00:03:58,671
<font size="36">What should Seong-jun do?</font>

113
00:03:59,231 --> 00:03:59,841
<font size="36">Oh, so pitiful.</font>

114
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:00,961
<font size="36">Ah...</font>

115
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:01,611
<font size="36">Ah...</font>

116
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:02,871
<font size="36">Oh. Yes.</font>

117
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,071
<font size="36">Seong-jun should hurry up.</font>

118
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:08,871
<font size="36">Hmm...</font>

119
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:10,151
<font size="36">Pfft...</font>

120
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:14,471
<font size="36">Hmm... Please wait a moment.</font>

121
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:23,551
<font size="36">Ah...</font>

122
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:24,571
<font size="36">Yes?</font>

123
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:25,111
<font size="36">What's wrong, what's wrong?</font>

124
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:26,771
<font size="36">Ah, I...</font>

125
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:27,851
<font size="36">No, I...</font>

126
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,081
<font size="36">I'm too late.</font>

127
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:31,801
<font size="36">Really?</font>

128
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:34,531
<font size="36">No, when I entered (the 1st floor)</font>

129
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,241
<font size="36">I already heard (someone else) asking for a date, I heard it.</font>

130
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:39,671
<font size="36">Ah...</font>

131
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:41,091
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

132
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:45,511
<font size="36">That person's name echoed along with the phrase 'Do you want to go on a date?' like that.</font>

133
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:51,751
<font size="36">Oh...</font>

134
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,771
<font size="36">Oh, but the timing difference was truly by a hair's breadth.</font>

135
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:54,671
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

136
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:55,771
<font size="36">Who was it, who was it?</font>

137
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:57,171
<font size="36">Sun... Sun-jun.</font>

138
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:57,531
<font size="36">Sun-jun?</font>

139
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:58,171
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

140
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:00,771
<font size="36">Because they're on different floors, this...</font>

141
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:03,531
<font size="36">Ah, I have to be faster, like this.</font>

142
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:07,671
<font size="36">I realized I shouldn't have been watching.</font>

143
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:09,531
<font size="36">That's right~</font>

144
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:11,171
<font size="36">I was too relaxed.</font>

145
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:11,671
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

146
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:13,971
<font size="36">Like Jun-ho, just go straight, and then what?</font>

147
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:14,671
<font size="36">Ah...</font>

148
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:15,171
<font size="36">I realized.</font>

149
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:16,171
<font size="36">It's okay, it's okay.</font>

150
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:16,671
<font size="36">Ah...</font>

151
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:18,671
<font size="36">Is Dad okay, anyway?</font>

152
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:19,671
<font size="36">It's okay.</font>

153
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:21,371
<font size="36">Ah, Dad, Seong-jun is okay.</font>

154
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:25,771
<font size="36">Oh, I went and asked Sa-yoon out already.</font>

155
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:26,071
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

156
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:28,271
<font size="36">Oh, but just now...</font>

157
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:33,171
<font size="36">Right before we talked, I heard a door open over there, didn't I?</font>

158
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:34,371
<font size="36">Really?</font>

159
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:36,471
<font size="36">Oh, Jun-ho heard it.</font>

160
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,671
<font size="36">Well, it can't be helped then. Because it's first come, first served.</font>

161
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:40,671
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

162
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:41,671
<font size="36">Because it's first come, first served.</font>

163
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:42,371
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

164
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:43,971
<font size="36">Well done, Sun-jun.</font>

165
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:44,571
<font size="36">Ah, so that's how it is.</font>

166
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:45,271
<font size="36">Ah...</font>

167
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:51,371
<font size="36">I mustered all my courage to ask Sa-yoon to go eat something delicious.</font>

168
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:54,571
<font size="36">I... lured her with food.</font>

169
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:57,747
<font size="36">So cute.</font>

170
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:59,315
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

171
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:03,671
<font size="36">Finally, someone asked me out,</font>

172
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:05,071
<font size="36">I was very happy. And</font>

173
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:06,871
<font size="36">because he invited me to eat delicious food together,</font>

174
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:08,452
<font size="36">so I agreed.</font>

175
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:11,922
<font size="36">Oh, Sa-yeon's expression isn't bad at all.</font>

176
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:14,832
<font size="36">Sa-yeon is also grinning widely now.</font>

177
00:06:15,352 --> 00:06:17,562
<font size="36">Today, they said we're going to eat delicious food, so I have to wear loose clothes.</font>

178
00:06:18,202 --> 00:06:20,672
<font size="36">So I can eat until my stomach is full before coming back.</font>

179
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,262
<font size="36">Doesn't Sa-yeon eat enough?</font>

180
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:24,962
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

181
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:27,332
<font size="36">What nonsense.</font>

182
00:06:28,392 --> 00:06:30,932
<font size="36">She comes right out when she hears about delicious food.</font>

183
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:34,651
<font size="36">- Ah, food is her weakness.
- She said she'll eat until she's full and then come back.</font>

184
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:42,012
<font size="36">He must be very confused right now.</font>

185
00:06:43,162 --> 00:06:45,162
<font size="36">Seong-jun, I'm sorry. What should I do?</font>

186
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:47,162
<font size="36">Ah, this was unexpected.</font>

187
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:50,382
<font size="36">Ah, so I have to hurry too?</font>

188
00:06:50,762 --> 00:06:51,152
<font size="36">What should I do?</font>

189
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:53,882
<font size="36">You have to hurry, Tak-soo.</font>

190
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:55,532
<font size="36">Hurry up.</font>

191
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:57,142
<font size="36">I'm too late.</font>

192
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:04,752
<font size="36">Oh, Tak-soo is gone.</font>

193
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:11,182
<font size="36">So now it's just Shin-hyang and Soo-wan, right?</font>

194
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:11,752
<font size="36">That's right, that's right.</font>

195
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:12,052
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

196
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:16,972
<font size="36">The person who made the biggest first impression on me was probably Soo-wan.</font>

197
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:20,772
<font size="36">Shin-hyang seems to have a lot of hobbies like mine,</font>

198
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:22,422
<font size="36">so I want to get to know her better.</font>

199
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:23,922
<font size="36">Please help me.</font>

200
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:30,852
<font size="36">It seems an unseen love triangle has begun.</font>

201
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:35,922
<font size="36">I was very surprised that you have the same hobbies as me.</font>

202
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:41,832
<font size="36">Same room.</font>

203
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:47,792
<font size="36">Ah, what should I do?</font>

204
00:07:56,822 --> 00:07:57,622
<font size="36">Want to go on a date?</font>

205
00:07:58,932 --> 00:07:59,422
<font size="36">With whom? With whom?</font>

206
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,772
<font size="36">With whom? With whom? Say the name!</font>

207
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:02,232
<font size="36">Please...</font>

208
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:04,152
<font size="36">Want to go on a date?</font>

209
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:11,932
<font size="36">Ah, Shin-hyang.</font>

210
00:08:13,852 --> 00:08:14,822
<font size="36">I have to change my clothes too.</font>

211
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:15,052
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

212
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:15,312
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

213
00:08:15,752 --> 00:08:17,812
<font size="36">Ah, what should I do? Soo-wan's expression is not good at all.</font>

214
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:19,932
<font size="36">Ah, Director Cheol.</font>

215
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:22,832
<font size="36">Ah, what should I, what should I do?</font>

216
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:24,962
<font size="36">Ah, he must be very pitiful.</font>

217
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:26,872
<font size="36">Ah, I really want to open the door and go out.</font>

218
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:27,492
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

219
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:29,442
<font size="36">Sorry. Ah.</font>

220
00:08:31,882 --> 00:08:32,382
<font size="36">10:10.</font>

221
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:33,182
<font size="36">At 10 minutes past.</font>

222
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:33,402
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

223
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,822
<font size="36">I asked Shin-hyang, the person I talked to a lot last night, on a date.</font>

224
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:41,952
<font size="36">Talking on the way back from the market was actually everything,</font>

225
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:46,152
<font size="36">so I want to learn more about her on the date.</font>

226
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:47,332
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

227
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:49,885
<font size="36">Q: How does it feel to be asked on a date?
Hmm.</font>

228
00:08:50,342 --> 00:08:51,342
<font size="36">Great.</font>

229
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:53,882
<font size="36">But it seems...</font>

230
00:08:55,992 --> 00:08:58,232
<font size="36">It seems he will come...</font>

231
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:00,932
<font size="36">Ah. Anyway,</font>

232
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:02,032
<font size="36">Ah, I have a feeling.</font>

233
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,808
<font size="36">Actually, I wasn't expecting it that much,</font>

234
00:09:04,808 --> 00:09:07,388
<font size="36">I just thought 'When will he come?'</font>

235
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:10,128
<font size="36">That's what I thought.</font>

236
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:13,348
<font size="36">Been single since childhood but</font>

237
00:09:13,348 --> 00:09:15,979
<font size="36">(Been single since childhood and yet has good intuition?)
Amazing intuition. Right?</font>

238
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:18,008
<font size="36">Even if you've been single since childhood, you should still be able to feel it.</font>

239
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:20,988
<font size="36">Being a person, how could you not feel it? Absurd.</font>

240
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:24,118
<font size="36">Oh, this is too inconvenient. Because they're in the same room.</font>

241
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,408
<font size="36">I also... I also feel a bit uncomfortable now.</font>

242
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:30,598
<font size="36">If we could switch places for a bit...</font>

243
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:36,528
<font size="36">Ah, 10:20?</font>

244
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:37,008
<font size="36">10:20.</font>

245
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:37,708
<font size="36">20 minutes.</font>

246
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:39,308
<font size="36">That...</font>

247
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:39,708
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

248
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:40,828
<font size="36">Going by bike?</font>

249
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:41,308
<font size="36">I don't know.</font>

250
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:41,688
<font size="36">You don't know?</font>

251
00:09:41,968 --> 00:09:42,368
<font size="36">You don't know? Is it a secret?</font>

252
00:09:42,368 --> 00:09:43,008
<font size="36">Secret, secret.</font>

253
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:43,308
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

254
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:49,408
<font size="36">Pants or skirt.</font>

255
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:49,908
<font size="36">Wear a skirt.</font>

256
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:52,308
<font size="36">I need to know that to do it. Ah, damn it.</font>

257
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:56,308
<font size="36">Ah, what should I do? Soo-wan's expression is not good at all.</font>

258
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:56,808
<font size="36">It's not good, is it.</font>

259
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:58,508
<font size="36">Oh, that's right. Yes.</font>

260
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:02,788
<font size="36">At that time, I actually had a little hope,</font>

261
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:05,908
<font size="36">so I was a little... regretful.</font>

262
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:07,008
<font size="36">His expression is not good at all now.</font>

263
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:08,808
<font size="36">That expression is really not good at all.</font>

264
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:17,908
<font size="36">Have you asked someone out yet?</font>

265
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:18,308
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

266
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:19,008
<font size="36">Yes, I succeeded.</font>

267
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:20,808
<font size="36">Who did you ask out?</font>

268
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:23,008
<font size="36">Me?</font>

269
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:23,208
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

270
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:24,808
<font size="36">Shin-hyang...</font>

271
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:26,008
<font size="36">Ah, Shin-hyang!</font>

272
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:30,008
<font size="36">Hmm... Okay. If you're asking Shin-hyang out then...</font>

273
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:35,708
<font size="36">Seong-jun, just go straight!</font>

274
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,208
<font size="36">Oh, 2nd floor already.</font>

275
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:38,508
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

276
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:39,208
<font size="36">Ah, Soo-wan, Soo-wan.</font>

277
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:39,708
<font size="36">Soo-wan, Soo-wan.</font>

278
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:40,208
<font size="36">It's Soo-wan.</font>

279
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:40,708
<font size="36">Ah, it's Soo-wan.</font>

280
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:45,108
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

281
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:53,908
<font size="36">Do you want to go on a date with me...</font>

282
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:55,008
<font size="36">What time...?</font>

283
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:57,208
<font size="36">Around 20 minutes.</font>

<font size="36">10:20.</font>

289
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:06,308
<font size="36">Seong-jun, I'm counting on you.</font>

290
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:07,208
<font size="36">That's a happy ending.</font>

291
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,008
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

292
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,708
<font size="36">What should we do?</font>

293
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:28,711
<font size="36">(Bad expression)
What's wrong? Why?</font>

294
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:31,208
<font size="36">Not yet...</font>

295
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:34,408
<font size="36">Because only one day has passed,</font>

296
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:39,408
<font size="36">I thought that no matter who came, it would be fun, but</font>

297
00:11:46,808 --> 00:11:48,408
<font size="36">actually, as soon as I read the message,</font>

298

<font size="36">Ah!</font>

303
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:00,908
<font size="36">Ah, this, this, this is inconvenient again.</font>

304

<font size="36">Even the parents are awkward</font>

305
00:12:03,508 --> 00:12:05,008

00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:15,152
<font size="36">If he wanted to ask me on a date,</font>

309
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:17,742
<font size="36">shouldn't he have asked sooner?</font>

310
00:12:18,382 --> 00:12:19,702
<font size="36">So it's really a bit...</font>

311
00:12:20,102 --> 00:12:21,202
<font size="36">Something like that...</font>

312
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:23,972
<font size="36">I don't know if he thought it was too late and didn't come</font>

313
00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:29,002
<font size="36">or if he just wanted to date different people</font>

314
00:12:29,712 --> 00:12:30,742
<font size="36">Because I don't know...</font>

315
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:32,582
<font size="36">I want to know.</font>

316
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:37,002
<font size="36">No, because it could be a misunderstanding.</font>

317
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:40,322
<font size="36">Because he thought the cassette was already given yesterday, so he didn't come to ask.</font>

318
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:41,352
<font size="36">Ah, as for Sa-yeon.</font>

319
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:42,512
<font size="36">That's right. It could be like that.</font>

320
00:12:44,652 --> 00:12:45,742
<font size="36">Because he was afraid someone else had already chosen.</font>

321
00:12:47,202 --> 00:12:47,572
<font size="36">That's why.</font>

322
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:48,602
<font size="36">Shall we go quickly?</font>

323
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:52,002
<font size="36">Ah, that's right. Why did I do that?</font>

324
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:53,902
<font size="36">I regret it so much.</font>

325
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:07,602
<font size="36">Seong-jun is worried.</font>

326
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:15,902
<font size="36">What is it, what is it?</font>

327
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:18,602
<font size="36">Huh? The two of them met.</font>

328
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,002
<font size="36">Didn't even greet each other.</font>

329
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:24,402
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

330
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:25,802
<font size="36">Oh, how awkward.</font>

331
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:26,302
<font size="36">Oh, what should I do?</font>

332
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:27,602
<font size="36">Why didn't they greet each other?</font>

333
00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:48,602
<font size="36">Aren't you hungry?</font>

334
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:49,802
<font size="36">Ah, tomatoes.</font>

335
00:13:49,802 --> 00:13:51,602
<font size="36">Ah, you eat. I already ate.</font>

336
00:13:52,102 --> 00:13:52,302
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

337
00:13:53,202 --> 00:13:54,602
<font size="36">Hey, Sa-yoon started the conversation first.</font>

338
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:04,202
<font size="36">Quite a lot of frowning, huh.</font>

339
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:06,802
<font size="36">But this wasn't picked from somewhere, right?</font>

340
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:07,602
<font size="36">No.</font>

341
00:14:07,802 --> 00:14:08,102
<font size="36">No.</font>

342
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:10,002
<font size="36">Bought from the supermarket already.</font>

343
00:14:10,302 --> 00:14:10,602
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

344
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:18,402
<font size="36">It seems Seong-jun silently doesn't know how to date.</font>

345
00:14:18,402 --> 00:14:18,802
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

346
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,802
<font size="36">So, the cassette tape</font>

347
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:26,502
<font size="36">Have you tried using that cassette tape?</font>

348
00:14:27,002 --> 00:14:27,602
<font size="36">No, first time.</font>

349
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:28,302
<font size="36">First time, right?</font>

350
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,002
<font size="36">Yes, it's the first time.</font>

351
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,602
<font size="36">Ah, I heard it clearly.</font>

352
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:32,602
<font size="36">Ah, I heard it clearly.</font>

353
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:33,702
<font size="36">Ah, me too.</font>

354
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:34,602
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

355
00:14:38,102 --> 00:14:38,702
<font size="36">Ah, me too.</font>

356
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:40,602
<font size="36">Ah, yes.</font>

357
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:42,002
<font size="36">They're so cute, those two.</font>

358
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:47,302
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

359
00:14:48,202 --> 00:14:50,502
<font size="36">First, they confirmed what was shown, now it's mutual.</font>

360
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:50,902
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

361
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:51,202
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

362
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:54,502
<font size="36">Because I said I definitely had to eat sashimi.</font>

363
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:56,502
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

364
00:14:57,902 --> 00:14:58,702
<font size="36">Yes, let's eat.</font>

365
00:14:59,002 --> 00:14:59,302
<font size="36">Huh, huh!</font>

366
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:00,502
<font size="36">It's a straight shot.</font>

367
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:02,022
<font size="36">Let's eat.</font>

368
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:10,703
<font size="36">Why didn't you say we went before that?</font>

369
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:11,423
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

370
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:12,453
<font size="36">Why can't he talk about that?</font>

371
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:15,391
<font size="36">He already felt it.</font>

372
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:16,011
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

373
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:16,721
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

374
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:17,861
<font size="36">Oh, because I'm full already.</font>

375
00:15:18,011 --> 00:15:18,591
<font size="36">Because I'm full already.</font>

376
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:19,631
<font size="36">No, seven?</font>

377
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:25,572
<font size="36">Can't come.</font>

378
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:27,754
<font size="36">Hmm, like Ciabatta?</font>

379
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:28,824
<font size="36">Ah, I know Ciabatta.</font>

380
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:30,484
<font size="36">Oh, he's here.</font>

381
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:31,844
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

382
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,011
<font size="36">Ciabatta.</font>

383
00:15:35,261 --> 00:15:37,011
<font size="36">I also like those things and pastries.</font>

384
00:15:37,441 --> 00:15:37,811
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

385
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:42,634
<font size="36">Ha...</font>

386
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:45,531
<font size="36">Have you tried Dubai chocolate?</font>

387
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:46,061
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

388
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:46,741
<font size="36">Me too.</font>

389
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:47,721
<font size="36">The original?</font>

390
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:48,761
<font size="36">No.</font>

391
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:50,121
<font size="36">I haven't had the original.</font>

392
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:52,401
<font size="36">I've had a lot of similar things. Yes.</font>

393
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,761
<font size="36">And that</font>

394
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:56,791
<font size="36">No kidding.</font>

395
00:15:57,011 --> 00:15:57,431
<font size="36">With that.</font>

396
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,611
<font size="36">Similar, huh.</font>

397
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,241
<font size="36">I kept thinking they were doing it one by one, but it seems they're doing it in multiple places at once.</font>

398
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:08,011
<font size="36">Yes, it seems so.</font>

399
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:16,321
<font size="36">The arrangement is good, isn't it.</font>

400
00:16:18,841 --> 00:16:19,381
<font size="36">Aren't you eating?</font>

401
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:19,771
<font size="36">Yes?</font>

402
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:20,911
<font size="36">Ah, you already had breakfast.</font>

403
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:22,111
<font size="36">I was going to prepare a little.</font>

404
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,111
<font size="36">Ah, prepare.</font>

405
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:31,011
<font size="36">Are you all prepared?</font>

406
00:16:31,571 --> 00:16:33,011
<font size="36">I'm all prepared but</font>

407
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:35,811
<font size="36">it's always the last one.</font>

408
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:37,511
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

409
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:47,534
<font size="36">Ha...</font>

410
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:49,864
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

411
00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:50,214
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

412
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:55,074
<font size="36">Oh...</font>

413
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:58,344
<font size="36">Oh... something...</font>

414
00:16:59,804 --> 00:17:03,879
<font size="36">Anyway, my mood isn't very good.</font>

415
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:05,554
<font size="36">A little jealous... envious...?</font>

416
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:10,324
<font size="36">I felt a little competitive.</font>

417
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:15,394
<font size="36">Anyway, everyone needs to get to know each other,</font>

418
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,094
<font size="36">so I tried to be understanding.</font>

419
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,079
<font size="36">Sun-jun!!!</font>

420
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,529
<font size="36">No, this is hair.</font>

421
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:41,699
<font size="36">Are you only worried about styling your hair?</font>

422
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:45,329
<font size="36">Can't do anything in the room, huh.</font>

423
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:45,819
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

424
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:48,169
<font size="36">There are also LPs.</font>

425
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:48,919
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

426
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:52,589
<font size="36">I have to ask how to listen to LPs.</font>

427
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,309
<font size="36">Do you want to try now?</font>

428
00:17:59,149 --> 00:17:59,549
<font size="36">Sure.</font>

429
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:01,099
<font size="36">Oh. Oh.</font>

430
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:06,236
<font size="36">I listened with this during the day.</font>

431
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:09,296
<font size="36">Aren't the two of them on a date right now?</font>

432
00:18:09,676 --> 00:18:10,526
<font size="36">That's right. This is a date.</font>

433
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:11,406
<font size="36">They're on a date.</font>

434
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:14,396
<font size="36">Is there a song you want to hear?</font>

435
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:15,566
<font size="36">A song I want to hear?</font>

436
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:16,086
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

437
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:17,326
<font size="36">Shall we take a look?</font>

438
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:21,196
<font size="36">Ah, it would be great if it turned on.</font>

439
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:22,076
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

440
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:25,626
<font size="36">What's there?</font>

441
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:28,106
<font size="36">There's Lee Seung-hwan too.</font>

442
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:28,786
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

443
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:33,086
<font size="36">No, there's even a Kim Han-seon song, it's so diverse.</font>

444
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:39,516
<font size="36">Choosing music together right now is a way of emotionally connecting with each other.</font>

445
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:44,426
<font size="36">Byun Jin-sub.</font>

446
00:18:44,776 --> 00:18:45,036
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

447
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:46,306
<font size="36">Do you know it?</font>

448
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:47,756
<font size="36">I like that song.</font>

449
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:48,796
<font size="36">Ah, really? Listen to it.</font>

450
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:49,516
<font size="36">Shall we listen?</font>

451
00:18:49,516 --> 00:18:49,726
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

452
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:52,916
<font size="36">Oh, oh, Seong-jun knows Byun Jin-sub?</font>

453
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,196
<font size="36">Hmph, sitting next to each other again.</font>

454
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:07,796
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

455
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:20,516
<font size="36">Hey, it really feels like a youth drama.</font>

456
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:39,266
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

457
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:39,866
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

458
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:42,716
<font size="36">Ah, this is like a movie, a movie.</font>

459
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:42,916
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

460
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,386
<font size="36">The sound quality is very warm, isn't it?</font>

461
00:19:45,446 --> 00:19:45,746
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

462
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:45,956
<font size="36">Very</font>

463
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:47,216
<font size="36">Very warm.</font>

464
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:49,516
<font size="36">Warm sound quality.</font>

465
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:50,516
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

466
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,316
<font size="36">Oh, poetic comments are appearing.</font>

467
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:00,516
<font size="36">Even though I see</font>

468
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:09,116
<font size="36">the sad look that sometimes appears bothers me.</font>

469
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:17,216
<font size="36">But the lyrics are very relatable.</font>

470
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:22,516
<font size="36">Lyrics like 'I want to know even the smallest things about you, but why don't you say anything?'</font>

471
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:27,016
<font size="36">I thought Seong-jun was hard to read,</font>

472
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:32,316
<font size="36">I didn't dare to talk about what happened today.</font>

473
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:36,516
<font size="36">Yes. So I tried to act as calm as possible.</font>

474
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:40,529
<font size="36">Q: How do you feel when you two listen to music together?
Yes.</font>

475
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:40,916
<font size="36">Moreover,</font>

476
00:20:41,516 --> 00:20:43,316
<font size="36">it's even better when we listen together.</font>

477
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:51,816
<font size="36">I was moved.</font>

478
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:52,716
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

479
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:53,516
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

480
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:54,016
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

481
00:20:55,116 --> 00:20:55,816
<font size="36">Ah, it's so refreshing.</font>

482
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:56,516
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

483
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:16,338
<font size="36">Hey, Sun-jun!</font>

484
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:18,768
<font size="36">I'm going crazy, seriously.</font>

485
00:21:20,938 --> 00:21:22,868
<font size="36">The hairdryer is overheating.</font>

486
00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:26,568
<font size="36">He's so excited about the date that he doesn't know what he's doing downstairs.</font>

487
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,378
<font size="36">Oh, Sun-jun.</font>

488
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:32,868
<font size="36">Anyway, he tried his best</font>

489
00:21:33,518 --> 00:21:34,768
<font size="36">to look handsome,</font>

490
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:39,368
<font size="36">I adjusted my hair about 20... many times.</font>

491
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,278
<font size="36">We can't feel it, but Sun-jun definitely has a little difference.</font>

492
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:45,068
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

493
00:21:45,068 --> 00:21:45,328
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

494
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:49,408
<font size="36">- No
- Shorts?</font>

495
00:21:50,248 --> 00:21:50,418
<font size="36">Oh oh.</font>

496
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:51,468
<font size="36">Ah, those two are so cute.</font>

497
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:53,558
<font size="36">I wonder if this is better? Or this one?</font>

498
00:21:54,828 --> 00:21:55,518
<font size="36">Oh, I think this is better.</font>

499
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:56,248
<font size="36">This is better?</font>

500
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:56,418
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

501
00:21:56,878 --> 00:21:58,198
<font size="36">That's right. It's good to ask like this.</font>

502
00:21:58,588 --> 00:21:58,928
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

503
00:22:05,718 --> 00:22:06,218
<font size="36">It's good, isn't it?</font>

504
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:09,468
<font size="36">That's good.</font>

505
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:10,718
<font size="36">They're looking at each other.</font>

506
00:22:10,718 --> 00:22:11,648
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

507
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:12,508
<font size="36">Good.</font>

508
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,768
<font size="36">Now, the date itinerary will be planned by the guy himself.</font>

509
00:22:27,108 --> 00:22:27,518
<font size="36">That's not bad, is it?</font>

510
00:22:27,718 --> 00:22:29,018
<font size="36">It's not raining, is it? The weather is a bit...</font>

511
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:31,108
<font size="36">Is it not allowed if it rains?</font>

512
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:35,468
<font size="36">Do you like the sea?</font>

513
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:37,346
<font size="36">To the sea?</font>

514
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:39,208
<font size="36">It's a secret.</font>

515
00:22:41,048 --> 00:22:45,948
<font size="36">Oh, later, if I go to the sea, I want to do *** so yes, I've planned it.</font>

516
00:22:46,758 --> 00:22:48,488
<font size="36">I searched a lot</font>

517
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,768
<font size="36">and I think I found a very good place.</font>

518
00:22:52,698 --> 00:22:57,738
<font size="36">I think we'll get closer after doing something active.</font>

519
00:22:58,738 --> 00:23:03,028
<font size="36">I believe Shin-hyang will also really like my favorite place.</font>

520
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:11,248
<font size="36">My prediction is</font>

521
00:23:11,548 --> 00:23:14,578
<font size="36">they'll go for a walk in a place like a botanical garden,</font>

522
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:16,068
<font size="36">Oh, Tak-soo?</font>

523
00:23:16,068 --> 00:23:16,968
<font size="36">Emotionally.</font>

524
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:17,168
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

525
00:23:17,838 --> 00:23:20,278
<font size="36">and have a date like listening to bird sounds.</font>

526
00:23:20,938 --> 00:23:22,068
<font size="36">With the scent of phytoncide.</font>

527
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:24,608
<font size="36">But didn't you just say it looked like it was going to rain?</font>

528
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:27,438
<font size="36">Then it would be like this, holding an umbrella</font>

529
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:27,768
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

530
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,978
<font size="36">Ah, this might make their hands touch...</font>

531
00:23:29,978 --> 00:23:30,768
<font size="36">That's the concern.</font>

532
00:23:30,768 --> 00:23:31,168
<font size="36">Ah, worried about hands touching.</font>

533
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:31,768
<font size="36">Hands shouldn't touch.</font>

534
00:23:31,768 --> 00:23:33,368
<font size="36">No hand-holding. That would be big trouble.</font>

535
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:33,768
<font size="36">After that.</font>

536
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:34,968
<font size="36">No, no. No hand-holding.</font>

537
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:35,268
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

538
00:23:36,268 --> 00:23:38,168
<font size="36">Do everything! Then hold hands!</font>

539
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:38,468
<font size="36">What.</font>

540
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:40,068
<font size="36">That person is crazy.</font>

541
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:43,068
<font size="36">For fathers with daughters now.</font>

542
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:44,368
<font size="36">No hand-holding.</font>

543
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:44,968
<font size="36">Is that reasonable now?</font>

544
00:23:45,768 --> 00:23:47,268
<font size="36">Yes, daughters are very sensitive now.</font>

545
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:55,568
<font size="36">Where are Tak-soo and Shin-hyang going?</font>

546
00:23:56,994 --> 00:23:58,794
<font size="36">You'll like where we're going.</font>

547
00:23:58,894 --> 00:23:59,495
<font size="36">Where we're going?</font>

548
00:23:59,595 --> 00:24:01,029
<font size="36">I think you'll definitely like it.</font>

549
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:01,730
<font size="36">Really?</font>

550
00:24:02,968 --> 00:24:04,433
<font size="36">Can't guess.</font>

551
00:24:05,634 --> 00:24:07,124
<font size="36">Do they even wear matching colors?</font>

552
00:24:07,504 --> 00:24:08,034
<font size="36">Very similar.</font>

553
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:08,341
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

554
00:24:08,341 --> 00:24:08,591
<font size="36">Oh, what is it?</font>

555
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:09,811
<font size="36">What is it, not a couple's outfit?</font>

556
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,241
<font size="36">In that case, they're already wearing a couple's outfit.</font>

557
00:24:14,632 --> 00:24:15,942
<font size="36">So are they really going to a botanical garden?</font>

558
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:23,282
<font size="36">It's so nice here.</font>

559
00:24:24,732 --> 00:24:25,302
<font size="36">This is Yeongrang Lake.</font>

560
00:24:25,492 --> 00:24:26,542
<font size="36">Yeongrang Lake.</font>

561
00:24:27,002 --> 00:24:28,002
<font size="36">Yeongrang Lake, Sokcho.</font>

562
00:24:28,402 --> 00:24:28,852
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

563
00:24:29,132 --> 00:24:29,632
<font size="36">So beautiful.</font>

564
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:31,852
<font size="36">Oh, it really feels like a botanical garden.</font>

565
00:24:32,752 --> 00:24:33,252
<font size="36">Oh, this is exactly the feeling.</font>

566
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:34,452
<font size="36">This is exactly the feeling.</font>

567
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:35,752
<font size="36">Oh, they're here, they're here, they're here.</font>

568
00:24:35,752 --> 00:24:36,732
<font size="36">Oh, it really is this feeling.</font>

569
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:37,512
<font size="36">They're walking.</font>

570
00:24:37,512 --> 00:24:38,752
<font size="36">Perfect, perfect.</font>

571
00:24:38,752 --> 00:24:39,152
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

572
00:24:39,552 --> 00:24:40,982
<font size="36">See, you have to know your son that well.</font>

573
00:24:44,903 --> 00:24:46,483
<font size="36">You usually like walking like this, right?</font>

574
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:47,233
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

575
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:48,263
<font size="36">By the lake or in places like this.</font>

576
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:49,003
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

577
00:24:50,513 --> 00:24:52,963
<font size="36">I deliberately did that. Because it's green and fresh.</font>

578
00:24:53,383 --> 00:24:53,583
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

579
00:24:54,303 --> 00:24:55,263
<font size="36">So it's really beautiful.</font>

580
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:56,363
<font size="36">Oh, it's really beautiful.</font>

581
00:24:56,883 --> 00:24:58,823
<font size="36">Mountains, lakes, trees...</font>

582
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:03,033
<font size="36">Actually, I quite like nature.</font>

583
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:07,733
<font size="36">So I tried to plan a route to walk around the lake. Because</font>

584
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:09,993
<font size="36">when you go there, your mind will also be at ease,</font>

585
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:14,123
<font size="36">and I thought I would feel like I was taking a deep breath, so I chose this place.</font>

586
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:14,763
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

587
00:25:15,063 --> 00:25:16,023
<font size="36">I'm so surprised, because I guessed correctly.</font>

588
00:25:16,603 --> 00:25:16,983
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

589
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:20,123
<font size="36">That's the date itinerary Tak-soo planned,</font>

590
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:23,743
<font size="36">and I happened to go to a place I really, really wanted to go,</font>

591
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:27,043
<font size="36">so I'm very happy.</font>

592
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:29,263
<font size="36">Cycling would be good too, wouldn't it?</font>

593
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:29,663
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

594
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:31,093
<font size="36">I'm good at cycling.</font>

595
00:25:31,313 --> 00:25:32,263
<font size="36">Bike... careful with the bike.</font>

596
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:38,863
<font size="36">Ah, polite.</font>

597
00:25:38,863 --> 00:25:39,263
<font size="36">Manners.</font>

598
00:25:39,683 --> 00:25:40,133
<font size="36">What, the gentleman.</font>

599
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:40,783
<font size="36">Oh, polite.</font>

600
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,973
<font size="36">That's right, men are supposed to walk on the outside.</font>

601
00:25:43,473 --> 00:25:44,973
<font size="36">He knows these things so well, even though no one taught him.</font>

602
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:45,623
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

603
00:25:45,823 --> 00:25:46,973
<font size="36">It's not something that can be learned by being taught.</font>

604
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:48,363
<font size="36">Instinct, instinct.</font>

605
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:53,713
<font size="36">Let's stay here for a bit and then go.</font>

606
00:25:53,713 --> 00:25:53,923
<font size="36">Yes?</font>

607
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:54,663
<font size="36">Okay.</font>

608
00:25:57,263 --> 00:25:57,773
<font size="36">Wow~</font>

609
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:05,803
<font size="36">But the wind blowing like this is really nice.</font>

610
00:26:06,123 --> 00:26:06,323
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

611
00:26:11,073 --> 00:26:11,633
<font size="36">Ah, it's beautiful.</font>

612
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:14,263
<font size="36">The two of you look so beautiful. So, so cute.</font>

613
00:26:18,383 --> 00:26:19,768
<font size="36">- How was yesterday?
- Yesterday?</font>

614
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:21,603
<font size="36">- The cassette tape...
- The cassette tape?</font>

615
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:22,263
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

616
00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:25,263
<font size="36">Nervous, right?</font>

617
00:26:26,803 --> 00:26:27,463
<font size="36">When you opened it, what then?</font>

618
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:28,113
<font size="36">When I opened it?</font>

619
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:28,563
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

620
00:26:30,003 --> 00:26:30,503
<font size="36">Liked it, right?</font>

621
00:26:32,103 --> 00:26:33,063
<font size="36">How many did you get is a secret, right?</font>

622
00:26:33,803 --> 00:26:34,263
<font size="36">It's a secret, right?</font>

623
00:26:35,263 --> 00:26:35,463
<font size="36">Okay.</font>

624
00:26:36,003 --> 00:26:36,563
<font size="36">It's a secret, right?</font>

625
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:40,263
<font size="36">You received a lot, right?</font>

626
00:26:40,563 --> 00:26:40,663
<font size="36">Me?</font>

627
00:26:40,963 --> 00:26:41,463
<font size="36">It's a secret, right?</font>

628
00:26:42,763 --> 00:26:43,063
<font size="36">Okay.</font>

629
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:45,927
<font size="36">- It's a secret, right.
- It's a secret, right.</font>

630
00:26:46,027 --> 00:26:46,763
<font size="36">No, as for me,</font>

631
00:26:47,763 --> 00:26:49,663
<font size="36">at first, I couldn't hear anything clearly.</font>

632
00:26:49,663 --> 00:26:50,163
<font size="36">Can you hear it clearly?</font>

633
00:26:50,463 --> 00:26:50,763
<font size="36">No?</font>

634
00:26:51,263 --> 00:26:52,463
<font size="36">That's right, isn't it? It was a bit staticky.</font>

635
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:54,563
<font size="36">But I really liked that?</font>

636
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:55,863
<font size="36">Ah, because you didn't know who it was?</font>

637
00:26:56,663 --> 00:26:57,263
<font size="36">I knew who it was.</font>

638
00:26:57,263 --> 00:26:58,263
<font size="36">Bạn biết là ai sao?</font>

639
00:26:58,263 --> 00:26:58,563
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

640
00:27:00,363 --> 00:27:01,263
<font size="36">Are you sure you know who it is?</font>

641
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:03,779
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

642
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,025
<font size="36">Wow!</font>

643
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,125
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

644
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:11,320
<font size="36">Isn't it like, 'You heard my voice clearly, right!!!'?</font>

645
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,725
<font size="36">It went straight to my heart.</font>

646
00:27:12,725 --> 00:27:13,025
<font size="36">Now.</font>

647
00:27:13,025 --> 00:27:14,125
<font size="36">Oh, Tak-soo.</font>

648
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,825
<font size="36">Are you sure you know who it is?</font>

649
00:27:18,025 --> 00:27:18,425
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

650
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:21,825
<font size="36">Me too.</font>

651
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:23,825
<font size="36">I also definitely know who it is.</font>

652
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:24,525
<font size="36">Oh, I definitely know.</font>

653
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:27,502
<font size="36">But I had a feeling...</font>

654
00:27:31,225 --> 00:27:33,225
<font size="36">I think the number doesn't matter.</font>

655
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:34,925
<font size="36">How many are there?</font>

656
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:35,325
<font size="36">Cassette tapes.</font>

657
00:27:35,325 --> 00:27:35,725
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

658
00:27:35,725 --> 00:27:38,325
<font size="36">How many I received, how many that person received</font>

659
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:39,825
<font size="36">I don't think those things matter.</font>

660
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,225
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

661
00:27:43,025 --> 00:27:43,325
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

662
00:27:43,925 --> 00:27:44,725
<font size="36">Ah, meaningful words.</font>

663
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:50,325
<font size="36">How was it? When you listened?</font>

664
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:50,625
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

665
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,225
<font size="36">How was it? When you listened?</font>

666
00:27:53,525 --> 00:27:54,025
<font size="36">I also was a bit</font>

667
00:27:54,725 --> 00:27:56,625
<font size="36">uncontrollably listening very carefully.</font>

668
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:57,325
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

669
00:27:58,025 --> 00:27:58,325
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

670
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:10,425
<font size="36">But doing it that way is a style I really like.</font>

671
00:28:11,225 --> 00:28:11,425
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

672
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:14,325
<font size="36">Because it's a bit analog-like?</font>

673
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:16,625
<font size="36">That's why I like it. Like...</font>

674
00:28:18,825 --> 00:28:21,225
<font size="36">That's why I thought about it a bit more.</font>

675
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,025
<font size="36">Now I see, Shin-hyang seems to have</font>

676
00:28:31,425 --> 00:28:34,625
<font size="36">revealed some of her feelings for Tak-soo.</font>

677
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:35,325
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

678
00:28:35,325 --> 00:28:35,625
<font size="36">It seems like she showed a little bit.</font>

679
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:35,925
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

680
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:37,825
<font size="36">Oh, if you say 'The speed here will be faster,' then.</font>

681
00:28:38,225 --> 00:28:39,425
<font size="36">No, now, whatever he says, it'll be pleasing.</font>

682
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:39,825
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

683
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:40,125
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

684
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:40,625
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

685
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:43,525
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

686
00:28:43,525 --> 00:28:43,825
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

687
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:45,146
<font size="36">Jun-ho and Seok-joo.</font>

688
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,025
<font size="36">It's really been a long time.</font>

689
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:48,625
<font size="36">Oh, Bowling.</font>

690
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:49,325
<font size="36">They've arrived at the bowling alley.</font>

691
00:28:50,425 --> 00:28:53,425
<font size="36">But they didn't just play normally; to make it more fun, they bet or</font>

692
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:54,325
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

693
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,259
<font size="36">So I'll give you a 30-point handicap, do you want to bet?</font>

694
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:58,626
<font size="36">They bet. They bet.</font>

695
00:28:59,627 --> 00:29:01,195
<font size="36">They're actually betting.</font>

696
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:06,225
<font size="36">So I'll give you a 30-point handicap, do you want to bet?</font>

697
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:07,225
<font size="36">30 points...?</font>

698
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:08,625
<font size="36">50 points...!</font>

699
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:09,325
<font size="36">50?</font>

700
00:29:09,325 --> 00:29:09,625
<font size="36">Really?</font>

701
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:09,825
<font size="36">50.</font>

702
00:29:10,025 --> 00:29:11,325
<font size="36">Hey, that's giving a lot.</font>

703
00:29:11,325 --> 00:29:11,625
<font size="36">50 points.</font>

704
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:11,825
<font size="36">Really.</font>

705
00:29:12,025 --> 00:29:13,225
<font size="36">Shall I take off my ankle weights?</font>

706
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:15,425
<font size="36">Shall I take this off?</font>

707
00:29:15,425 --> 00:29:15,725
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

708
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:17,125
<font size="36">50.</font>

709
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:17,425
<font size="36">Agreed.</font>

710
00:29:17,725 --> 00:29:21,625
<font size="36">They are both extroverted and cheerful, so I think they'll get along well.</font>

711
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:30,125
<font size="36">This?</font>

712
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:30,425
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

713
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:31,825
<font size="36">Looks a bit clumsy, doesn't it?</font>

714
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:32,125
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

715
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:32,725
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

716
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:33,025
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

717
00:29:38,525 --> 00:29:38,825
<font size="36">Great.</font>

718
00:29:39,025 --> 00:29:40,025
<font size="36">Oh, it's pretty good anyway.</font>

719
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:41,425
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

720
00:29:41,925 --> 00:29:43,425
<font size="36">Don't worry, just play comfortably.</font>

721
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:43,725
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

722
00:29:44,225 --> 00:29:45,325
<font size="36">I'm not worried at all.</font>

723
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:48,525
<font size="36">Oh, you'll catch up right away.</font>

724
00:29:49,025 --> 00:29:49,525
<font size="36">Hmm, hmm.</font>

725
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:52,625
<font size="36">Ah, Seok-joo will just slide to the side.</font>

726
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:52,925
<font size="36">Ah!</font>

727
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,325
<font size="36">Wow, this one slid.</font>

728
00:29:55,825 --> 00:29:57,325
<font size="36">Not looking anymore. Not looking anymore.</font>

729
00:29:57,725 --> 00:29:58,025
<font size="36">What a shame.</font>

730
00:30:05,143 --> 00:30:05,583
<font size="36">Amazing.</font>

731
00:30:07,093 --> 00:30:07,533
<font size="36">Did you see?</font>

732
00:30:08,113 --> 00:30:09,533
<font size="36">No, I didn't see.</font>

733
00:30:10,523 --> 00:30:10,933
<font size="36">Ah, really.</font>

734
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:12,813
<font size="36">They are the mood-makers here.</font>

735
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:13,553
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

736
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:17,693
<font size="36">Ah, why do you keep going that way?</font>

737
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:19,813
<font size="36">This one has a dot in the middle of the lane.</font>

738
00:30:19,813 --> 00:30:20,043
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

739
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:22,733
<font size="36">Look here and in this direction</font>

740
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:25,693
<font size="36">Try rolling the ball as if you're pushing it backward.</font>

741
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:26,933
<font size="36">Okay.</font>

742
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,433
<font size="36">Okay. Okay.</font>

743
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:31,493
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

744
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:32,433
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

745
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:32,733
<font size="36">Is it good? Is it good?</font>

746
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:34,133
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

747
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,533
<font size="36">Why don't you try lowering it a bit?</font>

748
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:38,803
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

749
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:40,533
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

750
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:41,803
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

751
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:46,533
<font size="36">It's not bad, is it?</font>

752
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,133
<font size="36">No. Seok-joo is the best player.</font>

753
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:49,633
<font size="36">You need a good teacher.</font>

754
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:51,933
<font size="36">You should be nervous.</font>

755
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,633
<font size="36">I think you're the best player among my students.</font>

756
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:57,633
<font size="36">Oh, the scores aren't that far apart.</font>

757
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:00,803
<font size="36">Goodbye.</font>

758
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:01,803
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

759
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:03,633
<font size="36">Hmm, what a shame.</font>

760
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:04,233
<font size="36">What a shame.</font>

761
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,033
<font size="36">It's really such a shame.</font>

762
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:08,533
<font size="36">Ah, it's because of this.</font>

763
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:11,333
<font size="36">Oh, it must be about 3kg.</font>

764
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:13,133
<font size="36">Why blame an innocent phone?</font>

765
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:15,833
<font size="36">Please.</font>

766
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:17,833
<font size="36">Ah, something.</font>

767
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:19,833
<font size="36">You two are so cute.</font>

768
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:28,933
<font size="36">Just tell others that I lost because I gave a handicap.</font>

769
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:29,733
<font size="36">Just say that.</font>

770
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:31,733
<font size="36">Ah!</font>

771
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:33,433
<font size="36">This is good.</font>

772
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:34,733
<font size="36">Our Jun-ho is really smart.</font>

773
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:38,233
<font size="36">Seok-joo has a charm too.</font>

774
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:41,833
<font size="36">At first, I just thought, 'He seems like an interesting person',</font>

775
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:48,233
<font size="36">but when he felt shy throwing the bowling ball, he did cute actions... like that,</font>

776
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:49,733
<font size="36">he looked adorable</font>

777
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:53,133
<font size="36">and I felt a little closer to him.</font>

778
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:54,833
<font size="36">First of all, it was really fun,</font>

779
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:57,533
<font size="36">and I felt that he has a similar personality.</font>

780
00:31:58,133 --> 00:31:59,333
<font size="36">He also jokes around a lot</font>

781
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:01,633
<font size="36">and talks very amusingly, so</font>

782
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:03,833
<font size="36">I want to talk to him more.</font>

783
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:05,933
<font size="36">And I also have something to ask.</font>

784
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:06,833
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

785
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:07,933
<font size="36">Okay, okay.</font>

786
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:08,633
<font size="36">Let me do it.</font>

787
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:09,133
<font size="36">Okay.</font>

788
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:09,433
<font size="36">So cool.</font>

789
00:32:09,633 --> 00:32:10,133
<font size="36">Ah, cool, cool.</font>

790
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:10,633
<font size="36">Okay, okay, okay.</font>

791
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:12,133
<font size="36">They really suit each other naturally.</font>

792
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:12,833
<font size="36">They really suit each other so much.</font>

793
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:14,033
<font size="36">I think they'll get along very well.</font>

794
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,533
<font size="36">Oh, I like Jun-ho too.</font>

795
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:18,733
<font size="36">Sun-jun.</font>

796
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:19,533
<font size="36">Let's watch Sun-jun.</font>

797
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:21,333
<font size="36">Here are Sun-jun and Sa-yoon.</font>

798
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:27,933
<font size="36">Sun-jun seems a bit nervous, doesn't he?</font>

799
00:32:28,633 --> 00:32:33,533
<font size="36">Oh, this seems like my first proper date ever.</font>

800
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:34,833
<font size="36">Oh, really?</font>

801
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:35,033
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

802
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:35,733
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

803
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:38,133
<font size="36">Ah, just say you've been on a few dates.</font>

804
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:42,533
<font size="36">Hey, first date ever. Let's watch it together.</font>

805
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,133
<font size="36">Wow, what to do.</font>

806
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:46,833
<font size="36">First of all, I'm very nervous.</font>

807
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:51,833
<font size="36">What kind of pizza do you like?</font>

808
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:52,833
<font size="36">Pizza?</font>

809
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:53,333
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

810
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,633
<font size="36">Me, I'm like</font>

811
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:55,833
<font size="36">cheese pizza</font>

812
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:57,933
<font size="36">and I like Hawaiian pizza.</font>

813
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:58,533
<font size="36">Oh, I like it too.</font>

814
00:32:58,833 --> 00:32:59,133
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

815
00:32:59,133 --> 00:32:59,333
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

816
00:32:59,333 --> 00:32:59,633
<font size="36">Right?</font>

817
00:32:59,633 --> 00:32:59,833
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

818
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:01,733
<font size="36">But I also like Gorgonzola.</font>

819
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:02,433
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

820
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:02,833
<font size="36">Gorgonzola.</font>

821
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:03,233
<font size="36">Dipped in honey.</font>

822
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,133
<font size="36">Dipped in honey.</font>

823
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:04,333
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

824
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:05,033
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

825
00:33:05,535 --> 00:33:06,335
<font size="36">So delicious...</font>

826
00:33:11,046 --> 00:33:12,496
<font size="36">I don't know what to do now.</font>

827
00:33:13,227 --> 00:33:13,857
<font size="36">What to do.</font>

828
00:33:15,124 --> 00:33:17,124
<font size="36">But having many siblings has a good point that</font>

829
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:18,766
<font size="36">Hmm. Food delivery!</font>

830
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:19,826
<font size="36">Food delivery. Yes.</font>

831
00:33:21,314 --> 00:33:23,104
<font size="36">You can order everything you want to eat...</font>

832
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:24,615
<font size="36">If you're alone, you can't do that.</font>

833
00:33:25,144 --> 00:33:25,594
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

834
00:33:26,915 --> 00:33:27,795
<font size="36">Something like that...</font>

835
00:33:40,033 --> 00:33:40,763
<font size="36">Hey, don't do that.</font>

836
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:42,333
<font size="36">Don't do that. Don't do that.</font>

837
00:33:42,863 --> 00:33:45,133
<font size="36">You need to push and pull, keep your distance.</font>

838
00:33:45,563 --> 00:33:46,033
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

839
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:46,403
<font size="36">Ah, that (?)</font>

840
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,263
<font size="36">Can't do that.</font>

841
00:33:47,763 --> 00:33:48,263
<font size="36">Ah, Dad,</font>

842
00:33:48,263 --> 00:33:48,493
<font size="36">Can't do it.</font>

843
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:49,493
<font size="36">Sun-jun's dad doesn't do that?</font>

844
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:52,163
<font size="36">Ah, I'm more of a bad boy type, so</font>

845
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:54,393
<font size="36">the push and pull immediately</font>

846
00:33:54,893 --> 00:33:56,593
<font size="36">Oh, it's already gone up and down. That's Dad.</font>

847
00:33:57,193 --> 00:33:59,193
<font size="36">Ah, where will our Sun-jun go, Dad?</font>

848
00:33:59,793 --> 00:34:02,433
<font size="36">First, I will look for a good restaurant</font>

849
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,833
<font size="36">and will probably find the best restaurant.</font>

850
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:09,633
<font size="36">So while eating delicious food, I'd say 'Do you want to try this?' Ah!</font>

851
00:34:16,994 --> 00:34:17,754
<font size="36">Wow, so beautiful.</font>

852
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:19,754
<font size="36">It's so beautiful here, isn't it?</font>

853
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:31,226
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

854
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,276
<font size="36">Oh, so beautiful.</font>

855
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:33,306
<font size="36">First of all, it's very beautiful.</font>

856
00:34:33,756 --> 00:34:40,946
<font size="36">There were many different dishes, but I chose a safe Western restaurant that most people love.</font>

857
00:34:42,466 --> 00:34:51,046
<font size="36">Hmm, I saw somewhere that when you eat delicious food, the memories of eating together stick very well.</font>

858
00:34:51,746 --> 00:34:52,716
<font size="36">Love learned from books.</font>

859
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:56,416
<font size="36">That's right. This book-learned love is the most dangerous. Ah.</font>

860
00:34:59,526 --> 00:35:01,576
<font size="36">Ah, but the scenery here is so beautiful.</font>

861
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:03,956
<font size="36">So beautiful. Like an attic.</font>

862
00:35:10,496 --> 00:35:11,296
<font size="36">He really isn't doing anything.</font>

863
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:14,596
<font size="36">Hey, these eyes just don't know where to look.</font>

864
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:15,416
<font size="36">Shall we see?</font>

865
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,326
<font size="36">Yes, would you like to see?</font>

866
00:35:17,696 --> 00:35:18,456
<font size="36">Do you have any recommendations?</font>

867
00:35:18,796 --> 00:35:19,416
<font size="36">Recommendations?</font>

868
00:35:20,756 --> 00:35:21,206
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

869
00:35:23,236 --> 00:35:24,836
<font size="36">They have pizza here, oh, there's pizza.</font>

870
00:35:25,776 --> 00:35:26,276
<font size="36">Hawaii.</font>

871
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:27,146
<font size="36">Ah, Hawaiian?</font>

872
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:28,246
<font size="36">Do you eat this?</font>

873
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:29,246
<font size="36">Shall we eat this?</font>

874
00:35:29,896 --> 00:35:32,496
<font size="36">So, one of this and one spicy seafood sashimi pasta.</font>

875
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:33,236
<font size="36">One dish.</font>

876
00:35:33,796 --> 00:35:35,696
<font size="36">Oh, Sa-yoon leads really well.</font>

877
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:36,566
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

878
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:45,326
<font size="36">Oh my, I'm suffocating.</font>

879
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:46,466
<font size="36">Oh, I'm suffocating. Really suffocating.</font>

880
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:47,426
<font size="36">Ah, he missed it.</font>

881
00:35:47,826 --> 00:35:49,226
<font size="36">Sun-jun, you should've taken it first.</font>

882
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:54,256
<font size="36">Shall I pour for you?</font>

883
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:55,156
<font size="36">Ah, it's okay.</font>

884
00:35:55,926 --> 00:35:56,326
<font size="36">Water...</font>

885
00:35:56,826 --> 00:35:57,126
<font size="36">What to do.</font>

886
00:35:57,726 --> 00:35:58,226
<font size="36">Oh my, what to do.</font>

887
00:35:58,996 --> 00:35:59,826
<font size="36">Just grab it!</font>

888
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:00,991
<font size="36">Just grab the water!!!</font>

889
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:01,491
<font size="36">Sun-jun.</font>

890
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:02,291
<font size="36">So innocent.</font>

891
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:03,291
<font size="36">It's just the first date scene of someone who's been single since birth.</font>

892
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:04,291
<font size="36">(It's just the first date scene of someone who's been single since birth)
Ah, so cute.</font>

893
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:05,291
<font size="36">So innocent.</font>

894
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,291
<font size="36">It looks like a walking path.</font>

895
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:10,091
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

896
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:15,691
<font size="36">Sun-jun.</font>

897
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:17,291
<font size="36">Sun-jun, say something.</font>

898
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,291
<font size="36">Anything will do.</font>

899
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:25,991
<font size="36">Is that Mount Seorak?</font>

900
00:36:26,991 --> 00:36:28,491
<font size="36">What does Mount Seorak matter.</font>

901
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:30,291
<font size="36">An Seobang!</font>

902
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:32,991
<font size="36">What does that matter, whether that's Mount Seorak or not.</font>

903
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:36,291
<font size="36">What if it's Mount Jirisan, or Mount Baekdu.</font>

904
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:38,291
<font size="36">Ah, Sun-jun is so cute.</font>

905
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:40,291
<font size="36">Is that Mount Seorak?</font>

906
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,291
<font size="36">Probably, right?</font>

907
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:43,291
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

908
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:48,291
<font size="36">Because it's his first date ever.</font>

909
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,491
<font size="36">Because it's his first date ever, so</font>

910
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:53,291
<font size="36">Now he seems to not know what to do.</font>

911
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:53,991
<font size="36">Now. Oh.</font>

912
00:36:53,991 --> 00:36:55,291
<font size="36">So impatient. So impatient now.</font>

913
00:36:56,991 --> 00:36:57,691
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

914
00:36:57,691 --> 00:36:58,291
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

915
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:01,291
<font size="36">Wow, it looks so delicious.</font>

916
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:03,291
<font size="36">Oh, let me scoop this for you.</font>

917
00:37:03,491 --> 00:37:06,291
<font size="36">This one is on my side.</font>

918
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:07,291
<font size="36">You eat first.</font>

919
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:08,291
<font size="36">No, you eat.</font>

920
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:10,291
<font size="36">Bacon</font>

921
00:37:10,991 --> 00:37:11,491
<font size="36">You should do it for them.</font>

922
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:12,291
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

923
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:18,491
<font size="36">No, Sun-jun is good at cooking but not good at that.</font>

924
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:20,691
<font size="36">I also thought I should do it,</font>

925
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:23,291
<font size="36">but Sa-yoon did everything already</font>

926
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,491
<font size="36">already did it</font>

927
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:28,291
<font size="36">I wanted to do it too but</font>

928
00:37:28,691 --> 00:37:29,491
<font size="36">It's just...</font>

929
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:31,691
<font size="36">just receiving.</font>

930
00:37:32,991 --> 00:37:33,991
<font size="36">He said he's just receiving.</font>

931
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:35,691
<font size="36">Enjoy your meal.</font>

932
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:36,491
<font size="36">Enjoy your meal.</font>

933
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:42,291
<font size="36">Hmm~</font>

934
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:43,291
<font size="36">Is it delicious?</font>

935
00:37:43,491 --> 00:37:43,991
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

936
00:37:45,491 --> 00:37:45,991
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

937
00:37:46,491 --> 00:37:47,291
<font size="36">It's really delicious.</font>

938
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:48,991
<font size="36">Now the atmosphere is better.</font>

939
00:37:48,991 --> 00:37:51,491
<font size="36">Oh. Because delicious food was served.</font>

940
00:37:51,491 --> 00:37:51,991
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

941
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:55,991
<font size="36">Shall I get you some pasta?</font>

942
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,491
<font size="36">Yes, thank you.</font>

943
00:37:58,691 --> 00:37:59,291
<font size="36">Let me scoop it.</font>

944
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,291
<font size="36">Ah, finally. Finally he did it.</font>

945
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:01,691
<font size="36">Oh, yeah, this time.</font>

946
00:38:08,491 --> 00:38:09,691
<font size="36">The noodles are really strange.</font>

947
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,291
<font size="36">Oh? It all came with it.</font>

948
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,491
<font size="36">It's really like sand.</font>

949
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,291
<font size="36">Ah, now his hand must be trembling.</font>

950
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:26,291
<font size="36">What to do, what to do, keeps grabbing and letting go.</font>

951
00:38:27,691 --> 00:38:28,691
<font size="36">You can just scoop roughly.</font>

952
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:30,691
<font size="36">You can just do it roughly...</font>

953
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:32,291
<font size="36">But he wants to do it well...</font>

954
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:33,491
<font size="36">He wants to do it well, that's it.</font>

955
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:34,691
<font size="36">Ah, but it's taking too long.</font>

956
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:38,491
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

957
00:38:39,691 --> 00:38:42,491
<font size="36">I'll get you a lot of salmon.</font>

958
00:38:42,991 --> 00:38:43,691
<font size="36">So frustrated.</font>

959
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:45,291
<font size="36">What to do.</font>

960
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:47,491
<font size="36">Eat a lot.</font>

961
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:47,991
<font size="36">I</font>

962
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:51,491
<font size="36">Give it to me now!!!</font>

963
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:54,291
<font size="36">An Seobang, An Seobang, okay, just hand it over.</font>

964
00:38:54,991 --> 00:38:55,491
<font size="36">Shall I do it?</font>

965
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:56,291
<font size="36">An Seobang!</font>

966
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:58,691
<font size="36">Just give it to me!!!</font>

967
00:38:59,991 --> 00:39:02,291
<font size="36">Oh, I just want to feed her a bite.</font>

968
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:05,867
<font size="36">(Finally the pasta reached Sa-yoon's hand)
Thank you.</font>

969
00:39:07,314 --> 00:39:08,024
<font size="36">Please try it.</font>

970
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:12,626
<font size="36">It must be delicious.</font>

971
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:13,026
<font size="36">Oh, it must be delicious.</font>

972
00:39:13,026 --> 00:39:13,646
<font size="36">It must be delicious.</font>

973
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:19,676
<font size="36">It's really delicious here.</font>

974
00:39:20,236 --> 00:39:20,396
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

975
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,020
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

976
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,550
<font size="36">Ah, hey, so cute.</font>

977
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,740
<font size="36">Ah, I'm a fan of Sun-jun.</font>

978
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,870
<font size="36">Sun-jun is really great~</font>

979
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,770
<font size="36">Ah, An Seobang is so cute.</font>

980
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,570
<font size="36">You can talk after you finish eating!</font>

981
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,580
<font size="36">Because Sa-yoon asked, he had to answer right away.</font>

982
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,800
<font size="36">Ah, that accent, that mouth, I've fallen for Sun-jun.</font>

983
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,530
<font size="36">Oh, I'm dying.</font>

984
00:39:45,465 --> 00:39:49,645
<font size="36">Oh, because this is almost my first proper date ever, so</font>

985
00:39:50,235 --> 00:39:53,025
<font size="36">I stuttered a lot and didn't talk very well.</font>

986
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:54,785
<font size="36">No, that can happen. It can happen.</font>

987
00:39:55,355 --> 00:39:56,395
<font size="36">First of all, anyway</font>

988
00:39:57,165 --> 00:40:01,455
<font size="36">umm, to look cooler, I paid a lot of attention.</font>

989
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:02,695
<font size="36">Everyone is like that.</font>

990
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,025
<font size="36">All dads are like that too~</font>

991
00:40:04,825 --> 00:40:07,628
<font size="36">Q: How was the date?</font>

992
00:40:07,728 --> 00:40:09,435
<font size="36">I'm really very satisfied.</font>

993
00:40:10,185 --> 00:40:11,535
<font size="36">The atmosphere was also very good</font>

994
00:40:11,985 --> 00:40:12,315
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

995
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,025
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

996
00:40:14,635 --> 00:40:14,815
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

997
00:40:15,335 --> 00:40:16,185
<font size="36">And I always</font>

998
00:40:17,135 --> 00:40:21,025
<font size="36">am the one who finds good restaurants, finds places to go,</font>

999
00:40:21,695 --> 00:40:25,175
<font size="36">so being led to a pre-arranged place like this is the first time</font>

1000
00:40:26,015 --> 00:40:26,935
<font size="36">I'm very grateful.</font>

1001
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:27,565
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1002
00:40:28,655 --> 00:40:29,285
<font size="36">Okay, okay.</font>

1003
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:31,585
<font size="36">No, but because he's never dated before, so</font>

1004
00:40:32,215 --> 00:40:33,635
<font size="36">he doesn't know what to do,</font>

1005
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:38,155
<font size="36">but it seems he's gradually finding his way, so I see a lot of hope for the future.</font>

1006
00:40:38,485 --> 00:40:38,865
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

1007
00:40:39,325 --> 00:40:44,185
<font size="36">The start was like this, but in the latter part, Sun-jun's performance just</font>

1008
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,445
<font size="36">poured in</font>

1009
00:40:47,235 --> 00:40:47,715
<font size="36">Like a flood!</font>

1010
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:49,185
<font size="36">I'm really looking forward to it.</font>

1011
00:40:49,645 --> 00:40:50,025
<font size="36">A desired thing.</font>

1012
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:51,525
<font size="36">But he seems a bit lacking in confidence.</font>

1013
00:40:51,745 --> 00:40:52,025
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1014
00:40:54,008 --> 00:40:57,378
<font size="36">It's Soo-wan and Seong-jun</font>

1015
00:40:58,568 --> 00:41:02,018
<font size="36">Actually, Soo-wan didn't know Seong-jun was planning to go with Sa-yoon.</font>

1016
00:41:02,018 --> 00:41:02,338
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1017
00:41:06,617 --> 00:41:09,517
<font size="36">Oh, when Seong-jun came to ask her out,</font>

1018
00:41:10,027 --> 00:41:12,537
<font size="36">oh, I still had a good impression of Seong-jun,</font>

1019
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:17,847
<font size="36">so him proactively asking me out like this is really, really good.</font>

1020
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:22,236
<font size="36">It seems they're going to the beach.</font>

1021
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:24,147
<font size="36">Yes, I like the sea.</font>

1022
00:41:25,247 --> 00:41:27,007
<font size="36">Ah, luckily Soo-wan likes the sea.</font>

1023
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:28,027
<font size="36">I like the sea.</font>

1024
00:41:28,547 --> 00:41:28,907
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1025
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:44,839
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1026
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,649
<font size="36">Fishing, boat fishing.</font>

1027
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,019
<font size="36">boat fishing.</font>

1028
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,019
<font size="36">Yes?</font>

1029
00:41:57,539 --> 00:41:57,899
<font size="36">Hmm?</font>

1030
00:41:58,219 --> 00:41:58,439
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1031
00:41:58,799 --> 00:41:59,019
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1032
00:41:59,267 --> 00:41:59,867
<font size="36">boat fishing...</font>

1033
00:42:00,247 --> 00:42:01,142
<font size="36">Boat fishing?</font>

1034
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:02,410
<font size="36">Ah, he said they're going boat fishing?</font>

1035
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,812
<font size="36">Hey, that boat fishing thing is really tough.</font>

1036
00:42:04,912 --> 00:42:07,949
<font size="36">- Number 1 most hated date itinerary for women: boat fishing!
- That's right.</font>

1037
00:42:07,997 --> 00:42:09,417
<font size="36">It's really nauseating.</font>

1038
00:42:10,137 --> 00:42:11,787
<font size="36">She dressed up nicely, but now she has to wear a life jacket...</font>

1039
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:13,537
<font size="36">Her hair will be all messed up from the wind.</font>

1040
00:42:13,817 --> 00:42:14,817
<font size="36">And her face will get sunburned.</font>

1041
00:42:14,817 --> 00:42:15,317
<font size="36">That's right, that's right.</font>

1042
00:42:15,317 --> 00:42:17,827
<font size="36">He's planning to do that on the first date...?</font>

1043
00:42:18,557 --> 00:42:21,097
<font size="36">Hey, this, oh, shall we hear Dad's opinion for once?</font>

1044
00:42:21,097 --> 00:42:21,647
<font size="36">Son's choice.</font>

1045
00:42:21,647 --> 00:42:22,427
<font size="36">Dad can't close his mouth.</font>

1046
00:42:22,427 --> 00:42:23,227
<font size="36">No, because</font>

1047
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:25,187
<font size="36">I get very seasick, so</font>

1048
00:42:25,737 --> 00:42:25,887
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1049
00:42:26,297 --> 00:42:28,357
<font size="36">I never thought about boat fishing.</font>

1050
00:42:28,827 --> 00:42:29,187
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1051
00:42:29,807 --> 00:42:31,947
<font size="36">If he's like me, he'd probably get very seasick too.</font>

1052
00:42:32,357 --> 00:42:32,677
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1053
00:42:32,677 --> 00:42:33,027
<font size="36">That.</font>

1054
00:42:34,977 --> 00:42:37,247
<font size="36">Oh, I always had a dream about fishing, so</font>

1055
00:42:37,777 --> 00:42:40,727
<font size="36">I said I definitely wanted to try fishing if I ever went to the sea,</font>

1056
00:42:41,087 --> 00:42:43,307
<font size="36">and since there was an opportunity, I arranged this itinerary.</font>

1057
00:42:44,137 --> 00:42:46,027
<font size="36">Ah, because he wanted to try it himself.</font>

1058
00:42:46,727 --> 00:42:48,397
<font size="36">Because Dad didn't take him boat fishing much, so</font>

1059
00:42:48,397 --> 00:42:50,724
<font size="36">he wanted to try it, that's it.</font>

1060
00:42:50,747 --> 00:42:55,162
<font size="36">No, but why fulfill a personal dream on a date...?</font>

1061
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:57,997
<font size="36">Are you okay?</font>

1062
00:42:58,517 --> 00:42:59,327
<font size="36">Yes! It will probably be fun.</font>

1063
00:43:00,147 --> 00:43:02,167
<font size="36">But she's never tried it before, I wonder if it'll be okay?</font>

1064
00:43:02,337 --> 00:43:02,607
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1065
00:43:04,107 --> 00:43:06,007
<font size="36">As for everyday fishing,</font>

1066
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:08,357
<font size="36">oh, I never even thought about it.</font>

1067
00:43:08,567 --> 00:43:09,327
<font size="36">He never even thought about it.</font>

1068
00:43:09,327 --> 00:43:09,807
<font size="36">Her expression is not good.</font>

1069
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:11,167
<font size="36">Soo-wan's expression is not good.</font>

1070
00:43:11,947 --> 00:43:17,067
<font size="36">I remember at first when I heard about going fishing, I felt very unfamiliar.</font>

1071
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:19,787
<font size="36">Ah, they should have gone to the basketball court.</font>

1072
00:43:20,747 --> 00:43:22,327
<font size="36">Ah, this is boat fishing, how can you go boat fishing.</font>

1073
00:43:22,807 --> 00:43:24,397
<font size="36">But actually, boat fishing is quite unique (?), so</font>

1074
00:43:24,397 --> 00:43:28,229
<font size="36">I don't know if Soo-wan will like it.</font>

1075
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:28,627
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1076
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:30,827
<font size="36">I predict her hair will get messy.</font>

1077
00:43:34,687 --> 00:43:35,387
<font size="36">Shall we get on the boat?</font>

1078
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:35,987
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1079
00:43:37,057 --> 00:43:37,887
<font size="36">Oh, is it that scary?</font>

1080
00:43:41,557 --> 00:43:42,057
<font size="36">You have to hold on!</font>

1081
00:43:42,057 --> 00:43:42,907
<font size="36">You have to hold on! You have to hold on!</font>

1082
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:44,917
<font size="36">Let me hold your hand.</font>

1083
00:43:49,207 --> 00:43:50,287
<font size="36">Oh? He suddenly grabbed her hand...!!!</font>

1084
00:43:50,287 --> 00:43:50,617
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

1085
00:43:50,617 --> 00:43:50,987
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

1086
00:43:50,987 --> 00:43:51,287
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

1087
00:43:51,287 --> 00:43:51,977
<font size="36">They held hands! They held hands!!</font>

1088
00:43:52,387 --> 00:43:52,807
<font size="36">Hey...!</font>

1089
00:43:53,677 --> 00:43:54,637
<font size="36">This way, everything will go smoothly~</font>

1090
00:43:54,637 --> 00:43:55,087
<font size="36">They held hands!</font>

1091
00:43:55,437 --> 00:43:55,937
<font size="36">It'll all be smooth sailing.</font>

1092
00:43:56,407 --> 00:43:56,847
<font size="36">It's smooth sailing now.</font>

1093
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:57,257
<font size="36">It's over.</font>

1094
00:43:57,977 --> 00:43:58,337
<font size="36">It's over.</font>

1095
00:43:58,337 --> 00:43:58,657
<font size="36">It's over.</font>

1096
00:44:03,897 --> 00:44:04,587
<font size="36">Oh, they've set off.</font>

1097
00:44:04,587 --> 00:44:04,977
<font size="36">Oh, they're gone.</font>

1098
00:44:06,037 --> 00:44:06,907
<font size="36">Ah, so nervous.</font>

1099
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,427
<font size="36">So cool. The wind is blowing too.</font>

1100
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:11,667
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1101
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:13,417
<font size="36">The sun hasn't risen yet, so</font>

1102
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:16,367
<font size="36">Ah, so beautiful.</font>

1103
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:20,197
<font size="36">Because it's also an unfamiliar environment, so</font>

1104
00:44:20,677 --> 00:44:21,837
<font size="36">she might unexpectedly enjoy it.</font>

1105
00:44:24,297 --> 00:44:25,207
<font size="36">It seems like they've arrived, don't you think?</font>

1106
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:27,107
<font size="36">Almost there.</font>

1107
00:44:34,497 --> 00:44:35,507
<font size="36">How is it? Do you feel it coming?</font>

1108
00:44:36,387 --> 00:44:37,957
<font size="36">I feel like something is coming, but also not.</font>

1109
00:44:38,947 --> 00:44:39,817
<font size="36">If you catch one, it'll be so fun.</font>

1110
00:44:40,157 --> 00:44:40,387
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1111
00:44:40,697 --> 00:44:41,597
<font size="36">Alright, catch it.</font>

1112
00:44:44,617 --> 00:44:45,097
<font size="36">Did he catch one?</font>

1113
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:47,427
<font size="36">So early?</font>

1114
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:50,887
<font size="36">Oh, did he catch one?</font>

1115
00:44:53,287 --> 00:44:54,007
<font size="36">Ah... couldn't catch it.</font>

1116
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:57,417
<font size="36">Catch it, catch it...</font>

1117
00:44:58,857 --> 00:45:00,317
<font size="36">Catch it, catch it.</font>

1118
00:45:00,317 --> 00:45:00,617
<font size="36">Catch it.</font>

1119
00:45:04,211 --> 00:45:04,711
<font size="36">Boring</font>

1120
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:09,131
<font size="36">Look at her expression ㅋㅋㅋ</font>

1121
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:10,231
<font size="36">Her expression is not good. Oh dear, what to do.</font>

1122
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:12,841
<font size="36">So, patience</font>

1123
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:13,711
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1124
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,511
<font size="36">It seems it has to be good. Just like that.</font>

1125
00:45:17,031 --> 00:45:17,931
<font size="36">Have you reached your patience limit?</font>

1126
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:19,581
<font size="36">Why wouldn't it?</font>

1127
00:45:20,711 --> 00:45:22,911
<font size="36">Now her head is spinning. She's starting to get bored.</font>

1128
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:25,511
<font size="36">Hey, a first date like this will surely make them enemies, won't it?</font>

1129
00:45:26,511 --> 00:45:29,211
<font size="36">As I see it, this is for Seong-jun's personal enjoyment,</font>

1130
00:45:29,211 --> 00:45:29,711
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1131
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:30,911
<font size="36">he chose such a place.</font>

1132
00:45:30,911 --> 00:45:31,511
<font size="36">So innocent.</font>

1133
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:34,321
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1134
00:45:34,721 --> 00:45:35,021
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1135
00:45:35,021 --> 00:45:35,521
<font size="36">Did he catch something?</font>

1136
00:45:35,921 --> 00:45:36,521
<font size="36">It's here, are you sure?</font>

1137
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:37,921
<font size="36">No, this is a bit heavy.</font>

1138
00:45:38,521 --> 00:45:39,221
<font size="36">Oh, it's here, it's here.</font>

1139
00:45:39,221 --> 00:45:39,721
<font size="36">Oh, hey.</font>

1140
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:40,221
<font size="36">Caught it.</font>

1141
00:45:40,221 --> 00:45:40,721
<font size="36">Caught it.</font>

1142
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:41,521
<font size="36">Caught it. Caught it. Caught it.</font>

1143
00:45:41,721 --> 00:45:42,221
<font size="36">Oh, it's here. It's here.</font>

1144
00:45:42,221 --> 00:45:42,721
<font size="36">It's here. It's here. It's here.</font>

1145
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:43,221
<font size="36">It's here. It's here.</font>

1146
00:45:43,221 --> 00:45:43,721
<font size="36">It's here.</font>

1147
00:45:43,721 --> 00:45:44,221
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1148
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:44,721
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1149
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:44,921
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

1150
00:45:44,921 --> 00:45:45,921
<font size="36">Hey, Soo-wan caught one.</font>

1151
00:45:45,921 --> 00:45:46,221
<font size="36">What?</font>

1152
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:47,921
<font size="36">Oh, amazing.</font>

1153
00:45:47,921 --> 00:45:48,521
<font size="36">Flounder, flounder, flounder.</font>

1154
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:49,221
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1155
00:45:49,721 --> 00:45:50,521
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1156
00:45:51,721 --> 00:45:52,721
<font size="36">Congratulations on your first fish.</font>

1157
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:54,921
<font size="36">The fish seems to like me more.</font>

1158
00:45:58,221 --> 00:45:59,221
<font size="36">Why can't I catch anything?</font>

1159
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:01,921
<font size="36">Moving a bit again?</font>

1160
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:02,921
<font size="36">Moving again?</font>

1161
00:46:03,221 --> 00:46:04,921
<font size="36">See? I told you Soo-wan would catch them all.</font>

1162
00:46:05,921 --> 00:46:06,221
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1163
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:06,721
<font size="36">Caught it.</font>

1164
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:07,221
<font size="36">See?</font>

1165
00:46:07,221 --> 00:46:07,521
<font size="36">Caught it.</font>

1166
00:46:08,521 --> 00:46:08,921
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1167
00:46:08,921 --> 00:46:09,221
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1168
00:46:09,921 --> 00:46:10,521
<font size="36">So big.</font>

1169
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:10,921
<font size="36">Very big indeed.</font>

1170
00:46:10,921 --> 00:46:11,221
<font size="36">Amazing.</font>

1171
00:46:11,721 --> 00:46:12,221
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1172
00:46:12,221 --> 00:46:12,721
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1173
00:46:12,721 --> 00:46:12,921
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1174
00:46:13,221 --> 00:46:13,721
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

1175
00:46:13,721 --> 00:46:14,221
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1176
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:14,721
<font size="36">Oh, hey, hey.</font>

1177
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:15,221
<font size="36">Two fish.</font>

1178
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:15,721
<font size="36">Two fish.</font>

1179
00:46:16,221 --> 00:46:16,721
<font size="36">Hey, what's that?</font>

1180
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:18,521
<font size="36">Two at once.</font>

1181
00:46:18,921 --> 00:46:20,921
<font size="36">Wow, you've experienced the feeling of reeling in two fish, something Dad has never seen.</font>

1182
00:46:21,221 --> 00:46:21,721
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1183
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:22,521
<font size="36">This is exciting, isn't it? It's really fun, isn't it?</font>

1184
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:02,076
<font size="36">Q: How was today's date?</font>

1185
00:47:02,176 --> 00:47:04,412
<font size="36">Uh, actually, I was very worried</font>

1186
00:47:04,512 --> 00:47:08,215
<font size="36">I thought, "What if she doesn't like fishing?", but fortunately</font>

1187
00:47:08,749 --> 00:47:10,884
<font size="36">I think she liked it.</font>

1188
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:16,691
<font size="36">I didn't think I was truly interested in boat fishing.</font>

1189
00:47:23,097 --> 00:47:25,532
<font size="36">Q: What was the most exciting moment of the date?</font>

1190
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:28,869
<font size="36">A heart-fluttering moment.</font>

1191
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:32,506
<font size="36">I didn't feel any moment like that.</font>

1192
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:38,476
<font size="36">That boat fishing thing is not a date.</font>

1193
00:47:38,653 --> 00:47:42,684
<font size="36">Seong-jun doesn't seem to be caring about the girl, but rather satisfying his own personal hobby.</font>

1194
00:47:42,783 --> 00:47:44,618
<font size="36">Boat fishing is not good at all.</font>

1195
00:47:44,718 --> 00:47:47,755
<font size="36">That's right, not good at all, completely</font>

1196
00:47:50,024 --> 00:47:52,593
<font size="36">I wanted to come to this place.</font>

1197
00:47:52,693 --> 00:47:54,227
<font size="36">Amazing.</font>

1198
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:57,731
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1199
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,403
<font size="36">Oh, it's an LP cafe.</font>

1200
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:04,805
<font size="36">Oh, so many LP albums.</font>

1201
00:48:05,006 --> 00:48:07,141
<font size="36">This retro style is really nice.</font>

1202
00:48:07,945 --> 00:48:11,145
<font size="36">because they both had similar musical tastes, they already had a good impression,</font>

1203
00:48:13,585 --> 00:48:15,875
<font size="36">First, choose a song.</font>

1204
00:48:21,105 --> 00:48:23,015
<font size="36">That song, 'You are like a star'.</font>

1205
00:48:23,825 --> 00:48:24,515
<font size="36">You too</font>

1206
00:48:27,415 --> 00:48:28,975
<font size="36">Owner, I'll leave my song request here.</font>

1207
00:48:29,445 --> 00:48:30,295
<font size="36">Ah, yes, you can correct it.</font>

1208
00:48:30,495 --> 00:48:30,825
<font size="36">Yes, yes.</font>

1209
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:40,365
<font size="36">Oh, Shin-hyang requested a song.</font>

1210
00:48:40,705 --> 00:48:41,235
<font size="36">Likes Yoo Jae-ha.</font>

1211
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:41,845
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1212
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:43,765
<font size="36">Ah, my son also really likes Yoo Jae-ha.</font>

1213
00:48:44,235 --> 00:48:44,635
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

1214
00:48:44,725 --> 00:48:45,915
<font size="36">Oh, ah, they have something in common now.</font>

1215
00:48:51,955 --> 00:48:53,035
<font size="36">Ah, Tak-soo likes it now.</font>

1216
00:49:13,565 --> 00:49:14,355
<font size="36">Ah... that's good.</font>

1217
00:49:19,775 --> 00:49:22,045
<font size="36">That's right, on a first date, you have to listen to music.</font>

1218
00:49:22,605 --> 00:49:23,545
<font size="36">What's the point of flounder.</font>

1219
00:49:24,865 --> 00:49:26,954
<font size="36">(Learn a little from Tak-soo.)
Why would you want to smell the sea?</font>

1220
00:49:30,595 --> 00:49:33,855
<font size="36">It's truly a date itinerary very much like Tak-soo's.</font>

1221
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:40,768
<font size="36">Ah, it seems like doing things Tak-soo likes together is really good.</font>

1222
00:49:41,365 --> 00:49:42,615
<font size="36">But now...</font>

1223
00:49:43,437 --> 00:49:45,840
<font size="36">But what about now?</font>

1224
00:49:46,975 --> 00:49:48,705
<font size="36">But, like, everyone has a different style.</font>

1225
00:49:49,775 --> 00:49:52,235
<font size="36">Some people want to get to know many people.</font>

1226
00:49:53,565 --> 00:49:55,235
<font size="36">And there are also people who, if they've 'fallen' for someone, just go for it.</font>

1227
00:49:55,435 --> 00:49:55,855
<font size="36">That's right, that's right.</font>

1228
00:49:56,715 --> 00:49:58,095
<font size="36">Because everyone has their own style.</font>

1229
00:49:59,515 --> 00:50:01,088
<font size="36">What style do you think you are?</font>

1230
00:50:01,188 --> 00:50:02,089
<font size="36">Me?</font>

1231
00:50:03,615 --> 00:50:04,615
<font size="36">Seems like the type to easily 'fall' for someone.</font>

1232
00:50:04,965 --> 00:50:05,859
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1233
00:50:05,893 --> 00:50:07,394
<font size="36">Ah, now it's</font>

1234
00:50:07,585 --> 00:50:07,785
<font size="36">Right</font>

1235
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:09,415
<font size="36">They're talking now.</font>

1236
00:50:15,505 --> 00:50:15,855
<font size="36">As for me...</font>

1237
00:50:17,535 --> 00:50:20,415
<font size="36">Still the type who wants to talk a little more? Seems like that style.</font>

1238
00:50:23,865 --> 00:50:24,235
<font size="36">What to do.</font>

1239
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:33,454
<font size="36">Should I call it a little disappointing?</font>

1240
00:50:33,554 --> 00:50:35,723
<font size="36">There was a little regret like that.</font>

1241
00:50:36,056 --> 00:50:37,045
<font size="36">Like,</font>

1242
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:37,635
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1243
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:38,635
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1244
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:42,235
<font size="36">Today was good but</font>

1245
00:50:43,055 --> 00:50:49,235
<font size="36">It seems I kept thinking about some concern arising in my heart.</font>

1246
00:50:50,705 --> 00:50:51,095
<font size="36">That's right, that's right.</font>

1247
00:50:51,095 --> 00:50:52,235
<font size="36">Very good but</font>

1248
00:50:52,855 --> 00:50:53,235
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1249
00:50:53,435 --> 00:50:56,105
<font size="36">But at the decisive moment, he said something disappointing.</font>

1250
00:51:01,484 --> 00:51:02,084
<font size="36">Actually, me,</font>

1251
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:03,414
<font size="36">one person...</font>

1252
00:51:04,234 --> 00:51:04,864
<font size="36">That is, still</font>

1253
00:51:05,374 --> 00:51:08,024
<font size="36">haven't dated other people and</font>

1254
00:51:08,574 --> 00:51:09,444
<font size="36">haven't talked much, so</font>

1255
00:51:09,794 --> 00:51:10,004
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1256
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:11,614
<font size="36">I don't know what kind of person he is.</font>

1257
00:51:11,884 --> 00:51:12,234
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1258
00:51:12,714 --> 00:51:12,914
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1259
00:51:13,034 --> 00:51:19,274
<font size="36">Oh, I want to talk to other people too, but what should I do? Like,</font>

1260
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:21,434
<font size="36">So I think I spoke frankly.</font>

1261
00:51:21,714 --> 00:51:23,164
<font size="36">My style is a bit like this.</font>

1262
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:23,924
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1263
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,174
<font size="36">If I lied, the disappointment would be greater.</font>

1264
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:26,594
<font size="36">That's right, that's right.</font>

1265
00:51:26,734 --> 00:51:27,014
<font size="36">Rather.</font>

1266
00:51:27,444 --> 00:51:28,442
<font size="36">Just say it directly like that</font>

1267
00:51:28,754 --> 00:51:29,074
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1268
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:30,384
<font size="36">I think that's right.</font>

1269
00:51:30,724 --> 00:51:30,984
<font size="36">Ah, that's right.</font>

1270
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:31,274
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1271
00:51:31,774 --> 00:51:32,604
<font size="36">I think so too. Then,</font>

1272
00:51:33,154 --> 00:51:34,024
<font size="36">it will be binding later.</font>

1273
00:51:34,154 --> 00:51:34,454
<font size="36">Of course.</font>

1274
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,504
<font size="36">Then they'll say, 'You said that back then, but now it's different.'</font>

1275
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:38,194
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1276
00:51:38,764 --> 00:51:46,014
<font size="36">Shin-hyang thought that since she told him this much, he would respond similarly, but</font>

1277
00:51:46,014 --> 00:51:46,804
<font size="36">it's not like that now.</font>

1278
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:47,074
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1279
00:51:47,344 --> 00:51:49,454
<font size="36">That's how love is. Isn't it something that can't be as you wish?</font>

1280
00:51:49,744 --> 00:51:50,104
<font size="36">That can happen.</font>

1281
00:51:50,104 --> 00:51:50,304
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1282
00:51:50,854 --> 00:51:51,954
<font size="36">Their styles are a bit different, aren't they?</font>

1283
00:51:52,164 --> 00:51:52,424
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1284
00:51:52,924 --> 00:51:53,724
<font size="36">I understand both sides.</font>

1285
00:51:53,724 --> 00:51:53,924
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1286
00:51:53,924 --> 00:51:54,124
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1287
00:51:54,284 --> 00:51:54,594
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1288
00:51:55,014 --> 00:52:02,194
<font size="36">And at this point, I think it's possible that Shin-hyang is a born-single person, because she shouldn't open up so quickly.</font>

1289
00:52:02,544 --> 00:52:03,284
<font size="36">You shouldn't show your feelings too quickly.</font>

1290
00:52:03,284 --> 00:52:07,534
<font size="36">But because Shin-hyang has no experience, she quickly expressed her feelings.</font>

1291
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:08,304
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1292
00:52:08,544 --> 00:52:08,744
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1293
00:52:08,854 --> 00:52:11,264
<font size="36">So, as a father, it's a bit...</font>

1294
00:52:11,774 --> 00:52:13,574
<font size="36">When Shin-hyang really likes something, there's an action she often does.</font>

1295
00:52:13,774 --> 00:52:13,974
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1296
00:52:14,104 --> 00:52:15,414
<font size="36">She sways her body side to side like this.</font>

1297
00:52:15,624 --> 00:52:15,974
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1298
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:21,404
<font size="36">Seeing her so happy with Tak-soo and listening to music, but</font>

1299
00:52:21,854 --> 00:52:25,024
<font size="36">at that time, Shin-hyang's disappointed expression</font>

1300
00:52:25,024 --> 00:52:25,374
<font size="36">I saw it too.</font>

1301
00:52:25,374 --> 00:52:26,064
<font size="36">It appeared instantly.</font>

1302
00:52:26,064 --> 00:52:29,884
<font size="36">But Shin-hyang shows her emotions too clearly, both when she's happy and unhappy, so</font>

1303
00:52:29,884 --> 00:52:30,094
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1304
00:52:30,094 --> 00:52:30,294
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1305
00:52:30,774 --> 00:52:34,534
<font size="36">On that point, as a father, it's a bit heartbreaking to see.</font>

1306
00:52:34,534 --> 00:52:34,794
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1307
00:52:41,004 --> 00:52:41,434
<font size="36">Let's go this way first.</font>

1308
00:52:41,984 --> 00:52:42,524
<font size="36">Going to eat?</font>

1309
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:45,794
<font size="36">Can I get one portion of pork belly and one portion of pork shoulder?</font>

1310
00:52:45,794 --> 00:52:46,854
<font size="36">One portion of pork belly, one portion of pork shoulder.</font>

1311
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:47,394
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1312
00:52:47,394 --> 00:52:47,754
<font size="36">Yes, thank you.</font>

1313
00:52:47,754 --> 00:52:48,054
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1314
00:52:48,324 --> 00:52:50,164
<font size="36">Good food. Shin-hyang likes pork shoulder.</font>

1315
00:52:51,594 --> 00:52:53,174
<font size="36">Let's have set C first.</font>

1316
00:52:53,384 --> 00:52:53,774
<font size="36">Set C?</font>

1317
00:52:53,934 --> 00:52:54,304
<font size="36">Set C?</font>

1318
00:52:54,414 --> 00:52:54,914
<font size="36">Yes, I understand.</font>

1319
00:52:55,254 --> 00:52:55,644
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

1320
00:52:55,854 --> 00:52:56,204
<font size="36">Wow!</font>

1321
00:52:56,534 --> 00:52:57,184
<font size="36">Ah, at the raw fish restaurant.</font>

1322
00:52:57,644 --> 00:52:59,104
<font size="36">Oh, hey, that's expensive.</font>

1323
00:52:59,864 --> 00:53:00,594
<font size="36">Wow!</font>

1324
00:53:00,864 --> 00:53:02,614
<font size="36">Oh, it's good now. It's good.</font>

1325
00:53:02,614 --> 00:53:03,004
<font size="36">So happy.</font>

1326
00:53:03,354 --> 00:53:05,414
<font size="36">Exercising hard then eating delicious food.</font>

1327
00:53:05,684 --> 00:53:06,224
<font size="36">It must taste even better.</font>

1328
00:53:07,314 --> 00:53:08,114
<font size="36">It's so beautiful here.</font>

1329
00:53:09,194 --> 00:53:12,514
<font size="36">When the sun rises, sitting there is also good.</font>

1330
00:53:12,874 --> 00:53:13,854
<font size="36">Perfect itinerary.</font>

1331
00:53:14,884 --> 00:53:16,254
<font size="36">It's the beef cheese burger set.</font>

1332
00:53:16,254 --> 00:53:16,454
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1333
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:17,334
<font size="36">Oh, hey.</font>

1334
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:18,104
<font size="36">Hamburger.</font>

1335
00:53:18,104 --> 00:53:18,394
<font size="36">Hamburger?</font>

1336
00:53:18,554 --> 00:53:18,804
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1337
00:53:18,804 --> 00:53:19,104
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

1338
00:53:19,314 --> 00:53:20,304
<font size="36">Doesn't that get stuck in your mouth?</font>

1339
00:53:21,384 --> 00:53:21,664
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1340
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:21,914
<font size="36">Exactly.</font>

1341
00:53:22,904 --> 00:53:23,714
<font size="36">You have to open your mouth wide.</font>

1342
00:53:23,714 --> 00:53:23,984
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1343
00:53:24,404 --> 00:53:25,154
<font size="36">Ah, Seong-jun again...</font>

1344
00:53:25,154 --> 00:53:26,954
<font size="36">Actually, on the first date, it's a hamburger.</font>

1345
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:27,154
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1346
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:29,584
<font size="36">Ah, it must be delicious.</font>

1347
00:53:31,734 --> 00:53:33,124
<font size="36">Are there a lot of side dishes?</font>

1348
00:53:33,874 --> 00:53:34,154
<font size="36">Swoosh.</font>

1349
00:53:34,664 --> 00:53:35,064
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

1350
00:53:39,264 --> 00:53:39,574
<font size="36">Oh, what is it?</font>

1351
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:40,344
<font size="36">Oh, a message arrived.</font>

1352
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:41,004
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1353
00:53:41,154 --> 00:53:41,604
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1354
00:53:41,604 --> 00:53:41,804
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1355
00:53:41,974 --> 00:53:42,224
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1356
00:53:42,454 --> 00:53:43,124
<font size="36">What, it just came out of nowhere?</font>

1357
00:53:48,114 --> 00:53:48,414
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1358
00:53:49,054 --> 00:53:49,404
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1359
00:53:49,404 --> 00:53:49,604
<font size="36">What?</font>

1360
00:53:49,604 --> 00:53:49,804
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1361
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:51,124
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1362
00:53:51,724 --> 00:53:52,124
<font size="36">Oh, everyone's surprised.</font>

1363
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:53,124
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1364
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:58,834
<font size="36">Wow, change partners?</font>

1365
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:04,574
<font size="36">Ah, from now on, you will change date partners. Ladies, please immediately move to the location of the person you chose this morning.</font>

1366
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:05,658
<font size="36">Please move.</font>

1367
00:54:05,658 --> 00:54:06,008
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1368
00:54:07,008 --> 00:54:07,608
<font size="36">Suddenly telling us to move?!</font>

1369
00:54:08,108 --> 00:54:08,708
<font size="36">What the heck...!!</font>

1370
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:09,508
<font size="36">No, the meat</font>

1371
00:54:09,808 --> 00:54:11,108
<font size="36">No, the meat hasn't even come out yet.</font>

1372
00:54:11,108 --> 00:54:12,208
<font size="36">You should finish eating before doing that.</font>

1373
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:12,508
<font size="36">The meal</font>

1374
00:54:12,808 --> 00:54:13,708
<font size="36">Just ordered a meal</font>

1375
00:54:14,108 --> 00:54:14,608
<font size="36">Immediately.</font>

1376
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:14,908
<font size="36">Immediately.</font>

1377
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:19,797
<font size="36">Date?</font>

1378
00:54:21,797 --> 00:54:22,697
<font size="36">Do you want to go bowling?</font>

1379
00:54:23,197 --> 00:54:24,697
<font size="36">Do you want to go on a date with me?</font>

1380
00:54:24,997 --> 00:54:26,097
<font size="36">Do you want to go eat delicious food?</font>

1381
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:27,297
<font size="36">Okay, delicious food.</font>

1382
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:27,997
<font size="36">Ah, yes.</font>

1383
00:54:32,274 --> 00:54:32,924
<font size="36">Ah, there's something.</font>

1384
00:54:35,574 --> 00:54:36,074
<font size="36">Oh, what is it?</font>

1385
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:37,274
<font size="36">Ah, with the daughter.</font>

1386
00:54:38,674 --> 00:54:41,074
<font size="36">They told them to send the name of the opposite sex they want to date.</font>

1387
00:54:42,174 --> 00:54:43,674
<font size="36">It's the daughter who signed up.</font>

1388
00:54:44,274 --> 00:54:46,574
<font size="36">They should also give the daughters a chance to be proactive like this.</font>

1389
00:54:47,374 --> 00:54:48,774
<font size="36">Those who went on mini-dates cannot do it.</font>

1390
00:54:49,574 --> 00:54:51,274
<font size="36">That's right. It has to be like that to get to know more people.</font>

1391
00:54:51,274 --> 00:54:51,774
<font size="36">It has to be like that.</font>

1392
00:54:51,774 --> 00:54:54,274
<font size="36">Oh, Shin-hyang has to choose someone other than Tak-soo.</font>

1393
00:54:54,474 --> 00:54:54,874
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1394
00:54:55,474 --> 00:54:58,074
<font size="36">Then Sa-yoon also can't choose Sun-jun.</font>

1395
00:54:58,074 --> 00:54:58,474
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1396
00:54:58,474 --> 00:55:00,574
<font size="36">Because they went on a mini-date together yesterday.</font>

1397
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:08,517
<font size="36">As soon as I saw it, my heart thumped.</font>

1398
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:11,517
<font size="36">I was both nervous and excited.</font>

1399
00:55:12,317 --> 00:55:13,717
<font size="36">I thought a lot.</font>

1400
00:55:15,717 --> 00:55:18,817
<font size="36">Except for Tak-soo, who went shopping with me yesterday.</font>

1401
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:21,617
<font size="36">After receiving that message, I really</font>

1402
00:55:22,117 --> 00:55:27,817
<font size="36">was supposed to send it before 9 o'clock, but I couldn't send the message even at 8:59.</font>

1403
00:55:28,517 --> 00:55:29,017
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1404
00:55:29,317 --> 00:55:31,351
<font size="36">Shin-hyang just went straight for Tak-soo.</font>

1405
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:33,517
<font size="36">Shin-hyang must have frozen.</font>

1406
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:38,717
<font size="36">Oh, after thinking a lot, I sent the name.</font>

1407
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:53,717
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1408
00:55:59,017 --> 00:56:00,817
<font size="36">They said to change date partners, so I thought I misread it.</font>

1409
00:56:01,717 --> 00:56:02,117
<font size="36">Is that so?</font>

1410
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,117
<font size="36">She seems very flustered.</font>

1411
00:56:05,217 --> 00:56:05,717
<font size="36">What is this?</font>

1412
00:56:07,217 --> 00:56:08,717
<font size="36">Another rather awkward thing has arrived.</font>

1413
00:56:11,217 --> 00:56:11,617
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

1414
00:56:13,217 --> 00:56:14,417
<font size="36">Can it be like this?</font>

1415
00:56:16,317 --> 00:56:16,908
<font size="36">...</font>

1416
00:56:17,717 --> 00:56:18,517
<font size="36">Don't eat anymore!</font>

1417
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:19,717
<font size="36">Ah!</font>

1418
00:56:20,517 --> 00:56:21,717
<font size="36">What is it? Don't eat anymore.</font>

1419
00:56:21,908 --> 00:56:23,317
<font size="36">Oh, wait a minute.</font>

1420
00:56:25,417 --> 00:56:25,617
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1421
00:56:25,717 --> 00:56:25,908
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1422
00:56:36,317 --> 00:56:37,217
<font size="36">Hey, that's cruel.</font>

1423
00:56:37,217 --> 00:56:37,517
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1424
00:56:38,117 --> 00:56:40,717
<font size="36">Sun-jun hasn't even had a chance to talk properly.</font>

1425
00:56:44,817 --> 00:56:47,217
<font size="36">It was really too awkward and</font>

1426
00:56:47,817 --> 00:56:51,908
<font size="36">so I had to get up and say 'I'm leaving' and go?</font>

1427
00:56:53,017 --> 00:56:55,517
<font size="36">I was very embarrassed and a bit flustered.</font>

1428
00:56:57,717 --> 00:56:58,517
<font size="36">Like this?</font>

1429
00:56:58,517 --> 00:56:58,908
<font size="36">Leaving?</font>

1430
00:57:01,656 --> 00:57:02,566
<font size="36">It was very fun.</font>

1431
00:57:04,186 --> 00:57:04,696
<font size="36">Such a shame.</font>

1432
00:57:05,316 --> 00:57:05,866
<font size="36">I'll eat it all.</font>

1433
00:57:06,196 --> 00:57:06,906
<font size="36">Enjoy your meal.</font>

1434
00:57:08,096 --> 00:57:08,476
<font size="36">Hic...</font>

1435
00:57:13,606 --> 00:57:15,096
<font size="36">Ah, Sun-jun has lost all spirit.</font>

1436
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:17,016
<font size="36">Ah, what to do.</font>

1437
00:57:26,626 --> 00:57:27,446
<font size="36">He just keeps looking at his phone.</font>

1438
00:57:27,716 --> 00:57:28,846
<font size="36">Ah, how sad.</font>

1439
00:57:29,216 --> 00:57:30,616
<font size="36">He didn't even get to do anything.</font>

1440
00:57:30,866 --> 00:57:33,516
<font size="36">Yes. Sun-jun was still waiting for a more suitable moment. Yes.</font>

1441
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:36,866
<font size="36">Although there was a little regret,</font>

1442
00:57:37,626 --> 00:57:39,846
<font size="36">I think the person leaving would be more awkward,</font>

1443
00:57:40,496 --> 00:57:41,986
<font size="36">so I hope they don't mind.</font>

1444
00:57:42,506 --> 00:57:45,606
<font size="36">I thought they should go comfortably.</font>

1445
00:57:47,646 --> 00:57:48,796
<font size="36">Hey, this boy is so kind.</font>

1446
00:57:49,676 --> 00:57:51,056
<font size="36">The one staying, like you, would have a harder time, this person.</font>

1447
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:57,406
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1448
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:57,966
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1449
00:57:58,616 --> 00:57:59,316
<font size="36">I have to go too.</font>

1450
00:58:00,926 --> 00:58:01,836
<font size="36">Enjoy your meal.</font>

1451
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:04,646
<font size="36">Enjoy your meal without me.</font>

1452
00:58:05,406 --> 00:58:06,616
<font size="36">Enjoy your meal without me.</font>

1453
00:58:07,326 --> 00:58:08,296
<font size="36">See you at home tonight.</font>

1454
00:58:09,056 --> 00:58:10,056
<font size="36">See you at home tonight.</font>

1455
00:58:10,606 --> 00:58:11,376
<font size="36">It's like they're a married couple.</font>

1456
00:58:11,976 --> 00:58:12,876
<font size="36">See you at home tonight.</font>

1457
00:58:14,436 --> 00:58:15,676
<font size="36">Can't move her feet?</font>

1458
00:58:16,716 --> 00:58:16,916
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1459
00:58:17,216 --> 00:58:17,906
<font size="36">Oh? What, what?</font>

1460
00:58:18,096 --> 00:58:18,696
<font size="36">Can't leave?</font>

1461
00:58:20,966 --> 00:58:21,466
<font size="36">Can't leave.</font>

1462
00:58:21,596 --> 00:58:22,826
<font size="36">Hey, Shin-hyang can't leave.</font>

1463
00:58:23,316 --> 00:58:24,216
<font size="36">Can she only wait?</font>

1464
00:58:24,786 --> 00:58:25,686
<font size="36">Oh, it was very...</font>

1465
00:58:26,786 --> 00:58:27,016
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1466
00:58:27,336 --> 00:58:29,416
<font size="36">Is it just the feeling of not wanting to leave?</font>

1467
00:58:30,416 --> 00:58:32,916
<font size="36">At that time, eating was a bit...</font>

1468
00:58:33,316 --> 00:58:34,816
<font size="36">Other stories</font>

1469
00:58:34,816 --> 00:58:36,816
<font size="36">wish I could have talked more?</font>

1470
00:58:37,216 --> 00:58:39,316
<font size="36">I thought I had to try it once</font>

1471
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:41,216
<font size="36">Ah... regret?</font>

1472
00:58:42,116 --> 00:58:43,916
<font size="36">Regret. Seems like that feeling.</font>

1473
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:48,416
<font size="36">Ah... what to do...</font>

1474
00:58:51,516 --> 00:58:52,016
<font size="36">I'm leaving.</font>

1475
00:58:56,216 --> 00:58:56,516
<font size="36">Go safely.</font>

1476
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:57,416
<font size="36">Enjoy your meal.</font>

1477
00:58:57,716 --> 00:58:57,916
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

1478
00:58:59,516 --> 00:59:00,216
<font size="36">What time are you coming home?</font>

1479
00:59:01,616 --> 00:59:02,316
<font size="36">I don't know.</font>

1480
00:59:03,816 --> 00:59:04,116
<font size="36">Bye.</font>

1481
00:59:04,616 --> 00:59:04,816
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

1482
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:06,116
<font size="36">No, what</font>

1483
00:59:06,616 --> 00:59:07,016
<font size="36">What time are you coming home?</font>

1484
00:59:07,116 --> 00:59:08,916
<font size="36">No, Tak-soo even checked the time she's coming home.</font>

1485
00:59:09,516 --> 00:59:11,716
<font size="36">'Dad, when are you coming home?' Has Shin-hyang ever asked?</font>

1486
00:59:12,316 --> 00:59:13,216
<font size="36">Mostly I ask.</font>

1487
00:59:15,016 --> 00:59:15,216
<font size="36">And also,</font>

1488
00:59:15,716 --> 00:59:16,916
<font size="36">Shin-hyang's favorite pork shoulder.</font>

1489
00:59:17,216 --> 00:59:17,416
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1490
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:19,416
<font size="36">When they had already ordered more and were about to grill it,</font>

1491
00:59:19,716 --> 00:59:21,416
<font size="36">Shin-hyang was eliminated.</font>

1492
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:21,616
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1493
00:59:22,116 --> 00:59:22,316
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1494
00:59:22,816 --> 00:59:23,816
<font size="36">Ah, technical jargon.</font>

1495
00:59:24,116 --> 00:59:24,816
<font size="36">Eliminated, eliminated.</font>

1496
00:59:25,216 --> 00:59:26,416
<font size="36">Please use a bit more polite language.</font>

1497
00:59:27,216 --> 00:59:29,016
<font size="36">No, in this situation, what's polite about it?</font>

1498
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:32,116
<font size="36">She was eliminated, so she's furious.</font>

1499
00:59:34,016 --> 00:59:35,216
<font size="36">Is that the atmosphere now?</font>

1500
00:59:35,216 --> 00:59:35,416
<font size="36">Yes, yes.</font>

1501
00:59:36,916 --> 00:59:38,416
<font size="36">So I... go... go...</font>

1502
00:59:39,316 --> 00:59:39,816
<font size="36">First of all, yes...</font>

1503
00:59:43,016 --> 00:59:43,416
<font size="36">Oh...</font>

1504
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:56,216
<font size="36">She might be able to come back, right...?</font>

1505
00:59:57,516 --> 00:59:58,416
<font size="36">Because she didn't go on a mini-date.</font>

1506
00:59:58,716 --> 00:59:59,116
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1507
01:00:01,316 --> 01:00:03,016
<font size="36">Thank, ah, thank you for bringing me back.</font>

1508
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:04,437
<font size="36">It was very fun.</font>

1509
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:05,367
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

1510
01:00:05,667 --> 01:00:06,297
<font size="36">Enjoy your meal.</font>

1511
01:00:06,407 --> 01:00:06,997
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

1512
01:00:09,988 --> 01:00:11,618
<font size="36">Seok-joo might still be here...</font>

1513
01:00:11,878 --> 01:00:12,398
<font size="36">Yes, that's the situation.</font>

1514
01:00:12,908 --> 01:00:13,478
<font size="36">But for some reason...</font>

1515
01:00:14,818 --> 01:00:16,498
<font size="36">Seok-joo will go back with Jun-ho.</font>

1516
01:00:17,088 --> 01:00:17,318
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1517
01:00:17,528 --> 01:00:17,788
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1518
01:00:18,188 --> 01:00:18,618
<font size="36">Both of them...</font>

1519
01:00:18,908 --> 01:00:19,618
<font size="36">Both of them took photos together.</font>

1520
01:00:20,288 --> 01:00:21,218
<font size="36">I don't know why I think that either.</font>

1521
01:00:22,048 --> 01:00:22,788
<font size="36">They really, really like each other.</font>

1522
01:00:24,008 --> 01:00:26,618
<font size="36">Which daughter will seek out which son?</font>

1523
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:31,928
<font size="36">Wow, seriously.</font>

1524
01:00:32,198 --> 01:00:33,328
<font size="36">Now, the exchange begins.</font>

1525
01:00:36,027 --> 01:00:39,377
<font size="36">I thought there would definitely be commonalities or similar things, so</font>

1526
01:00:40,487 --> 01:00:42,547
<font size="36">I wanted to find out a bit more</font>

1527
01:00:43,617 --> 01:00:46,617
<font size="36">and I thought I should send it to the first person I thought of.</font>

1528
01:00:48,517 --> 01:00:50,237
<font size="36">I wanted to talk a little more.</font>

1529
01:00:51,117 --> 01:00:51,417
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1530
01:00:52,917 --> 01:00:54,167
<font size="36">So the choices here overlap?</font>

1531
01:00:54,707 --> 01:00:55,827
<font size="36">Now the girls...</font>

1532
01:00:56,827 --> 01:00:59,747
<font size="36">If they choose the same person, there will be three people on the date.</font>

1533
01:01:00,037 --> 01:01:00,527
<font size="36">That can happen.</font>

1534
01:01:00,747 --> 01:01:01,047
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1535
01:01:01,517 --> 01:01:04,817
<font size="36">If many people choose one person, some people won't get dinner tonight.</font>

1536
01:01:05,417 --> 01:01:05,607
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1537
01:01:05,977 --> 01:01:09,817
<font size="36">Now, did anyone here say that more than two people would come to our sons?!</font>

1538
01:01:10,097 --> 01:01:10,417
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1539
01:01:10,607 --> 01:01:10,937
<font size="36">Is there?</font>

1540
01:01:11,277 --> 01:01:12,617
<font size="36">About two people will definitely come.</font>

1541
01:01:13,417 --> 01:01:14,127
<font size="36">I think they can come.</font>

1542
01:01:14,287 --> 01:01:14,817
<font size="36">Ah, really.</font>

1543
01:01:16,247 --> 01:01:16,777
<font size="36">Why is it like this?</font>

1544
01:01:16,977 --> 01:01:17,607
<font size="36">I think it will work out.</font>

1545
01:01:19,267 --> 01:01:19,747
<font size="36">Who will come here?</font>

1546
01:01:30,615 --> 01:01:31,085
<font size="36">...</font>

1547
01:01:36,015 --> 01:01:36,465
<font size="36">He keeps looking.</font>

1548
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:37,525
<font size="36">It seems like he's been waiting for a long time.</font>

1549
01:01:37,845 --> 01:01:38,585
<font size="36">Tak-soo. Tak-soo keeps looking.</font>

1550
01:01:38,915 --> 01:01:40,065
<font size="36">If so, go outside and wait.</font>

1551
01:01:50,865 --> 01:01:51,125
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1552
01:01:51,565 --> 01:01:52,315
<font size="36">It seems someone is coming.</font>

1553
01:01:55,605 --> 01:01:55,935
<font size="36">So tall.</font>

1554
01:01:56,135 --> 01:01:56,615
<font size="36">Is it a man?</font>

1555
01:01:57,945 --> 01:01:58,605
<font size="36">Ah, startled...</font>

1556
01:01:59,215 --> 01:01:59,655
<font size="36">It's a customer.</font>

1557
01:01:59,845 --> 01:02:00,625
<font size="36">Just a customer at the barbecue restaurant...</font>

1558
01:02:01,255 --> 01:02:01,615
<font size="36">Startled.</font>

1559
01:02:02,155 --> 01:02:02,525
<font size="36">Ah, hey.</font>

1560
01:02:02,855 --> 01:02:03,965
<font size="36">No, I thought Hee-cheol's dad came in!</font>

1561
01:02:04,565 --> 01:02:05,435
<font size="36">No, I thought Hee-cheol's dad came in!</font>

1562
01:02:05,585 --> 01:02:06,025
<font size="36">Mr. Jeon Hee-cheol</font>

1563
01:02:06,425 --> 01:02:07,495
<font size="36">Oh, Jeon Hee-cheol. Oh, Mr. Jeon Hee-cheol.</font>

1564
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:09,425
<font size="36">No, why would Jeon Hee-cheol go in there?</font>

1565
01:02:11,425 --> 01:02:14,554
<font size="36">Q: Are you expecting anyone to come?</font>

1566
01:02:14,725 --> 01:02:16,515
<font size="36">When I thought about who would come if someone did,</font>

1567
01:02:16,615 --> 01:02:17,335
<font size="36">So Soo-wan...</font>

1568
01:02:18,365 --> 01:02:21,145
<font size="36">I think I heard her voice on the tape.</font>

1569
01:02:21,845 --> 01:02:23,615
<font size="36">So I wanted to talk to Soo-wan a bit too.</font>

1570
01:02:23,835 --> 01:02:24,125
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1571
01:02:24,755 --> 01:02:25,015
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1572
01:02:31,115 --> 01:02:31,585
<font size="36">No...</font>

1573
01:02:32,235 --> 01:02:32,485
<font size="36">No.</font>

1574
01:02:32,605 --> 01:02:33,095
<font size="36">That's right, that's right, that's right.</font>

1575
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:33,505
<font size="36">No.</font>

1576
01:02:35,815 --> 01:02:36,305
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1577
01:02:39,045 --> 01:02:39,615
<font size="36">Oh, isn't that Seok-joo?</font>

1578
01:02:39,925 --> 01:02:40,435
<font size="36">Isn't that Seok-joo?</font>

1579
01:02:40,605 --> 01:02:40,845
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1580
01:02:41,225 --> 01:02:41,605
<font size="36">Probably not.</font>

1581
01:02:42,045 --> 01:02:42,555
<font size="36">Soo-wan, Soo-wan.</font>

1582
01:02:54,225 --> 01:02:55,415
<font size="36">Tak-soo's expression brightened.</font>

1583
01:02:57,945 --> 01:02:58,485
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1584
01:02:59,055 --> 01:02:59,525
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1585
01:03:04,025 --> 01:03:04,485
<font size="36">Oh, it's Soo-wan.</font>

1586
01:03:04,855 --> 01:03:05,195
<font size="36">The voice.</font>

1587
01:03:05,655 --> 01:03:06,355
<font size="36">It's Soo-wan, look.</font>

1588
01:03:08,245 --> 01:03:09,655
<font size="36">Because there was nothing to do while waiting.</font>

1589
01:03:10,305 --> 01:03:11,135
<font size="36">Have you been here all this time?</font>

1590
01:03:11,465 --> 01:03:11,655
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1591
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,616
<font size="36">I thought she wouldn't come.</font>

1592
01:03:16,716 --> 01:03:17,500
<font size="36">So I was very happy.</font>

1593
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,360
<font size="36">I was very happy.</font>

1594
01:03:20,488 --> 01:03:23,128
<font size="36">She's someone I had a little crush on since yesterday,</font>

1595
01:03:23,688 --> 01:03:26,948
<font size="36">like yesterday ended without doing anything, so</font>

1596
01:03:27,398 --> 01:03:30,768
<font size="36">I thought I wanted to get to know her a bit more, so I sent the message.</font>

1597
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:33,608
<font size="36">That's right. What a shame. Couldn't talk.</font>

1598
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,600
<font size="36">Right. There's a possibility here.</font>

1599
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,300
<font size="36">Now, the partner-swapping date will be Tak-soo and Soo-wan.</font>

1600
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:40,960
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1601
01:03:43,794 --> 01:03:44,994
<font size="36">Oh, oh, I'm so curious about this part.</font>

1602
01:03:45,374 --> 01:03:46,134
<font size="36">Already ordered king crab.</font>

1603
01:03:48,539 --> 01:03:51,818
<font size="36">As time passed, I thought, 'Will no one else come?'</font>

1604
01:03:51,918 --> 01:03:54,053
<font size="36">Ah, anyway, be confident.</font>

1605
01:03:54,153 --> 01:03:56,099
<font size="36">After reassuring myself, then</font>

1606
01:03:56,609 --> 01:03:58,129
<font size="36">all four of them came to me.</font>

1607
01:03:58,609 --> 01:03:58,789
<font size="36">Ah!</font>

1608
01:03:59,779 --> 01:04:01,369
<font size="36">I also imagined a scene of collective eating, and then</font>

1609
01:04:01,909 --> 01:04:05,279
<font size="36">the more I watched, the sadder I felt in real time.</font>

1610
01:04:05,649 --> 01:04:06,389
<font size="36">Ah, what to do.</font>

1611
01:04:14,849 --> 01:04:15,489
<font size="36">Oh, hello.</font>

1612
01:04:15,789 --> 01:04:15,989
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

1613
01:04:16,329 --> 01:04:17,129
<font size="36">She's here. Who came?</font>

1614
01:04:17,249 --> 01:04:18,099
<font size="36">She's here. She's here. She's here. She's here.</font>

1615
01:04:18,439 --> 01:04:19,119
<font size="36">No. What is it?</font>

1616
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:19,989
<font size="36">Who is it?</font>

1617
01:04:20,629 --> 01:04:21,289
<font size="36">Ah, what to do.</font>

1618
01:04:23,379 --> 01:04:24,019
<font size="36">Oh, hello.</font>

1619
01:04:25,849 --> 01:04:26,409
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1620
01:04:27,259 --> 01:04:27,579
<font size="36">Oh...</font>

1621
01:04:28,629 --> 01:04:29,119
<font size="36">Oh, oh?</font>

1622
01:04:30,669 --> 01:04:31,259
<font size="36">She must be very surprised.</font>

1623
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:32,049
<font size="36">Oh, yes.</font>

1624
01:04:32,429 --> 01:04:32,739
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1625
01:04:33,759 --> 01:04:34,779
<font size="36">Oh! It's Shin-hyang.</font>

1626
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:35,599
<font size="36">Shin-hyang is here.</font>

1627
01:04:35,899 --> 01:04:36,129
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1628
01:04:36,659 --> 01:04:38,329
<font size="36">Ah, Shin-hyang came to Jun-ho.</font>

1629
01:04:38,659 --> 01:04:39,309
<font size="36">Ah, this is getting interesting.</font>

1630
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:39,909
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1631
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:42,559
<font size="36">Wait, didn't Jun-ho say Shin-hyang made him tired?!</font>

1632
01:04:44,549 --> 01:04:44,739
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1633
01:04:45,479 --> 01:04:47,129
<font size="36">Personally, Shin-hyang</font>

1634
01:04:47,739 --> 01:04:50,129
<font size="36">had a bit of a feeling of being drained of energy.</font>

1635
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:51,249
<font size="36">Drained of energy.</font>

1636
01:04:52,129 --> 01:04:53,339
<font size="36">But why would she be drained of energy?</font>

1637
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,039
<font size="36">No, Shin-hyang doesn't do anything to drain energy.</font>

1638
01:04:57,349 --> 01:04:58,309
<font size="36">What is there to be drained of energy?</font>

1639
01:04:58,599 --> 01:04:59,269
<font size="36">No, sir, I'll continue...</font>

1640
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:00,269
<font size="36">No, no, no, no.</font>

1641
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:01,249
<font size="36">No, our son is a bit...</font>

1642
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:03,249
<font size="36">Ah. To think we'd meet again like this...</font>

1643
01:05:03,549 --> 01:05:04,279
<font size="36">It was surprising, now.</font>

1644
01:05:04,729 --> 01:05:05,129
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1645
01:05:08,269 --> 01:05:10,069
<font size="36">No, just now he said to eat the most delicious thing.</font>

1646
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:10,749
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1647
01:05:11,249 --> 01:05:12,129
<font size="36">He told us that.</font>

1648
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:14,249
<font size="36">I get to eat this again.</font>

1649
01:05:14,539 --> 01:05:15,939
<font size="36">Wow, so surprised.</font>

1650
01:05:16,129 --> 01:05:16,589
<font size="36">So surprised.</font>

1651
01:05:19,419 --> 01:05:21,129
<font size="36">When I first realized, it was like, 'Oh?'</font>

1652
01:05:22,249 --> 01:05:23,249
<font size="36">How could... did I see wrong?</font>

1653
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:23,979
<font size="36">Like,</font>

1654
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:26,109
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1655
01:05:26,759 --> 01:05:27,079
<font size="36">Oh...</font>

1656
01:05:27,729 --> 01:05:28,309
<font size="36">She must be very surprised.</font>

1657
01:05:28,609 --> 01:05:30,339
<font size="36">At that moment, my brain seemed to stop working for a moment.</font>

1658
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:35,789
<font size="36">Anyway, it was very grateful that she came.</font>

1659
01:05:36,759 --> 01:05:38,549
<font size="36">Ah, anyway, very grateful.</font>

1660
01:05:39,279 --> 01:05:40,079
<font size="36">Oh, that's right, that's right.</font>

1661
01:05:42,349 --> 01:05:42,599
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1662
01:05:44,929 --> 01:05:49,109
<font size="36">Like, I thought he was an artist,</font>

1663
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:53,129
<font size="36">so I thought there would definitely be commonalities or similar things,</font>

1664
01:05:53,479 --> 01:05:56,049
<font size="36">that's also why I chose Jun-ho.</font>

1665
01:05:57,609 --> 01:05:58,219
<font size="36">Oh...</font>

1666
01:06:00,549 --> 01:06:01,059
<font size="36">Is there alcohol?</font>

1667
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:02,119
<font size="36">Wow... Yes, I have some.</font>

1668
01:06:02,442 --> 01:06:03,712
<font size="36">She seems a bit awkward.</font>

1669
01:06:04,822 --> 01:06:05,932
<font size="36">Ah, this combination works too.</font>

1670
01:06:10,692 --> 01:06:13,042
<font size="36">Now, the remaining two are Seong-jun and Sun-jun.</font>

1671
01:06:14,892 --> 01:06:17,302
<font size="36">The ones left now are Sa-yoon and Seok-joo.</font>

1672
01:06:17,342 --> 01:06:17,842
<font size="36">Seok-joo.</font>

1673
01:06:18,422 --> 01:06:18,912
<font size="36">Look at Seok-joo.</font>

1674
01:06:24,632 --> 01:06:25,982
<font size="36">Oh, Sa-yoon!</font>

1675
01:06:27,912 --> 01:06:30,032
<font size="36">Ah, where will this go?</font>

1676
01:06:38,282 --> 01:06:39,082
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1677
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,102
<font size="36">In 1 minute. In 1 minute.</font>

1678
01:06:40,102 --> 01:06:40,302
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1679
01:06:44,012 --> 01:06:48,022
<font size="36">It seems they told me to send my number 1 priority right now, so</font>

1680
01:06:48,852 --> 01:06:50,302
<font size="36">I sent it immediately.</font>

1681
01:06:51,062 --> 01:06:52,072
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1682
01:07:04,402 --> 01:07:04,892
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1683
01:07:05,092 --> 01:07:07,402
<font size="36">Sa-yoon, stay there. Someone's coming.</font>

1684
01:07:18,962 --> 01:07:21,812
<font size="36">Wow. Sa-yoon, stay there. Someone's coming.</font>

1685
01:07:32,962 --> 01:07:33,402
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1686
01:07:33,672 --> 01:07:35,162
<font size="36">Ah. Lee Seong-jun.</font>

1687
01:07:40,782 --> 01:07:41,172
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1688
01:07:41,512 --> 01:07:42,022
<font size="36">Why, why, why?</font>

1689
01:07:42,022 --> 01:07:42,502
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1690
01:07:44,052 --> 01:07:44,402
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1691
01:07:47,652 --> 01:07:48,132
<font size="36">Wait...</font>

1692
01:07:52,862 --> 01:07:53,402
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1693
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:53,772
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1694
01:07:53,932 --> 01:07:54,862
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1695
01:07:55,512 --> 01:07:55,922
<font size="36">Hello?</font>

1696
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:56,342
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1697
01:07:56,542 --> 01:07:56,782
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1698
01:07:56,952 --> 01:07:57,142
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1699
01:07:57,502 --> 01:07:57,902
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1700
01:08:00,002 --> 01:08:00,402
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1701
01:08:00,592 --> 01:08:00,962
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1702
01:08:01,432 --> 01:08:02,232
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1703
01:08:04,822 --> 01:08:05,302
<font size="36">Come in.</font>

1704
01:08:05,602 --> 01:08:06,882
<font size="36">What should I do?</font>

1705
01:08:07,002 --> 01:08:07,402
<font size="36">It's Seok-joo.</font>

1706
01:08:07,612 --> 01:08:09,102
<font size="36">Oh! Oh!</font>

1707
01:08:10,012 --> 01:08:10,242
<font size="36">Seok-joo.</font>

1708
01:08:10,402 --> 01:08:11,402
<font size="36">Wow, what a surprise.</font>

1709
01:08:12,072 --> 01:08:13,312
<font size="36">Hey, I really didn't know.</font>

1710
01:08:13,312 --> 01:08:14,102
<font size="36">Oh, hey.</font>

1711
01:08:14,582 --> 01:08:16,202
<font size="36">That's really a daily drama.</font>

1712
01:08:20,602 --> 01:08:21,202
<font size="36">This... right?</font>

1713
01:08:21,832 --> 01:08:22,302
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1714
01:08:22,902 --> 01:08:23,602
<font size="36">Probably not.</font>

1715
01:08:24,402 --> 01:08:25,102
<font size="36">Ah, but to some extent,</font>

1716
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:28,102
<font size="36">If it overlaps, are there two people? I guessed that, but</font>

1717
01:08:29,102 --> 01:08:32,202
<font size="36">I thought no way, but it turned out to be true. So</font>

1718
01:08:33,702 --> 01:08:36,202
<font size="36">I was very, very surprised. Really surprised.</font>

1719
01:08:38,202 --> 01:08:38,602
<font size="36">This...</font>

1720
01:08:39,202 --> 01:08:41,102
<font size="36">It doesn't seem like a very good image.</font>

1721
01:08:44,502 --> 01:08:45,802
<font size="36">Seong-jun suddenly burst out laughing.</font>

1722
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:47,702
<font size="36">So when I looked, I saw Sa-yoon</font>

1723
01:08:48,602 --> 01:08:51,802
<font size="36">was also walking awkwardly, exactly the same way.</font>

1724
01:08:52,702 --> 01:08:54,502
<font size="36">Seok-joo sent the tape to Seong-jun, right?</font>

1725
01:08:54,802 --> 01:08:55,102
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1726
01:08:55,402 --> 01:08:57,602
<font size="36">No, but those two are roommates.</font>

1727
01:08:57,902 --> 01:08:58,302
<font size="36">Ah, that's right.</font>

1728
01:08:58,402 --> 01:08:59,402
<font size="36">They share a room.</font>

1729
01:08:59,502 --> 01:08:59,702
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1730
01:09:01,202 --> 01:09:07,600
<font size="36">Since Sa-yoon and I are roommates, even though we try not to show it, there's an unavoidable awkwardness.</font>

1731
01:09:07,948 --> 01:09:08,408
<font size="36">Even so...</font>

1732
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,778
<font size="36">I didn't think I had to step back.</font>

1733
01:09:12,438 --> 01:09:12,738
<font size="36">Oh my!</font>

1734
01:09:13,978 --> 01:09:15,678
<font size="36">I don't know what to do.</font>

1735
01:09:19,118 --> 01:09:20,668
<font size="36">Hey, Seong-jun is clearly happy. Clearly happy.</font>

1736
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:21,448
<font size="36">Good things...</font>

1737
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:22,308
<font size="36">Oh, Dad likes it.</font>

1738
01:09:22,308 --> 01:09:22,908
<font size="36">Likes it. Dad likes it.</font>

1739
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:23,298
<font size="36">Oh...</font>

1740
01:09:23,298 --> 01:09:24,448
<font size="36">Ah...</font>

1741
01:09:30,618 --> 01:09:31,128
<font size="36">Wait a minute.</font>

1742
01:09:31,748 --> 01:09:33,588
<font size="36">So is someone alone now?</font>

1743
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:34,958
<font size="36">No, that's right.</font>

1744
01:09:34,958 --> 01:09:35,618
<font size="36">Really.</font>

1745
01:09:39,948 --> 01:09:41,648
<font size="36">Oh, Sun-jun.</font>

1746
01:09:42,108 --> 01:09:42,948
<font size="36">Oh, Sun-jun.</font>

1747
01:09:43,138 --> 01:09:44,428
<font size="36">The pairing is over.</font>

1748
01:09:47,648 --> 01:09:50,598
<font size="36">At first, I wondered if anyone would come?</font>

1749
01:09:50,598 --> 01:09:53,378
<font size="36">but gradually...</font>

1750
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:55,688
<font size="36">Now, just as I feared...</font>

1751
01:09:57,148 --> 01:09:57,508
<font size="36">Ah...</font>

1752
01:09:58,908 --> 01:10:00,708
<font size="36">Ah... so it happened...</font>

1753
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:02,608
<font size="36">I think so.</font>

1754
01:10:02,608 --> 01:10:03,048
<font size="36">Heartbreaking.</font>

1755
01:10:03,048 --> 01:10:03,418
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1756
01:10:03,738 --> 01:10:04,608
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1757
01:10:05,478 --> 01:10:07,578
<font size="36">Anyway, at some point,</font>

1758
01:10:08,648 --> 01:10:09,848
<font size="36">good things will come.</font>

1759
01:10:09,848 --> 01:10:10,388
<font size="36">It's just that,</font>

1760
01:10:11,418 --> 01:10:13,688
<font size="36">I just vaguely thought that.</font>

1761
01:10:17,408 --> 01:10:18,028
<font size="36">Just eat alone.</font>

1762
01:10:18,028 --> 01:10:18,458
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1763
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:20,568
<font size="36">He said to order delicious food and eat.</font>

1764
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:21,748
<font size="36">Order a glass of wine, that wine.</font>

1765
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:22,718
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1766
01:10:22,988 --> 01:10:24,378
<font size="36">What's with talking about tea here?</font>

1767
01:10:25,538 --> 01:10:27,638
<font size="36">It's boiling hot outside, and my heart is also on fire.</font>

1768
01:10:31,408 --> 01:10:31,748
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1769
01:10:31,948 --> 01:10:32,798
<font size="36">It's not over. It's not over.</font>

1770
01:10:33,308 --> 01:10:33,808
<font size="36">Cheer up, cheer up.</font>

1771
01:10:33,808 --> 01:10:34,078
<font size="36">Our son, cheer up.</font>

1772
01:10:34,248 --> 01:10:34,978
<font size="36">It's only the second day.</font>

1773
01:10:35,248 --> 01:10:35,748
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1774
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:38,678
<font size="36">The menu over there has changed, what to do?</font>

1775
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:39,878
<font size="36">The pork shoulder is out.</font>

1776
01:10:40,088 --> 01:10:40,518
<font size="36">Do you like it?</font>

1777
01:10:40,518 --> 01:10:41,648
<font size="36">The pork shoulder is out.</font>

1778
01:10:43,728 --> 01:10:45,008
<font size="36">You were very flustered, weren't you?</font>

1779
01:10:45,488 --> 01:10:45,688
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1780
01:10:46,018 --> 01:10:46,498
<font size="36">You were flustered, weren't you?</font>

1781
01:10:46,698 --> 01:10:47,538
<font size="36">Oh, I was very flustered...</font>

1782
01:10:48,748 --> 01:10:50,168
<font size="36">Ah, because I was so flustered...</font>

1783
01:10:50,908 --> 01:10:52,308
<font size="36">Actually, talking like this is</font>

1784
01:10:52,688 --> 01:10:53,688
<font size="36">the first time... Yes.</font>

1785
01:10:54,408 --> 01:10:54,768
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1786
01:10:58,208 --> 01:10:59,908
<font size="36">Did you think I would come?</font>

1787
01:11:01,078 --> 01:11:01,678
<font size="36">I don't know.</font>

1788
01:11:03,348 --> 01:11:04,448
<font size="36">Because I couldn't predict it.</font>

1789
01:11:08,378 --> 01:11:10,778
<font size="36">Everyone watched yesterday, what were your first impressions?</font>

1790
01:11:12,118 --> 01:11:12,718
<font size="36">He talks well.</font>

1791
01:11:13,138 --> 01:11:13,908
<font size="36">He said he talks well.</font>

1792
01:11:14,648 --> 01:11:15,978
<font size="36">Hmm, he talks, asks a lot.</font>

1793
01:11:15,978 --> 01:11:16,968
<font size="36">He knows how to talk.</font>

1794
01:11:17,288 --> 01:11:20,388
<font size="36">No, and Soo-wan's expression is a bit different from when she went fishing on the boat.</font>

1795
01:11:20,388 --> 01:11:21,188
<font size="36">Very different.</font>

1796
01:11:21,398 --> 01:11:22,428
<font size="36">Completely different?</font>

1797
01:11:23,008 --> 01:11:24,408
<font size="36">From when the householder locked the door.</font>

1798
01:11:27,008 --> 01:11:29,208
<font size="36">Everyone watched yesterday, what were your first impressions?</font>

1799
01:11:30,478 --> 01:11:31,008
<font size="36">The first day?</font>

1800
01:11:34,008 --> 01:11:35,008
<font size="36">First of all, the most impressive...</font>

1801
01:11:35,008 --> 01:11:35,378
<font size="36">Impressive</font>

1802
01:11:36,308 --> 01:11:37,708
<font size="36">It really was the most memorable first impression.</font>

1803
01:11:38,608 --> 01:11:39,078
<font size="36">Ah, me?</font>

1804
01:11:41,578 --> 01:11:41,948
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1805
01:11:46,908 --> 01:11:47,908
<font size="36">What was your first impression of me?</font>

1806
01:11:48,508 --> 01:11:48,808
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1807
01:11:48,808 --> 01:11:50,108
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1808
01:11:51,108 --> 01:11:52,308
<font size="36">I was sitting in the middle.</font>

1809
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:54,608
<font size="36">Did I seem very outgoing?</font>

1810
01:11:54,908 --> 01:11:55,508
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

1811
01:11:55,508 --> 01:11:55,808
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1812
01:11:58,408 --> 01:11:59,308
<font size="36">It must be because I talk a lot.</font>

1813
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:00,708
<font size="36">Then it seems that's true.</font>

1814
01:12:06,598 --> 01:12:08,998
<font size="36">Is there anyone you had a slight crush on?</font>

1815
01:12:10,768 --> 01:12:11,268
<font size="36">Me?</font>

1816
01:12:11,508 --> 01:12:11,778
<font size="36">Is there?</font>

1817
01:12:12,108 --> 01:12:12,508
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1818
01:12:12,998 --> 01:12:13,368
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1819
01:12:13,628 --> 01:12:14,618
<font size="36">He's probing.</font>

1820
01:12:15,138 --> 01:12:15,968
<font size="36">Ah, probing, probing.</font>

1821
01:12:16,138 --> 01:12:16,538
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1822
01:12:17,338 --> 01:12:19,425
<font size="36">Dad also seems surprised.</font>

1823
01:12:20,358 --> 01:12:22,818
<font size="36">Is there anyone you had a slight crush on?</font>

1824
01:12:24,128 --> 01:12:24,578
<font size="36">Me?</font>

1825
01:12:24,878 --> 01:12:25,128
<font size="36">Is there?</font>

1826
01:12:25,798 --> 01:12:26,238
<font size="36">Cassette tape...</font>

1827
01:12:26,438 --> 01:12:27,438
<font size="36">What did you do with the cassette tape?</font>

1828
01:12:27,918 --> 01:12:28,358
<font size="36">How was it?</font>

1829
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:29,238
<font size="36">I already know.</font>

1830
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:30,058
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1831
01:12:30,318 --> 01:12:30,888
<font size="36">So curious.</font>

1832
01:12:33,138 --> 01:12:33,748
<font size="36">It's a secret.</font>

1833
01:12:34,838 --> 01:12:35,228
<font size="36">Is that so?</font>

1834
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:40,008
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1835
01:12:40,708 --> 01:12:41,848
<font size="36">I see.</font>

1836
01:12:54,188 --> 01:12:54,958
<font size="36">Let's grill the pork shoulder right away.</font>

1837
01:12:57,228 --> 01:12:58,138
<font size="36">That cassette tape...</font>

1838
01:12:58,738 --> 01:12:59,998
<font size="36">Who do you think you received it from?</font>

1839
01:13:01,448 --> 01:13:04,798
<font size="36">No, I mean, I talked a lot with Shin-hyang when we went shopping together so</font>

1840
01:13:05,408 --> 01:13:06,598
<font size="36">I tried to guess once.</font>

1841
01:13:07,298 --> 01:13:08,318
<font size="36">One person seemed to be...</font>

1842
01:13:16,718 --> 01:13:18,168
<font size="36">It seems like Soo-wan, but still.</font>

1843
01:13:18,528 --> 01:13:18,798
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1844
01:13:19,238 --> 01:13:19,558
<font size="36">Oh?</font>

1845
01:13:19,718 --> 01:13:20,338
<font size="36">U!</font>

1846
01:13:24,808 --> 01:13:25,238
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1847
01:13:27,408 --> 01:13:27,838
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1848
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:29,078
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1849
01:13:29,178 --> 01:13:29,818
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1850
01:13:30,138 --> 01:13:30,738
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1851
01:13:31,138 --> 01:13:32,838
<font size="36">That's right, you have to show it.</font>

1852
01:13:33,498 --> 01:13:34,778
<font size="36">If you don't show it, who would know?</font>

1853
01:13:35,138 --> 01:13:35,838
<font size="36">Oh, it's so uncomfortable.</font>

1854
01:13:36,138 --> 01:13:36,638
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1855
01:13:37,738 --> 01:13:38,838
<font size="36">It's like my son-in-law was stolen from me.</font>

1856
01:13:39,338 --> 01:13:40,538
<font size="36">You should try meeting here too.</font>

1857
01:13:40,738 --> 01:13:41,238
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1858
01:13:41,238 --> 01:13:41,438
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1859
01:13:41,638 --> 01:13:42,038
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

1860
01:13:42,138 --> 01:13:42,438
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1861
01:13:43,438 --> 01:13:44,538
<font size="36">Hey, this</font>

1862
01:13:45,938 --> 01:13:46,438
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1863
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:56,638
<font size="36">It seems I was very brave to show it.</font>

1864
01:13:58,238 --> 01:14:00,838
<font size="36">Anyway, if I don't show affection to someone I have a crush on,</font>

1865
01:14:01,138 --> 01:14:04,138
<font size="36">I thought I'd regret it a bit if I never showed my feelings, so</font>

1866
01:14:04,738 --> 01:14:06,338
<font size="36">I showed it.</font>

1867
01:14:09,538 --> 01:14:10,038
<font size="36">Well done.</font>

1868
01:14:10,338 --> 01:14:10,738
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1869
01:14:11,038 --> 01:14:11,438
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1870
01:14:12,538 --> 01:14:13,038
<font size="36">Right.</font>

1871
01:14:13,238 --> 01:14:13,938
<font size="36">Oh. Right, right.</font>

1872
01:14:14,038 --> 01:14:14,438
<font size="36">You have to do that.</font>

1873
01:14:14,638 --> 01:14:15,138
<font size="36">That's right, that's right.</font>

1874
01:14:15,438 --> 01:14:16,138
<font size="36">Yes, show it.</font>

1875
01:14:16,338 --> 01:14:17,238
<font size="36">Show it to Dad too.</font>

1876
01:14:17,238 --> 01:14:17,938
<font size="36">Show it to Dad too.</font>

1877
01:14:21,238 --> 01:14:21,838
<font size="36">Shall we drink alcohol?</font>

1878
01:14:22,538 --> 01:14:23,038
<font size="36">Alcohol.</font>

1879
01:14:23,238 --> 01:14:24,038
<font size="36">Do you want to drink alcohol?</font>

1880
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:24,538
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1881
01:14:24,538 --> 01:14:24,738
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1882
01:14:24,738 --> 01:14:25,038
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1883
01:14:25,038 --> 01:14:25,238
<font size="36">Ah,</font>

1884
01:14:25,238 --> 01:14:25,538
<font size="36">Somaek?</font>

1885
01:14:25,738 --> 01:14:26,038
<font size="36">Somaek?</font>

1886
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:26,738
<font size="36">Can you drink somaek?</font>

1887
01:14:26,738 --> 01:14:27,038
<font size="36">Somaek?</font>

1888
01:14:27,038 --> 01:14:27,238
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1889
01:14:27,238 --> 01:14:27,438
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1890
01:14:27,438 --> 01:14:27,638
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1891
01:14:30,338 --> 01:14:31,038
<font size="36">After talking for a bit,</font>

1892
01:14:31,838 --> 01:14:33,738
<font size="36">it was completely opposite to what I had thought.</font>

1893
01:14:34,538 --> 01:14:36,538
<font size="36">I thought that was a good person.</font>

1894
01:14:37,538 --> 01:14:38,038
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1895
01:14:38,838 --> 01:14:39,038
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1896
01:14:39,238 --> 01:14:39,638
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1897
01:14:40,538 --> 01:14:41,038
<font size="36">How did it change like this?</font>

1898
01:14:41,138 --> 01:14:41,838
<font size="36">That's right, that's right. You have to meet many people.</font>

1899
01:14:42,638 --> 01:14:43,038
<font size="36">Right.</font>

1900
01:14:43,038 --> 01:14:43,338
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1901
01:14:43,338 --> 01:14:43,638
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1902
01:14:45,538 --> 01:14:45,838
<font size="36">Oh my.</font>

1903
01:14:46,038 --> 01:14:46,838
<font size="36">Oh, the atmosphere is completely good.</font>

1904
01:14:47,238 --> 01:14:48,038
<font size="36">Hey, this atmosphere is nice.</font>

1905
01:14:48,038 --> 01:14:48,638
<font size="36">Hey, this atmosphere is nice.</font>

1906
01:14:48,638 --> 01:14:49,538
<font size="36">The atmosphere is much better than the previous date.</font>

1907
01:14:49,538 --> 01:14:50,038
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1908
01:14:50,038 --> 01:14:51,538
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1909
01:14:51,538 --> 01:14:52,038
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1910
01:14:52,038 --> 01:14:52,238
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1911
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:52,438
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1912
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:53,838
<font size="36">It's definitely different when you talk to them.</font>

1913
01:14:54,738 --> 01:14:55,038
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1914
01:14:55,738 --> 01:14:56,038
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1915
01:14:56,038 --> 01:14:56,638
<font size="36">Talking.</font>

1916
01:14:57,238 --> 01:14:57,838
<font size="36">Or maybe just speak casually?</font>

1917
01:14:58,438 --> 01:14:58,838
<font size="36">Is that so?</font>

1918
01:14:59,038 --> 01:14:59,238
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1919
01:14:59,738 --> 01:15:00,038
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1920
01:15:01,738 --> 01:15:02,038
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1921
01:15:10,396 --> 01:15:11,946
<font size="36">Now, we will reveal our ages.</font>

1922
01:15:12,946 --> 01:15:13,556
<font size="36">Twenty</font>

1923
01:15:13,916 --> 01:15:14,186
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1924
01:15:14,546 --> 01:15:15,056
<font size="36">Too young.</font>

1925
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:16,076
<font size="36">A little shocked.</font>

1926
01:15:16,706 --> 01:15:17,466
<font size="36">It seems good.</font>

1927
01:15:17,896 --> 01:15:18,126
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

1928
01:15:18,986 --> 01:15:20,336
<font size="36">It seems like a mix of joy and sadness.</font>

1929
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:22,466
<font size="36">You definitely have to talk to many people like this to</font>

1930
01:15:22,616 --> 01:15:23,466
<font size="36">be able to gain certainty.</font>

1931
01:15:24,756 --> 01:15:26,056
<font size="36">First impressions are really just</font>

1932
01:15:26,056 --> 01:15:26,926
<font size="36">first impressions.</font>

1933
01:15:28,916 --> 01:15:31,366
<font size="36">Because there are only three people I have feelings for,</font>

1934
01:15:32,576 --> 01:15:32,886
<font size="36">Ah,</font>

1935
01:15:32,886 --> 01:15:34,386
<font size="36">one-sided love like this is really difficult.</font>

1936
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:36,396
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1937
01:15:36,826 --> 01:15:37,326
<font size="36">Ah, really.</font>

1938
01:15:37,676 --> 01:15:38,606
<font size="36">This isn't that kind of hurt, really.</font>
