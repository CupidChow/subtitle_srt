<font size="36">Woah!</font>

15
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:50,005
<font size="36">Oh, my hands keep sweating.</font>

16
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:51,905
<font size="36">Oh, but, I'm really nervous. Woah.</font>

00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:54,335
<font size="36">Ah!</font>

18
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:57,045
<font size="36">Ah, I can't watch.</font>

00:00:58,344 --> 00:00:59,975
<font size="36">Oh, my lips are trembling right now.</font>

21
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:05,745
<font size="36">What to do?</font>

22
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:15,912
<font size="36">Hey, wait. What kind of combination is this?</font>

23
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:16,813
<font size="36">Oh, really?</font>

24
00:01:16,813 --> 00:01:17,483
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

25
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,052
<font size="36">Hey. Hey.</font>

26
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:22,052
<font size="36">Oh my god. Yes.</font>

27
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:23,802
<font size="36">You don't seem to be in a very good mood, do you?</font>

28
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:24,623
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

29
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:30,602
<font size="36">Hey, I wonder if a show like this can be made? Yes, I'm very surprised.</font>

30
00:01:30,602 --> 00:01:31,393
<font size="36">Really?</font>

31
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:40,992
<font size="36">Parents will appear as guests and are expected to watch their children freely 'flirt' during their time together.</font>

32
00:01:41,203 --> 00:01:42,513
<font size="36">Wait! Freely 'flirt', really?</font>

33
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:43,832
<font size="36">Yes, they freely 'flirt'.</font>

34
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:44,283
<font size="36">Is that so?</font>

35
00:01:44,283 --> 00:01:44,933
<font size="36">Yes, this</font>

36
00:01:45,763 --> 00:01:51,018
<font size="36">As far as I know, during the children's
time together, the production team does not interfere at all.</font>

37
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:57,763
<font size="36">Of course there's no script, and you'll get to see
100% real-life 'flirting' situations of the children.</font>

38
00:01:57,763 --> 00:01:58,242
<font size="36">This must be fun.</font>

39
00:01:58,242 --> 00:01:58,472
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

40
00:01:58,472 --> 00:02:00,233
<font size="36">I'm really looking forward to it.</font>

41
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:02,263
<font size="36">But why does the other side seem more relaxed?</font>

42
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:03,533
<font size="36">That side looks relaxed.</font>

43
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:06,403
<font size="36">They just keep falling back while we keep moving forward.</font>

44
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:07,072
<font size="36">What's next?</font>

45
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:09,853
<font size="36">Different stances. The thoughts are already different.</font>

46
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:10,353
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

47
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:14,383
<font size="36">Our Mr. Lee Jong-hyuk is truly a father like a friend.</font>

48
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:14,832
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

49
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,332
<font size="36">Do you live so comfortably with Tak-soo?</font>

50
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:18,723
<font size="36">Ah, of course. We live comfortably.</font>

51
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:20,203
<font size="36">Do you also drink alcohol together like that?</font>

52
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:22,832
<font size="36">Yes, I'm in our family group chat.</font>

53
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:23,173
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

54
00:02:23,173 --> 00:02:29,133
<font size="36">Tak-soo texted that he's sleeping at a friend's house today, after performance practice. Like that.</font>

55
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,893
<font size="36">Then I'll say don't lie.</font>

56
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:32,413
<font size="36">Don't lie.</font>

57
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:33,983
<font size="36">Don't lie.</font>

58
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:36,612
<font size="36">It's already been said.</font>

59
00:02:36,612 --> 00:02:37,043
<font size="36">Don't lie.</font>

60
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:37,372
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

61
00:02:37,612 --> 00:02:41,693
<font size="36">Oh, really. But Jun-soo said just pretend not to know.</font>

62
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:42,013
<font size="36">Just said that</font>

63
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:45,043
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

64
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:47,842
<font size="36">Hey. And the kid didn't answer. Tak-soo.</font>

65
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,953
<font size="36">He lied. He lied.</font>

66
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:52,842
<font size="36">Ah, this isn't a father like a friend, but a friend all the time?</font>

67
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:53,812
<font size="36">Ah, this isn't a father like a friend, but a friend all the time?</font>

68
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:58,242
<font size="36">That's right. Ah, this, even though I've talked to the fathers, but</font>

69
00:02:58,242 --> 00:03:02,263
<font size="36">If things go well, they'll become in-laws</font>

70
00:03:02,263 --> 00:03:03,223
<font size="36">If the atmosphere isn't good</font>

71
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,933
<font size="36">If the atmosphere isn't good, it'll become Romeo and Juliet.</font>

72
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:08,933
<font size="36">The children get along very well, but the parents might not.</font>

73
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,533
<font size="36">Come on, now let's mentally prepare and watch.</font>

74
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,133
<font size="36">Now we're going to watch.</font>

75
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,633
<font size="36">Yes, now let's mentally prepare.</font>

76
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:18,433
<font size="36">What to do? The expression is already not good.</font>

77
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:52,033
<font size="36">Sokcho.</font>

78
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,733
<font size="36">Sokcho. Ah, already went to Sokcho.</font>

79
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:03,333
<font size="36">Honestly... the expectation that I can meet my ideal type?</font>

80
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,133
<font size="36">Things I don't normally feel</font>

81
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,733
<font size="36">I want to feel the most flutter.</font>

82
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,033
<font size="36">Because I've never expressed or revealed my feelings</font>

83
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:14,233
<font size="36">Here, I will gather all my courage to express myself.</font>

84
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:22,233
<font size="36">Now that I'm grown up, I want to feel an emotion that makes my heart pound so much that I wonder 'Is it okay if I like someone this much?'</font>

85
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:33,833
<font size="36">Wow, so nervous.</font>

86
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:35,533
<font size="36">This must be fun, fun.</font>

87
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,233
<font size="36">Is something wrong with Jong-hyuk in the back? His back profile?</font>

88
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:56,133
<font size="36">(Probably...)</font>

89
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,033
<font size="36">Woah, so handsome.</font>

90
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:12,333
<font size="36">Handsome.</font>

91
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:14,333
<font size="36">Look, Tak-soo, Tak-soo. Is that Tak-soo?</font>

92
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:15,933
<font size="36">Oh, is this Tak-soo?</font>

93
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,933
<font size="36">Hey, so cool. Ah, he's really grown up. Really grown up.</font>

94
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:22,933
<font size="36">Tak-soo has his childhood facial features~</font>

95
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,933
<font size="36">Tak-soo has his childhood facial features. I told him not to get that haircut...</font>

96
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:29,933
<font size="36">Why, it's cool.</font>

97
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,333
<font size="36">Tak-soo has been handsome since he was little.</font>

98
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:40,933
<font size="36">Ah, so warm.</font>

99
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,833
<font size="36">Oh, so cool.</font>

100
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:53,933
<font size="36">Yes, hello. I am Lee Tak-soo, a 23-year-old student.</font>

101
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:55,733
<font size="36">So handsome.</font>

102
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:56,533
<font size="36">Handsome.</font>

103
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,633
<font size="36">He's really grown up very well.</font>

104
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:06,233
<font size="36">I'm currently a 2nd-year student in the Theater and Film Department at Dongguk University.</font>

105
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:12,454
<font size="36">Oh, I think my personality is that of an emotional person.</font>

106
00:06:12,844 --> 00:06:17,154
<font size="36">Oh. Every time the season changes, I have thousands of different thoughts.</font>

107
00:06:19,164 --> 00:06:23,294
<font size="36">So, the good thing is that when I'm in a bad mood, just listening to a song makes my mood even better.</font>

108
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:23,984
<font size="36">Truly emotional.</font>

109
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:24,964
<font size="36">Oh, really the opposite of your father.</font>

110
00:06:25,054 --> 00:06:26,094
<font size="36">Doesn't suit me. Doesn't suit.</font>

111
00:06:26,284 --> 00:06:26,784
<font size="36">Doesn't suit?</font>

112
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:38,044
<font size="36">I also prefer listening to old music over new music these days, so I want to meet someone who can understand and empathize with that.</font>

113
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:40,044
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

114
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:51,504
<font size="36">After high school, there were about three times.</font>

115
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:53,484
<font size="36">Doesn't Dad know? There were three times.</font>

116
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:53,714
<font size="36">Does he know?</font>

117
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:55,454
<font size="36">I don't care if I do or not.</font>

118
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:55,754
<font size="36">Don't care?</font>

119
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:57,554
<font size="36">Only Mom knows. Oh.</font>

120
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,154
<font size="36">Three times. Three times.</font>

121
00:06:59,624 --> 00:06:59,994
<font size="36">That many?</font>

122
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:00,694
<font size="36">Doesn't Dad know?</font>

123
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:02,694
<font size="36">Quite a lot, right?</font>

124
00:07:03,194 --> 00:07:06,294
<font size="36">No, but who would leave such a handsome guy alone? That's right, that's right.</font>

125
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:12,844
<font size="36">I was just discharged from the military in the winter, so it's been about half a year.</font>

126
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:16,684
<font size="36">In the military, it was all guys, so nothing happened.</font>

127
00:07:16,684 --> 00:07:17,484
<font size="36">Why now</font>

128
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:25,284
<font size="36">At school, throughout the first semester, I also participated in group work, so it seems I lived a busy life.</font>

129
00:07:26,214 --> 00:07:32,784
<font size="36">So, I think it would be good to meet someone who can revive those love cells.</font>

130
00:07:34,294 --> 00:07:34,794
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

131
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:36,804
<font size="36">Oh, this is a scene from a drama.</font>

132
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:37,704
<font size="36">His facial features are softer than his father's.</font>

133
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:38,204
<font size="36">It's a drama.</font>

134
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:38,904
<font size="36">It's a drama.</font>

135
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:39,504
<font size="36">His facial features are softer.</font>

136
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:39,904
<font size="36">Oh, it's a drama.</font>

137
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:41,304
<font size="36">The reaction isn't bad.</font>

138
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:42,804
<font size="36">Is it okay for now?</font>

139
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:43,204
<font size="36">Oh, so handsome.</font>

140
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:44,004
<font size="36">Ah, so handsome.</font>

141
00:07:44,004 --> 00:07:44,904
<font size="36">His facial features are indeed softer.</font>

142
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:45,304
<font size="36">Ah, so cool.</font>

143
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:46,004
<font size="36">So cool.</font>

144
00:07:47,204 --> 00:07:48,304
<font size="36">Probably better than his father.</font>

145
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:48,704
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

146
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:49,004
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

147
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:49,404
<font size="36">Better than his father</font>

148
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:51,304
<font size="36">How did this kid come from Lee Jong-hyuk?</font>

149
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,204
<font size="36">Better than his father.</font>

150
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:53,504
<font size="36">That's for sure.</font>

151
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:54,704
<font size="36">Also emotional, that's good.</font>

152
00:07:56,904 --> 00:07:58,804
<font size="36">If he's a student returning to school, he must really want to date.</font>

153
00:07:59,304 --> 00:08:00,504
<font size="36">As a student returning to school, he must really want to date.</font>

154
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:15,804
<font size="36">This must be a dormitory.</font>

155
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:16,704
<font size="36">Oh, so beautiful.</font>

156
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,804
<font size="36">The dormitory is so beautiful.</font>

157
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:31,404
<font size="36">Sigh.</font>

158
00:08:39,204 --> 00:08:40,304
<font size="36">Oh, oh, a girl is coming.</font>

159
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:40,704
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

160
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:41,804
<font size="36">Oh, oh, a girl is coming.</font>

161
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:42,104
<font size="36">Who is it?</font>

162
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:42,404
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

163
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:42,704
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

164
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:43,004
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

165
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:44,504
<font size="36">Who is it?</font>

166
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:44,904
<font size="36">Someone must know.</font>

167
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:45,704
<font size="36">So curious.</font>

168
00:08:58,804 --> 00:08:59,404
<font size="36">Is it my daughter?</font>

169
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:07,193
<font size="36">What to do?</font>

170
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:08,373
<font size="36">Watching. She's coming.</font>

171
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:10,663
<font size="36">Woah, how would that feel? Woah.</font>

172
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:13,473
<font size="36">Ah, a bit... Ah, why are my eyes tearing up... so nervous.</font>

173
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:23,013
<font size="36">Oh, my heart feels like it's going to burst.</font>

174
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:24,843
<font size="36">Hey, this is fun.</font>

175
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:30,373
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

176
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:35,143
<font size="36">Whose daughter is it?</font>

177
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:36,143
<font size="36">Whose daughter is it?</font>

178
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:39,653
<font size="36">Hello. I'm Kim Sa-yoon, 20 years old.</font>

179
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:41,943
<font size="36">I am currently a university student.</font>

180
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:44,403
<font size="36">A daughter with the Kim surname, then...</font>

181
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:44,893
<font size="36">Who is it?</font>

182
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:45,393
<font size="36">Whose daughter is it? Whose daughter is it?</font>

183
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:46,793
<font size="36">It's... it's my daughter!</font>

184
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:50,543
<font size="36">So beautiful! So pretty~</font>

185
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,603
<font size="36">Oh, so beautiful.</font>

186
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:54,943
<font size="36">So pretty.</font>

187
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:58,323
<font size="36">Your wife must be very beautiful.</font>

188
00:09:58,943 --> 00:09:59,653
<font size="36">She's truly very beautiful.</font>

189
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:00,063
<font size="36">Ah, she looks like me.</font>

190
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:01,263
<font size="36">She looks like me!</font>

191
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:02,443
<font size="36">Hey, she looks like me.</font>

192
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:05,053
<font size="36">If the features combined make her look like this, she must be a wonderful beauty?</font>

193
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,843
<font size="36">Oh, the love for a firstborn is truly special.</font>

194
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,653
<font size="36">Ah, anyway, her eyes resemble her father's. She has her father's facial features.</font>

195
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:21,193
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

196
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:22,843
<font size="36">Ah, that's right. The eyes are similar.</font>

197
00:10:23,183 --> 00:10:24,283
<font size="36">The eyes are similar.</font>

198
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:31,083
<font size="36">I am studying in the Department of Clothing and Textiles at Yonsei University. I am a student of the class of '25.</font>

199
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:35,243
<font size="36">Wow... Oh... And she even goes to a good school.</font>

200
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:48,033
<font size="36">Initially, she looks very well-behaved, but when she gets closer or more comfortable, she talks a lot and is very lively.</font>

201
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:52,373
<font size="36">Of course, dating is very difficult.</font>

202
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:53,203
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

203
00:10:53,893 --> 00:11:03,793
<font size="36">Because I've never prioritized love in my life, if there's someone of the opposite sex I like, I always just stand and watch.</font>

204
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:12,385
<font size="36">Because I live in the dormitory, there are many
couples walking together late at night</font>

205
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:18,103
<font size="36">When I see those couples, I think
'I wish I had a boyfriend like that too'.</font>

206
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:23,683
<font size="36">So, here, with the passion of my 20s</font>

207
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:32,843
<font size="36">Now that I'm an adult, unlike before, I want to try to make an effort first</font>

208
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:40,543
<font size="36">I want to feel a sensation where my heart pounds so much that I have to ask myself 'Is it okay to like someone this much?'.</font>

209
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:45,203
<font size="36">Woah, she said she wants to feel her heart pound! What are you going to do!!!</font>

210
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,243
<font size="36">Dae-hee! Dae-hee!</font>

211
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,643
<font size="36">Dae-hee! Dae-hee! Said it's better to go out first.</font>

212
00:11:52,843 --> 00:11:53,243
<font size="36">Oh, that's right.</font>

213
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:54,643
<font size="36">Said it's better to get hurt first.</font>

214
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:55,243
<font size="36">Watching.</font>

215
00:11:55,543 --> 00:11:57,543
<font size="36">Woah, but it's really nerve-wracking. Woah.</font>

216
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:00,443
<font size="36">Oh, and she even goes to a good school.</font>

217
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:06,012
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

218
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:10,972
<font size="36">Hello...</font>

219
00:12:14,322 --> 00:12:15,012
<font size="36">Please sit.</font>

220
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:31,582
<font size="36">Oh, both of them are so young.</font>

221
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:34,302
<font size="36">Are you alone?</font>

222
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:35,622
<font size="36">Yes... alone...</font>

223
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:37,632
<font size="36">Did you sleep well?</font>

224
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:39,432
<font size="36">Ah, yes...</font>

225
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:54,882
<font size="36">A little nervous.</font>

226
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,012
<font size="36">Dad is even more nervous...</font>

227
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:01,132
<font size="36">Awkward x2</font>

228
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:02,792
<font size="36">Must keep the conversation going.</font>

229
00:13:03,462 --> 00:13:05,352
<font size="36">I don't know what to do~</font>

230
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:09,718
<font size="36">Ah, that's right, someone come quickly. Quickly.
Wow, that atmosphere is so awkward.</font>

231
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:10,902
<font size="36">Woah, I really can't watch anymore.</font>

232
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:14,702
<font size="36">But do our children know who their father and mother are?</font>

233
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:15,752
<font size="36">The children don't know.</font>

234
00:13:16,232 --> 00:13:17,012
<font size="36">The children don't know. Yes.</font>

235
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:19,712
<font size="36">They don't know whose daughter and whose son they are.</font>

236
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:23,732
<font size="36">Have you... have you eaten yet?</font>

237
00:13:24,642 --> 00:13:26,842
<font size="36">Ah, yes. I ate bread for lunch.</font>

238
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:28,932
<font size="36">What kind of bread did you eat?</font>

239
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:31,492
<font size="36">Tomato bread?</font>

240
00:13:33,742 --> 00:13:34,462
<font size="36">What is tomato bread...?</font>

241
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:36,392
<font size="36">Tomato cream cheese...</font>

242
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:38,132
<font size="36">Tomato cream cheese...?</font>

243
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:44,642
<font size="36">I ate focaccia with sundried tomatoes and cream cheese.</font>

244
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,512
<font size="36">Fo... Focaccia...?</font>

245
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,212
<font size="36">Focaccia?</font>

246
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:52,232
<font size="36">A type of fermented bread? Bread made from fermented dough?</font>

247
00:13:52,562 --> 00:13:55,182
<font size="36">Ah, just pretend to know. Just say you know. Tak-soo, just...</font>

248
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:56,972
<font size="36">Why ask in such detail!</font>

249
00:13:57,332 --> 00:13:58,012
<font size="36">No... I don't know either...</font>

250
00:13:58,622 --> 00:13:59,592
<font size="36">Does Dad have a way of just being himself...?</font>

251
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:03,012
<font size="36">No, but on one hand, being honest is good. Honest.</font>

252
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:03,902
<font size="36">Be honest, be honest.</font>

253
00:14:08,242 --> 00:14:09,012
<font size="36">Uhm... is that so(?)</font>

254
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:14,472
<font size="36">I tried my best to ease the atmosphere in my own way.</font>

255
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:22,332
<font size="36">I've never been on a date, so this is my first time being alone with a stranger of the opposite sex.</font>

256
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:24,742
<font size="36">Oh. Oh, she tried, she tried. Oh.</font>

257
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:29,232
<font size="36">Someone's coming.</font>

258
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:30,532
<font size="36">Someone is coming.</font>

259
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:37,132
<font size="36">Oh, who, who, who's coming. A boy is coming, a boy.</font>

260
00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:38,032
<font size="36">Who is it?</font>

261
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,932
<font size="36">Ah!</font>

262
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,209
<font size="36">I can't watch.</font>

263
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:03,769
<font size="36">I can't watch. Ah, I can't watch.</font>

264
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:04,879
<font size="36">Oh, so cute.</font>

265
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:05,919
<font size="36">Really similar.</font>

266
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,069
<font size="36">Really.</font>

267
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:09,409
<font size="36">Oh, so cute. Oh.</font>

268
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,009
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

269
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:17,799
<font size="36">Hello. I'm Ahn Sun-jun, 24 years old.</font>

270
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:19,929
<font size="36">Woah, so cute.</font>

271
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:21,839
<font size="36">He's a mini replica of that master.</font>

272
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:23,729
<font size="36">He resembles his father.</font>

273
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:24,279
<font size="36">Solid.</font>

274
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:25,399
<font size="36">Woah, really similar.</font>

275
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,679
<font size="36">Woah. That's right.</font>

276
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:30,599
<font size="36">Look at this. So much like his father.</font>

277
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:32,379
<font size="36">Back when he was in kindergarten, when they went together.</font>

278
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:34,909
<font size="36">Ah, so cute. Oh.</font>

279
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:49,949
<font size="36">After graduating high school, I went to Tsuji Culinary Institute Osaka and am currently studying Japanese cuisine there.</font>

280
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:02,399
<font size="36">Ah, that's right. Ah, that's one of the top three culinary schools in the world.</font>

281
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,949
<font size="36">Choi Kang-rok and Jung Ho-young studied there.</font>

282
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:05,823
<font size="36">Ah, is that so?</font>

283
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,690
<font size="36">They came from there.</font>

284
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:09,309
<font size="36">Woah, really.</font>

285
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,039
<font size="36">Oh, so cool.</font>

286
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:13,689
<font size="36">Men who are good at cooking are charming.</font>

287
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:14,999
<font size="36">Jealous. So jealous.</font>

288
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,409
<font size="36">Show off your charm.</font>

289
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:22,449
<font size="36">I've been living in Japan for about 2 years now.</font>

290
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:23,799
<font size="36">Oh, that's right.</font>

291
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:29,379
<font size="36">Ah, yes, living without any problems.</font>

292
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:30,799
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

293
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:45,709
<font size="36">Hajimemashite. Ah, watashi wa An to mōshimasu. Ah, Kankokujin desu. (Hello. My name is An. I am Korean.)</font>

294
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,749
<font size="36">It's hard to live with just that much?</font>

295
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:49,919
<font size="36">Awkward. Probably needs to say more.</font>

296
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:52,819
<font size="36">Not as expected? No. Ah. Kankokujin desu.</font>

297
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:55,959
<font size="36">Dating?</font>

298
00:16:57,669 --> 00:16:59,169
<font size="36">Never been in love.</font>

299
00:16:59,169 --> 00:16:59,999
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

300
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:00,999
<font size="36">Never been in love.</font>

301
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:01,499
<font size="36">Never been in love.</font>

302
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:02,199
<font size="36">Oh, single since birth.</font>

303
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:03,949
<font size="36">Oh, single since birth. Yes.</font>

304
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,899
<font size="36">Yes, I have no experience with dating, confessing feelings, or going on dates.</font>

305
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:16,899
<font size="36">Oh, if I can do it here, this will be my first date in my life.</font>

306
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,999
<font size="36">Yes, it's a bit sad.</font>

307
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:21,599
<font size="36">Honestly, him.</font>

308
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:41,199
<font size="36">Oh, I'm a bit shy, but here, if there's someone I like, I think I'll gather all my courage to express myself clearly. Even if I fail, I'll try.</font>

309
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:44,599
<font size="36">Our son, fighting! Fighting, fighting! Ahn Sun-jun, fighting!</font>

310
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,199
<font size="36">Ah, that's good. Good courage.</font>

311
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:46,999
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

312
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:47,499
<font size="36">Fighting, fighting!</font>

313
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:48,699
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

314
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:51,899
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

315
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:52,499
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

316
00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:53,299
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

317
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:53,999
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

318
00:17:56,299 --> 00:17:58,499
<font size="36">Just sit wherever you're comfortable.</font>

319
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,499
<font size="36">So cute.</font>

320
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:03,199
<font size="36">Almost comfortable.</font>

321
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,833
<font size="36">Yes, I'll sit there.</font>

322
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,333
<font size="36">Sun-jun, sit closer.</font>

323
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:09,833
<font size="36">Why are you sitting like that?</font>

324
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:17,033
<font size="36">Are you okay?</font>

325
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,033
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

326
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:20,233
<font size="36">It seems like he's not okay...</font>

327
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,133
<font size="36">Awkward, awkward atmosphere.</font>

328
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:36,833
<font size="36">Oh, he's smiling.</font>

329
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,333
<font size="36">Oh, he's smiling.</font>

330
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:46,133
<font size="36">Ah no, now he's not looking at his son, but only at his son-in-law. Our Ahn Myung-jang.</font>

331
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:47,533
<font size="36">He's smiling.</font>

332
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:51,133
<font size="36">Someone else is coming...</font>

333
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,333
<font size="36">Oh, someone else is coming. Who could it be this time?</font>

334
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,133
<font size="36">Coming again, coming again.</font>

335
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:57,833
<font size="36">My daughter, my daughter.</font>

336
00:18:58,033 --> 00:18:58,233
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

337
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,833
<font size="36">Hmm. Oh, yes.</font>

338
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,833
<font size="36">Oh! Oh, whose daughter is it?</font>

339
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:26,133
<font size="36">Oh! Whose daughter is it? Who, who, who?</font>

340
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,833
<font size="36">Hello. I'm Lee Shin-hyang.</font>

341
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,133
<font size="36">If the surname is Lee then...</font>

342
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:33,833
<font size="36">(It's my daughter, isn't it?)</font>

343
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:35,333
<font size="36">Oh, so clean.</font>

344
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:35,833
<font size="36">Ours.</font>

345
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,833
<font size="36">Hey, seriously. Better than expected. Oh, who is it? It's my daughter.</font>

346
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:40,833
<font size="36">Really? Woah!</font>

347
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:49,833
<font size="36">Woah!</font>

348
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,533
<font size="36">Amazing!</font>

349
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,133
<font size="36">A daughter completely different from her father.</font>

350
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:54,833
<font size="36">Oh, now oh, truly amazing, amazing.</font>

351
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:55,133
<font size="36">Truly amazing.</font>

352
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:07,533
<font size="36">Ah, Shin-hyang.</font>

353
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:10,533
<font size="36">It's not kidnapping.</font>

354
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:15,333
<font size="36">Oh my.</font>

355
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:16,133
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

356
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:18,333
<font size="36">Oh, so cute.</font>

357
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,533
<font size="36">Oh my, what's wrong with her.</font>

358
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,133
<font size="36">You've raised your daughter very well.</font>

359
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:28,833
<font size="36">As for me, well, optimistic? Seems like a cheerful person</font>

360
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:30,533
<font size="36">Hey, why are you so cheerful?</font>

361
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,133
<font size="36">Cute.</font>

362
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:41,833
<font size="36">No matter who or where I meet, I quickly get close to them and, well, I seem to be a very emotional person.</font>

363
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,133
<font size="36">Shin-hyang is doing this part-time? At a cafe?</font>

364
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:46,533
<font size="36">Woah, Shin-hyang even works part-time.</font>

365
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:50,833
<font size="36">She must be very popular.</font>

366
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,833
<font size="36">My daughter has been single since birth.</font>

367
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:55,533
<font size="36">Single since birth? Never, never dated? Hey, that's a lie.</font>

368
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:59,333
<font size="36">No, no, no, seriously, seriously. No, it's not. Never dated once and truly single since birth.</font>

369
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,833
<font size="36">If she's really been single since birth, then you should be even more worried.</font>

370
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:03,133
<font size="36">Ah, is that so?</font>

371
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,333
<font size="36">Ah, Park Ho-san is a bit</font>

372
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,486
<font size="36">The kind of talk that makes a father uncomfortable to hear.</font>

373
00:21:09,486 --> 00:21:11,986
<font size="36">But it also makes sense...?</font>

374
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:14,156
<font size="36">That's right, you should be worried.</font>

375
00:21:19,926 --> 00:21:23,376
<font size="36">Hello. Hello. Hello.</font>

376
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:24,546
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

377
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:30,866
<font size="36">Sit wherever you're comfortable (go ahead).</font>

378
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:32,766
<font size="36">Comfortable... Yes...</font>

379
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:37,356
<font size="36">Ah, where should I sit? Ah here. I'll sit on this side.</font>

380
00:21:38,226 --> 00:21:39,266
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

381
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:47,076
<font size="36">He's like sunshine.</font>

382
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:52,396
<font size="36">Oh, the atmosphere seems to have changed.</font>

383
00:21:55,256 --> 00:21:56,546
<font size="36">Ah, first of all, cheerful, that kid.</font>

384
00:21:56,546 --> 00:22:00,326
<font size="36">Cheerful. Right? Cheerful. We fathers pay a lot of attention to that. Must be cheerful. Must have energy.</font>

385
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:01,476
<font size="36">What about my daughter?!</font>

386
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:02,936
<font size="36">What about my daughter.</font>

387
00:22:03,316 --> 00:22:03,986
<font size="36">No, it's not.</font>

388
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:08,966
<font size="36">Is my daughter dark?! Pitch black?!</font>

389
00:22:08,966 --> 00:22:10,966
<font size="36">It's over! (Sa-yoon) it's over!!</font>

390
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:14,766
<font size="36">Just came in, just came in. Please pay a little attention.</font>

391
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,846
<font size="36">Nice to meet you.</font>

392
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:18,766
<font size="36">Ah, nice to meet you.</font>

393
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:21,426
<font size="36">Sun-jun is too shy.</font>

394
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:24,586
<font size="36">This place is so beautiful, amazing.</font>

395
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,016
<font size="36">Ah, there's a board game.</font>

396
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:28,776
<font size="36">Do you like board games?</font>

397
00:22:29,206 --> 00:22:30,216
<font size="36">I go out often.</font>

398
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,266
<font size="36">Go out often? To a cafe. Ah, me too, me too.</font>

399
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:33,766
<font size="36">He's leading the atmosphere.</font>

400
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:36,766
<font size="36">Churros. French fries, french fries are good.</font>

401
00:22:37,476 --> 00:22:38,506
<font size="36">There's also a guitar?</font>

402
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:41,766
<font size="36">Does anyone know how to play guitar?</font>

403
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:44,526
<font size="36">Play a little, just a little. Very little.</font>

404
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,076
<font size="36">Just play a little? Me too, very little.</font>

405
00:22:48,556 --> 00:22:49,086
<font size="36">Show it.</font>

406
00:22:49,086 --> 00:22:49,446
<font size="36">Pardon?</font>

407
00:22:49,446 --> 00:22:49,806
<font size="36">Show it.</font>

408
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:52,766
<font size="36">Ah, if you show it first.</font>

409
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:57,896
<font size="36">I really didn't know my daughter was so good at talking.</font>

410
00:22:58,316 --> 00:23:00,606
<font size="36">Doing well. Ah, like an MC.</font>

411
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:01,786
<font size="36">Such a good personality.</font>

412
00:23:01,786 --> 00:23:08,166
<font size="36">At home, she's quiet, but she's so good at talking to friends. Why don't you talk to me...</font>

413
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,766
<font size="36">No, seriously. No, hey.</font>

414
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:14,366
<font size="36">The next participant is gradually approaching during the lively conversation</font>

415
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:14,766
<font size="36">Ah, a girl is coming again.</font>

416
00:23:15,476 --> 00:23:18,346
<font size="36">Woah, so tall, so tall. So long, so tall.</font>

417
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:21,606
<font size="36">Outstanding height visible from afar</font>

418
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:23,186
<font size="36">A swan has appeared!</font>

419
00:23:23,886 --> 00:23:24,486
<font size="36">Father's height.</font>

420
00:23:24,786 --> 00:23:29,006
<font size="36">Height DNA cannot be hidden. Hey, DNA cannot be hidden, cannot be hidden.</font>

421
00:23:29,656 --> 00:23:30,346
<font size="36">Someone is coming.</font>

422
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:34,326
<font size="36">Oh my God...</font>

423
00:23:34,856 --> 00:23:36,566
<font size="36">Oh my God. Sang is surprised. Oh my God.</font>

424
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,126
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

425
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:50,566
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

426
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:52,506
<font size="36">Everyone is beautiful! Everyone is beautiful!</font>

427
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,166
<font size="36">Why is that? lol</font>

428
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:56,866
<font size="36">Everyone is beautiful.</font>

429
00:23:56,866 --> 00:23:58,766
<font size="36">Sir, sir. Ah.</font>

430
00:23:58,766 --> 00:24:00,466
<font size="36">Woah.</font>

431
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:04,154
<font size="36">Hello. I'm Jeon Su-wan, 22 years old.</font>

432
00:24:07,163 --> 00:24:07,993
<font size="36">Mom, I say hello to you, I say hello to you.</font>

433
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:11,463
<font size="36">Oh, deadly beautiful, deadly. Oh.</font>

434
00:24:13,504 --> 00:24:17,014
<font size="36">So tall, she's the tallest, even her height. Always stands last.</font>

435
00:24:18,563 --> 00:24:21,063
<font size="36">Plays basketball too. Plays basketball too. Like her father.</font>

436
00:24:21,473 --> 00:24:23,453
<font size="36">This is our practice court, now. Ah.</font>

437
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:26,693
<font size="36">Oh! Now she's a model, a model.</font>

438
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:35,953
<font size="36">Oh my God. Look at her height.</font>

439
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,053
<font size="36">She has her father's facial features.</font>

440
00:24:40,274 --> 00:24:43,544
<font size="36">I am majoring in Korean traditional dance in the Dance Department at Sejong University.</font>

441
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:47,654
<font size="36">Ah, dance department. Dance department.</font>

442
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:50,444
<font size="36">Ah, it suits her so well. Suits her so well. Oh, suits her so well.</font>

443
00:24:51,134 --> 00:24:53,244
<font size="36">Looks like a real swan!</font>

444
00:24:55,424 --> 00:24:57,424
<font size="36">Hello. Hello. Hello.</font>

445
00:24:58,124 --> 00:24:58,724
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

446
00:25:01,104 --> 00:25:02,904
<font size="36">Just sit wherever you're comfortable.</font>

447
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:08,004
<font size="36">Oh! Sorry.</font>

448
00:25:11,354 --> 00:25:12,814
<font size="36">Hello. Hello.</font>

449
00:25:18,304 --> 00:25:18,704
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

450
00:25:22,984 --> 00:25:28,014
<font size="36">Just by looking, she's already so beautiful. So I feel like she must be very popular.</font>

451
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:38,244
<font size="36">Ah, it's not like she's a rival or anything, but, ah, among such beautiful and fresh people, what can I do?</font>

452
00:25:38,814 --> 00:25:40,494
<font size="36">Look at my daughter worrying.</font>

453
00:25:46,914 --> 00:25:47,734
<font size="36">You're not hot coming here, are you?</font>

454
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:50,104
<font size="36">Ah, yes. It's fine. Because it's a short walk.</font>

455
00:25:52,524 --> 00:25:54,594
<font size="36">Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh. Tak-soo took a glance.</font>

456
00:25:57,794 --> 00:25:58,734
<font size="36">How do you like this place?</font>

457
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:00,094
<font size="36">Pardon? This place?</font>

458
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,534
<font size="36">I think the garden here is beautiful.</font>

459
00:26:02,864 --> 00:26:04,174
<font size="36">That's right. The garden is really beautiful, isn't it?</font>

460
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:13,124
<font size="36">Have you been to Sokcho?</font>

461
00:26:13,424 --> 00:26:16,054
<font size="36">I went once last year with a friend.</font>

462
00:26:18,094 --> 00:26:18,994
<font size="36">Have you eaten anything delicious?</font>

463
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:22,264
<font size="36">Yes. I went to a certain market in Sokcho and ate fried chicken.</font>

464
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:26,264
<font size="36">Oh, he seems to talk a lot, doesn't he? Oh. Oh.</font>

465
00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:30,654
<font size="36">Hey, when our daughter came in, you didn't ask a single question, but, hey, oh?</font>

466
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:32,074
<font size="36">No, I already told them to sit wherever they're comfortable.</font>

467
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:34,774
<font size="36">That's right. Woah, discrimination like that?</font>

468
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:36,294
<font size="36">What discrimination?</font>

469
00:26:38,404 --> 00:26:40,324
<font size="36">Someone else is coming. Coming.</font>

470
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:43,734
<font size="36">Oh, now there's only one more person.</font>

471
00:26:44,174 --> 00:26:47,004
<font size="36">Sit where it's easiest to see. Jun-ho, Jun-ho.</font>

472
00:26:47,704 --> 00:26:49,134
<font size="36">You can tell by the way he walks.</font>

473
00:26:54,214 --> 00:26:57,914
<font size="36">Walking style, oh! Hey, a bit oh!</font>

474
00:26:57,914 --> 00:27:00,014
<font size="36">Oh! Oh! So rhythmic!</font>

475
00:27:02,744 --> 00:27:04,244
<font size="36">Oh, a bit stylish.</font>

476
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:05,815
<font size="36">Walks very stylishly.</font>

477
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:07,485
<font size="36">Doesn't seem worried at all.</font>

478
00:27:10,526 --> 00:27:11,176
<font size="36">Oh, so cool.</font>

479
00:27:15,986 --> 00:27:18,036
<font size="36">Ah, he has that look. He has his father's facial features. He has his father's facial features.</font>

480
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:21,596
<font size="36">Woah, he has his father's facial features!</font>

481
00:27:21,686 --> 00:27:23,126
<font size="36">He has his father's facial features. At this moment</font>

482
00:27:23,396 --> 00:27:24,376
<font size="36">You can tell it's Park Ho-san's son by looking at him.</font>

483
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:25,966
<font size="36">Really? So similar?</font>

484
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:27,016
<font size="36">You can tell it's Park Ho-san's son by looking at him.</font>

485
00:27:27,756 --> 00:27:28,866
<font size="36">Oh, exactly like Ho-san!</font>

486
00:27:29,306 --> 00:27:29,936
<font size="36">Similar, similar.</font>

487
00:27:30,686 --> 00:27:31,886
<font size="36">Oh, so similar.</font>

488
00:27:32,516 --> 00:27:33,126
<font size="36">He has his father's facial features.</font>

489
00:27:33,326 --> 00:27:33,926
<font size="36">He has his father's facial features.</font>

490
00:27:37,486 --> 00:27:38,016
<font size="36">Oh, so cool.</font>

491
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,016
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

492
00:27:40,756 --> 00:27:42,926
<font size="36">I am Park Jun-ho.</font>

493
00:27:43,706 --> 00:27:46,546
<font size="36">My profession is a rapper who composes music.</font>

494
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:47,516
<font size="36">He's a rapper!</font>

495
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:48,876
<font size="36">Q: Have you ever been confessed to?</font>

496
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:52,286
<font size="36">That happens occasionally ^^</font>

497
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:53,716
<font size="36">Oh! Yes!</font>

498
00:27:54,226 --> 00:27:55,566
<font size="36">Twice a month (confessed to)</font>

499
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,016
<font size="36">Twice a month??!!</font>

500
00:27:57,796 --> 00:28:02,516
<font size="36">The most I've been confessed to was five times a month</font>

501
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:03,726
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

502
00:28:04,856 --> 00:28:05,356
<font size="36">Woah!</font>

503
00:28:06,696 --> 00:28:09,016
<font size="36">Woah, so sometimes he's confessed to twice a week.</font>

504
00:28:10,796 --> 00:28:15,256
<font size="36">I debuted in 2018 with the show "High School Rapper 2"</font>

505
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:17,016
<font size="36">Ah, he appeared here? Ah, he already appeared.</font>

506
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:23,246
<font size="36">Because I'm not a very successful and famous artist</font>

507
00:28:24,026 --> 00:28:26,951
<font size="36">I've done quite a few part-time jobs.</font>

508
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:31,423
<font size="36">When I was in school, I worked at a wedding hall.</font>

509
00:28:31,736 --> 00:28:33,916
<font size="36">Carrying bowls and clearing plates</font>

510
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:38,276
<font size="36">Also did cargo loading, and worked at a clothing store.</font>

511
00:28:38,766 --> 00:28:47,786
<font size="36">Also at barbecue restaurants and Japanese restaurants, then at a discount candy store, and now at a cafe.</font>

512
00:28:48,616 --> 00:28:52,016
<font size="36">My living expenses, of course, I have to take care of myself.</font>

513
00:28:53,656 --> 00:28:54,856
<font size="36">He's really done a lot of part-time jobs.</font>

514
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:56,976
<font size="36">He certainly won't let his family go hungry.</font>

515
00:28:57,546 --> 00:28:58,006
<font size="36">Oh, that's right.</font>

516
00:29:00,356 --> 00:29:02,016
<font size="36">Q: What if you meet someone you like here?</font>

517
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:05,176
<font size="36">If I like someone, I won't wait forever.</font>

518
00:29:05,726 --> 00:29:09,406
<font size="36">Just try a little, just a little, no no.</font>

519
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:13,996
<font size="36">Look a little</font>

520
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:20,476
<font size="36">Oh, if there's a clear signal, I'll start a conversation right away.</font>

521
00:29:21,206 --> 00:29:22,276
<font size="36">So cool. Has a straightforward personality.</font>

522
00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:23,246
<font size="36">Cool, cool.</font>

523
00:29:23,736 --> 00:29:25,466
<font size="36">Seems like he'll be straightforward. Ah, a romantic rapper.</font>

524
00:29:32,746 --> 00:29:33,446
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

525
00:29:33,776 --> 00:29:35,026
<font size="36">Hello. Hello.</font>

526
00:29:37,326 --> 00:29:38,826
<font size="36">Just sit wherever you're comfortable.</font>

527
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:41,326
<font size="36">Ah, yes.</font>

528
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:43,936
<font size="36">Ah, really.</font>

529
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:44,926
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

530
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,996
<font size="36">Oh, the boys are nervous.</font>

531
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:50,016
<font size="36">Hello. Nice to meet you.</font>

532
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:58,176
<font size="36">Oh, he has charisma. Oh, with Jun-ho entering, the atmosphere seems to have changed.</font>

533
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,880
<font size="36">A bit like a banana, oh.</font>

534
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,110
<font size="36">Oh, he has an Eminem vibe.</font>

535
00:30:10,897 --> 00:30:13,537
<font size="36">I was also nervous, so I tried to stay as quiet as possible.</font>

536
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:19,837
<font size="36">If I talk a lot and initiate conversations a lot, honestly, I think I could do a lot.</font>

537
00:30:20,187 --> 00:30:20,387
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

538
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:27,367
<font size="36">But now I think talking a lot or doing something doesn't have any benefit.</font>

539
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:29,487
<font size="36">Oh. Ah, how calculating!</font>

540
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:32,637
<font size="36">Ah, something, ah, he's calculating, ah, he has a plan.</font>

541
00:30:32,637 --> 00:30:33,287
<font size="36">Ah, he has a plan.</font>

542
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,757
<font size="36">No, different from his father. Hey, he knows how to get confessed to.</font>

543
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:43,867
<font size="36">Jun-ho, I really like the song 'The Little Prince'.</font>

544
00:30:44,187 --> 00:30:52,897
<font size="36">I'm also a bit of a fan, and I've sung that song so many times at karaoke with my friends, so I miss it a lot.</font>

545
00:30:53,777 --> 00:30:55,837
<font size="36">Oh? So, she's a fan.</font>

546
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:57,987
<font size="36">First, have feelings, then start.</font>

547
00:30:58,307 --> 00:30:59,597
<font size="36">Ah, ah, connecting like that?</font>

548
00:31:04,397 --> 00:31:08,147
<font size="36">The man I feel I need to be wary of is Jun-ho, he's very</font>

549
00:31:09,237 --> 00:31:13,437
<font size="36">I have a feeling he's the type who will rush right in if he likes someone.</font>

550
00:31:13,787 --> 00:31:22,587
<font size="36">So, what if we like the same person. If we like the same person, oh, I can't lose. That's what I thought.</font>

551
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:23,897
<font size="36">Woah! It's not 'what to do' but rather.</font>

552
00:31:27,257 --> 00:31:28,197
<font size="36">Are you okay coming here?</font>

553
00:31:28,557 --> 00:31:31,187
<font size="36">Ah, yes, I, yes. I think it's fine.</font>

554
00:31:31,637 --> 00:31:32,837
<font size="36">Isn't this place beautiful?</font>

555
00:31:33,577 --> 00:31:38,367
<font size="36">Ah, yes. I saw it as soon as I arrived, it's just, ha...</font>

556
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:40,017
<font size="36">What's wrong?</font>

557
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:42,187
<font size="36">I don't know.</font>

558
00:31:42,517 --> 00:31:43,467
<font size="36">Don't know?</font>

559
00:31:46,847 --> 00:31:48,187
<font size="36">Oh, but that bracelet is nice.</font>

560
00:31:48,547 --> 00:31:50,387
<font size="36">Ah, thank you.</font>

561
00:31:51,187 --> 00:31:52,017
<font size="36">I borrowed it.</font>

562
00:31:52,017 --> 00:31:52,987
<font size="36">Ah, yes. It's nice.</font>

563
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:55,587
<font size="36">Looks stylish. Stylish.</font>

564
00:31:57,287 --> 00:31:58,487
<font size="36">From his walking style, you can tell</font>

565
00:31:58,487 --> 00:32:00,387
<font size="36">Very stylish. Both of you.</font>

566
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:02,847
<font size="36">Indeed stylish. It's my type.</font>

567
00:32:02,847 --> 00:32:04,887
<font size="36">It's my type.</font>

568
00:32:05,187 --> 00:32:08,887
<font size="36">Oh! Oh! It's my type?!!! Ah, it's my type. This</font>

569
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:13,987
<font size="36">Shin-hyang, who is said to be single since birth, is saying such flirtatious words?</font>

570
00:32:14,387 --> 00:32:15,587
<font size="36">It's really not like that. Right?</font>

571
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,787
<font size="36">So, shall we introduce our names first?</font>

572
00:32:21,987 --> 00:32:23,887
<font size="36">I am Lee Tak-soo.</font>

573
00:32:24,187 --> 00:32:24,887
<font size="36">Nice to meet you.</font>

574
00:32:25,187 --> 00:32:26,887
<font size="36">Nice to meet you.</font>

575
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,787
<font size="36">Kim Sa-yoon.</font>

576
00:32:29,187 --> 00:32:31,587
<font size="36">Kim Sa-yoon. Kim Sa-yoon.</font>

577
00:32:32,087 --> 00:32:33,187
<font size="36">Jeon Su-wan.</font>

578

<font size="36">Jeon Su-wan.</font>

579
00:32:33,687 --> 00:32:34,087
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

580
00:32:34,087 --> 00:32:34,887
<font size="36">Jeon Su-wan.</font>

581
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,587
<font size="36">I am Lee Shin-hyang.</font>

582
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:38,087
<font size="36">Lee Shin-hyang.</font>

583
00:32:38,087 --> 00:32:38,587
<font size="36">Lee Shin-hyang.</font>

584
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:41,187
<font size="36">I am Ahn Sun-jun.</font>

585
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:42,087
<font size="36">Ahn Sun-jun.</font>

586
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:42,687
<font size="36">Ahn Sun-jun.</font>

587
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:45,387
<font size="36">I am Park Jun-ho.</font>

588
00:32:45,387 --> 00:32:45,887
<font size="36">Jun-ho.</font>

589
00:32:46,387 --> 00:32:47,087
<font size="36">Nice to meet you.</font>

590
00:32:47,087 --> 00:32:47,687
<font size="36">Jun-ho.</font>

591
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:49,887
<font size="36">Woah.</font>

592
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:50,487
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

593
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:51,387
<font size="36">Nice to meet you.</font>

594
00:32:56,187 --> 00:32:58,387
<font size="36">Now everyone has gathered, right? Yes, all six people have arrived.</font>

595
00:32:58,387 --> 00:33:03,387
<font size="36">First, the fathers will tell us who their sons and daughters will choose as the person with the best first impression.</font>

596
00:33:03,506 --> 00:33:06,906
<font size="36">Let's see if they are correct.</font>

597
00:33:07,506 --> 00:33:10,036
<font size="36">Which boy did the daughters have the most favorable impression of?</font>

598
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:12,076
<font size="36">Father Su-hwan, yes, who will Su-wan choose.</font>

599
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:14,146
<font size="36">How tall is Tak-soo?</font>

600
00:33:14,946 --> 00:33:16,226
<font size="36">Around 1 meter 81, 82 cm, I think?</font>

601
00:33:18,286 --> 00:33:19,206
<font size="36">Then it must be Tak-soo.</font>

602
00:33:20,786 --> 00:33:21,516
<font size="36">She likes tall guys.</font>

603
00:33:22,986 --> 00:33:25,926
<font size="36">That gaze earlier was also like that, and she wasn't secretly peeking.</font>

604
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:29,116
<font size="36">That's right, did you peek at Tak-soo a little? Just like that, yes, and also starting a conversation.</font>

605
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:32,346
<font size="36">That father is watching very closely.</font>

606
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:35,706
<font size="36">Sa-yoon's father, who will our Sa-yoon choose, who</font>

607
00:33:36,476 --> 00:33:39,566
<font size="36">Ah, because she's my daughter, when I saw that look in her eyes</font>

608
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:43,666
<font size="36">Oh, first impression is probably Jun-ho, right?</font>

609
00:33:45,026 --> 00:33:48,156
<font size="36">What is it, my daughter's style seems a bit bad boy-ish?</font>

610
00:33:49,006 --> 00:33:54,326
<font size="36">Bad boy. Generally, she probably likes the bad boy type.</font>

611
00:33:55,256 --> 00:33:58,776
<font size="36">And the name Jun-ho doesn't feel unfamiliar.</font>

612
00:34:01,196 --> 00:34:02,926
<font size="36">There's a very close Jun-ho too.</font>

613
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:05,636
<font size="36">Yes, yes. So I think it's probably Jun-ho. Yes.</font>

614
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:12,616
<font size="36">But I think, looking at how she said he's her type, it's probably Jun-ho.</font>

615
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:18,996
<font size="36">A little bit, why, why, why is that, because I know Shin-hyang doesn't have such friends around her.</font>

616
00:34:19,346 --> 00:34:26,346
<font size="36">Meaning, making music, a bit stylish, a bit rebellious feeling? Affection? Curiosity? I guess those things are there. I think so.</font>

617
00:34:27,196 --> 00:34:28,346
<font size="36">So I'm worried.</font>

618
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,166
<font size="36">Oh, what's there to worry about? What's there to worry about? What's there to worry about? What about my child?</font>

619
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:33,666
<font size="36">What about my child?</font>

620
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:36,666
<font size="36">What's there to worry about...</font>

621
00:34:40,216 --> 00:34:41,346
<font size="36">Good. Shall we check?</font>

622
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:44,806
<font size="36">Is there anyone with a very good first impression?</font>

623
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:51,618
<font size="36">The person who left the deepest impression...</font>

624
00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:56,816
<font size="36">The person who left the deepest impression is Jun-ho.</font>

625
00:34:57,866 --> 00:34:59,466
<font size="36">Oh! Jun-ho. That's right.</font>

626
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:01,851
<font size="36">I guessed correctly. Yes</font>

627
00:35:01,861 --> 00:35:03,566
<font size="36">I saw him walking like this.</font>

628
00:35:04,866 --> 00:35:12,026
<font size="36">But his walking style was a bit different. So oh, I thought so.</font>

629
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:15,466
<font size="36">As expected, he's stylish. He's my type.</font>

630
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:18,566
<font size="36">That's right, I said I was worried, and he's her type... truly</font>

631
00:35:21,006 --> 00:35:21,651
<font size="36">Oh, Sa-yoon.</font>

632
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:30,666
<font size="36">Among the three, the one closest to my ideal type in terms of looks is probably Jun-ho.</font>

633
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:35,566
<font size="36">No, Jun-ho guessed correctly!!! That's right. I told you I understand my daughter!</font>

634
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,866
<font size="36">That's right. This atmosphere is really strange.</font>

635
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:40,766
<font size="36">No, he's popular, you know.</font>

636
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:44,366
<font size="36">Su-wan, please.</font>

637
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:49,766
<font size="36">Among the boys, the one closest to my ideal type is probably Tak-soo.</font>

638
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:52,066
<font size="36">Oh, Tak-soo. As expected. Oh, Dad guessed correctly.</font>

639
00:35:52,966 --> 00:35:56,966
<font size="36">Oh, I feel like his first impression of me was very good.</font>

640
00:35:57,966 --> 00:36:00,466
<font size="36">Well done. Guessed correctly. Oh.</font>

641
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:03,866
<font size="36">So, Jun-ho. Jun-ho probably had a first impression</font>

642
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:06,466
<font size="36">I think this suits me. I Sa-yoon</font>

643
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:07,959
<font size="36">Probably had a good impression.</font>

644
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:08,919
<font size="36">Reason, what's the reason?</font>

645
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:10,509
<font size="36">Why, why, why?</font>

646
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:15,509
<font size="36">Jun-ho likes to talk like that, so Sa-yoon will probably listen a lot.</font>

647
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:16,209
<font size="36">Probably.</font>

648
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:18,499
<font size="36">Woah.</font>

649
00:36:18,499 --> 00:36:21,549
<font size="36">Ah, I'm curious about our Sun-jun's choice. Who will Sun-jun choose</font>

650
00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:23,549
<font size="36">I like everyone, but</font>

651
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:25,679
<font size="36">Now, sir, sir, it's not the person your father likes!</font>

652
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,429
<font size="36">Not the person I like.</font>

653
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:32,799
<font size="36">Sir. Oh, is that not it...?</font>

654
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:36,389
<font size="36">Our son, first impression, our son likes this kind of person.</font>

655
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:39,739
<font size="36">Oh, the type Sun-jun likes is like IU.</font>

656
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,499
<font size="36">IU? The slender type.</font>

657
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,599
<font size="36">Slender. So who is slender?</font>

658
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,099
<font size="36">Su-wan.</font>

659
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:45,689
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

660
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:47,079
<font size="36">IU?</font>

661
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,909
<font size="36">Su-wan is IU??</font>

662
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:51,499
<font size="36">Is IU 170m tall?</font>

663
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:54,239
<font size="36">IU is very tall, that IU.</font>

664
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:56,629
<font size="36">Likes tall girls!!</font>

665
00:36:56,629 --> 00:36:57,629
<font size="36">But IU is</font>

666
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:01,329
<font size="36">Yes, what about Lee Jong-hyuk?</font>

667
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:01,679
<font size="36">Me?</font>

668
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:01,979
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

669
00:37:01,979 --> 00:37:05,669
<font size="36">Ah, I think Tak-soo seems to like Shin-hyang a bit?</font>

670
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:06,799
<font size="36">That's right~</font>

671
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:08,199
<font size="36">That's right. That's right.</font>

672
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:08,689
<font size="36">Lee Shin-hyang.</font>

673
00:37:08,689 --> 00:37:12,279
<font size="36">Cute. Oh, he probably likes the small and cute type.</font>

674
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,989
<font size="36">Father's opinion. Tak-soo probably chose that person.</font>

675
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:18,379
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

676
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:22,609
<font size="36">Yes, will the children's and parents' views align?</font>

677
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,659
<font size="36">Ah, the most impressive person at the first meeting</font>

678
00:37:29,723 --> 00:37:31,390
<font size="36">Is Su-wan.</font>

679
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:37,009
<font size="36">Very impressive, I felt she was very tall and seemed aloof.</font>

680
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:42,659
<font size="36">So I thought if I had a chance later, I'd like to talk more.</font>

681
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:44,329
<font size="36">Sun-jun.</font>

682
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:44,679
<font size="36">Sun-jun?</font>

683
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,029
<font size="36">Sun-jun.</font>

684
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,559
<font size="36">Sun-jun!</font>

685
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:48,139
<font size="36">Sa-yoon?</font>

686
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:48,899
<font size="36">Sa-yoon.</font>

687
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:49,749
<font size="36">Sa-yoon.</font>

688
00:37:49,749 --> 00:37:50,419
<font size="36">Oh, Sun-jun.</font>

689
00:37:50,419 --> 00:37:55,999
<font size="36">Her facial features also seemed very clear.</font>

690
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:59,369
<font size="36">I felt very comfortable and good.</font>

691
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:00,689
<font size="36">Oh, that's right, my (?)</font>

692
00:38:00,689 --> 00:38:01,329
<font size="36">That boy is really good at reading people.</font>

693
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:06,199
<font size="36">When I first saw her, the first impression was, oh, the first impression was so good.</font>

694
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:09,299
<font size="36">The person with the most approachable first impression is probably Su-wan.</font>

695
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:14,099
<font size="36">Personally, I find her very cute when she smiles.</font>

696
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:18,099
<font size="36">Doesn't Dad know anything? Dad seems too jealous.</font>

697
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:33,399
<font size="36">Personally, I felt that Shin-hyang seemed to be the type to liven up the atmosphere, so I felt a bit drained of energy at that moment.</font>

698
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:35,799
<font size="36">Drained of energy? Feeling drained of energy.</font>

699
00:38:35,799 --> 00:38:36,699
<font size="36">Feeling drained of energy.</font>

700
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:38,499
<font size="36">Aha.</font>

701
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:41,799
<font size="36">But what drained of energy, drained of energy!!</font>

702
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:46,099
<font size="36">Brother, I'm sorry.</font>

703
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:47,099
<font size="36">No, no, no, it's not.</font>

704
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:50,699
<font size="36">No, our son is a bit disrespectful...</font>

705
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:51,299
<font size="36">No, no, no, it's not.</font>

706
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:51,999
<font size="36">No, then</font>

707
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:52,299
<font size="36">No.</font>

708
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:53,999
<font size="36">Oh, this kid, I told him not to do that...</font>

709
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:54,499
<font size="36">Worried. Ah.</font>

710
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,999
<font size="36">Ah, I apologize on his behalf. Jun-ho is still</font>

711
00:38:57,999 --> 00:38:59,599
<font size="36">Because he's a kid~ Because he's a kid...</font>

712
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,599
<font size="36">No, Shin-hyang doesn't drain energy at all!!!!!</font>

713
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:02,647
<font size="36">No, Shin-hyang doesn't drain energy at all!!!!!</font>

714
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:05,307
<font size="36">The father is too invested because it's his child. No, she's just a bit shy, so she took the initiative.</font>

715
00:39:05,307 --> 00:39:08,297
<font size="36">If you misunderstand that, then actually (Shin-hyang) did well...</font>

716
00:39:08,777 --> 00:39:12,647
<font size="36">My daughter is absolutely not the type to drain someone's energy or anything like that.</font>

717
00:39:14,677 --> 00:39:16,707
<font size="36">No, saying that kid has good charm or something...</font>

718
00:39:17,537 --> 00:39:20,577
<font size="36">Or like a vacuum cleaner. Just something like that.</font>

719
00:39:21,187 --> 00:39:22,437
<font size="36">Good charm. That's good.</font>

720
00:39:22,437 --> 00:39:23,397
<font size="36">Saying that.</font>

721
00:39:32,812 --> 00:39:35,442
<font size="36">Tak-soo and Su-wan have swapped places.</font>

722
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:36,832
<font size="36">They chose each other.</font>

723
00:39:37,602 --> 00:39:39,272
<font size="36">Should we continue this?</font>

724
00:39:39,932 --> 00:39:43,132
<font size="36">Our Director Jung's daughter seems to have a very straightforward personality.</font>

725
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:45,402
<font size="36">I think they could get along.</font>

726
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:47,692
<font size="36">What is it, in-laws or something, they could become close.</font>

727
00:39:48,032 --> 00:39:49,932
<font size="36">I secretly hope so.</font>

728
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:50,622
<font size="36">Now what?</font>

729
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,032
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

730
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:53,832
<font size="36">Is that okay?</font>

731
00:39:53,832 --> 00:39:56,232
<font size="36">Is that okay? Isn't it good now? Isn't Tak-soo good?</font>

732
00:39:58,932 --> 00:39:59,332
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

733
00:39:59,932 --> 00:40:01,532
<font size="36">Don't you like him much? Is it not okay?</font>

734
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,632
<font size="36">Isn't Tak-soo okay? Why?</font>

735
00:40:03,832 --> 00:40:04,432
<font size="36">No, no, no, no.</font>

736
00:40:04,432 --> 00:40:08,332
<font size="36">Yes. Perhaps it's too early to become in-laws... hehe</font>

737
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:14,652
<font size="36">Ah no, but Sun-jun and Shin-hyang haven't yet. Yes.</font>

738
00:40:14,652 --> 00:40:15,652
<font size="36">They haven't received a single vote.</font>

739
00:40:15,652 --> 00:40:17,852
<font size="36">Yes. But a first impression is just a first impression.</font>

740
00:40:17,852 --> 00:40:18,752
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

741
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:19,152
<font size="36">Ah, that's right.</font>

742
00:40:19,152 --> 00:40:21,252
<font size="36">Ah no, then those who haven't received any votes should just date each other.</font>

743
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:23,852
<font size="36">Why are you getting angry at the MC... lol</font>

744
00:40:25,352 --> 00:40:28,352
<font size="36">No, there are viewers watching, why are you talking informally?</font>

745
00:40:28,952 --> 00:40:29,452
<font size="36">Ah, ah, me?</font>

746
00:40:29,452 --> 00:40:32,052
<font size="36">Brother, why are you talking informally? Everyone is watching.</font>

747
00:40:33,252 --> 00:40:34,552
<font size="36">I also have three children.</font>

748
00:40:35,152 --> 00:40:36,552
<font size="36">No, it's not like I did it.</font>

749
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:39,952
<font size="36">No, did I do this like this? I came here as the host.</font>

750
00:40:40,252 --> 00:40:45,252
<font size="36">MC-nim(?) That's not it, this is self-talk, what you think in your head, accidentally...</font>

751
00:40:45,552 --> 00:40:46,452
<font size="36">There are times like that.</font>

752
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:47,752
<font size="36">Sometimes there are times like that.</font>

753
00:40:47,752 --> 00:40:51,552
<font size="36">No, when you get old, there are times like that. You think it in your head and it just comes out.</font>

754
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:52,552
<font size="36">Ah, sorry.</font>

755
00:40:52,552 --> 00:40:52,952
<font size="36">Yes, that's right. Yes.</font>

756
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:54,552
<font size="36">Because it's silly.</font>

757
00:40:55,052 --> 00:41:00,352
<font size="36">No, no, but there's this saying. In ancient words, it is said that first impressions are often unreliable.</font>

758
00:41:01,652 --> 00:41:03,852
<font size="36">Ah, that's harsh.</font>

759
00:41:06,852 --> 00:41:07,752
<font size="36">First luck?</font>

760
00:41:07,752 --> 00:41:10,052
<font size="36">At first again, yes. First luck?</font>

761
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:10,752
<font size="36">First luck??</font>

762
00:41:10,752 --> 00:41:14,652
<font size="36">No, the truth is. If you quietly observe this world we live in</font>

763
00:41:15,252 --> 00:41:19,752
<font size="36">But actually, I don't think this first impression is really important.</font>

764
00:41:20,252 --> 00:41:28,852
<font size="36">Because what's important is to consider the overall personality and other things throughout life, and ultimately be chosen, so I won't be overly happy or disappointed.</font>

765
00:41:28,852 --> 00:41:29,552
<font size="36">Ah, last time.</font>

766
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:31,552
<font size="36">Yes. It seems like you're trying to comfort me.</font>

767
00:41:31,552 --> 00:41:32,752
<font size="36">What, no, it's true.</font>

768
00:41:32,752 --> 00:41:33,352
<font size="36">It's really okay.</font>

769
00:41:33,352 --> 00:41:33,752
<font size="36">Really.</font>

770
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:34,352
<font size="36">Really...</font>

771
00:41:34,352 --> 00:41:34,752
<font size="36">Really.</font>

772
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:35,252
<font size="36">Really.</font>

773
00:41:35,252 --> 00:41:35,752
<font size="36">Really.</font>

774
00:41:35,752 --> 00:41:35,952
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

775
00:41:36,252 --> 00:41:40,052
<font size="36">Please switch places with me... Ah, too much... pressure and yes.</font>

776
00:41:40,052 --> 00:41:40,752
<font size="36">And something</font>

777
00:41:41,152 --> 00:41:45,252
<font size="36">I don't have a daughter, but Sun-jun is the type of son-in-law I'd want.</font>

778
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:45,752
<font size="36">Even though I don't have a daughter.</font>

779
00:41:46,052 --> 00:41:48,652
<font size="36">Ah, if I had a daughter, I'd want to marry her to him.</font>

780
00:41:49,252 --> 00:41:50,452
<font size="36">Are you comforting me?</font>

781
00:41:50,452 --> 00:41:52,752
<font size="36">No, no, no. It's not like that, it's true.</font>

782
00:41:52,752 --> 00:41:53,752
<font size="36">No...</font>

783
00:41:57,052 --> 00:42:00,752
<font size="36">Ah, I didn't expect Park Ho-san to have this kind of way of provoking people.</font>

784
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:03,552
<font size="36">Giving both the illness and the cure.</font>

785
00:42:04,152 --> 00:42:04,752
<font size="36">Ah, these teachers.</font>

786
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,600
<font size="36">Me too, me too. Ah. Oh, honestly.</font>

787
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,920
<font size="36">But I, I'm going to make a hasty judgment.</font>

788
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,910
<font size="36">Just a hasty judgment.</font>

789
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,650
<font size="36">When this show ends, at the end of this series, I think Shin-hyang will find the right person.</font>

790
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,220
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

791
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,530
<font size="36">My gut feeling.</font>

792
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,820
<font size="36">No, Ho-san, I know you're trying to comfort me.</font>

793
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,140
<font size="36">Ah, both of you.</font>

794
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,140
<font size="36">Now both of you are unhappy.</font>

795
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,110
<font size="36">No, why do you comfort and then scold?</font>

796
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:27,870
<font size="36">No, it's true.</font>

797
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:32,920
<font size="36">The 6 residents have moved in.</font>

798
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:37,110
<font size="36">The real beginning is now.</font>

799
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,410
<font size="36">That one.</font>

800
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,890
<font size="36">It says, open it when everyone has gathered. Open it.</font>

801
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,110
<font size="36">Please read.</font>

802
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,760
<font size="36">Residency Guidelines.</font>

803
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,890
<font size="36">First. Do not arbitrarily reveal personal information other than your name.</font>

804
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,670
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

805
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,110
<font size="36">We've only said our names, right?</font>

806
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,890
<font size="36">On the 5th night of residency, we will proceed with the final choice.</font>

807
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,690
<font size="36">Feel free to flirt until then.</font>

808
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:09,710
<font size="36">So cute.</font>

809
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:16,970
<font size="36">Once everyone has moved in, we will begin room assignments. Please write your name on the nameplate of the room you want.</font>

810
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:18,760
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

811
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,620
<font size="36">So, shall we go out and see?</font>

812
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:21,860
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

813
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,750
<font size="36">The house has 1 ground floor and 1 upper floor.</font>

814
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,056
<font size="36">There's a 1st floor and a 2nd floor, separated.</font>

815
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,610
<font size="36">First, let's go explore the 1st floor.</font>

816
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,110
<font size="36">Woah, what is it?</font>

817
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,010
<font size="36">Woah, what is it?</font>

818
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:36,510
<font size="36">Woah, what is it?</font>

819
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,110
<font size="36">What, what, what?</font>

820
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:37,810
<font size="36">What, what, what?</font>

821
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:39,310
<font size="36">So cute.</font>

822
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,510
<font size="36">Woah, so clean. It's really beautiful.</font>

823
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,110
<font size="36">This must be our room.</font>

824
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,110
<font size="36">Probably the girls' room.</font>

825
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,010
<font size="36">Ladies.</font>

826
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:46,510
<font size="36">Oh my God.</font>

827
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,610
<font size="36">The dorm is so beautiful.</font>

828
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,510
<font size="36">It's truly a princess room.</font>

829
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:56,510
<font size="36">Ah, looking now, it seems males and females are on the same floor.</font>

830
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,110
<font size="36">So they can meet each other when they walk around.</font>

831
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,510
<font size="36">They can meet, on the same floor.</font>

832
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,910
<font size="36">Not divided by gender per floor.</font>

833
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,310
<font size="36">Floor division... ha...</font>

834
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:09,110
<font size="36">I want to stay here.</font>

835
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:11,410
<font size="36">Definitely have to be on the 2nd floor.</font>

836
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:11,710
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

837
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,110
<font size="36">I also want 2nd floor... hehe</font>

838
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,510
<font size="36">I also want 2nd floor... hehe</font>

839
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:15,910
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

840
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:22,810
<font size="36">As for me, it's like this.</font>

841
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:23,110
<font size="36">So cute.</font>

842
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:27,110
<font size="36">Sun-jun has already written it.</font>

843
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:27,410
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

844
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,710
<font size="36">We returned after room assignments...</font>

845
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:36,710
<font size="36">Hey.</font>

846
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,010
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

847
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:41,710
<font size="36">Shall we go here?</font>

848
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,910
<font size="36">Another space next to the common living room.</font>

849
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,010
<font size="36">Woah.</font>

850
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:58,010
<font size="36">Passing through the narrow hallway next to the living room, you'll find</font>

851
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,110
<font size="36">It has an atmosphere.</font>

852
00:44:59,110 --> 00:44:59,510
<font size="36">A bit</font>

853
00:45:00,217 --> 00:45:01,017
<font size="36">Classic feeling?</font>

854
00:45:02,487 --> 00:45:03,417
<font size="36">Woah, that place is beautiful.</font>

855
00:45:04,717 --> 00:45:05,797
<font size="36">Ah, I really like this place.</font>

856
00:45:06,117 --> 00:45:07,117
<font size="36">Hey, it's beautiful.</font>

857
00:45:09,657 --> 00:45:10,307
<font size="36">Woah!</font>

858
00:45:11,287 --> 00:45:12,657
<font size="36">There are also LPs. There are also LPs.</font>

859
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:14,237
<font size="36">Amazing.</font>

860
00:45:16,337 --> 00:45:16,837
<font size="36">It's beautiful.</font>

861
00:45:18,247 --> 00:45:18,847
<font size="36">Do you listen to these things often?</font>

862
00:45:19,367 --> 00:45:20,117
<font size="36">It's my first time seeing an LP.</font>

863
00:45:20,887 --> 00:45:21,347
<font size="36">Me too.</font>

864
00:45:22,437 --> 00:45:22,917
<font size="36">The atmosphere is so good.</font>

865
00:45:23,257 --> 00:45:24,607
<font size="36">What should we do? What will we do?</font>

866
00:45:26,967 --> 00:45:27,847
<font size="36">I don't know either.</font>

867
00:45:30,297 --> 00:45:30,897
<font size="36">Wow~</font>

868
00:45:32,307 --> 00:45:33,507
<font size="36">Shall we see if there's anything?</font>

869
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,947
<font size="36">Do you know Kim Hyun-sik?</font>

870
00:45:42,517 --> 00:45:43,347
<font size="36">I like him.</font>

871
00:45:45,527 --> 00:45:46,437
<font size="36">What's your favorite song?</font>

872
00:45:47,517 --> 00:45:49,817
<font size="36">I'm a bit into old songs.</font>

873
00:45:50,587 --> 00:45:51,107
<font size="36">Kim Kwang-seok.</font>

874
00:45:51,537 --> 00:45:51,807
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

875
00:45:52,147 --> 00:45:52,517
<font size="36">Yoo Jae-ha.</font>

876
00:45:52,637 --> 00:45:52,907
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

877
00:45:53,247 --> 00:45:54,007
<font size="36">Kim Hyun-sik.</font>

878
00:45:54,537 --> 00:45:55,537
<font size="36">People like that.</font>

879
00:45:56,007 --> 00:45:56,607
<font size="36">You know a bit about them.</font>

880
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:57,807
<font size="36">Of course.</font>

881
00:45:59,237 --> 00:46:00,127
<font size="36">Do you listen to pop music?</font>

882
00:46:00,847 --> 00:46:01,847
<font size="36">Absolutely love pop music.</font>

883
00:46:02,937 --> 00:46:03,787
<font size="36">Do you know this person? Elvis Presley?</font>

884
00:46:04,337 --> 00:46:05,007
<font size="36">Of course I know him.</font>

885
00:46:06,437 --> 00:46:07,137
<font size="36">He's a pop legend.</font>

886
00:46:07,467 --> 00:46:08,207
<font size="36">Oh, their tastes really match.</font>

887
00:46:08,467 --> 00:46:09,007
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

888
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,007
<font size="36">Oh, these two.</font>

889
00:46:10,737 --> 00:46:11,637
<font size="36">Similar tastes.</font>

890
00:46:11,737 --> 00:46:13,137
<font size="36">Tak-soo and Shin-hyang have similar tastes.</font>

891
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,137
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

892
00:46:17,227 --> 00:46:19,527
<font size="36">I really want to hear this song. Can't Help Falling in Love.</font>

893
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:19,827
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

894
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:20,727
<font size="36">This song is good.</font>

895
00:46:21,027 --> 00:46:21,527
<font size="36">It's famous.</font>

896
00:46:30,447 --> 00:46:31,147
<font size="36">This song, right?</font>

897
00:46:32,547 --> 00:46:32,847
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

898
00:46:33,847 --> 00:46:35,647
<font size="36">That's right. This song is really good.</font>

899
00:46:38,147 --> 00:46:39,447
<font size="36">Shall we enjoy this song together?</font>

900
00:46:40,147 --> 00:46:41,547
<font size="36">Because it's my favorite song.</font>

901
00:47:16,407 --> 00:47:18,207
<font size="36">Oh! What is it?</font>

902
00:47:18,907 --> 00:47:20,007
<font size="36">What is that eye contact, what is it.</font>

903
00:47:20,107 --> 00:47:20,507
<font size="36">Dad.</font>

904
00:47:21,007 --> 00:47:21,607
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

905
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:24,207
<font size="36">It's not eye contact, oh my...</font>

906
00:47:27,607 --> 00:47:31,607
<font size="36">Seems to like old things, old times. Even music...</font>

907
00:47:32,207 --> 00:47:33,807
<font size="36">Only listens to old music.</font>

908
00:47:34,507 --> 00:47:35,907
<font size="36">And Yoo Jae-ha.</font>

909
00:47:36,207 --> 00:47:39,107
<font size="36">All songs by singer Yoo Jae-ha.</font>

910
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,607
<font size="36">- As for Tak-soo
- Shin-hyang is very much</font>

911
00:47:44,107 --> 00:47:46,507
<font size="36">He even knows songs I don't know.</font>

912
00:47:47,107 --> 00:47:49,307
<font size="36">He even knows songs I don't know.</font>

913
00:47:49,907 --> 00:47:51,207
<font size="36">Those matched perfectly.</font>

914
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,207
<font size="36">Yes, I think the good impression has increased a bit compared to the beginning.</font>

915
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:18,222
<font size="36">Do you know U2, U2.</font>

916
00:48:18,782 --> 00:48:20,982
<font size="36">U2? You know U2?</font>

917
00:48:21,622 --> 00:48:24,102
<font size="36">How old are they? How old are they?</font>

918
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:28,232
<font size="36">Look for U2's song. I heard there's something in the mailbox.</font>

919
00:48:28,652 --> 00:48:29,122
<font size="36">Mailbox?</font>

920
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,452
<font size="36">What is it? So curious.</font>

921
00:48:31,982 --> 00:48:33,202
<font size="36">Let me go get it.</font>

922
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:35,332
<font size="36">Yes. Yes.</font>

923
00:48:46,482 --> 00:48:48,032
<font size="36">Shall we sit and watch? Yes.</font>

924
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,552
<font size="36">Ah. What is it?</font>

925
00:48:51,442 --> 00:48:53,222
<font size="36">Guidelines for grocery shopping, cooking, house decorating.</font>

926
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:55,442
<font size="36">Ah, grocery shopping, cooking, house decorating.</font>

927
00:48:55,442 --> 00:48:59,532
<font size="36">Divide into two-person teams and complete the task with your partner.</font>

928
00:49:00,632 --> 00:49:02,672
<font size="36">Note, same-sex individuals cannot be partners.</font>

929
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,632
<font size="36">Oh, Sun-jun, Sun-jun, the opportunity has arrived.</font>

930
00:49:05,982 --> 00:49:06,442
<font size="36">Opportunity.</font>

931
00:49:06,812 --> 00:49:12,918
<font size="36">Perhaps it should be two people for grocery shopping,
two people for cooking, and two people for decorating the house.</font>

932
00:49:12,928 --> 00:49:13,862
<font size="36">Grocery shopping.</font>

933
00:49:14,862 --> 00:49:18,532
<font size="36">As for me, cooking...</font>

934
00:49:19,282 --> 00:49:21,832
<font size="36">As long as it's not cooking, it's fine.</font>

935
00:49:22,452 --> 00:49:23,802
<font size="36">As for me, as long as it's not cooking, then...</font>

936
00:49:23,802 --> 00:49:24,352
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

937
00:49:25,352 --> 00:49:28,352
<font size="36">Then let me cook.</font>

938
00:49:28,352 --> 00:49:31,262
<font size="36">I don't know if I can do it.</font>

939
00:49:31,532 --> 00:49:32,662
<font size="36">Because it will help when you come back from shopping.</font>

940
00:49:33,142 --> 00:49:35,972
<font size="36">Sun-jun cooking is perfect! That's right. The cook</font>

941
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,682
<font size="36">Sun-jun, it's an opportunity to show off your skills.</font>

942
00:49:41,902 --> 00:49:48,132
<font size="36">Well, I usually cook, so I'll be on the cooking team.</font>

943
00:49:48,622 --> 00:49:49,822
<font size="36">Show off your abilities!</font>

944
00:49:50,062 --> 00:49:50,352
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

945
00:49:50,352 --> 00:49:50,742
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

946
00:49:51,152 --> 00:49:53,152
<font size="36">That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right. Show off your skills, show off your skills.</font>

947
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:55,142
<font size="36">I'll go grocery shopping. Grocery shopping.</font>

948
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,932
<font size="36">Oh. Who will go grocery shopping?</font>

949
00:50:07,352 --> 00:50:11,072
<font size="36">I'll go grocery shopping. I like going to the supermarket.</font>

950
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:13,352
<font size="36">That kid really hates going to the supermarket, though?</font>

951
00:50:14,032 --> 00:50:16,232
<font size="36">Shin-hyang. Does my daughter like going to the supermarket? She really hates it!!!</font>

952
00:50:16,632 --> 00:50:17,332
<font size="36">Does she really hate it?</font>

953
00:50:17,532 --> 00:50:18,732
<font size="36">As for me, I like going to the supermarket?</font>

954
00:50:18,732 --> 00:50:21,232
<font size="36">Yes. If I tell her to come along, she absolutely won't.</font>

955
00:50:21,232 --> 00:50:22,332
<font size="36">Aha.</font>

956
00:50:23,532 --> 00:50:26,332
<font size="36">I'll go grocery shopping. I like going to the supermarket.</font>

957
00:50:26,772 --> 00:50:28,052
<font size="36">Then I'll decorate the house.</font>

958
00:50:29,882 --> 00:50:33,372
<font size="36">Oh, cooking and looking at rooms, yes. House decorating.</font>

959
00:50:33,372 --> 00:50:34,732
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

960
00:50:36,632 --> 00:50:40,032
<font size="36">Among them, honestly, I want to work with Tak-soo the most.</font>

961
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:41,532
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

962
00:50:42,932 --> 00:50:44,232
<font size="36">Ah, I see.</font>

963
00:50:45,732 --> 00:50:47,932
<font size="36">I feel a bit regretful.</font>

964
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:54,432
<font size="36">I thought I should talk more after knowing I had chosen and become a pair.</font>

965
00:50:54,932 --> 00:50:59,132
<font size="36">I think that's the person I wanted to talk to the most.</font>

966
00:50:59,732 --> 00:51:02,432
<font size="36">See! See, brother!</font>

967
00:51:03,732 --> 00:51:06,632
<font size="36">First impressions aren't necessary! You don't know first impressions.</font>

968
00:51:06,824 --> 00:51:07,954
<font size="36">Hey. No.</font>

969
00:51:08,554 --> 00:51:10,314
<font size="36">Tak-soo is Su-wan, though...</font>

970
00:51:11,284 --> 00:51:11,684
<font size="36">Woah.</font>

971
00:51:14,244 --> 00:51:14,774
<font size="36">So, shall we go?</font>

972
00:51:15,324 --> 00:51:16,094
<font size="36">Goodbye.</font>

973
00:51:16,454 --> 00:51:17,194
<font size="36">Go carefully.</font>

974
00:51:19,504 --> 00:51:20,634
<font size="36">You can get in here. This one?</font>

975
00:51:21,924 --> 00:51:22,424
<font size="36">Go first.</font>

976
00:51:24,234 --> 00:51:25,484
<font size="36">Oh, that's right. So friendly.</font>

977
00:51:26,504 --> 00:51:28,684
<font size="36">Even though it's just called a 'mini-date', this is the first date.</font>

978
00:51:31,384 --> 00:51:32,684
<font size="36">So fun. It's like traveling.</font>

979
00:51:33,314 --> 00:51:34,354
<font size="36">No, driving from the back seat?</font>

980
00:51:34,684 --> 00:51:36,254
<font size="36">I'm not very good at driving, haven't tried it yet.</font>

981
00:51:36,254 --> 00:51:38,254
<font size="36">Ah, haven't tried it yet. Ah, yes.</font>

982
00:51:39,874 --> 00:51:40,684
<font size="36">Please hold me back.</font>

983
00:51:41,194 --> 00:51:42,254
<font size="36">Yes? Please hold me back.</font>

984
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:44,564
<font size="36">So I don't clear everything out... I'm not even sure if I can hold myself back.</font>

985
00:51:44,964 --> 00:51:45,564
<font size="36">Oh, no way.</font>

986
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,304
<font size="36">You like Yoo Jae-ha, I find that even more amazing.</font>

987
00:51:49,814 --> 00:51:50,584
<font size="36">I absolutely love Yoo Jae-ha.</font>

988
00:51:51,254 --> 00:51:53,254
<font size="36">I listened to it in my twenties. It comforted me a lot.</font>

989
00:51:53,254 --> 00:51:53,794
<font size="36">It's comforting.</font>

990
00:51:55,984 --> 00:51:56,784
<font size="36">Do you like musicals too?</font>

991
00:51:57,974 --> 00:51:58,574
<font size="36">Absolutely love musicals.</font>

992
00:51:58,984 --> 00:51:59,684
<font size="36">You like them?</font>

993
00:51:59,684 --> 00:51:59,784
<font size="36">Me too.</font>

994
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:01,684
<font size="36">I also like musical movies.</font>

995
00:52:01,984 --> 00:52:02,484
<font size="36">Hmm, me too.</font>

996
00:52:02,984 --> 00:52:04,484
<font size="36">I really like music films.</font>

997
00:52:04,684 --> 00:52:05,484
<font size="36">"Sing Street"!</font>

998
00:52:08,574 --> 00:52:09,574
<font size="36">I really like "Sing Street".</font>

999
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:14,184
<font size="36">Shin-hyang is reacting a bit too much, isn't she?</font>

1000
00:52:14,984 --> 00:52:15,684
<font size="36">Dad, Dad!</font>

1001
00:52:15,684 --> 00:52:17,984
<font size="36">Shin-hyang is reacting a bit too much, isn't she? (Shin-hyang)
(Is this a common reaction?)</font>

1002
00:52:18,784 --> 00:52:19,484
<font size="36">It's my first time seeing it.</font>

1003
00:52:21,584 --> 00:52:23,484
<font size="36">Ah, I'm very sensitive now because of my daughter.</font>

1004
00:52:24,984 --> 00:52:27,184
<font size="36">I'm listening to all the OSTs of "Sing Street".</font>

1005
00:52:28,584 --> 00:52:30,484
<font size="36">Up. That song 'Up' is really good.</font>

1006
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:32,184
<font size="36">That's my life movie. My life movie.</font>

1007
00:52:32,784 --> 00:52:34,184
<font size="36">This is the first time I've seen someone talk about "Sing Street".</font>

1008
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:34,884
<font size="36">Really?</font>

1009
00:52:35,584 --> 00:52:37,684
<font size="36">The last song for me is truly...</font>

1010
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:39,884
<font size="36">It's really good.</font>

1011
00:52:40,784 --> 00:52:41,884
<font size="36">There's a lot to talk about here, isn't there?</font>

1012
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,184
<font size="36">Wait. "Sing Street"?</font>

1013
00:52:45,284 --> 00:52:47,184
<font size="36">You two can really talk so smoothly here.</font>

1014
00:52:47,184 --> 00:52:48,484
<font size="36">Hey, they're so compatible.</font>

1015
00:52:50,984 --> 00:52:51,484
<font size="36">Ocean.</font>

1016
00:52:52,984 --> 00:52:55,884
<font size="36">You have to look closely into their eyes. You have to keep looking today. Just like this.</font>

1017
00:52:56,784 --> 00:52:58,884
<font size="36">If you look like this, you'll really see more clearly. Really?</font>

1018
00:53:00,984 --> 00:53:01,484
<font size="36">Let me try.</font>

1019
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:06,484
<font size="36">It feels like looking through binoculars, I think it has that feeling too.</font>

1020
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:06,884
<font size="36">Seriously?</font>

1021
00:53:08,984 --> 00:53:10,684
<font size="36">Oh, just immature... Just immature.</font>

1022
00:53:11,284 --> 00:53:13,484
<font size="36">That's right. Oh, cute and just like that.</font>

1023
00:53:28,784 --> 00:53:30,784
<font size="36">What should we buy first? Meat? Asparagus?</font>

1024
00:53:31,784 --> 00:53:32,784
<font size="36">That... that's not it, is it?</font>

1025
00:53:34,284 --> 00:53:35,184
<font size="36">Oh! Yes.</font>

1026
00:53:35,784 --> 00:53:36,484
<font size="36">We already bought asparagus.</font>

1027
00:53:37,784 --> 00:53:38,184
<font size="36">Then...</font>

1028
00:53:39,284 --> 00:53:39,884
<font size="36">Oh, mushrooms are here.</font>

1029
00:53:41,584 --> 00:53:42,484
<font size="36">Shredded green onions? I wonder if they'll eat it?</font>

1030
00:53:43,284 --> 00:53:44,484
<font size="36">I'll get a red lettuce.</font>

1031
00:53:45,584 --> 00:53:48,056
<font size="36">Sausages... sausages... which sausage is good?</font>

1032
00:53:48,156 --> 00:53:48,556
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1033
00:53:48,584 --> 00:53:49,590
<font size="36">Which one is good?</font>

1034
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:51,484
<font size="36">Huh? But oh, have you started speaking informally already?</font>

1035
00:53:51,984 --> 00:53:53,184
<font size="36">Onion? Gotta buy onion. Onion?</font>

1036
00:53:53,184 --> 00:53:55,484
<font size="36">From the onion. Oh, didn't we see the onions on this side?</font>

1037
00:53:55,984 --> 00:53:56,684
<font size="36">They're starting to speak informally, aren't they?</font>

1038
00:53:57,584 --> 00:53:58,884
<font size="36">They must have gotten close quickly.</font>

1039
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:01,484
<font size="36">Suddenly speaking informally.</font>

1040
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:03,666
<font size="36">Suddenly speaking informally.</font>

1041
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:06,666
<font size="36">When grocery shopping...</font>

1042
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:09,666
<font size="36">Suddenly speaking informally to me?</font>

1043
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:14,666
<font size="36">Seriously... I don't know why they're speaking informally. First time...</font>

1044
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:16,666
<font size="36">This is really delicious.</font>

1045
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,666
<font size="36">Let's buy one. Chicken is good.</font>

1046
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:21,690
<font size="36">To buy or not to buy? What should we do?</font>

1047
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:25,290
<font size="36">I trust you. I'll follow your choice.</font>

1048
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:28,923
<font size="36">But saying 'you' like that, isn't that flirting?!</font>

1049
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:30,666
<font size="36">They just met and it's already 'you'.</font>

1050
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:34,666
<font size="36">No, even the kids say that.</font>

1051
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:35,666
<font size="36">Kids can be like that...</font>

1052
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:39,666
<font size="36">They don't know each other's ages. Because they don't know their ages, they should be more polite.</font>

1053
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:42,623
<font size="36">It's not informal speech. You're wrong. What 'you'?</font>

1054
00:54:42,723 --> 00:54:43,856
<font size="36">It's not 'you' level yet?</font>

1055
00:54:43,956 --> 00:54:44,956
<font size="36">No way!</font>

1056
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:46,666
<font size="36">So call them 'jagi' (darling)?</font>

1057
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:47,666
<font size="36">Call them 'jagi' (darling)?</font>

1058
00:54:47,723 --> 00:54:48,590
<font size="36">Besides 'you', what do you call them?</font>

1059
00:54:48,666 --> 00:54:50,623
<font size="36">Well, you call them Shin-hyang-ssi.</font>

1060
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:51,666
<font size="36">Ah, Shin-hyang-ssi...</font>

1061
00:54:51,723 --> 00:54:52,590
<font size="36">They just met.</font>

1062
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:55,390
<font size="36">They just bought one onion and it's already 'you', what's wrong with that.</font>

1063
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:57,990
<font size="36">Is Tak-soo disrespectful...?</font>

1064
00:54:58,556 --> 00:54:59,423
<font size="36">Sorry.</font>

1065
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:02,190
<font size="36">Sorry. Sorry. Oh my, what, what...</font>

1066
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:03,257
<font size="36">Sorry.</font>

1067
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:04,667
<font size="36">Hey... I didn't raise him like that...</font>

1068
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:10,666
<font size="36">Just normally? Shall we buy this?</font>

1069
00:55:11,756 --> 00:55:12,589
<font size="36">Okay.</font>

1070
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:14,666
<font size="36">Let's go.</font>

1071
00:55:15,666 --> 00:55:16,923
<font size="36">But it seems it's not here?</font>

1072
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:18,656
<font size="36">Yeah, try going to the opposite side.</font>

1073
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:22,666
<font size="36">It's full. Oh.</font>

1074
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:25,666
<font size="36">You're here again.</font>

1075
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:26,666
<font size="36">This is here.</font>

1076
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:27,666
<font size="36">Almost.</font>

1077
00:55:27,666 --> 00:55:29,666
<font size="36">They'll probably touch hands, right?</font>

1078
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:30,666
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

1079
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:31,666
<font size="36">They touched once already.</font>

1080
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,666
<font size="36">Rice, grain...</font>

1081
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,666
<font size="36">They'll touch, they'll touch, they'll touch, they'll touch! They'll touch!</font>

1082
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:41,666
<font size="36">Oh, hey, hey!</font>

1083
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:42,666
<font size="36">Hey, no!</font>

1084
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:44,666
<font size="36">Hey... no...!!!</font>

1085
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:48,666
<font size="36">They'll touch! They touched already!</font>

1086
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:50,666
<font size="36">They touched already, they just touched.</font>

1087
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:51,666
<font size="36">Just a light touch.</font>

1088
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:52,666
<font size="36">Brother, they just touched.</font>

1089
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:53,666
<font size="36">VAR, VAR. It seems they touched.</font>

1090
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:55,666
<font size="36">Shin-hyang keeps getting closer.</font>

1091
00:55:56,666 --> 00:55:57,666
<font size="36">No, but Shin-hyang did it first! First, first!</font>

1092
00:55:57,666 --> 00:55:58,666
<font size="36">First, first.</font>

1093
00:55:58,666 --> 00:55:59,666
<font size="36">Why is it like this, like this.</font>

1094
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:00,666
<font size="36">What to do.</font>

1095
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:03,666
<font size="36">Seriously, brother. Shin-hyang is draining energy.</font>

1096
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:06,666
<font size="36">Oh... speechless...</font>

1097
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:08,666
<font size="36">Truly terrible.</font>

1098
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:12,666
<font size="36">Oh, Su-wan. Jun-ho.</font>

1099
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,666
<font size="36">We seem to have to decorate the rooftop up there.</font>

1100
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:17,666
<font size="36">Oh, really?</font>

1101
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,666
<font size="36">Woah, my slippers are so hot.</font>

1102
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:24,666
<font size="36">What, the phone isn't exploding, is it?</font>

1103
00:56:24,666 --> 00:56:25,666
<font size="36">Oh, really?</font>

1104
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:28,666
<font size="36">After installing the camping table and chairs...</font>

1105
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:31,666
<font size="36">Ah, installing this...</font>

1106
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:32,666
<font size="36">Ah...</font>

1107
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:40,156
<font size="36">We can just leave it here, right?</font>

1108
00:56:40,566 --> 00:56:41,956
<font size="36">Leave it here?</font>

1109
00:56:42,056 --> 00:56:43,823
<font size="36">Ah, next to the wall? Is that right?</font>

1110
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:46,666
<font size="36">They're still speaking very politely here, using honorifics.</font>

1111
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:49,956
<font size="36">Su-wan didn't speak informally first.</font>

1112
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:53,666
<font size="36">Will it be like this...?</font>

1113
00:56:58,666 --> 00:56:59,666
<font size="36">Jeon Su-wan...!</font>

1114
00:57:09,684 --> 00:57:11,204
<font size="36">This place is really just for working.</font>

1115
00:57:11,954 --> 00:57:13,844
<font size="36">Otherwise, talk while you work.</font>

1116
00:57:14,654 --> 00:57:16,014
<font size="36">This isn't 'Experience Life' reality show, you know.</font>

1117
00:57:16,844 --> 00:57:17,294
<font size="36">Oh, well.</font>

1118
00:57:21,484 --> 00:57:22,484
<font size="36">Woah, it's really hot.</font>

1119
00:57:22,924 --> 00:57:23,774
<font size="36">Woah, it's really hot.</font>

1120
00:57:24,454 --> 00:57:25,964
<font size="36">Woah, it's really hot. Ah, it's too hot.</font>

1121
00:57:28,624 --> 00:57:29,814
<font size="36">It's a dating show, you know.</font>

1122
00:57:35,874 --> 00:57:37,014
<font size="36">Oh...</font>

1123
00:57:38,574 --> 00:57:38,964
<font size="36">There's nothing.</font>

1124
00:57:39,194 --> 00:57:39,874
<font size="36">Hmm...</font>

1125
00:57:40,014 --> 00:57:40,384
<font size="36">There's nothing.</font>

1126
00:57:40,754 --> 00:57:41,014
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1127
00:57:42,014 --> 00:57:42,984
<font size="36">It seems there's nothing.</font>

1128
00:57:46,244 --> 00:57:50,014
<font size="36">Because it's too hot, I'm a bit tired.</font>

1129
00:57:51,254 --> 00:57:54,514
<font size="36">Just standing for about 10 minutes and I'm drenched in sweat.</font>

1130
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:58,834
<font size="36">Because it's too hot, I don't feel any flutter at all.</font>

1131
00:58:00,554 --> 00:58:01,654
<font size="36">Ah... The weather is wrong...</font>

1132
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:03,554
<font size="36">I should have just taken a shower instead.</font>

1133
00:58:04,594 --> 00:58:05,984
<font size="36">Why did I get caught up in that...</font>

1134
00:58:07,324 --> 00:58:08,554
<font size="36">These guys are so funny haha</font>

1135
00:58:12,584 --> 00:58:13,844
<font size="36">Now, Sun-jun and Sa-yoon.</font>

1136
00:58:15,574 --> 00:58:16,524
<font size="36">Do you cook often?</font>

1137
00:58:17,504 --> 00:58:19,814
<font size="36">Yes, I can't make things like soybean paste stew or kimchi stew.</font>

1138
00:58:20,304 --> 00:58:21,004
<font size="36">Hmm...</font>

1139
00:58:22,564 --> 00:58:23,504
<font size="36">Just processing ingredients.</font>

1140
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,004
<font size="36">Just processing ingredients. Not really cooking.</font>

1141
00:58:26,684 --> 00:58:27,854
<font size="36">Sun-jun seems too shy.</font>

1142
00:58:28,864 --> 00:58:31,544
<font size="36">Sun-jun's first impression was Sa-yoon.</font>

1143
00:58:32,894 --> 00:58:34,814
<font size="36">Ah, it might get ruined.</font>

1144
00:58:36,524 --> 00:58:37,014
<font size="36">What to do?</font>

1145
00:58:37,894 --> 00:58:38,504
<font size="36">Hmm...</font>

1146
00:58:39,504 --> 00:58:42,014
<font size="36">Earlier, I saw fried shrimp, so</font>

1147
00:58:43,594 --> 00:58:44,004
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1148
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:45,004
<font size="36">Fried food...</font>

1149
00:58:45,874 --> 00:58:46,804
<font size="36">Ten-don?</font>

1150
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:48,004
<font size="36">Ten-don? Oh my goodness.</font>

1151
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:48,814
<font size="36">Oh my goodness.</font>

1152
00:58:49,274 --> 00:58:50,504
<font size="36">Because there are enough ingredients...</font>

1153
00:58:50,504 --> 00:58:51,004
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1154
00:58:51,614 --> 00:58:53,844
<font size="36">Then let's just make a little, okay?</font>

1155
00:58:54,274 --> 00:58:54,994
<font size="36">That's good.</font>

1156
00:58:55,004 --> 00:58:55,844
<font size="36">Oh~ Good choice!</font>

1157
00:58:56,584 --> 00:58:57,514
<font size="36">No, Ten-don over there?</font>

1158
00:58:57,894 --> 00:58:59,534
<font size="36">Making the Ten-don dish that appeared in "Black & White Chef".</font>

1159
00:58:59,534 --> 00:59:00,534
<font size="36">Ah, Ten-don. Hey.</font>

1160
00:59:02,294 --> 00:59:08,804
<font size="36">(By cooking) I want to show my charm and make a really decent dish.</font>

1161
00:59:09,294 --> 00:59:13,054
<font size="36">I bought ingredients and tools to practice making Ten-don.</font>

1162
00:59:13,844 --> 00:59:17,234
<font size="36">It seems I've learned those tricks.</font>

1163
00:59:17,874 --> 00:59:20,054
<font size="36">I was taught by a Ten-don master.</font>

1164
00:59:23,884 --> 00:59:25,054
<font size="36">Even brought all the tools.</font>

1165
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:26,114
<font size="36">Ah, he brought everything himself.</font>

1166
00:59:26,634 --> 00:59:27,054
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1167
00:59:29,894 --> 00:59:31,244
<font size="36">We have to prepare the ingredients, right?</font>

1168
00:59:31,854 --> 00:59:32,104
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1169
00:59:33,104 --> 00:59:34,524
<font size="36">How should we cut the green onions?</font>

1170
00:59:35,594 --> 00:59:37,514
<font size="36">Just... cut them small?</font>

1171
00:59:37,864 --> 00:59:39,054
<font size="36">Cut them small.</font>

1172
00:59:40,254 --> 00:59:40,804
<font size="36">About this much?</font>

1173
00:59:40,804 --> 00:59:41,054
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1174
00:59:41,054 --> 00:59:41,514
<font size="36">Small?</font>

1175
00:59:41,514 --> 00:59:42,054
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1176
00:59:42,054 --> 00:59:42,254
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1177
00:59:43,624 --> 00:59:44,114
<font size="36">A bit</font>

1178
00:59:44,594 --> 00:59:45,114
<font size="36">Let me try.</font>

1179
00:59:48,894 --> 00:59:49,824
<font size="36">Cut it all the way here?</font>

1180
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:50,284
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1181
00:59:50,584 --> 00:59:50,844
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1182
00:59:52,574 --> 00:59:53,054
<font size="36">This one</font>

1183
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:54,054
<font size="36">First of all</font>

1184
00:59:54,594 --> 00:59:55,054
<font size="36">Ah,</font>

1185
00:59:55,054 --> 00:59:55,844
<font size="36">Dangerous. Dangerous.</font>

1186
00:59:55,844 --> 00:59:56,814
<font size="36">Hold hands.</font>

1187
00:59:57,054 --> 00:59:57,844
<font size="36">What to do, what to do, what to do</font>

1188
00:59:59,154 --> 00:59:59,814
<font size="36">Oh, Sun-jun!</font>

1189
01:00:00,019 --> 01:00:01,009
<font size="36">Sun-jun, it's okay.</font>

1190
01:00:01,429 --> 01:00:03,639
<font size="36">Sun-jun, it's okay. It's like I'm okay.</font>

1191
01:00:04,709 --> 01:00:06,629
<font size="36">He's just a kid. Ah, seeing him so worried is so cute.</font>

1192
01:00:11,209 --> 01:00:12,359
<font size="36">You just do your thing.</font>

1193
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:14,689
<font size="36">Ah... you don't trust me, do you?</font>

1194
01:00:15,269 --> 01:00:15,819
<font size="36">No, no...</font>

1195
01:00:18,569 --> 01:00:22,729
<font size="36">For Sa-yoon, this situation is unfamiliar, so</font>

1196
01:00:24,479 --> 01:00:28,099
<font size="36">At first, she seemed very tense, didn't know what to do?</font>

1197
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:33,439
<font size="36">It used to be like that, but now... online, when encountering such a situation,</font>

1198
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,759
<font size="36">Praise them a lot.</font>

1199
01:00:38,489 --> 01:00:40,789
<font size="36">I remembered what I had seen.</font>

1200
01:00:42,509 --> 01:00:44,399
<font size="36">Ah, this is how you learn to date.</font>

1201
01:00:44,869 --> 01:00:46,169
<font size="36">Why prepare so many things?</font>

1202
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:47,689
<font size="36">Learned it online again.</font>

1203
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:55,759
<font size="36">Look, look. He's never tried it before.</font>

1204
01:00:56,889 --> 01:00:58,259
<font size="36">Oh... That's right.</font>

1205
01:00:58,489 --> 01:00:58,639
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1206
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:00,299
<font size="36">Huh? (What's right...?)</font>

1207
01:01:01,899 --> 01:01:02,699
<font size="36">Doing well, aren't they?</font>

1208
01:01:03,579 --> 01:01:04,289
<font size="36">Thank goodness.</font>

1209
01:01:06,379 --> 01:01:07,359
<font size="36">Huh? It's spinning?</font>

1210
01:01:09,109 --> 01:01:09,779
<font size="36">It's cold, though?</font>

1211
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,399
<font size="36">It's spinning! Oh~</font>

1212
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:15,199
<font size="36">So good with machines.</font>

1213
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:15,859
<font size="36">Almost there</font>

1214
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:21,729
<font size="36">Ah, I, I am Sun-jun!</font>

1215
01:01:22,699 --> 01:01:24,099
<font size="36">I've decided. Choose Sun-jun.</font>

1216
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:27,509
<font size="36">Isn't that an exaggerated compliment? No, Sun-jun. Ah, I really like it.</font>

1217
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:32,009
<font size="36">In the end, whether it's fixing that, or assembling that... He just wants to praise at all costs.</font>

1218
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:38,789
<font size="36">It's an apron!</font>

1219
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:42,119
<font size="36">Do you want to wear this apron?</font>

1220
01:01:44,399 --> 01:01:46,359
<font size="36">Just for fun. Oh, it's good, isn't it?</font>

1221
01:01:47,569 --> 01:01:50,799
<font size="36">This... Ah, let me tie it for you. Oh, yes. Thank you.</font>

1222
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:53,579
<font size="36">Oh, this string... Oh, that's right.</font>

1223
01:02:14,379 --> 01:02:17,251
<font size="36">Done. Thank you.</font>

1224
01:02:17,261 --> 01:02:18,239
<font size="36">Let me do it for you...</font>

1225
01:02:19,499 --> 01:02:20,589
<font size="36">Oh, doing it for each other.</font>

1226
01:02:23,549 --> 01:02:26,009
<font size="36">Why is it so long? Looks like a coat?</font>

1227
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:30,379
<font size="36">Oh, it's self-acting... Yes. Ah, like this?</font>

1228
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:33,199
<font size="36">Mhm. That's right. Oh.</font>

1229
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:40,199
<font size="36">Having someone tie an apron for me and me tying one for someone else,</font>

1230
01:02:40,869 --> 01:02:42,599
<font size="36">That's not a common thing, right?</font>

1231
01:02:47,399 --> 01:02:54,709
<font size="36">So, it was my first time experiencing that, um... I think I felt a bit flustered.</font>

1232
01:02:56,609 --> 01:02:58,509
<font size="36">What to do, what to do. What is it? So cute, you two are so cute.</font>

1233
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,009
<font size="36">So cute. They're almost in-laws for real.</font>

1234
01:03:04,775 --> 01:03:06,885
<font size="36">Sun-jun taught all (the cooking methods).</font>

1235
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:12,295
<font size="36">Basically, he's a very kind and meticulous person.</font>

1236
01:03:12,545 --> 01:03:14,865
<font size="36">I think he's very trustworthy.</font>

1237
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:17,345
<font size="36">Ah. Ah, that's right.</font>

1238
01:03:18,145 --> 01:03:19,275
<font size="36">Ah, of course. Of course.</font>

1239
01:03:19,575 --> 01:03:20,975
<font size="36">Son-in-law Ahn, of course!</font>

1240
01:03:26,966 --> 01:03:27,466
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1241
01:03:27,866 --> 01:03:28,366
<font size="36">Hurry up.</font>

1242
01:03:28,866 --> 01:03:29,366
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1243
01:03:30,066 --> 01:03:30,966
<font size="36">No, the apron</font>

1244
01:03:32,566 --> 01:03:33,366
<font size="36">So cute.</font>

1245
01:03:34,866 --> 01:03:35,366
<font size="36">So cute.</font>

1246
01:03:36,566 --> 01:03:37,566
<font size="36">Ah, ah, it's polite. It's polite.</font>

1247
01:03:37,866 --> 01:03:38,366
<font size="36">Ah, Yi Tak-soo.</font>

1248
01:03:38,866 --> 01:03:39,566
<font size="36">Just basic, just basic!</font>

1249
01:03:39,866 --> 01:03:40,366
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1250
01:03:42,866 --> 01:03:43,566
<font size="36">Ah, we...</font>

1251
01:03:44,066 --> 01:03:44,366
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1252
01:03:44,866 --> 01:03:46,866
<font size="36">Actually, I've already prepared Ten-don.</font>

1253
01:03:46,966 --> 01:03:47,366
<font size="36">Oh, that's right.</font>

1254
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:48,866
<font size="36">Ten-don?</font>

1255
01:03:49,166 --> 01:03:51,366
<font size="36">Wow. You've prepared to make Ten-don?</font>

1256
01:03:51,866 --> 01:03:52,366
<font size="36">That's amazing.</font>

1257
01:03:52,566 --> 01:03:55,566
<font size="36">Even brought the pot, thermometer, and breadcrumbs...</font>

1258
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:57,366
<font size="36">Even made the rice himself.</font>

1259
01:03:57,566 --> 01:03:57,866
<font size="36">No,</font>

1260
01:03:58,866 --> 01:03:59,366
<font size="36">Wow, that's amazing.</font>

1261
01:03:59,866 --> 01:04:00,366
<font size="36">Chef...</font>

1262
01:04:00,866 --> 01:04:01,566
<font size="36">Truly a chef.</font>

1263
01:04:01,866 --> 01:04:03,366
<font size="36">So delicious, chef.</font>

1264
01:04:04,366 --> 01:04:05,566
<font size="36">Oh, it's this good.</font>

1265
01:04:06,366 --> 01:04:07,566
<font size="36">Showing off charm. The likability rating will definitely soar.</font>

1266
01:04:07,866 --> 01:04:09,366
<font size="36">Wow, now's the time to show off your charm.</font>

1267
01:04:09,866 --> 01:04:10,866
<font size="36">My son is doing great!</font>

1268
01:04:11,166 --> 01:04:12,166
<font size="36">Sun-jun is on a roll.</font>

1269
01:04:12,866 --> 01:04:14,566
<font size="36">Hey, if this dish is delicious, then it's amazing...</font>

1270
01:04:14,866 --> 01:04:15,366
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1271
01:04:24,866 --> 01:04:25,166
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

1272
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:26,566
<font size="36">Gardenia powder? What is gardenia powder?</font>

1273
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:28,366
<font size="36">That's the secret. That's</font>

1274
01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:30,866
<font size="36">Adding gardenia powder makes the (fried batter) yellow.</font>

1275
01:04:31,366 --> 01:04:33,366
<font size="36">And it also removes the fishy smell, and it fries very well.</font>

1276
01:04:33,866 --> 01:04:34,866
<font size="36">He taught very well.</font>

1277
01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:35,566
<font size="36">Ah, that's a good tip.</font>

1278
01:04:40,566 --> 01:04:42,366
<font size="36">Oh, but the oil might splash out so...</font>

1279
01:04:42,566 --> 01:04:43,366
<font size="36">Yes. Ah, yes.</font>

1280
01:04:43,866 --> 01:04:44,866
<font size="36">Oh, be careful.</font>

1281
01:04:45,366 --> 01:04:46,366
<font size="36">Oh, I'm fine.</font>

1282
01:04:47,866 --> 01:04:48,866
<font size="36">They're like newlyweds.</font>

1283
01:04:49,366 --> 01:04:49,866
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1284
01:04:50,366 --> 01:04:51,566
<font size="36">No, it's like visiting a new home.</font>

1285
01:04:52,866 --> 01:04:53,566
<font size="36">Isn't it now?</font>

1286
01:04:59,166 --> 01:04:59,566
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1287
01:05:00,366 --> 01:05:01,166
<font size="36">Really professional.</font>

1288
01:05:01,366 --> 01:05:02,866
<font size="36">Doing so well. Hey, so cool.</font>

1289
01:05:04,566 --> 01:05:05,366
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1290
01:05:10,566 --> 01:05:11,166
<font size="36">Hey, so delicious.</font>

1291
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,366
<font size="36">Fried food must be delicious.</font>

1292
01:05:18,366 --> 01:05:19,366
<font size="36">Oh, is plating important?</font>

1293
01:05:19,866 --> 01:05:20,366
<font size="36">Plating?</font>

1294
01:05:20,866 --> 01:05:22,366
<font size="36">To make the shrimp stand up like this.</font>

1295
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:23,166
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1296
01:05:23,866 --> 01:05:24,366
<font size="36">Seaweed powder?</font>

1297
01:05:24,866 --> 01:05:26,366
<font size="36">Yes, just sprinkle a little.</font>

1298
01:05:26,866 --> 01:05:27,366
<font size="36">Oh, really?</font>

1299
01:05:27,366 --> 01:05:27,566
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1300
01:05:30,866 --> 01:05:31,366
<font size="36">Here you go.</font>

1301
01:05:31,866 --> 01:05:32,366
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

1302
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:37,566
<font size="36">Yes, it's done.</font>

1303
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:41,866
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1304
01:05:43,366 --> 01:05:44,166
<font size="36">Oh, delicious, so delicious.</font>

1305
01:05:44,866 --> 01:05:45,866
<font size="36">It looks so appetizing.</font>

1306
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:48,166
<font size="36">Ah, I think he's shown his charm.</font>

1307
01:05:48,366 --> 01:05:48,866
<font size="36">Oh, well done.</font>

1308
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:49,566
<font size="36">Showing off charm.</font>

1309
01:05:50,366 --> 01:05:51,866
<font size="36">Doing better than expected.</font>

1310
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:52,366
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1311
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:54,566
<font size="36">Enjoy your meal.</font>

1312
01:05:54,566 --> 01:05:55,366
<font size="36">Enjoy your meal.</font>

1313
01:05:55,366 --> 01:05:56,366
<font size="36">Enjoy your meal.</font>

1314
01:05:57,566 --> 01:05:58,566
<font size="36">It's truly amazing.</font>

1315
01:05:58,866 --> 01:05:59,366
<font size="36">Seriously.</font>

1316
01:06:03,366 --> 01:06:04,366
<font size="36">Now, I wonder what the reaction will be.</font>

1317
01:06:04,866 --> 01:06:06,166
<font size="36">Now it's Sun-jun's moment.</font>

1318
01:06:12,694 --> 01:06:13,724
<font size="36">Amazing Ten-don</font>

1319
01:06:13,954 --> 01:06:14,464
<font size="36">So delicious.</font>

1320
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:16,684
<font size="36">The perilla leaf is really delicious.</font>

1321
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:17,654
<font size="36">So crispy.</font>

1322
01:06:18,144 --> 01:06:18,594
<font size="36">So delicious.</font>

1323
01:06:23,484 --> 01:06:24,984
<font size="36">My son did a great job! "That's right~!</font>

1324
01:06:26,994 --> 01:06:27,784
<font size="36">Wow, it's really delicious.</font>

1325
01:06:28,104 --> 01:06:29,324
<font size="36">Ah, it's really delicious. Ah, it's truly delicious.</font>

1326
01:06:30,494 --> 01:06:31,484
<font size="36">Completely crispy and</font>

1327
01:06:31,814 --> 01:06:32,234
<font size="36">So delicious.</font>

1328
01:06:32,354 --> 01:06:34,654
<font size="36">The fried batter is really... like store-bought.</font>

1329
01:06:35,064 --> 01:06:35,304
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1330
01:06:36,114 --> 01:06:36,704
<font size="36">Thank goodness.</font>

1331
01:06:39,904 --> 01:06:42,494
<font size="36">Everyone keeps praising how delicious it is.</font>

1332
01:06:43,464 --> 01:06:46,264
<font size="36">The reaction was so good, so anyway... thank goodness.</font>

1333
01:06:46,974 --> 01:06:47,654
<font size="36">Well done, my son~!</font>

1334
01:06:48,244 --> 01:06:49,324
<font size="36">Ah, my son did a great job.</font>

1335
01:06:49,994 --> 01:06:51,044
<font size="36">That's doing well.</font>

1336
01:06:52,054 --> 01:06:53,454
<font size="36">Sun-jun is showing extremely strong appeal here.</font>

1337
01:06:53,994 --> 01:06:55,894
<font size="36">Seriously. Everyone is paying attention now.</font>

1338
01:06:58,824 --> 01:06:59,754
<font size="36">So what about dessert?</font>

1339
01:07:00,494 --> 01:07:01,154
<font size="36">Have to eat it.</font>

1340
01:07:03,324 --> 01:07:03,784
<font size="36">Oh, thank you.</font>

1341
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:06,554
<font size="36">Almost disappointed. Wow.</font>

1342
01:07:11,584 --> 01:07:11,994
<font size="36">Mmm~</font>

1343
01:07:12,354 --> 01:07:12,964
<font size="36">So delicious.</font>

1344
01:07:14,194 --> 01:07:14,954
<font size="36">So delicious.</font>

1345
01:07:15,954 --> 01:07:18,944
<font size="36">When I was little, my dad used to buy *Gather every day.</font>

1346
01:07:19,174 --> 01:07:19,404
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1347
01:07:20,844 --> 01:07:21,824
<font size="36">As for me, *Baskin Robbins.</font>

1348
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:22,804
<font size="36">Oh...</font>

1349
01:07:23,844 --> 01:07:24,274
<font size="36">Oh...</font>

1350
01:07:24,824 --> 01:07:25,244
<font size="36">Oh...</font>

1351
01:07:25,844 --> 01:07:26,554
<font size="36">An expensive one?</font>

1352
01:07:27,514 --> 01:07:29,144
<font size="36">Now this... my dad...</font>

1353
01:07:29,544 --> 01:07:29,884
<font size="36">Unexpected</font>

1354
01:07:30,474 --> 01:07:30,874
<font size="36">No...</font>

1355
01:07:31,194 --> 01:07:31,744
<font size="36">Ah, what, what...</font>

1356
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:35,114
<font size="36">Tak-soo, stop it.</font>

1357
01:07:35,974 --> 01:07:37,484
<font size="36">What about the one who bought *Gather~</font>

1358
01:07:39,874 --> 01:07:42,054
<font size="36">I can buy *Baskin Robbins too!</font>

1359
01:07:44,124 --> 01:07:44,854
<font size="36">There's even a bomb.</font>

1360
01:07:45,934 --> 01:07:46,784
<font size="36">*Gather is more delicious!</font>

1361
01:07:47,644 --> 01:07:48,574
<font size="36">I also like *Gather...</font>

1362
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,584
<font size="36">Mmm~ So delicious.</font>

1363
01:07:54,844 --> 01:07:55,444
<font size="36">Oh, so startled.</font>

1364
01:07:55,944 --> 01:07:56,304
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1365
01:07:57,344 --> 01:07:57,904
<font size="36">Is anything coming?</font>

1366
01:07:58,154 --> 01:07:58,464
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1367
01:07:59,074 --> 01:07:59,824
<font size="36">No message came.</font>

1368
01:08:00,924 --> 01:08:03,084
<font size="36">But when I looked for the mailbox earlier, it seemed like a message had arrived?</font>

1369
01:08:03,784 --> 01:08:04,984
<font size="36">That's right. This one doesn't have it.</font>

1370
01:08:09,664 --> 01:08:10,204
<font size="36">Huh? Who is it!</font>

1371
01:08:11,384 --> 01:08:11,804
<font size="36">Oh, what is it!</font>

1372
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:12,594
<font size="36">Probably a guy.</font>

1373
01:08:12,774 --> 01:08:13,054
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

1374
01:08:18,854 --> 01:08:19,534
<font size="36">This is it. catfish!</font>

1375
01:08:19,934 --> 01:08:20,254
<font size="36">So soon?</font>

1376
01:08:20,404 --> 01:08:21,034
<font size="36">Ah, ah, catfish, that's right.</font>

1377
01:08:21,534 --> 01:08:23,054
<font size="36">No, why is the progress so fast?</font>

1378
01:08:23,154 --> 01:08:23,494
<font size="36">What is it.</font>

1379
01:08:24,314 --> 01:08:25,154
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1380
01:08:25,974 --> 01:08:26,404
<font size="36">Huh? Who is it!</font>

1381
01:08:27,184 --> 01:08:27,604
<font size="36">Oh, what is it!</font>

1382
01:08:27,954 --> 01:08:28,394
<font size="36">Probably a guy.</font>

1383
01:08:28,574 --> 01:08:28,854
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

1384
01:08:34,254 --> 01:08:35,034
<font size="36">This is it. catfish!</font>

1385
01:08:35,434 --> 01:08:35,754
<font size="36">So soon?</font>

1386
01:08:35,904 --> 01:08:36,534
<font size="36">Ah, ah, catfish, that's right.</font>

1387
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:38,554
<font size="36">No, why is the progress so fast?</font>

1388
01:08:38,654 --> 01:08:38,994
<font size="36">What is it.</font>

1389
01:08:39,814 --> 01:08:40,654
<font size="36">He... Hey... Oh.</font>

1390
01:08:45,374 --> 01:08:46,124
<font size="36">Hey, what... Who is it?</font>

1391
01:08:46,774 --> 01:08:47,294
<font size="36">Oh, so handsome!</font>

1392
01:08:47,404 --> 01:08:47,904
<font size="36">Oh, so handsome.</font>

1393
01:08:49,304 --> 01:08:50,464
<font size="36">Huh? It's a new person.</font>

1394
01:08:50,864 --> 01:08:51,124
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1395
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:54,754
<font size="36">Amazing.</font>

1396
01:08:55,904 --> 01:08:56,134
<font size="36">Oh my goodness.</font>

1397
01:08:56,534 --> 01:08:57,054
<font size="36">Who is it?</font>

1398
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:08,330
<font size="36">Oh, I didn't think they'd arrive so quickly.</font>

1399
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:15,240
<font size="36">Oh, he seems quite tall and well-built, so I also felt a bit pressured.</font>

1400
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,330
<font size="36">Gotta keep a cool face.</font>

1401
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:26,870
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1402
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:28,400
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1403
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,430
<font size="36">Oh, so handsome. Oh</font>

1404
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:31,810
<font size="36">He's really a catfish. So handsome!</font>

1405
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:33,810
<font size="36">Hey, so handsome. Handsome and tall too.</font>

1406
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:34,940
<font size="36">He's really a catfish, isn't he?</font>

1407
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:36,910
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1408
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,380
<font size="36">Hello, hello.</font>

1409
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:39,380
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1410
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:40,810
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1411
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,910
<font size="36">Oh my, look at his nose?!</font>

1412
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,370
<font size="36">Is he really Korean? Why is his nose so big?</font>

1413
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,680
<font size="36">Hey, what kind of nose is that?</font>

1414
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:51,180
<font size="36">Hello~</font>

1415
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,240
<font size="36">Ah, please sit down.</font>

1416
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,260
<font size="36">Have you eaten anything?</font>

1417
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:57,680
<font size="36">Eaten what? I haven't eaten.</font>

1418
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,810
<font size="36">Oh, what to do?</font>

1419
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:01,610
<font size="36">Just finished eating. What did you eat?</font>

1420
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:05,310
<font size="36">A bit... it seems that person also has charisma.</font>

1421
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:13,390
<font size="36">Honestly, because that's the type of appearance I really like, I thought I wanted to get to know him.</font>

1422
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:20,500
<font size="36">At first glance, he was very tall and I found him very cool.</font>

1423
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:23,570
<font size="36">It seems Sa-yoon's face brightened up a bit?</font>

1424
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:26,810
<font size="36">Ah, that's right~ The brightest, right?</font>

1425
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:28,090
<font size="36">Ha.ha.ha...</font>

1426
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,680
<font size="36">Ah, our Sun-jun has already shown his charm today.</font>

1427
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,420
<font size="36">Oh, he's so handsome, I was really surprised.</font>

1428
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:39,810
<font size="36">I think I should be a bit careful.</font>

1429
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:41,910
<font size="36">That's right, feels dangerous, feels dangerous.</font>

1430
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:45,810
<font size="36">Now, the boys' and girls' reactions are a bit different.</font>

1431
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:50,210
<font size="36">Who does he look like?</font>

1432
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:55,210
<font size="36">Hello. I'm Lee Sung-jun.</font>

1433
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:56,210
<font size="36">Lee Sung-jun.</font>

1434
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,500
<font size="36">Lee Sung-jun? Is his last name Lee?!</font>

1435
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:03,390
<font size="36">Currently, I am a university student studying aviation services with the dream of becoming a flight attendant.</font>

1436
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,680
<font size="36">Male flight attendant. Oh~ Flight attendant!</font>

1437
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,400
<font size="36">Hey, flight attendant, flight attendant.</font>

1438
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,490
<font size="36">Hey, look at him in uniform.</font>

1439
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:13,310
<font size="36">My dad has experience as a flight attendant, so he talked to me a lot.</font>

1440
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:22,050
<font size="36">He wants me to broaden my horizons when looking at the flight attendant profession, so now I'm trying my best to become a flight attendant.</font>

1441
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:23,800
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1442
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,200
<font size="36">Huh? Your dad?</font>

1443
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,650
<font size="36">Your dad used to be a flight attendant?</font>

1444
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:27,310
<font size="36">Your dad? Ah, who is it?</font>

1445
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:29,990
<font size="36">Had experience as a flight attendant. Flight attendant.</font>

1446
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:34,010
<font size="36">Used to play a flight attendant means actor?</font>

1447
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:38,160
<font size="36">Oh, someone's coming.</font>

1448
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:38,810
<font size="36">Huh?!</font>

1449
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:40,910
<font size="36">Someone suddenly came.</font>

1450
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:47,110
<font size="36">OH!!!!?!?!?!</font>

1451
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:51,810
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1452
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:54,010
<font size="36">Ah~ No wonder he looked like someone!</font>

1453
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,610
<font size="36">Ah, no wonder he looked like someone.</font>

1454
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:57,610
<font size="36">Ah, yes, there is. He's here.</font>

1455
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:58,910
<font size="36">Flight attendant. That's right.</font>

1456
01:11:59,610 --> 01:11:59,910
<font size="36">Wow!</font>

1457
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:01,810
<font size="36">Nice to meet you.</font>

1458
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:03,110
<font size="36">Mr. Lee Jong-won.</font>

1459
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:03,710
<font size="36">It's Lee Jong-won.</font>

1460
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:04,010
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1461
01:12:05,425 --> 01:12:08,625
<font size="36">He was a heartthrob actor from the early days. Oh, no one compares.</font>

1462
01:12:31,536 --> 01:12:33,916
<font size="36">No, his son's looks are outstanding.</font>

1463
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:34,966
<font size="36">So handsome.</font>

1464
01:12:35,536 --> 01:12:36,846
<font size="36">His facial features are too clear.</font>

1465
01:12:37,516 --> 01:12:40,996
<font size="36">A strong catfish boy, as handsome as his father, has appeared.</font>

1466
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:47,816
<font size="36">Oh, his son said his dad has experience as a flight attendant, something like that.</font>

1467
01:12:48,466 --> 01:12:49,856
<font size="36">In the past, because of the drama 'Partner'.</font>

1468
01:12:50,416 --> 01:12:52,326
<font size="36">Partner, that's right. Partner, that's right.</font>

1469
01:12:52,956 --> 01:12:54,136
<font size="36">He played a flight attendant there?</font>

1470
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:04,440
<font size="36">I had the dream of becoming a flight attendant quite late in life.</font>

1471
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,810
<font size="36">Oh, the uniform suits him so well.</font>

1472
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:11,830
<font size="36">I think I didn't have time to date because I spent more time on my dream than on love.</font>

1473
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:12,730
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1474
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:21,200
<font size="36">Anyway, this time, I think I can experience many different things with new people in a new environment, so I came here to find that flutter.</font>

1475
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:23,210
<font size="36">Hey, that's amazing.</font>

1476
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:24,880
<font size="36">Ah, so cool. Real looks. Wow.</font>

1477
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:37,320
<font size="36">As I see it, even though he seems cold, he doesn't know how to approach someone he likes and is clumsy, so maybe he likes the 'testo-female' type? Seems to like testo-females.</font>

1478
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:39,140
<font size="36">Likes testo-females~</font>

1479
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:40,960
<font size="36">What does that mean?</font>

1480
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,230
<font size="36">What is a testo-female?</font>

1481
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,830
<font size="36">Girls with a lot of testosterone.</font>

1482
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:45,280
<font size="36">Ah, testosterone.</font>

1483
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,050
<font size="36">The outgoing, extroverted type is very popular recently.</font>

1484
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:48,860
<font size="36">Testo-female.</font>

1485
01:13:51,888 --> 01:13:52,918
<font size="36">Nice to meet you.</font>

1486
01:13:53,218 --> 01:13:53,718
<font size="36">Nice to meet you.</font>

1487
01:13:53,718 --> 01:13:54,818
<font size="36">Nice to meet you.</font>

1488
01:13:58,738 --> 01:14:01,648
<font size="36">I'm Lee Sung-jun. Yes.</font>

1489
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:03,178
<font size="36">Lee Sung... Ju...?</font>

1490
01:14:03,438 --> 01:14:04,398
<font size="36">Lee Sung-jun. Yes.</font>

1491
01:14:06,968 --> 01:14:08,388
<font size="36">Are you nervous? Coming here?</font>

1492
01:14:09,018 --> 01:14:10,138
<font size="36">Oh, yes. Of course.</font>

1493
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:15,158
<font size="36">It's not because of me that it became awkward, right?</font>

1494
01:14:15,758 --> 01:14:16,408
<font size="36">No, it's not.</font>

1495
01:14:16,788 --> 01:14:19,788
<font size="36">Oh, Su-wan. Su-wan's expression is the brightest.</font>

1496
01:14:20,468 --> 01:14:21,368
<font size="36">Su-wan is laughing fiercely.</font>

1497
01:14:22,528 --> 01:14:24,828
<font size="36">Sa-yoon seems to have fallen for him.</font>

1498
01:14:27,848 --> 01:14:31,148
<font size="36">Because he's so handsome, I think he'll be the most liked by everyone...</font>

1499
01:14:32,018 --> 01:14:35,938
<font size="36">Hey, you... Ah, you're exactly Sun-jun's type before he came in.</font>

1500
01:14:36,798 --> 01:14:38,788
<font size="36">Ah, the atmosphere is good, Sun-jun~!</font>

1501
01:14:39,328 --> 01:14:40,758
<font size="36">He already fed them all the Ten-don!!!</font>

1502
01:14:41,648 --> 01:14:42,098
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1503
01:14:42,988 --> 01:14:44,268
<font size="36">Oh, Sun-jun...</font>

1504
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:45,818
<font size="36">Sun-jun.</font>

1505
01:14:50,478 --> 01:14:51,728
<font size="36">Does everyone have any hobbies...</font>

1506
01:14:52,368 --> 01:14:54,938
<font size="36">As for me... eating bread and making bread?</font>

1507
01:14:55,568 --> 01:14:56,918
<font size="36">Ah, bread? Taking a walk.</font>

1508
01:14:56,918 --> 01:14:57,818
<font size="36">Taking a walk.</font>

1509
01:14:58,018 --> 01:14:59,718
<font size="36">Oh, that's good. Seems like he likes walking?</font>

1510
01:15:00,544 --> 01:15:03,384
<font size="36">As for me... I like being at home.</font>

1511
01:15:04,924 --> 01:15:06,534
<font size="36">Or I like going to good restaurants.</font>

1512
01:15:06,824 --> 01:15:07,434
<font size="36">Good restaurants</font>

1513
01:15:08,814 --> 01:15:10,474
<font size="36">I also listen to music and watch movies.</font>

1514
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:11,454
<font size="36">Music and movies</font>

1515
01:15:12,214 --> 01:15:14,354
<font size="36">Me too.. Yes. Exactly the same.</font>

1516
01:15:15,474 --> 01:15:16,154
<font size="36">So much like me.</font>

1517
01:15:19,744 --> 01:15:20,634
<font size="36">You like it too, Tak-soo, go on and say it..!</font>

1518
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:22,874
<font size="36">Tak-soo became much quieter. Much quieter now.</font>

1519
01:15:23,554 --> 01:15:25,234
<font size="36">That's right. He was the MC originally.</font>

1520
01:15:29,594 --> 01:15:30,404
<font size="36">Do you watch many movies?</font>

1521
01:15:30,914 --> 01:15:32,214
<font size="36">Yes! I really like movies.</font>

1522
01:15:32,854 --> 01:15:34,534
<font size="36">Oh, really?! What genre do you like?</font>

1523
01:15:35,344 --> 01:15:38,504
<font size="36">I like movies with aliens, like Alien.</font>

1524
01:15:38,974 --> 01:15:40,624
<font size="36">So what about comics or similar things... do you read them?</font>

1525
01:15:41,414 --> 01:15:42,694
<font size="36">Oh, I like comics. Oh, really?</font>

1526
01:15:43,464 --> 01:15:45,014
<font size="36">Tak-soo, Tak-soo, just take your time.</font>

1527
01:15:45,524 --> 01:15:46,844
<font size="36">I also like comics.</font>

1528
01:15:50,854 --> 01:15:52,894
<font size="36">Wow... It's already like this on the first day.</font>

1529
01:15:53,434 --> 01:15:55,834
<font size="36">It's a bit like a rival.</font>

1530
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:58,154
<font size="36">Oh, what's your favorite food?</font>

1531
01:15:58,604 --> 01:16:00,154
<font size="36">I also like Japanese food.</font>

1532
01:16:00,644 --> 01:16:01,014
<font size="36">Oh</font>

1533
01:16:07,924 --> 01:16:15,134
<font size="36">When talking, they constantly looked into each other's eyes and conversed very well, so I think they'll be very popular.</font>

1534
01:16:18,314 --> 01:16:19,374
<font size="36">Their eyes kept sparkling.</font>

1535
01:16:19,834 --> 01:16:26,914
<font size="36">But they seem closer and talk more comfortably, which... Ah, I really thought a lot about this.</font>

1536
01:16:39,764 --> 01:16:41,494
<font size="36">Look! We already took a picture earlier.</font>

1537
01:16:44,204 --> 01:16:46,014
<font size="36">Have to show it! We ate this.</font>

1538
01:16:46,564 --> 01:16:50,014
<font size="36">This is Gyudon, Ten-don, Ten-don, like crispy fried rice.</font>

1539
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:54,134
<font size="36">So I haven't eaten yet, but this skill is not ordinary.</font>

1540
01:16:55,214 --> 01:16:57,984
<font size="36">And even grilled pasta and steak.</font>

1541
01:16:58,554 --> 01:17:00,014
<font size="36">Oh, leave Tak-soo in the middle.</font>

1542
01:17:00,714 --> 01:17:02,254
<font size="36">What kind of situation is this now?</font>

1543
01:17:03,154 --> 01:17:05,154
<font size="36">What kind of situation is this...? No, who did he go grocery shopping with earlier?</font>

1544
01:17:05,524 --> 01:17:09,254
<font size="36">What is that? They leave Tak-soo in the middle and the other two just keep talking to each other.</font>

1545
01:17:10,754 --> 01:17:11,714
<font size="36">Just switch seats already haha</font>

1546
01:17:12,384 --> 01:17:14,934
<font size="36">No, hyung! Tak-soo's energy is completely drained!!!</font>

1547
01:17:15,554 --> 01:17:18,014
<font size="36">Bro... I'm sorry... my energy is drained~!!</font>

1548
01:17:18,314 --> 01:17:21,014
<font size="36">The one who talks so much is like this (Oh my goodness...)</font>

1549
01:17:25,454 --> 01:17:26,654
<font size="36">One more person, one more person is coming.</font>

1550
01:17:27,284 --> 01:17:28,284
<font size="36">Oh? Another person is coming!</font>

1551
01:17:29,254 --> 01:17:30,284
<font size="36">Huh? Could it be a girl...?!</font>

1552
01:17:30,494 --> 01:17:31,014
<font size="36">Coming again?</font>

1553
01:17:31,454 --> 01:17:32,054
<font size="36">Oh, who else is it?</font>

1554
01:17:32,654 --> 01:17:33,844
<font size="36">Aren't ten people supposed to come?</font>

1555
01:17:37,774 --> 01:17:38,154
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

1556
01:17:38,594 --> 01:17:40,254
<font size="36">That's right, that's right, oh, the female catfish is here again.</font>

1557
01:17:40,634 --> 01:17:41,624
<font size="36">No, why is the progression so fast?</font>

1558
01:17:41,964 --> 01:17:43,014
<font size="36">Hey, the progression is really fast.</font>

1559
01:17:44,454 --> 01:17:45,014
<font size="36">Oh</font>

1560
01:17:53,154 --> 01:17:53,414
<font size="36">Surprise</font>

1561
01:17:53,964 --> 01:17:55,014
<font size="36">Huh? Here they are, oh.</font>

1562
01:17:57,154 --> 01:17:58,254
<font size="36">Ah, one more person is coming.</font>

1563
01:17:59,014 --> 01:17:59,854
<font size="36">The lineup is complete.</font>

1564
01:18:03,344 --> 01:18:04,164
<font size="36">The arrival of the catfish shakes up the game.</font>

1565
01:18:05,444 --> 01:18:06,444
<font size="36">What kind of person will she be?</font>

1566
01:18:11,734 --> 01:18:12,544
<font size="36">Oh, everyone is tense.</font>

1567
01:18:15,174 --> 01:18:15,834
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1568
01:18:17,014 --> 01:18:18,044
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1569
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:19,644
<font size="36">Lee Jong-hyuk's son says hello.</font>

1570
01:18:19,644 --> 01:18:20,144
<font size="36">Lee Tak-soo</font>

1571
01:18:20,144 --> 01:18:20,744
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1572
01:18:21,644 --> 01:18:22,244
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

1573
01:18:27,264 --> 01:18:28,094
<font size="36">First meeting.</font>

1574
01:18:28,734 --> 01:18:29,134
<font size="36">Forced laugh</font>

1575
01:18:30,994 --> 01:18:31,824
<font size="36">Isn't this the main character's spot?</font>

1576
01:18:31,944 --> 01:18:33,054
<font size="36">Why is Tak-soo so surprised??</font>

1577
01:18:33,854 --> 01:18:34,344
<font size="36">Huh, what is it?</font>

1578
01:18:37,524 --> 01:18:38,634
<font size="36">It seems Tak-soo knows this person...?</font>

1579
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:39,594
<font size="36">Oh, it seems Tak-soo knows?</font>

1580
01:18:40,024 --> 01:18:40,664
<font size="36">Oh, they know each other?</font>

1581
01:18:46,144 --> 01:18:47,144
<font size="36">Wow... Then</font>

1582
01:18:49,544 --> 01:18:52,444
<font size="36">I didn't know how to react. My reaction at that moment was messed up.</font>

1583
01:18:53,644 --> 01:18:54,144
<font size="36">Why, why, why?</font>

1584
01:18:54,444 --> 01:18:54,944
<font size="36">Why, why, why?</font>

1585
01:18:55,544 --> 01:18:56,544
<font size="36">Jong-hyuk with a suspicious look.</font>

1586
01:18:57,944 --> 01:19:00,444
<font size="36">I think that was the most awkward moment of my life.</font>

1587
01:19:03,044 --> 01:19:04,244
<font size="36">What is it, that strange gaze?</font>

1588
01:19:04,844 --> 01:19:05,344
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1589
01:19:05,544 --> 01:19:06,244
<font size="36">Didn't they used to date?!</font>

1590
01:19:06,444 --> 01:19:07,044
<font size="36">That's right. What is it?</font>

1591
01:19:07,244 --> 01:19:08,244
<font size="36">Should I pretend not to know? What should I do?</font>

1592
01:19:10,544 --> 01:19:11,644
<font size="36">The person who made Tak-soo flustered.</font>

1593
01:19:11,644 --> 01:19:12,544
<font size="36">The last tenant.</font>

1594
01:19:14,944 --> 01:19:15,944
<font size="36">What is their relationship?</font>

1595
01:19:16,044 --> 01:19:17,344
<font size="36">It really felt like time had stopped.</font>

1596
01:19:22,944 --> 01:19:23,844
<font size="36">Who would've thought we'd meet here.</font>

1597
01:19:24,044 --> 01:19:24,644
<font size="36">Which trip is it now?</font>

1598
01:19:25,444 --> 01:19:26,244
<font size="36">How should I explain this?</font>

1599
01:19:27,044 --> 01:19:28,344
<font size="36">Is she an ex-girlfriend or something?</font>

1600
01:19:28,844 --> 01:19:30,044
<font size="36">Tak-soo, let's talk for a bit.</font>

1601
01:19:30,844 --> 01:19:31,544
<font size="36">Actually, there's something I want to say...</font>

1602
01:19:32,044 --> 01:19:33,144
<font size="36">Today I will send (a message) to you.</font>

1603
01:19:33,744 --> 01:19:34,044
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

1604
01:19:34,544 --> 01:19:35,444
<font size="36">This is the first time I've seen a dating show like this.</font>

1605
01:19:36,744 --> 01:19:42,244
<font size="36">Here, you will convey your sincere feelings with a voice recording tape. Record and send that tape.</font>

1606
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:44,044
<font size="36">"How many tapes did my children receive?"</font>

1607
01:19:44,444 --> 01:19:45,044
<font size="36">Ah, none received.</font>

1608
01:19:49,744 --> 01:19:50,844
<font size="36">That's because they are my children.</font>
