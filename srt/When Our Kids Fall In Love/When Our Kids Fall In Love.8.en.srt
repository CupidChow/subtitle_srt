<font size="36">Oh!</font>

154
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:42,679
<font size="36">(The two talk for the first time after the truth game)
Ah, what will Tak-soo say now?</font>

155
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:46,012
<font size="36">I also didn't expect there to be a truth game.</font>

156
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:47,378
<font size="36">Me too.</font>

157
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:48,779
<font size="36">It's okay.</font>

158
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:50,745
<font size="36">No...</font>

159
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:51,346
<font size="36">What's wrong?</font>

160
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:52,212
<font size="36">It's just that...</font>

161
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:54,579
<font size="36">[Hesitates]</font>

162
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:58,312
<font size="36">Is it... me?</font>

163
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,012
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

164
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:05,379
<font size="36">[Hehe]</font>

165
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,579
<font size="36">Relieved that Tak-soo reaffirmed his feelings.</font>

166
00:08:11,986 --> 00:08:13,379
<font size="36">Was it too sudden?</font>

167
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:15,212
<font size="36">No, no. I like it.</font>

168
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:17,879
<font size="36">But it was a bit...</font>

169
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:23,079
<font size="36">I thought oppa would think about it more carefully before deciding.</font>

170
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,545
<font size="36">I didn't want such worries to drag on until tomorrow.</font>

171
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:39,679
<font size="36">I also wondered if I had said too much.</font>

172
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:42,205
<font size="36">But it was all the opposite.</font>

173
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:45,579
<font size="36">Actually, I thought oppa would reject me.</font>

174
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:46,479
<font size="36">That's right, that's right.</font>

175
00:08:48,286 --> 00:08:53,245
<font size="36">Hmm, I think it's better not to reject and to be chosen like that.</font>

176
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:55,645
<font size="36">Don't you feel uncomfortable?</font>

177
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:57,412
<font size="36">- No, not at all.
- Oh, really?</font>

178
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:00,079
<font size="36">I think it's good?</font>

179
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:01,379
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

180
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,645
<font size="36">It's really good.</font>

181
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:05,079
<font size="36">(After the truth game,
The two are relaxed)</font>

182
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:08,146
<font size="36">(expressing their feelings for each other)
Oh, they're freely showing their affection.</font>

183
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,879
<font size="36">That's right. Nothing is stopping them now.</font>

184
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,712
<font size="36">When I heard that answer,</font>

185
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:13,745
<font size="36">since I entered this dorm,</font>

186
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:19,179
<font size="36">I felt the happiest and most excited among all the emotions I've experienced.</font>

187
00:09:19,212 --> 00:09:21,466
<font size="36">Ah. Hmm.</font>

188
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:24,112
<font size="36">(However, Soo-wan is still worried)</font>

189
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:24,666
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

190
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,612
<font size="36">Worried about Shin-hyang?</font>

191
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,479
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

192
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:30,666
<font size="36">- Have you talked to Shin-hyang unnie yet?
- No, not yet.</font>

193
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:38,945
<font size="36">- You have to talk...
- That's right. You have to talk to nuna.</font>

194
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:42,145
<font size="36">(Meanwhile, Shin-hyang)</font>

195
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:44,845
<font size="36">Ah, nuna doesn't have the energy to pack now.</font>

196
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:45,466
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

197
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:47,545
<font size="36">Sa-yoon.</font>

198
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,812
<font size="36">- Sa-yoon, come here.
- Unnie~~~</font>

199
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:51,179
<font size="36">Give nuna a hug.</font>

200
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,466
<font size="36">Oh my, oh my.</font>

201
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:57,165
<font size="36">I'm so exhausted now.</font>

202
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:57,666
<font size="36">Oh, oh.</font>

203
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:02,412
<font size="36">Seok-joo, give me a hug.</font>

204
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:07,545
<font size="36">(Everyone comforts Shin-hyang)</font>

205
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:13,145
<font size="36">Someone hug me.</font>

206
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,645
<font size="36">Ah, what should I do...</font>

207
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:21,979
<font size="36">I keep trying to act strong, but I'm actually not okay at all.</font>

208
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,146
<font size="36">I thought so already.</font>

209
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:30,845
<font size="36">Anyway, I had put all my heart into Tak-soo from the beginning, not looking at anyone else.</font>

210
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:36,245
<font size="36">I also thought I had received some affection from Tak-soo.</font>

211
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:40,370
<font size="36">It's just that I feel
uncomfortable inside.</font>

212
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:46,665
<font size="36">I have difficulty accepting this myself
and facing Soo-wan.</font>

213
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,845
<font size="36">It must be difficult.</font>

214
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:52,712

216
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:58,512

217
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,079
<font size="36">(Neither of them went to their room, but down to the first floor)
So, both of them feel uncomfortable.</font>

<font size="36">Neither of them went up to the second floor, but down to the first floor.</font>

219
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,145
<font size="36">Oh dear, what do I do.</font>

220
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:11,945
<font size="36">In a public place where everyone knows my feelings,</font>

221
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:16,479
<font size="36">Everyone knows these feelings of ours, so they said that.</font>

222
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:20,212
<font size="36">I think that's because that friend's feelings are very strong.</font>

223
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,212
<font size="36">(Stop...!)</font>

224
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:27,379
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

225
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,279
<font size="36">Can I (come in)?</font>

226
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:31,179
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

227
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:34,579

<font size="36">Solving it humorously.</font>

230
00:11:40,345 --> 00:11:41,478
<font size="36">Oh, she must be really angry.</font>

231
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,345
<font size="36">Oh, she handled it well. Yeah.</font>

232
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:45,712
<font size="36">You can't come where I am. Get out quickly.</font>

233

<font size="36">- You can't.
- Why~~</font>

234
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:49,312
<font size="36">Unnie~~</font>

235

<font size="36">That was the first round, that appeared.</font>

240
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:04,466
<font size="36">I'll wander around for a bit.</font>

244
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,430
<font size="36">Oh dear, what do I do.</font>

245
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,545
<font size="36">(Where only two people are)
Oh, Seong-jun now.</font>

246
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,112
<font size="36">(Shin-hyang leaves)
She didn't lose the ointment, did she?</font>

247
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,979
<font size="36">Shin-hyang, Shin-hyang avoids it.</font>

248
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,245
<font size="36">She must still be uncomfortable inside.</font>

249
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,379
<font size="36">What should I do.</font>

250
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,745
<font size="36">My heart is also very uncomfortable.</font>

251
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,179
<font size="36">- But hey.
- Yeah.</font>

252
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,199
<font size="36">What was it?</font>

253
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,379
<font size="36">Shin-hyang unnie.</font>

254
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:46,312
<font size="36">Uh, uh... how?</font>

255
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,812
<font size="36">Of course, she doesn't hate Soo-wan.</font>

256
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:53,012
<font size="36">- She just feels uncomfortable inside.
- I think so.</font>

257
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:55,245
<font size="36">Because in the end, everything happened so suddenly.</font>

258
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,412
<font size="36">Anyway, it was going to be like this sooner or later.</font>

259
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,312
<font size="36">Because she's her roommate...</font>

260
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:00,912
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

261
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,645
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

262
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,503
<font size="36">Because Shin-hyang unnie is my roommate
and also in an awkward situation,</font>

263
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:08,845
<font size="36">so she's in a difficult situation.</font>

264
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,146
<font size="36">So it's also a bit difficult for me to actively suggest talking.</font>

265
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:17,379
<font size="36">So I think I'm having pretty complex feelings.</font>

266
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:22,212
<font size="36">(Meanwhile Shin-hyang, Seok-joo, Jun-ho on the 2nd floor)

267
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,145
<font size="36">Jun-ho oppa keeps telling me.</font>

268
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,145
<font size="36">The best way is for you to talk to Tak-soo one last time.</font>

269
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,312
<font size="36">That's right, we already talked just now~</font>

270
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:33,179
<font size="36">But...</font>

271
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:39,579
<font size="36">I'm just worried now that even that will make him uncomfortable.</font>

272
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,945
<font size="36">- With Tak-soo?
- Hmm.</font>

273
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:43,312
<font size="36">Shin-hyang is so thoughtful.</font>

274
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,379
<font size="36">It's really funny.</font>

275
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,945
<font size="36">(Tak-soo comes to talk to Shin-hyang)
It's Tak-soo.</font>

276
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,912
<font size="36">Ah, if only she had scolded him there, it would have been great.</font>

277
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,779
<font size="36">No, you're too greedy for ratings.</font>

278
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,145
<font size="36">Tak-soo, you jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!</font>

279
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,810
<font size="36">Talk.</font>

280
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,245
<font size="36">No, we'll go somewhere else.</font>

281
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,912
<font size="36">Because both of them are on the 2nd floor.</font>

282
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,309
<font size="36">That's right, that's right, that's right.</font>

283
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,445
<font size="36">Move aside. Make way.</font>

284
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,345
<font size="36">- I think I need to talk.
- Yeah.</font>

285
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,879
<font size="36">It's just that...</font>

286
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,312
<font size="36">- Today was a random date, right?
- Yeah, yeah.</font>

287
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:34,278
<font size="36">So I thought I had to talk to Soo-wan, and she came at the right time.</font>

288
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:43,179
<font size="36">But I think, in my heart, this is the right thing to do.</font>

289
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:49,212
<font size="36">No, actually, I kept thinking today</font>

290
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,012
<font size="36">I kept thinking you should date someone else.</font>

291
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,212
<font size="36">Better that way.</font>

292
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,212
<font size="36">But I didn't expect it to be Soo-wan.</font>

293
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,845
<font size="36">And I, yesterday...</font>

294
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,145
<font size="36">Listening to the tape content,</font>

295
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,412
<font size="36">I thought, ah, will Tak-soo also decide his feelings?</font>

296
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:17,012
<font size="36">Since yesterday?</font>

297
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,812
<font size="36">I thought so.</font>

298
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,512
<font size="36">It turns out...</font>

299
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,512
<font size="36">It's as if that was changed through today's random date?</font>

300
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:27,045
<font size="36">I feel a bit regretful.</font>

301
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,145
<font size="36">That's what I thought.</font>

302
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,909
<font size="36">Compared to Shin-hyang's inner turmoil,</font>

303
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,010
<font size="36">she seemed to speak very calmly.</font>

304
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,810
<font size="36">Her feelings.</font>

305
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,112
<font size="36">(Q. After seeing Tak-soo change his feelings, what do you plan to do next?)</font>

306
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:51,778
<font size="36">Actually, my feelings have been the same from the start,</font>

307
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,010
<font size="36">The person I have feelings for,</font>

308
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,379
<font size="36">Just because that person has feelings for someone else</font>

309
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,979
<font size="36">doesn't mean my feelings will suddenly disappear</font>

310
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,079
<font size="36">Or that I'll have feelings for someone else.</font>

311
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,345
<font size="36">I don't think it's like that.</font>

312
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,712
<font size="36">Ah, that's amazing.</font>

313
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,245
<font size="36">It's this. Yes. That's right.</font>

314
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,112
<font size="36">What a faithful love.</font>

315
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,145
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

316
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,245
<font size="36">- Let's talk.
- Yes.</font>

317
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,245
<font size="36">Ah, hey, we shouldn't forget Seok-joo and Sun-jun.</font>

318
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,245
<font size="36">This situation is also worrying.</font>

319
00:16:28,345 --> 00:16:29,978

<font size="36">Hmm...</font>

324
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,212
<font size="36">let's be frank. Both of us do that,</font>

325
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,510
<font size="36">But in the truth game earlier,</font>

326
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,310
<font size="36">I think I wavered a bit.</font>

327
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,812
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

328
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,960
<font size="36">Now tell me your number 1 and number 2 priorities.</font>

329
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:06,645
<font size="36">Something like that.</font>

330
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,579
<font size="36">I think it's 60, 40.</font>

331
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,745
<font size="36">Jun-ho oppa was truly unexpected,</font>

332
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:20,912
<font size="36">After hearing that, I started having many different thoughts.</font>

333
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,410
<font size="36">Anyway, what I can show,</font>

334
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,110
<font size="36">I think I have to do it once.</font>

335
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,245
<font size="36">Hmm...</font>

336
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,145
<font size="36">Give... give me your hand.</font>

337
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,479
<font size="36">(Give me your hand?)
What is it?</font>

338
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:43,645
<font size="36">Is it dried seaweed again?</font>

339
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,512
<font size="36">Give... give me your hand.</font>

340
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,612
<font size="36">Earlier...</font>

341
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,510
<font size="36">I picked this at the campsite.</font>

342
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:03,045
<font size="36">(A flower picked from the campsite)
So cute. - What is it? - A flower?</font>

343
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:09,612
<font size="36">(A flower cherished in his hand for Seok-joo)
Hey, he managed to pick something at the campsite during that time.</font>

344
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:10,058
<font size="36">Oh my.</font>

345
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:11,712
<font size="36">That's really cute.</font>

346
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:15,645
<font size="36">You really...</font>

347
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:18,879
<font size="36">How did you manage to keep it?</font>

348
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,407
<font size="36">Because it wasn't preserved well,</font>

349
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:21,908
<font size="36">it ended up like this.</font>

350
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:24,412
<font size="36">Ah, so cute.</font>

351
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:27,712
<font size="36">Seok-joo, he's gone this far, you should understand.</font>

352
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:28,479
<font size="36">Of course.</font>

353
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:30,879
<font size="36">What's 60%~ It should be 600%</font>

354
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:33,379
<font size="36">It still has this shape.</font>

355
00:18:37,738 --> 00:18:40,079
<font size="36">That place was so beautiful.</font>

356
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:42,888
<font size="36">I wanted to share it with you.</font>

357
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:44,812
<font size="36">Oh, hey.</font>

358
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:47,312
<font size="36">I really like that kind of man.</font>

359
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:48,445
<font size="36">I also like that kind of man.</font>

360
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,212
<font size="36">Me too.</font>

361
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:50,745
<font size="36">He's at home now.</font>

362
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:53,345
<font size="36">Feelings will be broken. Don't say such things.</font>

363
00:18:57,108 --> 00:18:58,812
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

364
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:01,312
<font size="36">That's really cute.</font>

365
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:07,245
<font size="36">Ah, he really showed his feelings to the very end, tried his best, so...</font>

366
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:14,745
<font size="36">I thought again that this friend is truly a warm person.</font>

367
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:18,779
<font size="36">Ah, taking a photo.</font>

368
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:24,412
<font size="36">Even after returning to her room, she took photos for a long time.</font>

369
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:36,912
<font size="36">What is Seok-joo doing on the 2nd floor again?</font>

370
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:40,179
<font size="36">Is it a continuation from that time?</font>

371
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:41,379
<font size="36">Ah, with Jun-ho.</font>

372
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:42,088
<font size="36">10 minutes later.</font>

373
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:42,388
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

374
00:19:43,088 --> 00:19:44,088
<font size="36">Seok-joo is really busy.</font>

375
00:19:45,588 --> 00:19:46,388
<font size="36">She should have talked more.</font>

376
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:47,088
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

377
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:50,688
<font size="36">There were some things that were a bit confusing, but they were completely reset.</font>

378
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:53,088
<font size="36">It feels like it went back to zero.</font>

379
00:19:54,088 --> 00:19:57,912
<font size="36">What I need most now is to talk to Jun-ho oppa.</font>

380
00:20:02,188 --> 00:20:04,145
<font size="36">It's a shame I couldn't talk.</font>

381
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,588
<font size="36">So I found that really strange.</font>

382
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,845
<font size="36">Couldn't she do it properly?</font>

383
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:09,288
<font size="36">Oh, even though she couldn't talk,</font>

384
00:20:09,988 --> 00:20:14,179
<font size="36">I found it strange that I was among those four people.</font>

385
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:15,188
<font size="36">Ah, that's right.</font>

386
00:20:15,788 --> 00:20:19,445
<font size="36">I really wanted to find someone compatible.</font>

387
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:21,087
<font size="36">But when I was with everyone,</font>

388
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:24,479
<font size="36">Oh, ah, this friend has a very good sense of humor.</font>

389
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:26,756
<font size="36">So, ah, it matched well.</font>

390
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:29,188
<font size="36">Like an old man.</font>

391
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:31,812
<font size="36">(Feeling the similarities between the two
Seok-joo and Jun-ho)</font>

392
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:33,387
<font size="36">That's amazing.</font>

393
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:33,888

397
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:42,188
<font size="36">Indeed, the security oppa provides is very different.</font>

398
00:20:47,888 --> 00:20:50,288
<font size="36">And what surprised me about myself was,</font>

399
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:58,888
<font size="36">I even felt a little nervous talking to oppa.</font>

400
00:20:59,588 --> 00:21:08,312
<font size="36">So does this mean my heart is leaning towards this side?</font>

401
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:12,145
<font size="36">(Is Seok-joo's heart leaning towards Jun-ho?)

<font size="36">Ah, still wavering until the very end.</font>

403
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:16,479
<font size="36">Ah, you never know with this one.</font>

- What's he looking for?</font>

<font size="36">Again?</font>

596
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:53,037
<font size="36">I also didn't have to
think about who to choose,</font>

597
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,912
<font size="36">and since he was eating nearby,
I went and talked to him right away.</font>

598
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:01,779
<font size="36">(Unlike Seong-jun, who was a step slower)</font>

599
00:32:03,112 --> 00:32:06,445
<font size="36">(Sa-yoon invited him right after reading the message)</font>

600
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:07,799
<font size="36">Hey, this</font>

601
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:11,412
<font size="36">Over time, Sa-yoon will almost lead Seong-jun.</font>

602
00:32:11,499 --> 00:32:13,179
<font size="36">That's right. So cute.</font>

603
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:16,779
<font size="36">Soo-wan heads towards the living room after checking the message.</font>

604
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:18,379
<font size="36">[Glancing]</font>

605
00:32:22,312 --> 00:32:25,645
<font size="36">(Soo-wan sits opposite Tak-soo)</font>

606
00:32:33,499 --> 00:32:34,512
<font size="36">Oppa.</font>

607
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:37,745
<font size="36">Oppa, want to go on a date?</font>

608
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:39,679
<font size="36">[Nodding]</font>

609
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:40,279
<font size="36">It's done.</font>

610
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:41,312
<font size="36">They're so cute.</font>

611
00:32:41,345 --> 00:32:42,745
<font size="36">Let's go. Go on.</font>

612
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,679
<font size="36">Oh my...</font>

613
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,679
<font size="36">What do I do now. Haha</font>

614
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:52,879
<font size="36">Ah, Seok-joo is so funny.</font>

615
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:56,579
<font size="36">Seok-joo is so cute.</font>

616
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:02,579
<font size="36">Both sides seem happy.</font>

617
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:05,212
<font size="36">Sorry.</font>

618
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:07,679
<font size="36">Oh my goodness.</font>

619
00:33:10,177 --> 00:33:12,279
<font size="36">Actually, I had already guessed.</font>

620
00:33:12,487 --> 00:33:14,412
<font size="36">So I was wondering when it would come,</font>

621
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:18,545
<font size="36">She came earlier than I expected, so I happily accepted.</font>

622
00:33:18,547 --> 00:33:19,545
<font size="36">I'm very happy.</font>

623
00:33:22,853 --> 00:33:25,612
<font size="36">Who Seok-joo will invite is also a matter of concern now.</font>

624
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:29,379
<font size="36">(Jun-ho and Sun-jun are still together)</font>

625
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:32,012
<font size="36">(Seok-joo is torn between the two)</font>

626
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:33,445
<font size="36">Why pay attention like that.</font>

627
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,179
<font size="36">That's right, just do it.</font>

628
00:33:35,543 --> 00:33:36,513
<font size="36">That's right. Ah.</font>

629
00:33:37,093 --> 00:33:38,579
<font size="36">Seok-joo must also have a lot to think about.</font>

630
00:33:42,512 --> 00:33:46,912
<font size="36">(Meanwhile, Shin-hyang is reading the message in the LP room)</font>

631
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,812
<font size="36">Now this has truly become a bit awkward.</font>

632
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,645
<font size="36">Ah. Yes, it's difficult in my heart.</font>

633
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,912
<font size="36">Why is it happening like this?</font>

634
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,312
<font size="36">I thought a lot.</font>

635
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:08,045
<font size="36">Of course, since it's the last day,</font>

636
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:14,945
<font size="36">I also want to go on a date and spend time with Tak-soo in the end.</font>

637
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:17,779
<font size="36">(Shin-hyang was also in the living room at that time)</font>

638
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:21,079
<font size="36">Oppa, want to go on a date?</font>

639
00:34:24,894 --> 00:34:27,812
<font size="36">I heard it. - Oh my</font>

640
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:29,345
<font size="36">Ah, she's right next to him.</font>

641
00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:31,512
<font size="36">In that situation, talking becomes even harder.</font>

642
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:38,112
<font size="36">But on the other hand,</font>

643
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:42,512
<font size="36">Because I knew for sure he would go on a date with Soo-wan,</font>

644
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:48,245
<font size="36">I felt like I was taking up both of their time,</font>

645
00:34:48,749 --> 00:34:53,079
<font size="36">Ah... I think my thinking time has prolonged a lot.</font>

646
00:34:55,137 --> 00:35:01,012
<font size="36">(What will Shin-hyang and Seok-joo choose?)</font>

647
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:06,279
<font size="36">(Meanwhile, someone is in a good mood)</font>

648
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:12,012
<font size="36">Oh my, so happy.</font>

649
00:35:12,173 --> 00:35:14,279
<font size="36">Oh my, is our daughter too happy?</font>

650
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,512
<font size="36">She seems very happy, like she's in a musical.</font>

651
00:35:24,961 --> 00:35:29,312
<font size="36">I think I tried to wear the nicest outfit.</font>

652
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:34,846
<font size="36">(Sa-yoon goes out early in an excited mood)</font>

653
00:35:41,543 --> 00:35:41,923
<font size="36">Shall we go?</font>

654
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:42,543
<font size="36">Let's go.</font>

655
00:35:44,623 --> 00:35:45,579
<font size="36">Are you already nervous?</font>

656
00:35:46,003 --> 00:35:46,679
<font size="36">Completely.</font>

657
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:51,663
<font size="36">Their outfits are like couple clothes.</font>

658
00:35:51,763 --> 00:35:52,645
<font size="36">So beautiful.</font>

659
00:35:57,328 --> 00:35:58,779
<font size="36">The itinerary planned for today is</font>

660
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:02,045
<font size="36">Is it the date you most wanted to try?</font>

661
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:03,779
<font size="36">Oh, that's right.</font>

662
00:36:04,098 --> 00:36:04,879
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

663
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,512
<font size="36">But I've never tried it either.</font>

664
00:36:07,545 --> 00:36:08,148
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

665
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:10,145
<font size="36">What an honor.</font>

666
00:36:10,478 --> 00:36:11,579
<font size="36">First time, first time.</font>

667
00:36:11,988 --> 00:36:12,879
<font size="36">What an honor.</font>

668
00:36:15,265 --> 00:36:18,112
<font size="36">Actually, this is their first 1:1 date.</font>

669
00:36:18,165 --> 00:36:18,535
<font size="36">Oh, really?</font>

670
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:20,112
<font size="36">Is that so?!</font>

671
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:20,285
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

672
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:22,144
<font size="36">First time in 5 days.</font>

673
00:36:22,145 --> 00:36:23,579
<font size="36">Ah, for 1:1, yes.</font>

674
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:25,612
<font size="36">Ah, at that time it was 2:2.</font>

675
00:36:26,355 --> 00:36:27,979
<font size="36">Ah, this is their first 1:1 date.</font>

676
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:28,879
<font size="36">Oh, how strange.</font>

677
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,845
<font size="36">- They never dated each other, but their feelings just continued.
- Yes, that's right.</font>

678
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:32,979
<font size="36">So it seems there are only two of them.</font>

679
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:33,779
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

680
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:36,045
<font size="36">First time, first time.</font>

681
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:37,279
<font size="36">Hmm. What an honor.</font>

682
00:36:37,379 --> 00:36:39,312
<font size="36">(Finally, time alone for the two of them)</font>

683
00:36:39,937 --> 00:36:41,445
<font size="36">Is there any YouTube channel you particularly follow?</font>

684
00:36:42,007 --> 00:36:43,379
<font size="36">I really...</font>

685
00:36:43,817 --> 00:36:45,845
<font size="36">Oh! I also often watch my father-in-law's YouTube.</font>

686
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:46,779
<font size="36">Ah, follow? Hmm.</font>

687
00:36:46,812 --> 00:36:47,945
<font size="36">Ah, follow? Ah, watch often?</font>

688
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:48,479
<font size="36">Is that so.</font>

689
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,545
<font size="36">Really, during meals or anytime it's like this,</font>

690
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:53,312
<font size="36">Father-in-law.</font>

691
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:54,945
<font size="36">I don't make YouTube, do I?</font>

692
00:36:55,095 --> 00:36:56,412
<font size="36">Father-in-law. - That's right.</font>

693
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:59,512
<font size="36">No, that's a brother I know in Busan, not mine.</font>

694
00:36:59,605 --> 00:37:01,555
<font size="36">It's the one with the red hair.</font>

695
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:03,512
<font size="36">Let's go.</font>

696
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:06,312
<font size="36">(Soon they arrived at the date location)</font>

697
00:37:06,379 --> 00:37:06,839
<font size="36">Here.</font>

698
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:10,012
<font size="36">A cafe?</font>

699
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:12,279
<font size="36">This is a perfume workshop.</font>

700
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:13,545
<font size="36">Ah, a perfume workshop.</font>

701
00:37:14,249 --> 00:37:15,412
<font size="36">I really like perfume.</font>

702
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:16,645
<font size="36">That's right. - Oh.</font>

703
00:37:18,145 --> 00:37:19,179
<font size="36">It must be a place to do something.</font>

704
00:37:19,255 --> 00:37:20,179
<font size="36">Perfume workshop.</font>

705
00:37:20,195 --> 00:37:21,112
<font size="36">It's a very beautiful place.</font>

706
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,012
<font size="36">It smells really good.</font>

707
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:28,679
<font size="36">Now, I think it would be great if we created a scent that both of us want the other person to have.</font>

708
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,412
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

709
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,612
<font size="36">This will be fun.</font>

710
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,179
<font size="36">Seong-jun uses perfume often, doesn't he?</font>

711
00:37:34,265 --> 00:37:34,712
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

712
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,779
<font size="36">Oppa, do you like lavender scent?</font>

713
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,779
<font size="36">Lavender?</font>

714
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:41,945
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

715
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:42,979
<font size="36">If you don't like it, just say you don't like it.</font>

716
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,012
<font size="36">I like it.</font>

717
00:37:45,245 --> 00:37:46,745
<font size="36">How could I not like it?</font>

718
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:48,379
<font size="36">At that moment, you like everything.</font>

719
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,345
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

720
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:56,445
<font size="36">(Q. What scent suits Sa-yoon?)
This absolutely must be included.</font>

721
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:03,990
<font size="36">Ah, I think a very bright, cheerful, and refreshing scent would suit her.</font>

722
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:06,910
<font size="36">Oh, I did well.</font>

723
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:11,212
<font size="36">(Q. What scent suits Seong-jun?)
How is it? Smell it. Good, right?</font>

724
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,503
<font size="36">Among the basic scents,</font>

725
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:16,537
<font size="36">there's a scent that smells
like men's cologne,</font>

726
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:22,612
<font size="36">I thought it suited Seong-jun oppa very
well, so I added a lot of it to the perfume.</font>

727
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:26,478
<font size="36">(Thinking of each other
carefully adding each drop)</font>

728
00:38:30,365 --> 00:38:35,479
<font size="36">I think I might have made another bottle for this father.</font>

729
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:39,145
<font size="36">So now you're going to name the perfume.</font>

730
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,679
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

731
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,045
<font size="36">Name? Naming is really hard.</font>

732
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,645
<font size="36">No, but the name...</font>

733
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,812
<font size="36">It's not cheesy, it's funny, right?</font>

734
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,812
<font size="36">Completely.</font>

735
00:38:57,055 --> 00:38:57,879
<font size="36">What's the name?</font>

736
00:38:58,885 --> 00:39:01,579
<font size="36">Oh, what did she say? So curious.</font>

737
00:39:01,612 --> 00:39:03,945
<font size="36">What is the name of the perfume for Sa-yoon?</font>

738
00:39:03,979 --> 00:39:07,412
<font size="36">'Hmm, I'm a goddess'</font>

739
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,712
<font size="36">Hmm, I'm a goddess?</font>

740
00:39:11,856 --> 00:39:14,879
<font size="36">His flirting leaves others speechless (?)</font>

741
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:16,345
<font size="36">That's good~</font>

742
00:39:16,426 --> 00:39:17,645
<font size="36">Sa-yoon is indeed a goddess.</font>

743
00:39:18,206 --> 00:39:20,712
<font size="36">Hmm, I'm a goddess? - Hmm.</font>

744
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,879
<font size="36">Every time I spray this, I'll think of that.</font>

746
00:39:26,556 --> 00:39:27,225
<font size="36">Shall I make it again for you?</font>

747
00:39:27,226 --> 00:39:27,745
<font size="36">No?</font>

748
00:39:27,786 --> 00:39:28,979
<font size="36">Is it okay? - Oh, that's good.</font>

749
00:39:29,256 --> 00:39:31,712
<font size="36">Q. Do you like 'Hmm, I'm a goddess'?</font>

750
00:39:32,512 --> 00:39:35,912

751
00:39:36,066 --> 00:39:39,412
<font size="36">Ah, but the more I look at it, the more I like it.</font>

754
00:39:44,537 --> 00:39:46,012

758
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:55,826
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

759
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:58,912

00:40:06,426 --> 00:40:07,645
<font size="36">Won't it run out in two months?</font>

764
00:40:08,066 --> 00:40:09,212

787
00:40:57,066 --> 00:41:00,845

820
00:42:20,419 --> 00:42:21,745
<font size="36">Finally going. Last day.</font>

821
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:29,112
<font size="36">I wanted to go to the central market ever since I heard we were coming to Sokcho, so I told Seong-jun oppa we'd go together next time,</font>

00:51:51,464 --> 00:51:53,112
<font size="36">(Shin-hyang received the date message and kept hesitating)</font>

1047
00:51:53,144 --> 00:51:54,679
<font size="36">Hmm, it probably took some time.</font>

1048
00:51:59,644 --> 00:52:00,279
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1049
00:52:01,554 --> 00:52:04,112
<font size="36">Ah, it would really be uncomfortable. - That's right.</font>

1050
00:52:05,824 --> 00:52:11,254
<font size="36">Oh, anyway, the guys can't refuse (a date invitation), so, hmm...</font>

1051
00:52:12,404 --> 00:52:21,684
<font size="36">Actually, I already knew Tak-soo's and Soo-wan's feelings, and now it's clear before my eyes,</font>

1052
00:52:22,854 --> 00:52:30,445
<font size="36">so when I was about to ask him on a date, I kept remembering their feelings,</font>

1053
00:52:31,454 --> 00:52:36,574
<font size="36">I felt like I was taking up their time,</font>

1054
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:44,445
<font size="36">and I thought if I did that, I would feel uncomfortable and guilty,</font>

1055
00:52:45,254 --> 00:52:49,479
<font size="36">so I couldn't act decisively.</font>

1056
00:52:52,054 --> 00:52:53,145
<font size="36">Shin-hyang gave in.</font>

1057
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:54,845
<font size="36">Such a deep heart.</font>

1058
00:52:55,054 --> 00:52:58,312
<font size="36">(Shin-hyang hesitated because of Tak-soo and Soo-wan)
Shin-hyang thought a lot.</font>

1059
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:06,554
<font size="36">While thinking, time passed.</font>

1060
00:53:13,854 --> 00:53:18,645
<font size="36">The girls' invitation time has ended.</font>

1061
00:53:20,054 --> 00:53:21,745
<font size="36">Oh, she didn't ask him out.</font>

1062
00:53:22,154 --> 00:53:22,554
<font size="36">Oh...</font>

1063
00:53:22,754 --> 00:53:26,445
<font size="36">The invitation time ended like that.</font>

1064
00:53:27,054 --> 00:53:34,245
<font size="36">Shin-hyang ultimately couldn't ask him out.</font>

1065
00:53:35,154 --> 00:53:35,754
<font size="36">Is that so.</font>

1066
00:53:37,254 --> 00:53:38,079
<font size="36">Well done.</font>

1067
00:53:39,154 --> 00:53:42,212
<font size="36">It seems Shin-hyang doesn't want to make anyone uncomfortable.</font>

1068
00:53:42,254 --> 00:53:43,279
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1069
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:47,979
<font size="36">Shin-hyang's warm heart also reached the fathers.</font>

1070
00:53:50,054 --> 00:53:53,912
<font size="36">(Dad just wants to comfort her.)
Well done.</font>

1071
00:53:55,654 --> 00:53:58,412
<font size="36">And there's one more person.</font>

1072
00:53:58,854 --> 00:54:01,645
<font size="36">The girls' invitation time has ended. Sun-jun did not receive an invitation.</font>

1073
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:02,545
<font size="36">He didn't receive one?</font>

1074
00:54:02,612 --> 00:54:03,112
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1075
00:54:03,145 --> 00:54:05,245
<font size="36">Seok-joo didn't invite him either?</font>

1076
00:54:06,586 --> 00:54:06,866
<font size="36">Seok-joo didn't.</font>

1077
00:54:06,867 --> 00:54:07,712
<font size="36">Ah, what to do.</font>

1078
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,612
<font size="36">Oh, Seok-joo didn't do it.</font>

1079
00:54:10,466 --> 00:54:13,879
<font size="36">How disappointed he must be.</font>

1080
00:54:14,266 --> 00:54:14,766
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1081
00:54:14,767 --> 00:54:22,545
<font size="36">I felt like I was slowly losing confidence in myself,</font>

1082
00:54:22,745 --> 00:54:24,545
<font size="36">that was the hardest part.</font>

1083
00:54:25,256 --> 00:54:26,556
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1084
00:54:26,866 --> 00:54:31,445
<font size="36">(Shin-hyang and Sun-jun stayed at the house like that.)
Shall we listen to music? - Hmm. - LP room?</font>

1085
00:54:32,866 --> 00:54:35,479
<font size="36">(Away from the common area,
the two went to the LP room.)</font>

1086
00:54:35,566 --> 00:54:36,745
<font size="36">Ah, I heard it earlier too.</font>

1087
00:54:37,266 --> 00:54:38,479
<font size="36">No...</font>

1088
00:54:38,766 --> 00:54:40,912
<font size="36">I think I've dated you the most.</font>

1089
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:41,666
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1090
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:42,566
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1091
00:54:42,966 --> 00:54:44,645
<font size="36">What is this situation?</font>

1092
00:54:45,466 --> 00:54:48,012
<font size="36">Come to think of it, it's true lol.</font>

1093
00:54:48,566 --> 00:54:49,312
<font size="36">It's good.</font>

1094
00:54:49,345 --> 00:54:52,445
<font size="36">(Anyway, it's lucky that they're together)
Ah, what is this. - It's good.</font>

<font size="36">[Sigh]</font>

1096
00:54:56,966 --> 00:54:58,745
<font size="36">Still bothered? - Huh?</font>

1097
00:54:58,779 --> 00:55:00,946
<font size="36">Still bothered? Are you sad?</font>

1098
00:55:01,466 --> 00:55:02,612
<font size="36">What? Do I look like that?</font>

1099
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:03,679
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1100
00:55:04,266 --> 00:55:05,779
<font size="36">No. I...</font>

1101
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:10,345
<font size="36">You're standing next to me now, dying of anxiety, like you're cooking and about to cut your hand.</font>

1102
00:55:10,379 --> 00:55:14,512
<font size="36">(At that moment, Seok-joo and Jun-ho passed by the window)
No. What to do, what to do.</font>

<font size="36">(Oh, hey! Ah... no...!)</font>

1104
00:55:15,966 --> 00:55:17,465

1105

<font size="36">- What to do, Seong-jun...
- Did you see it? - I think they saw it.</font>

00:59:30,038 --> 00:59:30,912
<font size="36">Okay.</font>

1193
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:33,345
<font size="36">Oh, how sweet~</font>

1194
00:59:34,429 --> 00:59:35,845
<font size="36">Don't be chased today.</font>

1195
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:38,812
<font size="36">(Oh~ Jun-ho takes such good care of her)</font>

1196
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:46,045
<font size="36">Surely, the thoughts and feelings about oppa are different from back then,</font>

1197
00:59:46,778 --> 00:59:48,945
<font size="36">so there's also a fresh feeling,</font>

1198
00:59:50,208 --> 00:59:51,445
<font size="36">So something that's just right,</font>

1199
00:59:51,558 --> 00:59:56,479
<font size="36">Having spent 5 days and 4 nights together, now it's the last day, is there anything you regret?</font>

1200
00:59:57,338 --> 00:59:59,779
<font size="36">Like, 'Ah, I should have done this back then'.</font>

1201
01:00:00,747 --> 01:00:02,012
<font size="36">Jun-ho is leading the conversation again~</font>

1202
01:00:02,067 --> 01:00:03,266
<font size="36">I should have tried this, or that.</font>

1203
01:00:04,918 --> 01:00:07,979
<font size="36">It would have been better if I had talked to oppa sooner.</font>

1204
01:00:08,158 --> 01:00:08,945
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1205
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:09,845
<font size="36">Ah, that's right.</font>

1206
01:00:09,848 --> 01:00:14,179
<font size="36">It's lucky I was able to do it. Seriously. I thought I wouldn't be able to and would just go home.</font>

1207
01:00:14,919 --> 01:00:22,037
<font size="36">But honestly, after talking
with you yesterday and getting to know you a bit more,</font>

1208
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,179
<font size="36">I felt very good, even the conversation itself.</font>

1209
01:00:25,408 --> 01:00:27,045
<font size="36">Ah, it's lucky we talked.</font>

1210
01:00:28,279 --> 01:00:29,212
<font size="36">But now</font>

1211
01:00:33,249 --> 01:00:38,212
<font size="36">Do you have feelings for me as in, a romantic interest, this... hmm.</font>

1212
01:00:39,279 --> 01:00:40,779
<font size="36">That, I don't know.</font>

1213
01:00:44,678 --> 01:00:48,845
<font size="36">So I'm still thinking about that.</font>

1214
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:55,745
<font size="36">(Jun-ho is still sorting out his feelings for Seok-joo until the very end)
It seems so. I think so too.</font>

1215
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,803
<font size="36">But as I said yesterday,</font>

1216
01:01:01,886 --> 01:01:09,070
<font size="36">no matter what the other person's feelings are,</font>

1217
01:01:09,153 --> 01:01:11,312
<font size="36">I don't think it will affect my choice.</font>

1218
01:01:11,408 --> 01:01:12,559
<font size="36">Hmm. Oh.</font>

1219
01:01:14,198 --> 01:01:14,408
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1220
01:01:14,939 --> 01:01:15,645
<font size="36">Amazing.</font>

1221
01:01:15,858 --> 01:01:17,079
<font size="36">That's you.</font>

1222
01:01:19,469 --> 01:01:24,779
<font size="36">I think both oppa and I need quite a bit of time.</font>

1223
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:28,937
<font size="36">Because last night was the first time we
had a serious conversation,</font>

1224
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:36,146
<font size="36">so I have a slight regret that if we had
talked sooner, it might have been easier to understand each other.</font>

1225
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:44,912
<font size="36">I think I honestly expressed all my turmoil.</font>

1226
01:01:44,945 --> 01:01:48,645
<font size="36">Seok-joo!! Don't end up with a bad guy!! Otherwise, you'll become like your mother.</font>

1227
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:52,345
<font size="36">She should have chosen Sun-jun... Sigh.</font>

1228
01:01:52,983 --> 01:01:55,412
<font size="36">No, he's not a bad guy.</font>

1229
01:01:56,084 --> 01:01:57,012
<font size="36">He's a bit like a bad guy.</font>

1230
01:01:57,084 --> 01:01:58,179
<font size="36">Jun-ho's father is next to him.</font>

1231
01:01:58,404 --> 01:02:00,812
<font size="36">Ah, that's right. Was Dad here...?! Ah, ah, Dad.</font>

1232
01:02:00,834 --> 01:02:04,379
<font size="36">Are the parents also speaking their minds on the last day?</font>

1233
01:02:04,412 --> 01:02:06,645
<font size="36">You shouldn't say it out loud like that.</font>

1234
01:02:06,945 --> 01:02:09,145
<font size="36">No, no, I'm just talking to myself.</font>

1235
01:02:09,179 --> 01:02:09,978
<font size="36">Ah, the last day.</font>

1236
01:02:09,979 --> 01:02:12,579
<font size="36">(It's the last day, so the atmosphere is even bolder.)
This atmosphere, this, this.</font>

1237
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:16,412
<font size="36">So everyone's last date ends,</font>

1238
01:02:17,212 --> 01:02:20,145
<font size="36">1 hour before the final choice.</font>

1239
01:02:21,479 --> 01:02:25,379
<font size="36">(Tak-soo & Soo-wan rest in the garden.)
Oh, it's the first time sitting here.</font>

1240
01:02:26,345 --> 01:02:32,612
<font size="36">Soo-wan still seems to have something to say...</font>

1241
01:02:34,245 --> 01:02:36,112
<font size="36">- Hmm, it's just that...
- Hmm.</font>

1242
01:02:41,312 --> 01:02:42,945
<font size="36">Anyway, I also</font>

1243
01:02:43,045 --> 01:02:44,912
<font size="36">The more time passed... - hmm.</font>

1244
01:02:44,945 --> 01:02:48,745
<font size="36">The time was too short, so I regret it. - Hmm.</font>

1245
01:02:48,845 --> 01:02:52,145
<font size="36">I think even if I had already made my choice,</font>

1246
01:02:53,012 --> 01:02:55,379
<font size="36">I would still want to go out and get to know them more. - Hmm.</font>

1247
01:02:55,412 --> 01:02:58,045
<font size="36">I thought so.</font>

1248
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:05,712
<font size="36">(Soo-wan shows initiative.)
Oh, Soo-wan talks like that again.</font>

1249
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,945
<font size="36">Meanwhile, Shin-hyang is inside the house.</font>

1250
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:17,179
<font size="36">Just in time, they face each other.</font>

1251
01:03:17,179 --> 01:03:17,879
<font size="36">Why are they sitting there?</font>

1252
01:03:21,245 --> 01:03:24,212
<font size="36">Aish, big glass doors are not good, big glass doors. Oh dear.</font>

1253
01:03:25,979 --> 01:03:28,779
<font size="36">Ah, I also need to have a final conversation with Tak-soo.</font>

1254
01:03:28,779 --> 01:03:29,478
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1255
01:03:29,479 --> 01:03:30,778
<font size="36">Just try talking to him.</font>

1256
01:03:30,779 --> 01:03:33,512
<font size="36">And say there's only one hour left, not much time.</font>

1257
01:03:33,612 --> 01:03:35,079
<font size="36">What time is it?</font>

1258
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:39,712
<font size="36">To have a final conversation with Tak-soo,</font>

1259
01:03:39,812 --> 01:03:44,712
<font size="36">and I want to express my feelings. I kept thinking that.</font>

1260
01:03:46,245 --> 01:03:50,512
<font size="36">(Shin-hyang invites Tak-soo for a final talk)
Hi, hi. Sit down.</font>

1261
01:03:50,779 --> 01:03:51,779
<font size="36">Oh my.</font>

1262
01:03:52,379 --> 01:03:54,946
<font size="36">Because of the memories with the LP - Hmm.</font>

1263
01:03:55,779 --> 01:03:56,478
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1264
01:03:56,479 --> 01:03:59,479
<font size="36">It's right to talk here.</font>

1265
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:13,778
<font size="36">For me, the moments in the LP room were truly memorable.</font>

1266
01:04:13,779 --> 01:04:19,012
<font size="36">From the first time Tak-soo and I learned about each other's preferences and styles in the LP room,</font>

1267
01:04:19,045 --> 01:04:21,012
<font size="36">I remember us becoming closer.</font>

1268
01:04:21,745 --> 01:04:25,612
<font size="36">The LP room on the first day.</font>

1269
01:04:26,012 --> 01:04:31,212
<font size="36">Tak-soo and Shin-hyang confirmed their preferences.</font>

1270
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:40,912
<font size="36">The place where the two first connected on the first day.</font>

1271
01:04:48,975 --> 01:04:54,779
<font size="36">Anyway, I have to talk to you one last time.</font>

1272
01:04:56,112 --> 01:05:00,512
<font size="36">What is the last thing Shin-hyang wants to say to Tak-soo...?</font>

1273
01:05:00,812 --> 01:05:03,479
<font size="36">Then something...</font>

1274
01:05:12,345 --> 01:05:15,045
<font size="36">I don't know. When I think about it,</font>

1275
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:18,278
<font size="36">Here...</font>

1276
01:05:18,312 --> 01:05:23,212
<font size="36">It's some kind of,
a really good memory.</font>

1277
01:05:23,245 --> 01:05:26,312
<font size="36">The only person who made me feel a flutter was you,</font>

1278
01:05:26,617 --> 01:05:28,479
<font size="36">because you were the first one,</font>

1279
01:05:31,545 --> 01:05:34,027
<font size="36">If it weren't for you,</font>

1280
01:05:34,617 --> 01:05:38,027
<font size="36">In this short time,</font>

1281
01:05:38,745 --> 01:05:42,245
<font size="36">I don't think I would have felt anything.</font>

1282
01:05:48,897 --> 01:05:52,645
<font size="36">Just a heartfelt gratitude for that.</font>

1283
01:05:54,845 --> 01:05:56,678
<font size="36">That feeling...</font>

1284
01:05:59,245 --> 01:06:01,312
<font size="36">That's right. Hmm.</font>

1285
01:06:04,445 --> 01:06:08,445
<font size="36">(Shin-hyang wants to say her final thanks.)</font>

1286
01:06:08,457 --> 01:06:10,345
<font size="36">Oh. She's showing such a kind heart.</font>

1287
01:06:10,912 --> 01:06:16,745
<font size="36">The two of them spent a lot of time together.</font>

1288
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:22,645
<font size="36">(On the first day, similar interests led to endless conversation.)</font>

1289
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:26,145
<font size="36">(A joyful day of confirming each other's feelings.)</font>

1290
01:06:29,145 --> 01:06:33,812
<font size="36">(A day when he couldn't hide his fluttering heart.)</font>

1291
01:06:34,679 --> 01:06:42,617
<font size="36">(And the past few days, he expressed his feelings for the first time)</font>

1292
01:06:42,717 --> 01:06:47,897
<font size="36">I think my feelings have been unwavering and very firm from the beginning until now.</font>

1293
01:06:50,367 --> 01:06:52,827
<font size="36">I hope we continue to live well in the future.</font>

1294
01:06:53,912 --> 01:07:02,779
<font size="36">In Shin-hyang's timeline, Tak-soo was always there.</font>

1295
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:12,012
<font size="36">The feelings I first felt here, the feelings I first confronted...</font>

1296
01:07:13,337 --> 01:07:14,067
<font size="36">Ah, truly.</font>

1297
01:07:17,217 --> 01:07:22,045
<font size="36">Emotions welling up from old memories.</font>

1298
01:07:24,345 --> 01:07:25,712
<font size="36">It's okay.</font>

1299
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:34,167
<font size="36">Because there were so many feelings I truly felt for the first time,</font>

1300
01:07:35,417 --> 01:07:37,179
<font size="36">I was also very surprised.</font>

1301
01:07:37,287 --> 01:07:43,897
<font size="36">At first, when I just got here, I wondered if I could develop such feelings?</font>

1302
01:07:44,267 --> 01:07:52,803
<font size="36">I think it was because of the precious moments when
we could feel so connected and close,</font>

1303
01:07:52,886 --> 01:08:02,178
<font size="36">and honestly share and understand each other's feelings in
such a short period, less than a week.</font>

1304
01:08:02,379 --> 01:08:05,546
<font size="36">(The moment these feelings were felt was truly precious.)</font>

1305
01:08:14,312 --> 01:08:16,740
<font size="36">It's just that, living here,</font>

1306
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,100
<font size="36">because of you,</font>

1307
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:21,420
<font size="36">that I was happy.</font>

1308
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:24,045
<font size="36">And it was interesting too.</font>

1309
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:30,312
<font size="36">We also talked a lot about things we sympathized with,</font>

1310
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:34,570
<font size="36">because you were the first person I talked to the most,</font>

1311
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:37,580
<font size="36">for Shin-hyang,</font>

1312
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:39,280
<font size="36">I truly feel sorry,</font>

1313
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:43,900
<font size="36">but on the other hand, I'm also very grateful.</font>

1314
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,080
<font size="36">You always chose me,</font>

1315
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,470
<font size="36">so I want to say thank you.</font>

1316
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,210
<font size="36">It was fun.</font>

1317
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:53,720
<font size="36">It was fun.</font>

1318
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:54,090
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1319
01:08:54,190 --> 01:08:54,720
<font size="36">It was fun.</font>

1320
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:58,045
<font size="36">Shall we go?</font>

1321
01:08:58,210 --> 01:08:58,879
<font size="36">Good luck.</font>

1322
01:08:59,060 --> 01:08:59,812
<font size="36">Let's go.</font>

1323
01:08:59,912 --> 01:09:03,670
<font size="36">Leaving behind the brief memories they shared,</font>

1324
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:07,879
<font size="36">the two left the LP room.</font>

1325
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:10,610
<font size="36">A beautiful ending.</font>

1326
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:12,640
<font size="36">Everyone has grown up so well.</font>

1327
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:13,640
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1328
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,879
<font size="36">(Dad also sees that his child has grown up)</font>

1329
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:22,312
<font size="36">Shin-hyang, from what I see,</font>

1330
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:26,009
<font size="36">this was not an easy decision, but her heart is very warm. The end.</font>

1331
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:26,410
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1332
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:28,260
<font size="36">It's wonderful.</font>

1333
01:09:29,079 --> 01:09:32,179
<font size="36">(Shin-hyang's father's eyes were red)</font>

1334
01:09:33,012 --> 01:09:36,112
<font size="36">(Soo-wan's father always quietly took care of everyone)</font>

1335
01:09:38,412 --> 01:09:43,540
<font size="36">I'm not sad that Shin-hyang and Tak-soo didn't work out,</font>

1336
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:45,679
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1337
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,345
<font size="36">It's that my daughter has grown up.</font>

1338
01:09:47,445 --> 01:09:49,510
<font size="36">That is, I can somewhat understand Shin-hyang's heart.</font>

1339
01:09:51,379 --> 01:09:52,246
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1340
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:54,079
<font size="36">This is that.</font>

1341
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:57,050
<font size="36">The Shin-hyang we see,</font>

1342
01:09:57,450 --> 01:10:01,150
<font size="36">and the image of Shin-hyang that her father sees will be different.</font>

1343
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:05,850
<font size="36">Yes, because her father is the one who saw her from birth,</font>

1344
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:14,145
<font size="36">thinking she was still in his arms, but she's grown up now.</font>

1345
01:10:14,179 --> 01:10:18,112
<font size="36">Shin-hyang learned to grow up on her own.</font>

1346
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:23,812
<font size="36">I don't think I raised her well, but she grew up well, I think.</font>

1347
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:26,012
<font size="36">No, that's not true. You raised her well. Don't say that.</font>

1348
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:31,150
<font size="36">I'm very satisfied that Shin-hyang did her best, regardless of success?</font>

1349
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:32,750
<font size="36">Then the problem is the next step,</font>

1350
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:39,912
<font size="36">Ultimately, she is a friend who knows how to distinguish clearly when to do something and when not to.</font>

1351
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,170
<font size="36">So, I think even if she lives in society,</font>

1352
01:10:45,253 --> 01:10:48,270
<font size="36">she will always do her
best and if she feels it's not right,</font>

1353
01:10:48,353 --> 01:10:50,745
<font size="36">she will never
bother others.</font>

1354
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:52,749
<font size="36">That is, she was raised really well.</font>

1355
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:53,412
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1356
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:57,750
<font size="36">I think it's really good.</font>

1357
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:00,250
<font size="36">I think Shin-hyang has matured much more than I thought.</font>

<font size="36">Everyone gathers in the common living room, let's end the 4 nights and 5 days we spent together.</font>

1359

1361
01:11:15,845 --> 01:11:16,645
<font size="36">If so, there.</font>

1362
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:18,346
<font size="36">Oh, shall we try sitting where we sat for the first time?</font>

1363

1369

moment feels like a very long time ago.</font>

1478
01:19:00,412 --> 01:19:02,779
<font size="36">[Shy]</font>

1479
01:19:04,104 --> 01:19:06,979
<font size="36">[Happy]</font>

1480
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:11,379
<font size="36">(Satisfied with his daughter's brave display.)
Soo-wan delivered her feelings clearly.</font>

1481
01:19:13,112 --> 01:19:16,579
<font size="36">Now it's time to confirm Tak-soo's sincere feelings.</font>

1482
01:19:20,562 --> 01:19:23,679
<font size="36">I think I also spoke simply.</font>

1483
01:19:25,779 --> 01:19:28,846
<font size="36">Yesterday and today were very fun,</font>

1484
01:19:29,445 --> 01:19:32,078
<font size="36">Thank you for creating beautiful memories.</font>

1485
01:19:32,579 --> 01:19:38,746
<font size="36">The person clearly in my heart is... you (Soo-wan).</font>

1486
01:19:42,279 --> 01:19:44,846
<font size="36">I was too embarrassed to say anything more.</font>

1487
01:19:44,879 --> 01:19:46,146
<font size="36">- Ah, my voice isn't like this, is it?
- Huh?</font>

1488
01:19:46,179 --> 01:19:47,579
<font size="36">This sounds different.</font>

1489
01:19:47,612 --> 01:19:48,345
<font size="36">Right?</font>

1490
01:19:48,812 --> 01:19:49,879
<font size="36">[Filled with smiles]</font>

1491
01:19:49,979 --> 01:19:52,079
<font size="36">Wow, Soo-wan is smiling so brightly.</font>

1492
01:19:52,645 --> 01:20:00,312
<font size="36">Oh, when I first came here, I never thought I would become the final couple.</font>

1493
01:20:00,412 --> 01:20:03,737
<font size="36">Becoming the final couple
like this is truly thrilling.</font>

1494
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:06,212
<font size="36">and I'm even happier because it's Tak-soo Oppa.</font>

1495
01:20:07,012 --> 01:20:12,179
<font size="36">Over the past 5 days, the warmest person in my heart was Soo-wan.</font>

1496
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:18,312
<font size="36">I also look forward to what the future holds.</font>

1497
01:20:18,379 --> 01:20:22,412
<font size="36">I think that depends on both of us.</font>

1498
01:20:23,445 --> 01:20:24,778
<font size="36">Oh, great~</font>

1499
01:20:26,912 --> 01:20:28,545
<font size="36">Congratulations.</font>

1500
01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:29,979
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

1501
01:20:30,045 --> 01:20:33,378
<font size="36">A friendly ending.</font>

1502
01:20:34,979 --> 01:20:37,612
<font size="36">Seok-joo and Shin-hyang at night.</font>

1503
01:20:37,645 --> 01:20:40,012
<font size="36">You talked a lot with Soo-wan, right?</font>

1504
01:20:40,745 --> 01:20:47,345
<font size="36">But, at that time, I thought Soo-wan had heard many good things from the older sisters.</font>

1505
01:20:47,445 --> 01:20:49,412
<font size="36">And then she gained confidence.</font>

1506
01:20:49,495 --> 01:20:53,712
<font size="36">Soo-wan grew more and more thanks to the older sisters.</font>

1507
01:20:53,823 --> 01:20:55,993
<font size="36">Yes. But looking at her bright smile,</font>

1508
01:20:56,293 --> 01:20:57,723
<font size="36">Hmm. I'm sorry.</font>

1509
01:21:00,053 --> 01:21:01,203
<font size="36">No, no, no, no.</font>

1510
01:21:03,937 --> 01:21:07,212
<font size="36">And there was another person waiting for Tak-soo.</font>

1511
01:21:18,108 --> 01:21:23,946
<font size="36">The final choice has ended.</font>

1512
01:21:25,749 --> 01:21:28,679
<font size="36">Although there are regrets, I don't think there are any regrets.</font>

1513
01:21:28,889 --> 01:21:30,079
<font size="36">That's right. Indeed.</font>

1514
01:21:30,429 --> 01:21:31,289
<font size="36">Of course.</font>

1515
01:21:32,829 --> 01:21:35,403
<font size="36">If I go out and meet someone,</font>

1516
01:21:35,486 --> 01:21:47,778
<font size="36">I think I can express my feelings without regret, just like what I felt here.</font>

1517
01:21:47,829 --> 01:21:48,009
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1518
01:21:48,829 --> 01:21:51,345
<font size="36">I think I'm most grateful to myself.</font>

1519
01:21:52,729 --> 01:21:54,779
<font size="36">I want to tell myself that I did very well.</font>

1520
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:56,979
<font size="36">Yes, you did well. You did well.</font>

1521
01:21:57,109 --> 01:22:00,289
<font size="36">Oh, Shin-hyang will become even more popular if she appears on broadcast.</font>

1522
01:22:00,879 --> 01:22:01,745
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1523
01:22:01,759 --> 01:22:02,379
<font size="36">Really.</font>

1524
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:09,937
<font size="36">Oh, Shin-hyang, in her
first dating experience,</font>

1525
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,437
<font size="36">even though it ultimately failed,</font>

1526
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,270
<font size="36">but as Shin-hyang said,</font>

1527
01:22:14,353 --> 01:22:17,679
<font size="36">I also feel grateful to Tak-soo for creating that time.</font>

1528
01:22:17,889 --> 01:22:20,512
<font size="36">And Lee Jong-hyuk, who gave birth to Tak-soo, also deserves thanks.</font>

1529
01:22:22,389 --> 01:22:23,189
<font size="36">A beautiful ending.</font>

1530
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:24,779
<font size="36">Ah, this now, it's wonderful.</font>

1531
01:22:24,799 --> 01:22:26,745
<font size="36">Oh, Shin-hyang is so like her father.</font>

1532
01:22:27,089 --> 01:22:29,849
<font size="36">Yes. Ah, Dad is also wonderful. Yes.</font>

1533
01:22:32,908 --> 01:22:33,812
<font size="36">Ah, it's Seok-joo.</font>

1534
01:22:36,479 --> 01:22:39,746
<font size="36">Who is Seok-joo's choice?</font>

1535
01:22:41,045 --> 01:22:42,678
<font size="36">Who will Seok-joo choose?</font>

1536
01:22:42,818 --> 01:22:45,128
<font size="36">I said it from the beginning.</font>

1537
01:22:45,698 --> 01:22:51,279
<font size="36">She's the type who's a good wife and daughter-in-law, likes older, funny people, and things like that,</font>

1538
01:22:51,878 --> 01:22:54,848
<font size="36">the image matches perfectly.</font>

1539
01:22:55,028 --> 01:22:55,879
<font size="36">However,</font>

1540
01:22:56,658 --> 01:22:59,879
<font size="36">I don't think Jun-ho will choose.</font>

1541
01:23:00,048 --> 01:23:01,845
<font size="36">Huh? Jun-ho?</font>

1542
01:23:01,879 --> 01:23:02,846
<font size="36">He will choose, won't he?</font>

1543
01:23:02,879 --> 01:23:03,979
<font size="36">Ah, Seok-joo chooses Jun-ho.</font>

1544
01:23:05,422 --> 01:23:07,212
<font size="36">But Jun-ho won't choose. - Yes.</font>

1545
01:23:08,153 --> 01:23:09,145
<font size="36">Seok-joo.</font>

1546
01:23:09,593 --> 01:23:12,545
<font size="36">What will their fate be?</font>

1547
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:14,079
<font size="36">I don't think he will choose.</font>

1548
01:23:14,112 --> 01:23:15,979
<font size="36">Huh? Ah, Jun-ho.</font>

1549
01:23:16,012 --> 01:23:16,945
<font size="36">He will choose, won't he?</font>

1550
01:23:16,979 --> 01:23:21,812
<font size="36">Ah, Seok-joo chooses Jun-ho,
but Jun-ho won't choose.</font>

1551
01:23:22,153 --> 01:23:23,345
<font size="36">Seok-joo.</font>

1552
01:23:23,593 --> 01:23:27,212
<font size="36">Sun-jun's father is quietly worried.</font>

1553
01:23:29,193 --> 01:23:32,845
<font size="36">Sun-jun is going somewhere.</font>

1554
01:23:33,313 --> 01:23:36,545
<font size="36">Sun-jun and Jun-ho are going somewhere.</font>

1555
01:23:36,923 --> 01:23:40,945
<font size="36">- The same place, right?
- The same place.</font>

1556
01:23:42,223 --> 01:23:44,923
<font size="36">The only person I was wondering about was Seok-joo.</font>

1557
01:23:45,123 --> 01:23:45,779
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1558
01:23:49,423 --> 01:23:53,323
<font size="36">I also thought carefully about the meaning of the final choice,</font>

1559
01:23:53,923 --> 01:23:58,923
<font size="36">and whether that meaning aligns with my current thoughts about Seok-joo,</font>

1560
01:24:00,023 --> 01:24:04,323
<font size="36">I want to decide based on my feelings as the top priority.</font>

1561
01:24:04,723 --> 01:24:07,612
<font size="36">I want to look deep into my heart, but...</font>

1562
01:24:08,123 --> 01:24:10,223
<font size="36">with the final choice,</font>

1563
01:24:11,223 --> 01:24:15,912
<font size="36">is my heart in a state where I can choose someone?</font>

1564
01:24:16,623 --> 01:24:19,522
<font size="36">I wondered a lot about that.</font>

1565
01:24:19,523 --> 01:24:20,445
<font size="36">So...</font>

1566
01:24:23,723 --> 01:24:25,445
<font size="36">- There's no tape.
- What happened?</font>

1567
01:24:25,823 --> 01:24:28,112
<font size="36">There's no tape.</font>

1568
01:24:28,123 --> 01:24:30,245
<font size="36">She probably didn't choose.</font>

1569
01:24:31,723 --> 01:24:36,523
<font size="36">Seok-joo thought for a long time in the message room.</font>

1570
01:24:37,523 --> 01:24:40,123
<font size="36">I thought until the very last minute,</font>

1571
01:24:40,823 --> 01:24:45,323
<font size="36">but I felt my heart wasn't ready yet.</font>

1572
01:24:47,423 --> 01:24:51,879
<font size="36">I gave up the final choice.</font>

1573
01:24:53,023 --> 01:24:53,523
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1574
01:24:54,223 --> 01:24:56,645
<font size="36">Oh dear, what's wrong with that girl again.</font>

1575
01:24:57,123 --> 01:24:59,479
<font size="36">Ah, no wonder her hands are empty.</font>

1576
01:25:01,323 --> 01:25:02,323
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1577
01:25:05,523 --> 01:25:08,145
<font size="36">- Jun-ho doesn't have one either.
- Jun-ho also doesn't have a tape.</font>

1578
01:25:08,323 --> 01:25:09,012
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1579
01:25:10,023 --> 01:25:13,323
<font size="36">So, in the end, I thought a lot, but</font>

1580
01:25:14,123 --> 01:25:16,423
<font size="36">the meaning of the final choice that I thought of</font>

1581
01:25:17,423 --> 01:25:24,523
<font size="36">and my current feelings for Seok-joo didn't align, so I concluded</font>

1582
01:25:27,023 --> 01:25:29,879
<font size="36">that it's a shame, but I gave up the choice.</font>

1583
01:25:31,823 --> 01:25:34,245
<font size="36">I thought I was a very hasty person,</font>

1584
01:25:34,823 --> 01:25:40,123
<font size="36">conversely, I just realized that I am a very cautious person when there's no time.</font>

1585
01:25:40,723 --> 01:25:44,123
<font size="36">Conversely, when I came here,</font>

1586
01:25:44,423 --> 01:25:47,123
<font size="36">Ah, I originally felt comfortable with myself.</font>

1587
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:51,223
<font size="36">Conversely, I returned to the starting point.</font>

1588
01:25:51,523 --> 01:25:54,923
<font size="36">Is she a bit slower than I thought?</font>

1589
01:25:56,123 --> 01:26:02,123
<font size="36">I think it's best to be honest and true to yourself.</font>

1590
01:26:07,581 --> 01:26:13,745
<font size="36">Park Jun-ho and Seok-joo
gave up the final choice.</font>

1591
01:26:14,956 --> 01:26:17,779
<font size="36">Both seemed to have too little time to get to know each other.</font>

1592
01:26:18,536 --> 01:26:20,412
<font size="36">It seems both are the type of people who need more time to get to know someone.</font>

1593
01:26:20,576 --> 01:26:21,712
<font size="36">A bit longer.</font>

1594
01:26:21,996 --> 01:26:23,345
<font size="36">Can it be this wonderful too?</font>

1595
01:26:24,056 --> 01:26:26,145
<font size="36">Their personalities are similar, so their choices are also similar.</font>

1596
01:26:26,216 --> 01:26:27,145
<font size="36">It's funny.</font>

1597
01:26:30,725 --> 01:26:36,312
<font size="36">Sun-jun alone with the tape.</font>

1598
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:49,012
<font size="36">The final choice has ended.</font>

1599
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:51,212
<font size="36">Ah... my heart aches.</font>

1600
01:26:52,312 --> 01:26:55,012
<font size="36">(Sun-jun's choice was Seok-joo.)</font>

1601
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:58,310
<font size="36">Anyway, I've already made my choice.</font>

1602
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,700
<font size="36">True to Sun-jun, going straight to the end.</font>

1603
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,300
<font size="36">If it were before,</font>

1604
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:12,720
<font size="36">expressing sincere feelings might have been clumsier,</font>

1605
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,900
<font size="36">giving up immediately after a few failures,</font>

1606
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:20,200
<font size="36">or avoiding it, so that's how it was done.</font>

1607
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:25,279
<font size="36">but this time there are not many regrets,</font>

1608
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:27,912
<font size="36">everyone was still honest with their feelings,</font>

1609
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,500
<font size="36">and was able to clearly express their feelings until the very end,</font>

1610
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:36,079
<font size="36">so I think I can leave with a lot of growth.</font>

1611
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,679
<font size="36">Yes. That's right.</font>

1612
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:38,912
<font size="36">Well done.</font>

1613
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,600
<font size="36">Sun-jun has grown up a lot compared to the beginning,</font>

1614
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:42,379
<font size="36">Truly.</font>

1615
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,279
<font size="36">Sun-jun should also get applause.</font>

1616
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,712
<font size="36">Everyone learned a lot.</font>

1617
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,079
<font size="36">It seems he has grown up very quickly.</font>

1618
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:48,912
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1619
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,045
<font size="36">In 3 nights and 5 days.</font>

1620
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:54,900
<font size="36">Because I had absolutely no dating experience, I was very hesitant to join this program.</font>

1621
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:58,600
<font size="36">I was also hesitant, and Sun-jun was also very hesitant.</font>

1622
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:03,099
<font size="36">But the hesitant voice at the beginning and</font>

1623
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:06,300
<font size="36">the mature image at the end.</font>

1624
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,300
<font size="36">When I see this image,</font>

1625
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,845
<font size="36">even though he is in Japan now, I think our Sun-jun will grow up beautifully no matter where he is.</font>

1626
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,900
<font size="36">So the most important thing is!</font>

1627
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:23,012
<font size="36">Ahn, the nation's son-in-law, has been crowned.</font>

1628
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:26,900
<font size="36">This is the most important thing.</font>

1629
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,800
<font size="36">Even if he wasn't chosen here,</font>

1630
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,245
<font size="36">let's give him a round of applause.</font>

1631
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,700
<font size="36">He's receiving a lot of love from the audience.</font>

1632
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:35,799
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1633
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:36,100
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

1634
01:28:38,586 --> 01:28:45,106
<font size="36">Sa-yoon is still holding the tape tightly and waiting.</font>

1635
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:50,256
<font size="36">Since they've already confirmed their feelings,</font>

1636
01:28:50,956 --> 01:28:53,045
<font size="36">I think there's a bit of certainty.</font>

1637
01:28:55,686 --> 01:29:00,045
<font size="36">Seong-jun is nervously going somewhere.</font>

1638
01:29:02,221 --> 01:29:05,579
<font size="36">Will Sa-yoon be at the end of this road?</font>

1639
01:29:05,612 --> 01:29:09,245
<font size="36">Seong-jun is nervously going somewhere.</font>

1640
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:14,945
<font size="36">Will Sa-yoon be at the end of this road?</font>

1641
01:29:17,721 --> 01:29:22,545
<font size="36">Seong-jun's choice is still Sa-yoon.</font>

1642
01:29:24,314 --> 01:29:24,964
<font size="36">Oh, startled.</font>

1643
01:29:26,774 --> 01:29:28,012
<font size="36">[Shy]</font>

1644
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:28,879
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

1645
01:29:29,004 --> 01:29:29,912
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1646
01:29:30,034 --> 01:29:30,945
<font size="36">When did you arrive?</font>

1647
01:29:31,164 --> 01:29:32,012
<font size="36">I just got here.</font>

1648
01:29:34,582 --> 01:29:36,312
<font size="36">Ah, so beautiful. Very beautiful.</font>

1649
01:29:36,412 --> 01:29:40,112
<font size="36">- Congratulations.
- Thank you.</font>

1650
01:29:41,012 --> 01:29:43,245
<font size="36">20 years old, 24 years old. Good, right?</font>

1651
01:29:43,642 --> 01:29:44,445
<font size="36">Four years.</font>

1652
01:29:45,624 --> 01:29:46,645
<font size="36">Are you looking at the water?</font>

1653
01:29:46,974 --> 01:29:49,312
<font size="36">Oh, I've been waiting for a long time.</font>

1654
01:29:49,444 --> 01:29:50,779
<font size="36">Sorry.</font>

1655
01:29:52,954 --> 01:29:55,045
<font size="36">Were you worried that I wouldn't come?</font>

1656
01:29:55,914 --> 01:29:57,679
<font size="36">No? I thought you would come.</font>

1657
01:29:57,894 --> 01:29:58,579
<font size="36">Really?</font>

1658
01:29:59,414 --> 01:30:01,445
<font size="36">This is what I recorded.</font>

1659
01:30:01,604 --> 01:30:02,712
<font size="36">Me too.</font>

1660
01:30:05,174 --> 01:30:05,779
<font size="36">Here.</font>

1661
01:30:06,245 --> 01:30:07,712
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

1662
01:30:09,542 --> 01:30:11,532
<font size="36">Oh dear, just laughing out loud, really.</font>

1663
01:30:12,645 --> 01:30:16,612
<font size="36">We're going together...</font>

1664
01:30:18,845 --> 01:30:19,945
<font size="36">Hands are so cold.</font>

1665
01:30:20,044 --> 01:30:21,345
<font size="36">Ah, I was cold.</font>

1666
01:30:21,972 --> 01:30:23,912
<font size="36">Holding hands already? Holding hands?</font>

1667
01:30:24,162 --> 01:30:25,812
<font size="36">Holding hands already? Holding hands?</font>

1668
01:30:26,172 --> 01:30:27,112
<font size="36">Huh? What is it?</font>

1669
01:30:28,362 --> 01:30:29,112
<font size="36">No.</font>

1670
01:30:29,179 --> 01:30:30,379
<font size="36">It's over here too. It's over here too.</font>

1671
01:30:30,412 --> 01:30:31,779
<font size="36">Holding hands is the end.</font>

1672
01:30:31,872 --> 01:30:32,732
<font size="36">Ice skating rink? Yes.</font>

1673
01:30:33,222 --> 01:30:33,922
<font size="36">This is an ice skating rink.</font>

1674
01:30:34,362 --> 01:30:35,912
<font size="36">Ah, Tak-soo had a hard time holding hands.</font>

1675
01:30:36,122 --> 01:30:37,545
<font size="36">That's right. But they are so natural.</font>

1676
01:30:37,592 --> 01:30:38,542
<font size="36">Who held hands first?</font>

1677
01:30:39,172 --> 01:30:39,622
<font size="36">I don't know, both.</font>

1678
01:30:39,932 --> 01:30:41,745
<font size="36">Both held hands naturally without anyone telling them to.</font>

1679
01:30:41,922 --> 01:30:42,679
<font size="36">Like magnets?</font>

1680
01:30:42,732 --> 01:30:44,322
<font size="36">Wow, this. Wow, this.</font>

1681
01:30:45,362 --> 01:30:47,545
<font size="36">Ah, they'll go ice skating after this.</font>

1682
01:30:48,092 --> 01:30:49,112
<font size="36">It's done. It's done.</font>

1683
01:30:49,232 --> 01:30:50,551
<font size="36">They became a couple, and they're holding hands too.</font>

1684
01:30:50,552 --> 01:30:52,179
<font size="36">That's right. It's done. Oh, startled.</font>

1685
01:30:53,914 --> 01:30:54,845
<font size="36">The weather is chilly.</font>

1686
01:30:56,524 --> 01:31:00,512
<font size="36">What can Dad do even if he sees them holding hands?</font>

1687
01:31:02,074 --> 01:31:04,179
<font size="36">Dad also held Mom's hand...</font>

1688
01:31:07,342 --> 01:31:07,762
<font size="36">What can be done now?</font>

1689
01:31:08,282 --> 01:31:08,752
<font size="36">What can be done now?</font>

1690
01:31:09,242 --> 01:31:10,552
<font size="36">Dad and Mom...</font>

1691
01:31:11,082 --> 01:31:12,102
<font size="36">Dad also held Mom's hand.</font>

1692
01:31:12,562 --> 01:31:15,712
<font size="36">No, Dad and Mom holding hands is not the same.</font>

1693
01:31:17,102 --> 01:31:17,462
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1694
01:31:22,514 --> 01:31:26,445
<font size="36">When I went out, rice balls. Sa-yoon, keep a calm expression. I said that.</font>

1695
01:31:26,694 --> 01:31:28,045
<font size="36">Ah, can't do it now?</font>

1696
01:31:28,174 --> 01:31:28,912
<font size="36">Ah, really?</font>

1697
01:31:30,434 --> 01:31:31,279
<font size="36">It must be fun.</font>

1698
01:31:31,524 --> 01:31:32,079
<font size="36">Really.</font>

1699
01:31:32,934 --> 01:31:34,245
<font size="36">I really wanted to go.</font>

1700
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:36,412
<font size="36">She completely wanted to do this.</font>

1701
01:31:36,445 --> 01:31:38,045
<font size="36">That's right. Every time she saw it, she said it.</font>

1702
01:31:38,904 --> 01:31:40,179
<font size="36">I really thought she wouldn't be able to go.</font>

1703
01:31:40,524 --> 01:31:41,979
<font size="36">Did she achieve everything today?</font>

1704
01:31:44,384 --> 01:31:45,579
<font size="36">Oh. Wow.</font>

1705
01:31:46,154 --> 01:31:46,845
<font size="36">Oh dear.</font>

1706
01:31:47,564 --> 01:31:49,345
<font size="36">- It's cozier than I thought.
- What to do.</font>

1707
01:31:51,162 --> 01:31:54,079
<font size="36">- You shouldn't put your hand on her shoulder there.
- If it's just the two of them, who knows.</font>

1708
01:31:54,112 --> 01:31:55,379
<font size="36">They were holding hands just now.</font>

1709
01:31:55,412 --> 01:31:58,145
<font size="36">- This is a truly romantic game.
- Ah, that's right.</font>

1710
01:32:01,534 --> 01:32:02,479
<font size="36">Feeling nervous somehow.</font>

1711
01:32:03,114 --> 01:32:04,279
<font size="36">Going on this with oppa.</font>

1712
01:32:05,079 --> 01:32:06,712
<font size="36">It feels like everything has been achieved. Right?</font>

1713
01:32:06,812 --> 01:32:09,545
<font size="36">That's right. Today, I really,
haven't done this together until now.</font>

1714
01:32:09,579 --> 01:32:11,712
<font size="36">Ah, why! Why! Show the camera! Now!</font>

1715
01:32:12,179 --> 01:32:13,179
<font size="36">Why can't you film somewhere else!</font>

1716
01:32:13,479 --> 01:32:14,879
<font size="36">You have to show the inside.</font>

1717
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:18,112
<font size="36">You don't know what will happen when they reach the top.</font>

1718
01:32:19,879 --> 01:32:20,678
<font size="36">Do you hear it?</font>

1719
01:32:20,679 --> 01:32:21,678
<font size="36">Listen to it.</font>

1720
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:22,979
<font size="36">Ah, I really couldn't do it.</font>

1721
01:32:23,179 --> 01:32:23,779
<font size="36">Wait a moment.</font>

1722
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:37,179
<font size="36">Oh, I don't know where to start,</font>

1723
01:32:39,579 --> 01:32:44,879
<font size="36">but I think from the first day until now, I've always sent you messages only,</font>

1724
01:32:46,579 --> 01:32:50,612
<font size="36">hmm, you're the best person,</font>

1725
01:32:51,179 --> 01:32:57,079
<font size="36">and I thought you were the most wonderful person.</font>

1726
01:32:58,779 --> 01:33:04,379
<font size="36">Hmm, so my final choice is you.</font>

1727
01:33:05,879 --> 01:33:07,479
<font size="36">Ah, I'm so embarrassed.</font>

1728
01:33:08,379 --> 01:33:09,878
<font size="36">Ah, now my mouth can't close.</font>

1729
01:33:09,879 --> 01:33:10,679
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1730
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:13,812
<font size="36">Ah, my gums will dry out.</font>

1731
01:33:14,379 --> 01:33:15,279
<font size="36">Wow, this.</font>

1732
01:33:15,479 --> 01:33:16,912
<font size="36">Oh, Sa-yoon will probably run away from home.</font>

1733
01:33:17,379 --> 01:33:20,445
<font size="36">Dad, Sa-yoon will probably run away from home.</font>

1734
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:22,879
<font size="36">Does she come home these days?</font>

1735
01:33:26,379 --> 01:33:27,079
<font size="36">Ah, truly captivated.</font>

1736
01:33:27,579 --> 01:33:28,279
<font size="36">Wow, what to do.</font>

1737
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:29,779
<font size="36">Oh dear, so beautiful.</font>

1738
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:32,879
<font size="36">Hello?</font>

1739
01:33:33,279 --> 01:33:38,479
<font size="36">I hope the 5 days I spent with you</font>

1740
01:33:39,979 --> 01:33:43,212
<font size="36">will be a happy memory.</font>

1741
01:33:43,779 --> 01:33:50,545
<font size="36">I've liked oppa from the first time he appeared until now,</font>

1742
01:33:50,779 --> 01:33:57,279
<font size="36">and I hope we'll have time to get to know each other more when we leave here.</font>

1743
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:05,079
<font size="36">I think I still have a lot of things to tell oppa,</font>

1744
01:34:05,979 --> 01:34:12,379
<font size="36">so I want to meet oppa often and talk more in the future.</font>

1745
01:34:18,879 --> 01:34:21,879
<font size="36">The 5-day period has ended, but</font>

1746
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:27,845
<font size="36">I don't think this is the end but rather a possible beginning for us, so I have high hopes.</font>

1747
01:34:28,579 --> 01:34:29,579
<font size="36">We're back here again.</font>

1748
01:34:29,879 --> 01:34:31,178
<font size="36">That's right. This time it's the two of them.</font>

1749
01:34:31,179 --> 01:34:31,879
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1750
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:34,979
<font size="36">Oh dear.</font>

1751
01:34:35,079 --> 01:34:35,679
<font size="36">They've become the final couple.</font>

1752
01:34:36,179 --> 01:34:37,978
<font size="36">Wedding invitations will be coming soon.</font>

1753
01:34:37,979 --> 01:34:38,779
<font size="36">Wedding invitations.</font>

1754
01:34:40,479 --> 01:34:43,679
<font size="36">Aish, I've said it from the beginning and throughout this process,</font>

1755
01:34:43,779 --> 01:34:46,245
<font size="36">because I cherished Sa-yoon so much,</font>

1756
01:34:46,579 --> 01:34:48,212
<font size="36">I actually didn't pay attention to anyone else.</font>

1757
01:34:48,279 --> 01:34:48,779
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1758
01:34:49,879 --> 01:34:51,979
<font size="36">Ah, Dad also had feelings.</font>

1759
01:34:52,279 --> 01:34:53,578
<font size="36">Let's talk tomorrow.</font>

1760
01:34:53,579 --> 01:34:53,779
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1761
01:34:54,179 --> 01:34:55,645
<font size="36">Our son is this good, truly.</font>

1762
01:34:55,779 --> 01:34:56,578
<font size="36">Yes, ah, of course.</font>

1763
01:34:56,579 --> 01:34:59,179
<font size="36">Although I also watched Seong-jun throughout,</font>

1764
01:34:59,479 --> 01:35:00,679
<font size="36">sincere and kind,</font>

1765
01:35:00,979 --> 01:35:01,479
<font size="36">Aish, so good.</font>

1766
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:02,779
<font size="36">Putting those things aside,</font>

1767
01:35:03,579 --> 01:35:06,279
<font size="36">if my daughter likes him, then I like him too.</font>

1768
01:35:06,479 --> 01:35:07,079
<font size="36">Wow.</font>

1769
01:35:07,579 --> 01:35:08,645
<font size="36">Now, set the date.</font>

1770
01:35:12,647 --> 01:35:17,297
<font size="36">Yes, so, the story, yes, all the final choices have ended.</font>

1771
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:19,217
<font size="36">Yes, how does everyone feel?</font>

1772
01:35:19,877 --> 01:35:26,770
<font size="36">I think the common point among the parents here, the fathers, mothers,</font>

1773
01:35:26,853 --> 01:35:31,666
<font size="36">is that they watched aspects of their children that they had never known before, through the screen.</font>

1774
01:35:31,667 --> 01:35:31,967
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1775
01:35:31,967 --> 01:35:32,187
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1776
01:35:32,397 --> 01:35:36,407
<font size="36">Ah, I feel very proud that my child seems to have grown much more than when he was with me.</font>

1777
01:35:36,737 --> 01:35:40,257
<font size="36">After 4 nights and 5 days, I saw him grow a lot, so I'm very proud.</font>

1778
01:35:40,577 --> 01:35:43,287
<font size="36">I learned a lot from the 8 sons and daughters.</font>

1779
01:35:43,777 --> 01:35:49,247
<font size="36">Later when they grow up, if they watch this video at our age, they might revisit those emotions.</font>

1780
01:35:49,657 --> 01:35:57,370
<font size="36">At this very young age of 24, my child created
a beautiful memory, a beautiful love,</font>

1781
01:35:57,453 --> 01:36:01,966
<font size="36">and participating in this program, as a
father, I think it was a very good choice.</font>

1782
01:36:01,967 --> 01:36:02,979
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1783
01:36:03,227 --> 01:36:05,096
<font size="36">Yes, can I speak next?</font>

1784
01:36:05,097 --> 01:36:05,587
<font size="36">Ah, is that so?</font>

1785
01:36:05,957 --> 01:36:08,267
<font size="36">I also agree with my in-law.</font>

1786
01:36:10,237 --> 01:36:11,256
<font size="36">Ah, it seems they participated well.</font>

1787
01:36:11,257 --> 01:36:11,617
<font size="36">Yes, yes.</font>

1788
01:36:11,618 --> 01:36:12,987
<font size="36">Yes, I was also very worried.</font>

1789
01:36:14,017 --> 01:36:15,567
<font size="36">But I'm the only mother here.</font>

1790
01:36:16,077 --> 01:36:20,017
<font size="36">So, I was really worried as a daughter and also scolded her a lot.</font>

1791
01:36:20,727 --> 01:36:22,979
<font size="36">But conversely, watching this,</font>

1792
01:36:23,077 --> 01:36:30,766
<font size="36">I suddenly realized that I didn't need to worry that much, children in their twenties still have their innocence, most of them are like that.</font>

1793
01:36:30,767 --> 01:36:34,656
<font size="36">So maybe it's better to be more at ease?</font>

1794
01:36:34,657 --> 01:36:41,966
<font size="36">And if they always meet each other with such lovely images, then there's really nothing to worry about.</font>

1795
01:36:41,967 --> 01:36:42,566
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

1796
01:36:42,567 --> 01:36:45,377
<font size="36">So my heart was just overflowing with emotions and</font>

1797
01:36:45,667 --> 01:36:47,366
<font size="36">that's it.</font>

1798
01:36:47,367 --> 01:36:47,867
<font size="36">Hmm.</font>

1799
01:36:48,697 --> 01:36:54,257
<font size="36">That's right, I had a lot of fears and worries, it was such a time.</font>

1800
01:36:55,047 --> 01:37:00,937
<font size="36">I also sat here and felt that no matter what circumstances I'm in or whoever I meet,</font>

1801
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:09,426
<font size="36">my parents always supported me, so this is a program where I also learned a lot.</font>

1802
01:37:09,427 --> 01:37:11,566
<font size="36">Yes, yes. The best dating show.</font>

1803
01:37:11,567 --> 01:37:13,377
<font size="36">Please keep in touch with your parents often.</font>

1804
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:15,766
<font size="36">Ah, I do it every day.</font>

1805
01:37:15,767 --> 01:37:16,426
<font size="36">Yes, yes, yes.</font>

1806
01:37:16,427 --> 01:37:17,167
<font size="36">Ah, yes.</font>

1807
01:37:17,567 --> 01:37:22,347
<font size="36">Let's find my children who are yearning for love, we should also come back with Season 2.</font>

1808
01:37:22,767 --> 01:37:24,966
<font size="36">This is the end of the show. Thank you.</font>

1809
01:37:24,967 --> 01:37:25,566
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

1810
01:37:25,567 --> 01:37:28,067
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

1811
01:37:30,727 --> 01:37:31,667
<font size="36">What else is coming?</font>

1812
01:37:32,747 --> 01:37:33,379
<font size="36">Huh?</font>

1813
01:37:33,937 --> 01:37:35,845
<font size="36">Oh my God.</font>

1814
01:37:40,845 --> 01:37:43,078
<font size="36">It's time to leave.</font>

1815
01:37:43,097 --> 01:37:44,527
<font size="36">It's time to leave now.</font>

1816
01:37:44,957 --> 01:37:45,797
<font size="36">Ah.</font>

1817
01:37:49,167 --> 01:37:50,077
<font size="36">Can we go now?</font>

1818
01:37:50,667 --> 01:37:52,767
<font size="36">Do we have to go home?</font>

1819
01:37:59,267 --> 01:37:59,567
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

1820
01:38:00,167 --> 01:38:00,967
