1
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,040
What's your name?

2
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,520
Fusu,

3
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,200
I heard that mermen are never afraid of poison,

4
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,520
Is that true?

5
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,360
Don't worry.

6
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,320
There's no poison in the food.

7
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,840
This dagger is made of merman's fins.

8
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,200
Is it beautiful?

9
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,240
Do you know whose fin this is?

10
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,760
Your Excellency,

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,440
this is a clue from Supreme Court

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,600
about the murderer of Old State Preceptor,

13
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,280
Excuse me.

14
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,640
After searching for more than a month,

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,480
I found out this little thing.

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,840
What a bunch of losers.

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,440
Aren't you going to kill me?

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,160
Why should I kill you?

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,920
I'm your prisoner.

20
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,760
They are born of mermen and mermen.

21
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,400
Except for my mother,

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,760
no one who has seen me likes me.

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,040
How could it be?

24
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,000
I like

25
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,120
your eyes a lot,

26
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,760
Junior Sister,

27
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,200
Junior Sister,

28
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,120
You.

29
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,640
Sister,

30
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,000
Ah,

31
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Who are you?

32
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,040
Senior Brother, why are you running away?

33
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,720
I'm not running.

34
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,240
Did you watch Daqin State Preceptor

35
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,160
flirt with a merman in broad daylight?

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,920
I just want to get more information about Nan Zhao from him.

37
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,960
I have plenty of information

38
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,240
in Supreme Court,

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,400
Besides,

40
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,000
do I need to hold my chin

41
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,080
to interrogate information?

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,000
Do you really think I'm the Grand Tutor of Daqin?

43
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,280
Only by this face?

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,640
Don't you think so?

45
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,680
Forget it if you don't believe me.

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,960
Senior Tutor,

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,800
take care. I believe you,

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
Of course I believe you.

49
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,840
Junior sister,

50
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,120
if you don't feel at ease, you can give him to me.

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,720
No need.

52
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,080
I'll cover for you

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,080
I'll look into it myself.

54
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,840
Your Excellency, bad news.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,960
Young master and that merman got into a fight.
