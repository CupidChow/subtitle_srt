1
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,880
Master, please tell me that

2
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,600
there was a serial murder in the city last night.

3
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,680
The one who died was Li An, Vice President of Supreme Court.

4
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,040
National Normal University has a better eye than us.

5
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,840
I'm sure you'll know at a glance

6
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,760
that the wound was indeed caused by merman's fin.

7
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,280
But so what?

8
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,160
Everyone in Daqin State knows,

9
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,680
your State Preceptor's Mansion keeps mermen privately,

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,880
You have to hand in the merman today.

11
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,120
You have to hand it in if you don't.

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Ridiculous.

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,040
As the State Preceptor's Mansion,

14
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,920
is it a place where you can run wild whenever you want?

15
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,920
Help! Get them

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,200
out of here.

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,440
Who dares?

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,440
Who dares to hurt her?

19
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,640
As you can see,

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
in the past few days,

21
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,320
This little merman is imprisoned in my room every day,

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,120
if the Supreme Minister of Dali still insists on pestering me,

23
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,160
I don't mind

24
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,480
telling you about my boudoir.

25
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Shame on you!

26
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
I will find the evidence.

27
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,360
Let's go.

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,480
You killed someone.

29
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,480
No, I didn't.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,880
Don't tell me.

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,120
Only these two chains can tie you down.

32
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,320
If I really want to kill someone,

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,400
I won't give them a chance to redress their grievances.

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,400
You're quite proud of yourself.

35
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,040
My State Preceptor's Mansion is in disarray.

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,480
Are you satisfied?

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,120
No, I didn't.

38
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,840
From now on,

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
get out of the master's mansion,

40
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,800
Don't let me see you again.
