1
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,400
Gu Danmo,

2
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,360
you really let me down.

3
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,440
Guards,

4
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,760
take this spy to the prison.

5
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,520
Sir.

6
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,440
My lord,

7
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,720
sister,

8
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,080
Sir,

9
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,080
are you all right, sir?

10
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,520
Sir,

11
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,560
go get the royal physician!

12
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,960
Weixu.

13
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,360
Don't worry.

14
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,160
State Preceptor, great man and good man have their own heaven.

15
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,320
Let's go.

16
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,000
Stop pretending.

17
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,280
They're all gone.

18
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,600
It's not easy for me to take a day off,

19
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,840
I want to make good use of it.

20
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Maybe,

21
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,560
I still have a merman in my belly,

22
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,000
Otherwise, why am I always so tired?

23
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,200
Nonsense?

24
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,360
What nonsense?

25
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,160
Otherwise, why can't the dagger hurt me?

26
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,240
Well,

27
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,760
Maybe only my mother knows that.

28
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,360
Guards,

29
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,240
Guards,

30
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,160
Sir,

31
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,120
you're awake.

32
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,440
Write a letter for me His Majesty

33
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,280
asked me to lead Lin Weixu to Beiqi

34
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,680
to rescue Princess Yan Chu of merman

35
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,640
Yes.

36
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,920
Your Excellency is awake.

37
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,360
Now you feel at ease.

38
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,080
Yes.
