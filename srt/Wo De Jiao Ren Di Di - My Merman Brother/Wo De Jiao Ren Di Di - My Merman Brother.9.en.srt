1
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
Is it still hot?

2
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,360
Where are you going?

3
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,840
I shouldn't be in the State Preceptor's Mansion.

4
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,120
This is an order from the State Preceptor.

5
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,720
We were like that last night.

6
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,520
What happened to you and me?

7
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,040
Last night,

8
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,040
You,

9
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,720
Me,

10
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,800
Don't you remember?

11
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,720
No matter what happens,

12
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,400
State Preceptor will not be responsible for it.

13
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,760
Don't you think so?

14
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,960
Fusu,

15
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,160
I'm really sorry, State Preceptor.

16
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,120
Adult mermen go crazy every full moon night.

17
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,120
So I really don't remember

18
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,440
what happened last night?

19
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,920
If I do anything out of line,

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,080
please punish me, State Preceptor.

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,280
A full moon night is abnormal,

22
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,520
you are a merman not a werewolf,

23
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,080
You think I'm so gullible,

24
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,960
but State Preceptor doesn't believe me anyway.

25
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,240
I'll get going.

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,320
Stop!

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,800
I was very satisfied with your performance last night.

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,560
Then.

29
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,120
Your Excellency is willing to take responsibility for me.

30
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,000
Let me think about it.

31
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,920
Are you going to kick me out?

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,160
Stay here for now.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,760
Mermen

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,720
are in estrus at the age of 18.

35
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,440
Every night when the moon is full, the strength is weak

36
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,680
and the Qi is weak. Once combined,

37
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,880
You only recognize one person in your life.

38
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,560
What do you think?

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,480
Is it good?

40
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,840
Delicious.

41
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,560
Sit down and eat together.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,680
My mother loved your human food,

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,840
when she was little,

44
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,920
She often makes me cold cakes,

45
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,360
but why don't you eat them?

46
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,560
After my mother disappeared,

47
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,360
I never ate it again.

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,760
Even if some people haven't seen the memories and good tastes

49
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,280
they left us for a long time.

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,760
It will make us reminisce for the rest of our lives.

51
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,560
She left so early,

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,360
I can hardly remember what she looked like.

53
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,080
I remember

54
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,120
your mother's name is Yanchu, right?

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,160
Your Excellency, have you met my mother?
