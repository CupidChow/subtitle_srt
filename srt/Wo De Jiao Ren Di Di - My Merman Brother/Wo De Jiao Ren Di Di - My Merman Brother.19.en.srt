1
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,520
Grand Tutor,

2
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,880
the file you asked for has arrived.

3
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,640
Grand Tutor.

4
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,800
Grand Tutor.

5
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,840
Grand Tutor.

6
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,000
Lord Ning,

7
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,120
Grand Tutor,

8
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,840
I didn't expect that you're good at weapons.

9
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,600
First, Li An,

10
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,720
then Ning Yi,

11
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,880
They all had a grudge against Fusu.

12
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,760
Besides,

13
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,400
the way to die is almost the same.

14
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,840
A bunch of losers,

15
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,240
Fusu escaped from prison.

16
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,440
I'm sure

17
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,040
Fusu is the murderer.

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,480
There's not even a single fish in Daqin's prison,

19
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,640
Lin Weixu,

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,920
Is this the result of your promise?

21
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,440
If Your Majesty wants to punish me,

22
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,400
just give the order.

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:09,880
You.

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,080
The murderer of Nanzhao has not been determined and the spy of Beiqi has not been caught,

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,000
why are you holding on to a merman?

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,000
At this point,

27
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,240
you still have to defend him.

28
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,320
I'm just talking about the matter.

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,360
As for Fusu,

30
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,440
I will capture him personally.

31
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,920
Give everyone an explanation.

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,480
Okay

33
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,960
If I can't catch you back, you don't have to be a State Preceptor.

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,200
Your Excellency,

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,040
have some fruit.

36
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,880
We have news about Fusu's movements.

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,040
Your Excellency,

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,920
Fusu is going to commit a crime now.

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,240
Walls have ears.

40
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,760
What are you afraid of? I was ordered to investigate.

41
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,760
Hurry up!

42
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,080
Grand Tutor didn't attend the morning court before,

43
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,600
but now he refuses to show up.

44
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,040
What's going on?

45
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,800
Grand Tutor has been working day and night on the case of Beiqi spies,

46
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,840
please wait a bit longer.

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,000
Junior Sister.

48
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,080
Why do you look so pale?

49
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,840
You don't look much better.

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,120
I was attacked by that merman

51
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,480
Fu Su

52
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,160
I must have provoked him before.

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,680
That's why he retaliated against me.

54
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,440
Unfortunately,

55
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm not as strong as him.

56
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,760
Or did he run away?
