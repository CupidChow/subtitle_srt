1
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,960
Don't do this to me.

2
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,400
Your Excellency, why did you wronged

3
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,000
your Excellency?

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,280
Young master is awake.

5
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,040
Darn it.

6
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,880
It's so hateful.

7
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,680
I can't believe I fell for such a low-end trick.

8
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,800
Darn it.

9
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,440
Are you okay?

10
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,880
It's okay.

11
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,400
How could I be okay?

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,760
Nothing happened.

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,040
You really scared me.

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,320
It's all my fault.

15
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,360
Let's go!

16
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,000
Merman blood

17
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,320
can resist all kinds of poisons.

18
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,080
It's true.

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,040
I'll poison you to death at any time.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,240
Fu Su

21
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,840
Your Majesty,

22
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,040
these are all the letters I got from Chen Moxi.

23
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,480
Now that she has been assassinated,

24
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,480
she may die soon.

25
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,520
It must be just an abandoned child of Beiqi.

26
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,280
And the one who really harmed our Daqin

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,160
is someone else?

28
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,120
When my master was killed two months ago,

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,040
the murderer left the murder weapon at the scene.

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,120
I'm sure that

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,400
the murderer must be a spy of Beiqi.

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,320
I hope His Majesty can order a thorough investigation.

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,320
I've been investigating it thoroughly

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,680
State Preceptor

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,520
What else do you want me to give you?

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,680
I guess,

37
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,440
the mastermind behind this scene must be an important official in the court.

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,720
I hope,

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,320
we can search the residences of all the officials above Grade 1,

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,200
Ridiculous.

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,720
Grand Tutor asks to see you,

42
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,240
Announce it.

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

44
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,640
Grand Tutor,

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,160
can you read this letter?

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,720
Your Majesty,

47
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,360
this letter is heavily encrypted,

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,000
I really don't understand.

49
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
And this dagger

50
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,680
is made by the caudal fin of Yan Chu, the most beautiful woman in the South China Sea.

51
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,240
Are you serious?

52
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,440
I like to collect world-famous paintings,

53
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,600
among which,

54
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,520
There is a portrait of Yan Chu,

55
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
and,

56
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,960
She is the biological mother of Fusu, a merman.

57
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,120
The merman must have some ulterior motive

58
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,520
to approach the State Preceptor.

59
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Your Majesty, please put him in prison

60
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,520
and interrogate Yan Chu's whereabouts,

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,520
Revenge for my master.

62
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,520
That makes sense.

63
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,400
Put the merman into the prison,

64
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,400
Your Majesty,
