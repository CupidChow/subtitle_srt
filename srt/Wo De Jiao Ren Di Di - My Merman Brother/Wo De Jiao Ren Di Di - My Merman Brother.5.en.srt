1
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,560
There must be news of your mother in the State Preceptor's Mansion.

2
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,800
There must be

3
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,480
Miss Jiu,

4
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,880
What happened?

5
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,560
Hand over the merman!

6
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,520
I can spare your life.

7
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,120
Give it to me!

8
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,640
Hand it over.

9
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,800
Aren't you afraid of Supreme Court?

10
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,280
You scumbags.

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,360
Even when State Preceptor is not around,

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,320
he dares to come here and shout,

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:14,920
Bullshit!

14
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
I'm the Vice President of Supreme Court.

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,120
You want to commit a crime of hiding mermen.

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,680
I'm here under the order of Supreme Court to interrogate you.

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,600
Stop slinging mud at me.

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,920
You abused the captives first,

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,760
State Preceptor temporarily sheltered them according to the rules of Daqin.

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,440
It makes sense.

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,360
Wait.

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,680
You mistreated the captives,

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,280
but that merman is no ordinary captives,

24
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,040
Thank you.

25
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,920
He helped me vent my anger.

26
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,840
Good buddy.

27
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,440
You merman jerk

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,760
dared to hurt me.

29
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,200
Kill him!

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:55,720
Go,

31
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,120
Kill him!

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,360
Go, go, go!

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,160
If you disturb the State Preceptor's Mansion again,

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,320
I'll make you feel like you can't stand up for the rest of your life.

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,200
Get lost!

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,920
Wow,

37
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,320
I didn't expect this guy to be so fierce,

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,280
Lin Ru practices

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,400
ink, Xi.

40
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,600
Your Majesty,

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,600
State Preceptor released all merman captives.

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,080
You even kept mermen without permission.

43
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
He even encouraged mermen

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,040
to severely injure Vice President of Supreme Court.

45
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,560
You can't leave it alone.

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,960
Nonsense,

47
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,640
State Preceptor.

48
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,120
Do you really take the lead in raising enemy captives privately

49
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,080
Your Majesty

50
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,040
Fu Su is kind by nature,

51
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,840
not an orthodox merman in Nanzhao.

52
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,280
He's not a prisoner of the enemy.

53
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,360
With strong arguments,

54
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,960
I destroyed Nanzhao in one fell swoop,

55
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,000
Your Majesty, do you still count the rewards

56
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,160
you promised me?

57
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,080
Of course.

58
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,080
Okay,

59
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,360
Then I don't want anything.

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
As long as that merman is here,

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,880
I hope Your Majesty will grant me permission.

62
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,560
You.

63
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,120
Take care of that guy.

64
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,600
If it happens again,

65
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,520
Send it to the frontier. Thank you,

66
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,680
Your Majesty.

67
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,440
Your Majesty,

68
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,600
that merman is cruel by nature,

69
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,760
I'll take my leave now.

70
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,800
The murderer of Master.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,680
So far, there is no definite clue.

72
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,600
I hope Senior Tutor can pay more attention to it.
