1
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,960
What's the matter?

2
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,680
What do you want to do?

3
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,360
Somebody,

4
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,480
stop yelling.

5
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,760
No one will come.

6
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,320
I treated you well.

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,040
Why do you

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,560
treat me so well.

9
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,920
I was born humble.

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,400
Even the Supreme Minister of Dali is one head higher than me, isn't he?

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,240
If I really look down on you,

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,320
how can you take the position of Senior Tutor?

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,400
Shut up!

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,360
Grand Tutor, Grand Tutor,

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,000
I hate Grand Tutor the most.

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,120
I'd rather be illiterate.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,640
I don't want to be treated as vulnerable trash.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,880
State Preceptor,

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,960
do you think so too?

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,680
Of course

21
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
not.

22
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,960
Junior Sister,

23
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,520
You.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What's wrong, brother?

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,120
You've been lying to me.

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,840
Or what?

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,880
Don't make me hurt you.

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,280
Just like you hurt my master.

29
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,720
Master won't let me marry you.

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,480
Of course I can't keep him.

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,760
It's really you.

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,600
When I kill this dog emperor,

33
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,040
I'll be the new emperor of Qin State,

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,120
When the time comes,

35
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,640
you'll be my empress,

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,480
Wouldn't everyone be happy?

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,800
As for your Fu Su,

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,600
I killed her a long time ago.

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,080
No one can stop me.

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,720
What do you think?

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,080
you guys

42
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,080
I'm suffocating Brother-in-law,

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,040
what kind of fish skin are you using It smells fishy,

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,240
It's killing me.

45
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,960
Sir.

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,040
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,880
I never meant to kick you out.

48
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,560
I know.

49
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,560
I'll get you out of here.

50
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,520
No,

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,280
If he finds out that I'm not here,

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,760
he'll definitely change his original plan.

53
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,640
Gu Danmo's purpose is to steal from the world,

54
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,280
please be fully prepared.

55
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,080
I underestimated him.

56
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,880
You're finally

57
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,120
willing to believe me this time.
