00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,600
Sis,

2
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,480
I heard that my brother-in-law is causing trouble again,

3
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,800
What brother-in-law?

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,040
Fusu, of course.

5
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,480
He saved me with blood.

6
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,360
It's my brother-in-law,

7
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,520
isn't it? Moxi.

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,560
It's up to me to decide who your brother-in-law is.

9
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,720
Got it?

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,880
Cut,

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,800
Change your mind when you see something different,

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,000
then abandon everything after chaos?

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,920
Did you find it?

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,280
I've searched everywhere I can.

15
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,600
It's cute.

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,520
Let him stay in the mansion.

17
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
Aren't you going to kill me?

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,880
I told you,

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,920
I like you.

20
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,400
Your Excellency, from now on, I will only recognize you in this life.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,120
Think about it carefully.

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,040
Or you're dead.

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,760
You saved me again.

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,640
I'm here.

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,160
I won't let you get hurt.

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,840
Next time, without my permission,

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
you are not allowed to use spells on anyone.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,080
Who's against you?

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,560
I'll provoke anyone.

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,240
Now I'm your man.

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,800
I want you to be fine.

32
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,520
Your Excellency,

33
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,680
that's why you approached me,

34
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,360
Just to investigate your mother.

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,680
Really?

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,480
What did you find?

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,680
There's something wrong with Gu Danmo.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,880
He's not a good man,

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,160
His internal energy is extremely high.

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,600
I saw it with my own eyes that day.

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,280
He must be good at it.

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
If I say he's been lying to you,

43
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,720
will you believe me?

44
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,520
Junior Sister,
