1
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,080
My Lord,

2
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,080
when did you know that dagger belonged to your mother?

3
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,960
The first time we met,

4
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,840
the first time.

5
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,040
So you approached me,

6
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,680
just to investigate your mother.

7
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,080
Yes.

8
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,400
What did you find?

9
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,440
There's something wrong with Gu Danmo.

10
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,560
He's not a good man,

11
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,840
At this point, you're still slinging mud at me.

12
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,800
He does have a portrait of your mother.

13
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,160
But that's what he got when he was the envoy of the two countries.

14
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,000
Dan Mo is not talented enough.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,080
He's not as talented as you are.

16
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,000
Lack of talent, lack of learning,

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,360
no knowledge of political affairs,

18
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,480
Brother,

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,000
how come?

20
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,320
State Preceptor.

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,680
This is Master's handwriting,

22
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:50,960
light ink,

23
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,240
Weixu,

24
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,360
perfect match.

25
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,800
Youngest Sister,

26
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,040
your master has already made a will,

27
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,280
But

28
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,960
I know you have no feelings for me.

29
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,480
So,

30
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,760
I didn't tell you.

31
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,200
Senior Brother,

32
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
you haven't called me Senior Brother for a long time.

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,640
How is the investigation of Yanchu's case going?

34
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,440
I don't have a clue yet.

35
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,000
After all, Yan Chu has been missing for so many years,

36
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,360
all I know is that

37
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,800
she is now the queen of Beiqi,

38
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,960
She used to be the queen of Nanzhao,

39
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
such a woman,

40
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,920
All of this

41
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,240
should be Beiqi's plot.

42
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,000
Including that merman,

43
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,800
what about the spy of Beiqi in the dynasty?

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,320
It should be the merman.

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,360
It's impossible

46
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
that Fusu has been by my side these days,

47
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,400
He doesn't have time to do this.

48
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,600
Look at you,

49
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
This one

50
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,560
That's why His Majesty forbade you to participate in this matter.

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Don't be blinded by this merman.

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,800
Senior is right.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,400
I really shouldn't trust him anymore.

54
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,080
Wake up early.

55
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,480
Master's revenge

56
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,840
would have been avenged earlier.

57
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,360
If Fusu is really the murderer.

58
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,640
I will personally fulfill

59
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,640
his master's last wish,
