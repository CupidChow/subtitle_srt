1
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,240
I remember your mother's name is Yanchu, right?

2
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,960
Your Excellency, have you met my mother?

3
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,280
I only saw it on the file.

4
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,040
Is there anything else?

5
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,480
You're hurting me.

6
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:55,920
My Lord

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,920
If I can find my mother,

8
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,920
I can break the water ban spell on you.

9
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,720
It's fine.

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,920
Don't worry about me.

11
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,920
How can I not worry?

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,760
Now I'm your man.

13
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,280
I want you to be fine.

14
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,000
make a sneak attack

15
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,600
Master,

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,520
I have a favor to ask of you,

17
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,200
Tell me about it,

18
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,000
Disciple

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,240
If you want to marry Youngest Sister,

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,840
you and Weixu are not a good match.

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Don't dwell on it.

22
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,080
Why?

23
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,400
What is a match?

24
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,600
What do you mean by "unworthy"?

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,520
I'm in love with her.

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,520
If I love and respect her,

27
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,960
why don't I deserve it?

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,680
If you are foolhardy,

29
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,640
how can you keep her safe?

30
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,880
Water Forbidden Curse.

31
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,920
Your Majesty,

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,240
it's been two months.

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,240
The murderer of Master is still unknown.

34
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,160
I have to doubt the ability of Supreme Court to handle cases.

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,240
Your Majesty,

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,200
I've been trying my best to investigate,

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,040
But there are too few clues.

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,000
The only remaining Prince of Nanzhao is also in State Preceptor's Mansion,

39
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,000
so I really can't find out.

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,040
Your Excellency Ning,

41
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,200
you suspect that I'm harboring criminals.

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,160
I've told you before,

43
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,480
if Fusu is guilty,

44
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,440
I will personally take him to the Imperial State Preceptor

45
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,560
and stay with mermen day and night,

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,040
I'm afraid I won't be able to bear it then.

47
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,440
You,

48
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,400
Stop arguing.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,240
If Supreme Court fails to investigate the case,

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,920
I can punish him severely.

51
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,920
But when mermen killed Vice President of Supreme Court,

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,040
I can't ignore

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Fusu. He didn't hurt anyone.

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,320
No matter what,

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,200
he is the biggest suspect.

56
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,080
No punishment, no cure.

57
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,080
If it's hard to block Youyou's crowd,

58
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,280
then check it out.

59
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,000
We found it and blocked Youyou people's mouths.

60
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
I won't say much.
