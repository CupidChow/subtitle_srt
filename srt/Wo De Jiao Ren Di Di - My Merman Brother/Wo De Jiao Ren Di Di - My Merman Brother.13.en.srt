1
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,400
Fu Su

2
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,280
My good guard.

3
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,440
You went out early in the morning,

4
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,880
just to protect another woman.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,520
No,

6
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,360
do you have the right to speak?

7
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:01,960
Sis,

8
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,000
she's a spy of Beiqi.

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,280
Are you her accomplice?

10
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,200
Me,

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,680
I just happened to pass by.

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,320
It's 108 thousand miles away from the State Preceptor's Mansion.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,440
Seven miles to be exact,

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,320
I walk twice a day,

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,640
So,

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,600
shut up!

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,040
I was assassinated

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,000
and Fusu just happened to save me.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,960
Well,

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,040
why were you assassinated?

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,120
You're from Beiqi,

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,840
Yes.

23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
Or not?

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
Yes, I am.

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,440
Beiqi

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,800
Someone from Qin State,

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,480
but I've never done anything to hurt Qin State,

28
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,480
I promise.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,840
Tian Si Fang

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,440
is just a place where information flows.

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,320
But all the information

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,920
is fragmented,

33
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,200
I don't understand the meaning at all.

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,920
Do you know

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,640
who is the person who contacted you?

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,800
All I know is,

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,920
he has a high position in Daqin,

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,240
But as for who it is,

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,640
I really don't know.

40
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
In that case,

41
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,160
you're just an abandoned child of Beiqi.

42
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,320
Your Excellency,

43
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,760
Chen Tian Si was seriously injured by accident.

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,720
The news that he's dying has been released.

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,600
There is no suspicious person yet.

46
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,360
Why didn't you go to Tian Si Fang today?

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,800
My Lord,

48
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,160
I was wrong.

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,920
How could you be wrong?

50
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,720
You're not my accessory.

51
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
You can go wherever you like.

52
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,360
My Lord,

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,040
don't be mad at me.

54
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,600
When will you tell me?

55
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,800
Why did you show up at Tian Si Fang?

56
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,120
Even if I tell you, you won't believe me.

57
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,080
Okay,

58
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,320
Then don't ever say it again.

59
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,160
I went to see her to make sure of one thing.

60
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,600
What is it?

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,640
To confirm why she stole the painting from the State Preceptor's Mansion,

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,960
how do you know?

63
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,360
She stole the painting,

64
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,720
and the scent of the scene is the same as hers,

65
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,680
Your nose

66
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,600
is very sensitive.

67
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,960
Mermen do have an unusual sense of smell.

68
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,560
If you kiss me again,

69
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,320
you're dead.

70
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,040
I heard that Chen Tian Si had an accident,

71
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,280
so I came here to take a look.

72
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,960
I heard that you two usually get along well,

73
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,400
so don't be too sad.

74
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,920
Stop looking, Danmo.

75
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,120
My sister,

76
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,960
My sister,

77
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,280
she's not here.

78
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,840
These pastries,

79
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,800
This is for your sister.

80
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,840
Since she's not here,

81
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,800
it's fine.

82
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,640
Mo Xi likes it.

83
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,800
I'll give it to her later.

84
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,320
Chen Moxi

85
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,520
is still alive,
