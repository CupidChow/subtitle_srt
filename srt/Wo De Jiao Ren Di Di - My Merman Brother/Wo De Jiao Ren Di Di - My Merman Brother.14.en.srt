1
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,880
These cakes were meant for your sister.

2
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,800
But if she's not here now,

3
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,800
it's fine.

4
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,720
Mo Xi likes it.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,040
I'll give it to her later.

6
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,080
Chen Moxi

7
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,360
is still alive.

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,720
Unfortunately,

9
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,400
she won't be able to eat anymore.

10
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:18,840
Your Excellency,

11
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,680
Chen Moxi is indeed in State Preceptor's Mansion,

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
The sooner, the better.

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,840
Don't miss again

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,440
Yes.

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,240
Isn't it fun?

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,120
Yes.

17
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,960
I have more,

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,440
Look

19
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,040
What do you think?

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,920
Isn't it interesting?

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,000
Boring.

22
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,960
Have some tea.

23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,880
not be as good as

24
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,680
How about

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,440
a cross-cup of tea?

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,360
No. Come on.

27
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,400
Come on.

28
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,560
Stop messing around.

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,000
Not bad.

30
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,760
Good tea.

31
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,920
What's wrong with you again?

32
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,280
Lin Rulian,

33
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,400
Ru Lian,

34
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,400
This tea.

35
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,120
Lin Rulian, Rulian,

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,160
what's wrong with you?

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,960
What's wrong with you?

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,280
Help!

39
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,880
Is there anyone?

40
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,880
Rulian,

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,400
Lin Rulian,

42
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,080
Ru Lian,

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
Ru Lian,

44
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,560
Ru Lian

45
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,160
Rulian, don't scare me.

46
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,560
What's going on?

47
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,440
Lin Rulian,

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,320
Ru Lian,

49
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,480
Lin Rulian.

50
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,520
He was struck by the Soul-Hanging Powder.

51
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,800
You must have a way to save him, right?

52
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,480
This is Beiqi's secret medicine.

53
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,200
You should know better than I do.

54
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,080
Does this soup work?

55
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,000
It's better to drink it than not to drink it,

56
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,800
Fusu,

57
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,760
Your blood,

58
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,840
save Rulian,

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,000
Your blood will make him recover.

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,040
Okay?

61
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,200
Not good.

62
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,720
He's my little brother.

63
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,040
That's all I have.

64
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,720
You're useless.

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,200
You didn't accomplish enough.

66
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,400
It seems that I have to do it myself.
