1
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,280
Sir.

2
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,560
Stop!

3
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,360
My Lord,

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,480
I never meant to lie to you.

5
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,640
I never wanted to hurt you.

6
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,160
Your Excellency is the first person who treats me sincerely.

7
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,600
But I will only bring misfortune to you.

8
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,680
When I find a way to completely remove the Water Restriction Curse,

9
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,320
I will definitely come back to you.

10
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,000
What's wrong with State Preceptor?

11
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,680
She's under the Water Restriction Curse.

12
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,000
Isn't that the secret art of Nanzhao?

13
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,800
It was you

14
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,680
who betrayed my sister.

15
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,960
I don't have the strength to pester you now.

16
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,640
let go

17
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,080
Fusu, you don't deserve it.

18
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,520
You don't deserve my sister's love at all.

19
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,200
You made my sister sad,

20
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,680
and hurt her badly.

21
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,560
She made my sister the target of public criticism.

22
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,520
You're unlucky.

23
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,800
Enough scolding?

24
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,600
I'm not just going to scold you,

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,480
I'm going to beat you.

26
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,400
It's so late now.

27
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,400
Stop messing around.

28
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,680
About my mother Yan Chu,

29
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,120
how much do you know?

30
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,280
I don't know much.

31
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,240
I just heard that a few years ago,

32
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,080
King Beiqi,

33
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,160
At the junction of Beiqi and Nanzhao,

34
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,840
we found a merman,

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,280
Instead of killing her,

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,640
she was raised in the palace and made Consort Chu,

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,240
The palace is heavily guarded,

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,240
and we can't get in without a token.

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,480
I can't see her

40
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,360
either. It's just a token. Just make one.

41
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,920
It's a pity that I don't know what the token looks like.

42
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,320
But the person behind me must have a token.

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,600
Behind you. Stop

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
messing around.

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,200
I'm telling you, don't let me see you again.

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,800
Or I'll beat you up every time I see you.

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,400
Don't say that about Fusu.

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,600
Why can't I blame him for hurting my sister like that?

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,480
He cut his meridians and saved you.

50
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,360
What?
