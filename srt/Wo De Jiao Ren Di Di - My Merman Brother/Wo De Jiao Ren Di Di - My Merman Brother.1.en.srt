1
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,840
It coincides with Daqin,

2
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,520
Beiqi,

3
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,240
The three states of Nanzhao stand together

4
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,360
and Daqin State is prosperous.

5
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,360
State Preceptor Lin Weixu took office less than a month ago,

6
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,160
and took down Nanzhao State in one fell swoop,

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,840
plotting unparalleled in the world.

8
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,440
The whole court is very afraid of him.

9
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,360
You little merman,

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,280
Nanzhao has died.

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,760
Just surrender.

12
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,040
For us to enjoy.

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,680
You want to run away?

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,200
Beat him!

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,920
Darn it. Aren't

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,280
all the captives of Nanzhao locked up in prison?

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,760
How did he escape?

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,360
Beat him,

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,440
Stop!

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,000
The person I asked you

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,680
to run to Supreme Court is really not something,

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,680
You tortured him like this.

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,480
Where did you get that silly girl?

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,720
Mind your own business.

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,440
Beat him!

26
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,560
Who are you?

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,600
How dare you attack Supreme Court?

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,480
State Preceptor's Mansion,

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,120
Lin Weixu.

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,440
Let's go.

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,120
Master.

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,240
Master.

33
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,520
Sir.

34
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,640
This guy has been standing at the door.

35
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,880
Why can't I drive him away?

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,120
It seems that he followed us secretly.

37
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,640
You.

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,720
It's cute.

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,520
Let him stay in the mansion.

40
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,200
Are you willing to do that?

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,320
I said,

42
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,880
are you willing to do it?

43
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,280
Take him down to wash and change clothes.

44
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,360
Yes.

45
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,040
Your Excellency,

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,480
it's ready.

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,920
This merman

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,080
is so handsome.
