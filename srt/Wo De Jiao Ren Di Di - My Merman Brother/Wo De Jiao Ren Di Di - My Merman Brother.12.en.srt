1
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,480
Your Excellency is awake.

2
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
You saved me again.

3
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,720
I'm here.

4
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,480
I won't let you get hurt.

5
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,120
By the way,

6
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,880
how is my senior brother?

7
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,280
Bitter tricks can't kill anyone.

8
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,280
How can you say that about him?

9
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,960
After Master left,

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,920
I only have Senior Brother left.

11
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
I don't want anything to happen to him.

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,080
What if I say he's lying to you?

13
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,560
He's not that kind of person.

14
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,640
I'll go check on him.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,360
Sir,

16
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,160
don't go!

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,200
Sir,

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,520
what is it?

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,280
A thief broke into

20
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,920
the restless old State Preceptor's room.

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,240
What?

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,600
Did you find the thief?

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,720
The thief was so cunning that he got away.

24
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,840
Fortunately, I didn't lose anything valuable,

25
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,640
just some calligraphy and paintings by the old State Preceptor,

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,720
He seems to be a petty thief who doesn't know the goods.

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,000
Master's calligraphy and painting are priceless to me.

28
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,160
Send someone to find out immediately.

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,400
Yes.

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,200
Why is this scent so familiar?

31
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,480
You are the merman.

32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,960
Fu Su

33
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,640
Fusu left early in the morning.

34
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,040
Chen Moxi,

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,280
it's her.

36
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,720
You've been away for a long time,

37
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,200
don't forget who you are.

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,080
I heard that

39
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,760
the girl from Tian Si Fang,

40
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,960
You gave yourself away.

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,240
Then just kill them.

42
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't get emotional.

43
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,960
Don't forget why you came to Qin State.

44
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,200
Otherwise,

45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,320
you'll be poisoned to death at any time.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,960
Mo Xi can't be a spy. It must be a frame-up.

47
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,360
Sister,

48
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,920
say something.

49
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,400
Mo Xi doesn't know martial arts at all,

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,000
how could she be a spy?

51
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,640
Sister,

52
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,840
Sister,

53
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,880
I'm not sure.

54
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,680
Who says spies must be good at martial arts?

55
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,800
Sister.

56
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,400
Ruoruo Moxi,

57
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,280
as you said, she's not a spy,

58
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,440
She should be in danger now.

59
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,280
Tian Si Fang,
