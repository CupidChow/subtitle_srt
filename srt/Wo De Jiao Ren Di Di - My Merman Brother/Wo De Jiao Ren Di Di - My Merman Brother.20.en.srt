1
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,640
I didn't touch your brother.

2
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,360
I didn't hurt him.

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,160
I didn't scare him.

4
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,080
It's true.

5
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,080
I didn't take you down.

6
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,560
To bring it to the imperial court,

7
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,920
it's already the greatest tolerance for you.

8
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,960
Don't push your luck.

9
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,840
What do you have to do to forgive me

10
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,600
and leave my sight.

11
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
Don't let me see you again.

12
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
It's you. You

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,040
didn't expect it, did you?

14
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,240
I'll take you down one day.

15
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,040
You should be glad that I don't want to kill you yet.

16
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,560
Why?

17
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,360
Could it be

18
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,120
Is it because of your mother Yanchu?

19
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,040
What did you do to my mother?

20
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,320
Your mother,

21
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,600
your mother,

22
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,200
I really love you.

23
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,680
Even if I cut off the fins,

24
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,560
he still refuses to tell the truth.

25
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,400
You merman jerks

26
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,080
are really useless.

27
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,640
You,

28
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,680
If you're sensible,

29
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,680
just let me go.

30
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,800
Otherwise,

31
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,720
I can't guarantee that Yanchu

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,760
will be safe and sound.

33
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,000
I told you to leave but you really did.

34
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,600
Stinky salted fish,

35
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,360
you didn't come to me even when you were in heat.

36
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,560
Drink my blood.

37
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,000
You won't have to work for others anymore.

38
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,160
Well

39
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,320
It's your turn to speak.

40
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,800
Can Gu Danmo give you any benefit after the job is done?

41
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,440
Senior Tutor wants to take over the people of the world,

42
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,040
how can you speculate here?
