1
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,240
You're awake.

2
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,440
Are you feeling better?

3
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,760
Who let you into my room?

4
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,040
This is my room.

5
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,280
I was the one who saved you last night.

6
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,960
Don't you know

7
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,440
you're under the Water Restriction Curse?

8
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,320
The cold poison in your body will attack at any time.

9
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,760
Once you touch the cold water,

10
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,480
the pain will get worse.

11
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,600
Then tell me how to crack it?

12
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,480
The merman's blood can be relieved.

13
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,680
But the real way to crack it,

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,040
only the elders of the royal family know it.

15
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,160
That means I can't live without you.

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
As long as you need me,

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,560
I can always be there.

18
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,040
When can we

19
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,080
get married?

20
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,160
I won't be so responsible to you.

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,000
Among the men and women in Nanzhao,

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,120
Nanzhao has passed away.

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,000
This is Daqin.

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,440
Where are you going?

25
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,440
Youngest Sister is never late,

26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,280
but she's also late.

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,360
I'm investigating a case,

28
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,720
isn't interrogating the merman

29
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,600
more important than serving incense to Master?

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,680
Master,

31
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,440
if you had come earlier to give incense to Master,

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,120
Then we can find out the murderer.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,280
Then I must have come earlier than you.

34
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,800
What did you find out?

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,080
Not yet.

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,280
That merman

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,400
has a tough mouth,

38
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,240
Why don't you give him to me?

39
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,480
I think he's so delicate,

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,640
he can't stand whipping.

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,920
What do you think, Junior Sister?

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,400
As I said yesterday,

43
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
I'll investigate it myself this time.

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,640
Lin,

45
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,160
who beat you up like this?

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,840
What hit?

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,720
That guy,

48
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,320
no,

49
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
That merman

50
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,560
is even worse.

51
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,040
I almost didn't make him a fish with Chinese sauerkraut

52
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,160
with a set of serial punches. He can serve it with some chopped green onion.

53
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,760
You mean mermen?

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,040
My sister,

55
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,600
I don't know where she got

56
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,240
a fine-skinned merman to keep in her mansion,

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,080
Keep it at home.

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,040
I heard he's the prince of Nanzhao.

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,040
Bah!

60
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,720
Who cares if he's a prince or a jerk?

61
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,440
Anyway,

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,720
you can't enter the Lin family's gate.
