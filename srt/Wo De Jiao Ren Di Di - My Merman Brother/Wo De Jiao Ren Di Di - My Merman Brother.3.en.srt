1
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,920
Your Excellency, bad news.

2
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,560
Young master and that merman got into a fight.

3
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,120
You don't have to worry about my family matters.

4
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
So that you won't accidentally hurt Senior Brother.

5
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,400
Tomorrow is the day of Master's sacrifice.

6
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,920
I'll wait for you at the usual place.

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,000
Stop!

8
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,680
Sis,

9
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,320
who allowed you to enter my room?

10
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,680
I haven't asked you yet. Why are you asking about me?

11
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,840
When did you

12
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,720
raise such a pretty boy in the mansion,

13
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,600
Does Danmo know?

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,760
You're doomed.

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,520
What does it have to do with you who I raise?

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,480
What does it have to do with Grand Tutor?

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,960
Lin Weixu, let me tell you,

18
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,280
I only admit that Danmo is my future brother-in-law.

19
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,160
As for this stinky salted fish, don't even think about it.

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,040
No way.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,840
Get him out of here.

22
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,680
Execute.

23
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,440
Ah,

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,320
Sis,

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,640
it's not that serious, is it?

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:48,920
No,

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,720
you're going to kill me just for a little salted fish.

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,360
Are you my sister or not?

29
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,400
Does Danmo know?

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,920
Lin Weixu,

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,600
you're in trouble.

32
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,560
You stinky seafood. I'll kill you.

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
I was trying to scare him.

34
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,840
Where are your fins?

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,440
Mermen live in the sea with their fins,

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,280
no one would expose such an important thing

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,240
to the outside.

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,520
If you lose your fins,

39
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,040
you'll be unable to move.

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,760
Until death.

41
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,720
But you're so good at kung fu,

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,040
I don't think you'll die so easily.

43
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,800
It's because your brother is too weak.

44
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,080
He has a strong tone,

45
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,080
My little brother is a jerk,

46
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,800
but he's good at it.

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
That means

48
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,320
those people are no match for you.

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,040
Why didn't you fight back?

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,640
Since you don't want to say it,

51
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,840
forget it. You should rest well in the mansion these days.

52
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,960
Why are you so nice to me?

53
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,320
I told you,

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,240
I like you.

55
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,720
That's how much

56
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,240
you like it.

57
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,440
What's wrong with you?

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
Cold,

59
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,440
It's so cold.

60
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,320
Water Forbidden Curse.

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,160
Only the blood of my clan can relieve it.
