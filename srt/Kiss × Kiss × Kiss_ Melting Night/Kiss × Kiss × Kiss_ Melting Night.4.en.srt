00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,290
Carefully~

4
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,910
As the younger sister, I am being
 allowed to live in my older brother's room.

5
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,780
It's locked, open up please.

6
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,390
- Do you realise what time it is?
- Hurry up and open it, this is my place! I'm the one paying for it, got it?

7
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,230
Alright, quickly come inside, you
 can probably leave it there, good.

8
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,350
Listen, as a working adult, there
are certain things you do, right?

9
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,340
- Here... I bought this for you.
- Thank you.

10
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,730
Make sure to enjoy it properly tomorrow, okay?

11
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,560
Who is this guy?

12
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,390
- He's my coworker that I always work with, so treat him with respect.
- Nice to meet you.

13
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,190
Well, I'm off to bed now.

14
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,410
- Ask my sister if you need anything. Night, night.
 - Ah, good night.

15
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,210
I have to endure even selfish behaviour...

16
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,710
Come in.

17
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, excuse me.

18
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,510
He's... so handsome...

19
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,090
You can go here...

20
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,250
Beautiful sleeping face.

21
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,910
Huh...?

22
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,550
What's up with this guy?

23
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,400
We kissed...

24
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,190
Bro~

25
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,810
What kind of person is that coworker?

26
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,240
It was so hard when you left, you know?

27
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,340
I...

28
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,260
Even got kissed...

29
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,410
He probably mistook me for somebody
else because he was drunk...

30
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,970
Bro, are you even listening?

31
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,830
You should've told me earlier.

32
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,490
The sensation of his lips still lingers...

33
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,220
He invited me out to eat.

34
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,330
Ah, I'm so full~

35
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,440
Thank you so much for today.

36
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,720
Thank you for the meal.

37
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,330
It was my first time at such a lovely
place, I ended up being a bit nervous.

38
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,380
I'm sorry for causing trouble the other day.

39
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,490
Actually...

40
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,350
It's fine, how many times are you going to apologise?

41
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,030
Are you okay?

42
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,850
- Hold onto my shoulder.
- But...

43
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,670
It's alright, this time it's my turn.

44
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,570
Eh?

45
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,420
Actually...

46
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,730
You know...

47
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,390
...I was the person in the bath.

48
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,490
Huh?

49
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,950
You're lying...

50
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,240
Is it okay...

51
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,120
...To try again?

52
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,520
Try again?

53
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,310
Your lips...

54
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,450
They're just like how I remembered.

Junior guy × Adulterous woman

57
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,230
It's essential for teens, especially
high school girls, to go viral.

58
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,250
Some young people participate
in events and live performances.

59
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,690
But social media is crucial-

60
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,440


61
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,630
Alright, everyone please work on what we talked about today. Thank you.

62
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,420
- You're dismissed.

63

Ah, wait, could you stay a little longer?

66
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,780
Of course.

Can I come over tonight?

70
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,080
I thought we ended things.

71
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,330
I'm still not convinced.

72
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,390
Convinced?

73
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,810
My boss and I used to have a casual relationship.

74
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,970
Your feelings can change that easily?

75
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,230
Please stop it.

76
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,810
Could you give me a little more time?

77
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,830
There was plenty of time.

78
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,470
I...

79
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,110
Lost control there...

80
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,750
This was the best I could do...

81
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,840
Are you okay?

82
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,710
I just made a mistake and got scolded.

83
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,810
Shall I comfort you?

84
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,630
No, it's fine.

85
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,630
Hold on a second, please.

86
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,910
If it were me,

87
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,060
I wouldn't make you look like that.

88
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,280
Is it okay if I comfort you a little?

89
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,950
The love without comfort is over...

90
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,480
How will you comfort me?

91
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,000
Cute.

92
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,400
I, for the first time in a long time, am being comforted...

93
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,600
In this moment, I want to be comforted
without thinking about anything...

94
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,200
