[ Interview Kiss ]

3
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,000
But even now, I really regret it.

4
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,410
Popular actor × His first girlfriend

5
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,370
Today's interviewee is him, a popular actor.

6
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,110
...Let's do this!

7
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,860
I'm feeling nervous because he is my ex-boyfriend...

8
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,730
I'm confirming where the interviewer is now,

9
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,810
- Please just wait a little longer.
- Okay.

10
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,870
I'm sorry.

11
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,820
Nice to meet you.

12
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,430
Nice to meet you.

13
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,000
Thank you for your cooperation today.

14
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,260
Nice to meet... you?

15
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,510
After 10 years as a journalist, I was
 finally able to meet him again.

16
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,300
Huh? Wait a minute. What does this mean?

17
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,900
- What's wrong?
- Huh...?

18
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,100
Ah... it's nothing.

19
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,510
This isn't a hidden camera prank, you know?

20
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,540
I was his classmate in high school.

21
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,010
Eh- What are the chances?!

22
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,620
Well then, I'd like to promptly conduct an interview regarding the release of the movie that'll be releasing next month.

23
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,670
Then, I will guide you to the room.

24
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,400
I appreciate your assistance.

25
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,800
This way, please.

26
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,460
Well then,

27
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,540
Relating to the content of this movie,

28
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,090
May I ask you about your own love life?

29
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,080
In this movie,

30
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,700
You played a role where you were toyed with by a free-spirited girlfriend,

31
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,410
But what kind of woman do you actually prefer?

32
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,170
It might be close to the role.

33
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,040
Does that mean your type is a free-spirited woman?

34
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,550
Rather,

35
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,400
I like girls who are strong-willed
and have a solid sense of self.

36
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,210
I see.

37
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,880
Thank you.

38
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,280
So, next question.

39
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,210
Can you be friends with

40
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,500
an ex-lover?

41
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,930
I can't be friends with an ex.

42
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,310
I haven't had the kind of relationship where I can switch to being friends.

43
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,900
Does that mean you don't stay in touch either?

44
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,900
Yes, I don't.

45
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,400
Indeed, there was no contact from him

46
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,900
I forgot to contact you!

47
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,210
Ah, I got it on! Thank god~

48
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,200
Ta-da~

49
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,400
But...

50
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,510
I'm still not over the first person I dated.

51
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,610
I had no choice but to break up
with them to enter this industry,

52
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,420
But even now, I really regret it.

53
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,890
I'll stop the tape.

54
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,970
It's okay, you can write about it.

55
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,110
Since it's the truth.

56
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,910
Ah, I see...

57
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,200
Yes,

58
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,310
I see, I see.

59
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,260
Yes, I deeply apologise.

60
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,030
I understand.

61
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,420
I'm just about to check that right now.

62
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,990
Please hold on for a moment.

63
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,600
Oops! No, no, something
 just happened on my end.

64
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,910
Sorry about that, yes.

65
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,720
Please allow me to check right away.

66
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:53,620
Yes.

67
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,290
I'm really sorry...

68
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,070
Seriously...

69
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,750
Being with you makes me
feel crazy or something.

70
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,100
Don't call me 'you'!

71
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,300
You're still as strong-willed as ever.

72
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,700
Your stubborn nature hasn't changed either, has it?

73
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,090
It's been 10 years.

74
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,800
Let's try to reclaim what we lost back then.

75
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,500
You also kept it on.

76
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,810
Why didn't you say something?

77
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,150
There was no opportunity to say it.

78
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,460
