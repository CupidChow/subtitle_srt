3
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,510
I ended up coming after working overtime again...

4
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,810
I can't stop thinking about him today either...

5
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,100
Huh?

6
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,510
What does this mean...? Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation?

7
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,110
What is happening...?

8
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,900
You do this a lot, don't you?

9
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,690
Did you work overtime?

10
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,510
Currently,

11
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,760
I have an important project.

12
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,700
But...

13
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,390
Just going straight home everyday feels unsatisfying.

14
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,110
You're impressive.

15
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,450
Exercising like this after work.

16
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,020
I came here for a mental break...

17
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,840
And also because you're here.

18
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,910
Oh no! What did I just say?!

19
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,560
I... go to a sports science university nearby.

20
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,240
You're a university student?

21
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,810
Compared to me, he's much younger.

22
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,020
Please don't treat me like a child.

23
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,260
It was a dream after all.

24
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,520
I got too tired.

25
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,280
You're tired, aren't you?

26
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,510
Sorry... for surprising you.

27
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,730
Ahh...

28
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,190
Is it closing time already?

29
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,700
Not yet, it's okay.

30
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,750
Although... we're the only people still here.

31
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,610
I'm talking with him... is this another dream?

32
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,710
Um...

33
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,020
Did you happen to put this on me?

34
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,310
It would be bad if you caught a cold.

35
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you very much.

36
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,310
Your important project...

37
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,010
When will you be finished?

38
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,910
Huh?

39
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,910
I'm the same as you.

40
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,180
I've always been looking out for you.

41
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:53,220
On the days you come... Tuesday and Thursday... I've been swapping shifts...

42
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,330
I'm so terrible, aren't I?

43
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,100
I must still be dreaming...

44
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,260
I don't even understand... what I'm feeling.

45
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,440
You really don't know?

46
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,610
Even in my dream, my mind is filled with thoughts of him.

47
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,100
I had a dream that I was being
 given mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

48
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,020
By you.

49
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,390
That...

50
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,430
Wasn't a dream.

51
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,650
Huh?

52
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,750
Also...

53
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,390
I kissed you.

54
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,630
I'm sorry.

55
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,020
Don't apologise.

56
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,350
Could I have been... talking in my sleep?

57
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,110
Even if this is a dream... Even if this is not a dream...

58
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,800
My tired body, engulfed in his arms.

59
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:33,310
