[ Jealous Kiss ]
Caring current boyfriend × Conflicted girlfriend × Cool ex-boyfriend

3
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,420
That was fun.

4
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,420
Right~

5
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,940
Thanks for today.

6
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,900
- Have a good night.
- Yeah.

7
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,590
- You're really not coming?
- I'm not.

8
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,710
- You sure?
- You can go, just go.

9
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,720
You're annoying, just go~

10
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,760
Don't you have to get up early tomorrow?

11
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,240
Let's go another time. See ya, have fun! Bye-bye!

12
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,070
- Shall we go now?
- Yeah~

13
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,100
He was my first kiss... my ex-boyfriend.

14
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,090
So cold~

15
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,100
By the way, I still haven't quit smoking.

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,780
It's because you're wearing light clothing.

17
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,100
Don't you want to quit?

18
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,460
Fashion is built on a bit of sacrifice.

19
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,100
I care about that, you know?

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,040
What's with this conversation?

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,700
Let's decide on one topic.

22
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,120
See?

23
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,040
It's cold, isn't it?

24
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,130
In this moment, it's easy to intentionally
 make someone's heart race like this

25
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,920
Are you seducing me?

26
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,810
I think so.

27
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,610
You know you have to make a decision regarding your past feelings, right?

28
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,210
I've grown since we were together.

29
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,210
I still can't decide.

30
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,710
I have a younger boyfriend

31
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm home.

32
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,810
Welcome back.

33
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,700
You smell like cigarettes.

34
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,210
It can't be helped, no matter
 if it's cheap or expensive.

35
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,170
- Hey,
- Hm?

36
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,610
Was he wearing it?

37
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,250
Him?

38
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,260
The person you had your first kiss with.

39
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,100
Ah...

40
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,690
He came.

41
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,000
How was it?

42
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,600
It was nothing special.

43
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,290
It happened in middle school.

44
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,570
I know but...

45
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,080
You went dressed in such a cute outfit.

46
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,540
Because I get sunburnt so easily.

47
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,550
Don't use getting burnt easily as an excuse~

48
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,010
Hey,

49
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,080
Where did you kiss?

50
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,340
...What?

51
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,700
The place of your first kiss.

52
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,610
Where do you think it was?

53
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,820
Come on,

54
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,300
Not that topic again...

55
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,490
It's in the past already.

56
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,230
What kind of kiss was it?

57
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,540
Can you recreate it?

58
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,900
About the first kiss? Or...

59
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,000
This kind of feeling?

60
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,810
This kind of feeling?

61
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,570
Cute~

62
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,200
No I'm not...

63
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,210
It'd be better if it were just
the two of us next time.

64
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,510
Hey,

65
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,520
Kiss me more.

66
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,210
You like my kisses more, don't you?

67
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,100
Yeah~

68
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,810
A gentle kiss, my favourite kind of kiss
