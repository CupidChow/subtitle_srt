Welcome home.

8
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,890
I still have a little more to do,

9
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,590
Why don't you take a shower now?

10
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,560
Eh~ don't worry, I'll help too.

11
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,620
What is it, what is it~~

12
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,540
Ah~ It's mapo tofu, right?

13
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,210
My favourite!

Thanks for your help.

16
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,470
I'm sorry.

17
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,420
I was supposed to be in charge of today's meal...

18
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,090
But I could only make something simple.

19
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,120
No worries.

20
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,200
Thank you as always.

- Thank you.
- Thank you.

22
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,400
Thank you for coming.

23
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,750

- Thank you!

24
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,550
- Excuse us, we'll be on our way.
- See you.

25
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,060
It was a pleasure doing business with you.

26
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,910
- The kitchen was spacious.
- Right? It seems like it'd be easy to cook in. Thank god.

27
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,310
We sell houses at the same company.

28
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,650
Ah~ I'm tired.

29
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,230
Good work.

30
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,470
I didn't know you liked mapo tofu.

31
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,530
It was just acting, obviously.

32
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,950
I'm not good with spicy food.

33
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,010
We act out married life to help our customers imagine it.

34
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,110
It was really good.

35
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,850
Just a little more to go.

36
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,970
Let's keep at it.

37
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,110
Yeah.

38
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,210
He's not just good at acting...

39
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,310
- Thanks.
- No problem.

40
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,270
Then...

41
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,710
See you tomorrow, I look forward to it.

42
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,270
Yeah.

43
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,310
He's truly kind and perfect.

44
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:01,410
I'm becoming more and more attracted to him.

45
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,000
Hey! You got soap on me!

46
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,740
Sorry, sorry.

47
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,910
Hold still, I'll get it off.

48
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,050
C'mon...

49
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,210
As usual, this kiss... is an act.

50
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,060


51
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:33,350


52
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,600
Don't distract me!

53
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,630
You know, you're losing because
you keep doing things like that.

54
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,610
I end up falling for the act.

55
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,990
Hey! Don't distract me!

56
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,010
I'm the only one getting worked up like a fool.

57
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,920
- Bring that, bring that...
- I get it!

58
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:56,730


59
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,010
Huh?! He... kissed me!?

60
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,510
Thank you for signing the contract.

61
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,460
Thanks to you two, it was easy to imagine living here.

62
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,460
At the end, I thought you might
have really kissed, so I got excited.

63
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,370
- Right?
- Exactly.

64
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,550
Thank you.

65
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,290
I'm glad we were able to help.

66
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,990
Well then, see you later.

67
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,110
It was a pleasure doing business with you.

68
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,310
I wonder what that kiss was about...

69
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,990
Ah... I'm tired.

70
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,830
- Tomorrow's finally our last one, let's do our best.
- Of course.

71
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,190
How about some wine?

72
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:09,240
Sounds great! It's been a while, hasn't it?

73
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,410
Oh, that's right!

74
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,940
Hey, how about we turn tomorrow
 into a wine-drinking celebration.

75
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,150
You like sudden kisses, right?

76
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,110
I always hear your heartbeat speed up.

77
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,810
It's obviously just acting...

78
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,480
You act too much.

79
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,150
I'm embarrassed.

80
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,350
Sorry, I got flustered.

81
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,150
I've always wanted to do this.

82
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,430
Me too.

83
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:33,700
meow :3
