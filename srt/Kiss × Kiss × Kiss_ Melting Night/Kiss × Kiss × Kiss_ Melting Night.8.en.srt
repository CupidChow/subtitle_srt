[ Healing Kiss ]
Live streaming guy × Tired girl

3
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,080
I truly believe...

4
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,870
That we were destined to meet.

5
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,410
Like always

6
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:00,410
I came home tired from work.

7
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,040
If you're asking how it became like this...

8
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,310
I'm home...

9
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,160
My life's only healing is this.

10
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,850
As expected, he's cool.

11
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,170
Alright!

12
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,180
Today is the beloved program,

13
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,940
"Surprise! Real-Life Princess Next Door!"

14
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,220
Let's get started right away.

15
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,940
To the princess out there, please do me a favour,

16
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,700
And send me a direct message.

17
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,680
You have five minutes.

18
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,480
Then I'll immediately intrude into your room.

19
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,960
This super popular program will indulge your every desire.

20
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,140
It's the real deal, no trickery.

21
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,380
This project, as I've mentioned before,

22
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,200
Is a personal dream of mine.

23
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,650
As for what that dream is...

24
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,630
I'll keep it a secret from you all until it comes true.

25
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,570
Thanks for watching.

26
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,210
And... send.

27
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,800
Applying is my daily routine.
Actually, I just do it out of habit at this point.

28
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,610
[You have a new message]

29
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,710
I don't actually think I'll win.

30
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,800
Cleaning someone else's house somehow boosts your mood, don't you think?

31
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,330
I actually like household chores like this.

32
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,760
Ah, it's so clean. Incredible.

33
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,200
I won

34
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,460
Sorry for intruding~

35
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,520
I've arrived~

36
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,200
You're our princess this time.

37
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,590
Wave.

38
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,240
How is it?

39
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,360
It feels good.

40
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,650
That's a relief.

41
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,990
But... I'm embarrassed.

42
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,880
Alright~

43
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,440
Then, please lie down on your side.

44
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,630
It's like a moment from a dream...

45
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,060
It's like a dream...

46
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,320
It seems like a dream, doesn't it?

47
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,570
However, it's not a dream!

48
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,580
Yes, this is "Surprise! Real-Life
Princess Next Door!"

49
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,200
I wish I had dressed up better...

50
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,330
You didn't know you would win.

51
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,670
But...

52
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,990
You also look very lovely the way you are right now.

53
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,710
Lastly, let's make a toast to our chance encounter.

54
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,260
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

55
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,620
Well then, that's all for today.

56
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,260
We've decided that this episode,

57
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,560
Will be the final episode of this program.

58
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,540
So... stay tuned for the next episode.

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,210

60
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,500
Bye-bye.

61
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,500
The dream is coming to an end...

62
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,780
Do you understand why I was doing a program like this?

63
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,630
Huh?

64
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,780
It was... a dream of yours?

65
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,060
...Is that right?

66
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,810
What do you think my dream is?

67
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,010
I wonder what it is...

68
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,440
I...

69
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,410
Wanted to experience love at first sight.

70
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,430
Huh?

71
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,300
I guess I was drawn to the idea of love at first sight.

72
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,090
I wanted to try to have a
 fateful encounter in my life.

73
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,170
So I thought, there's no choice but to take action.

74
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,910
That's why...

75
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,240
The program ended today.

76
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,320
Huh?

77
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,730
Huh?!

78
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,090
Today...

79
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,410
My dream has finally come true.

80
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,210
Huh?!

81
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,740
Because I truly believe...

82
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,470
That this is a fateful encounter.

83
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,470
Okay...?

84
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,560
Is this...

85
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,740
Hmm?

86
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,610
...A dream?

87
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,200
I don't want to wake up from this dream...

88
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,490
You won't.

89
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,640
Why not?

90
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,810
Because it's real.

91
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,650
It is a dream.

92
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,140
No, it's not.

93
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes it is.

94
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,500
Nowadays, even dreams can come true out of nowhere.

95
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,960
This look is also cute.

96
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,740
- It's not cute...
- Yes, it is.

97
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
- No, it's not.
- It is.

98
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,700
Glasses don't suit me...

99
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,090
Again.

100
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,290
Again.

101
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,780
Five left.

102
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,770
Alright, I get it!

103
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,770
One.

104
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,010
Two.

105
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,010
Three.

106
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,450
Four.

107
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,340
meow :3
