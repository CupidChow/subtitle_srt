1
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:28,697
Hey Pops, where have you been?

2
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:31,180
I dropped by your house a couple of times

3
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,618
but it’s always locked.

4
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,746
Anyway, if you’re already home,

5
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:39,166
I’d just like to remind you
of our upcoming presentation.

6
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:41,748
We did great in our last project

7
00:01:41,773 --> 00:01:43,797
so we need to take care
of this client, okay?

8
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:45,250
Give me a call.

9
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:47,063
Yes, Bro.

10
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:50,744
Hi Lucas!

11
00:01:50,883 --> 00:01:52,009
I’m very grateful to you

12
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:54,536
for the way things
ended between us.

13
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,555
And I’m glad I met you.

14
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:59,057
You’re the only one
who made me happy.

15
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:01,877
I hope you’ll find your true love.

16
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:04,697
You can have all
my books in your condo.

17
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:07,922
But don’t you dare share our videos.

18
00:02:07,947 --> 00:02:09,156
You fool!

19
00:02:10,808 --> 00:02:12,018
Lana.

20
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:19,473
That’s what you will see on the website.

21
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,742
Thank you Caloy.

22
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:23,560
This is very good.

23
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:28,106
Sorry we didn’t do
an online presentation today.

24
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:30,083
My Boss is so old school.

25
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:32,235
He wants to see
the actual sample printouts

26
00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:33,862
to gauge the quality.

27
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:35,072
That’s okay Ma’am.

28
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:37,908
I also want our artist
to get out of the house.

29
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,827
He’s been stuck in his computer.

30
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,882
As you can see,
my boss is impressed.

31
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:55,842
Thank you so much Lucas and Caloy.

32
00:04:56,193 --> 00:04:58,820
So let’s have the Final Artwork
so we can print it out.

33
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:00,827
My media team is already asking about it.

34
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:02,516
Congratulations!

35
00:05:04,768 --> 00:05:06,311
Come on, let’s celebrate.

36
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:08,038
Order anything that you like.

37
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:09,314
Waiter!

38
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:35,484
Could she be a prostitute?

39
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,761
She’s way too simple though.

40
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:55,003
Let me try something different tonight.

41
00:06:55,003 --> 00:06:57,047
A little adventure.

42
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:31,331
Shit, why is she playing hard to get?

43
00:07:57,336 --> 00:07:59,380
Do you live in that area?

44
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:00,544
What?

45
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:01,695
No.

46
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,847
I just went to one
of my workmates nearby.

47
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:08,574
Where are you going?

48
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:13,373
How about you?

49
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:16,368
You can drop me off at the bus stop.

50
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:20,297
Are you sure?
Where are you going?

51
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:25,883
Where do you want to go?

52
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,009
Are you nervous?

53
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:43,053
A little.

54
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:44,322
How about you?

55
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:46,038
Very.

56
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,711
I don’t usually do this you know.

57
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:09,863
You might think…

58
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:14,367
Me too, I don’t usually do this…

59
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:16,144
You might also think…

60
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:22,109
Do you come here often?

61
00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:26,254
You seem like a regular...

62
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:31,781
It’s my friend
who frequents this place, not me.

63
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:34,809
This is his secret place.

64
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,468
You must think low of me...

65
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:46,624
Then you probably
see me the same way.

66
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:50,235
You’re silly.

67
00:11:18,865 --> 00:11:21,034
Is that enough?

68
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:23,328
And what is that?

69
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:29,935
I don’t get you.

70
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:32,322
What do you mean?

71
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:35,844
Do I look like a hooker to you?

72
00:11:37,974 --> 00:11:39,350
No.

73
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,710
I just thought…

74
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,132
I’m sorry, I didn’t know.

75
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:45,109
I don’t get you.

76
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:46,961
I’m sorry.

77
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:49,030
Just because you’re taller than me?

78
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:50,799
What?

79
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:53,413
You’re looking down on me
because you’re taller than me.

80
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:54,911
That’s it.

81
00:11:57,931 --> 00:11:59,224
Joke!

82
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:06,481
Corny?

83
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:09,692
I’m so slow, sorry.

84
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:12,821
I'm Liza, by the way.

85
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:15,471
Lucas.

86
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,258
You seem different a while ago.

87
00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:51,203
How do you mean different?

88
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:53,635
Never mind.

89
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:59,477
I actually went back
the night after our first time.

90
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:02,324
I waited at the same corner

91
00:19:03,014 --> 00:19:06,226
hoping that you’d pass by.

92
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:11,945
Then I realized that
we met on a Thursday.

93
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,337
So I thought, perhaps you’ll be
back on a Thursday.

94
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,537
And you came.

95
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:19,431
Was that intentional?

96
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:21,272
What?

97
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:27,416
Were you aware that
we met on a Thursday?

98
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:33,049
I wasn’t sure that
we’ll see each other again…

99
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,384
…because we didn’t exchange numbers.

100
00:19:37,557 --> 00:19:40,434
Were we too embarrassed at that time or...

101
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:44,776
did we both think that
we won't do it often?

102
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,033
Just one time.

103
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:51,959
To be honest, I really didn’t know
what to do at that time.

104
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:55,696
I've never experienced this before.

105
00:19:58,024 --> 00:19:59,327
Me too.

106
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:04,026
Believe it or not.

107
00:20:04,818 --> 00:20:06,862
I believe you.

108
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:11,982
So, see you on Thursday?

109
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:22,573
Sounds just like in the movies, Pops!

110
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:27,435
How come you’re not sure
if she’s a hooker or not?

111
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,714
You said she didn’t ask for money.

112
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,363
I just don't know.

113
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:40,839
So, you mean she won't be
asking for money yet?

114
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:42,609
She’ll wait?

115
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:44,807
Maybe she has bigger plans

116
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:46,499
...to hook you,
and marry you someday?

117
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:47,668
Is that it?

118
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:48,773
Jerk!

119
00:20:51,256 --> 00:20:55,026
You're the one who's not
sure if she's a prostitute,

120
00:20:55,051 --> 00:20:56,886
and I'm the jerk?

121
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:06,072
Do you still have beer?

122
00:22:31,939 --> 00:22:33,441
Hey Bro…

123
00:22:33,466 --> 00:22:35,051
Looking for some fun?

124
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:41,900
Do you already
have a regular here?

125
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:49,042
Maybe my girls can also do
what your regular does.

126
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:53,626
What are you looking for?

127
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,431
Young?

128
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:57,533
Really young?

129
00:22:58,069 --> 00:22:59,181
Old?

130
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:01,267
Girls?

131
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:03,362
Boys?

132
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:04,595
Gays?
Tomboy?

133
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:07,162
I think I’m looking for love.

134
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:13,348
Love?

135
00:23:13,373 --> 00:23:14,556
You're looking for love?

136
00:23:18,424 --> 00:23:19,675
Jerk!

137
00:23:19,753 --> 00:23:21,213
Screw you!

138
00:23:21,238 --> 00:23:22,540
Go to Quezon Avenue,

139
00:23:22,565 --> 00:23:24,066
that's where you can find
the Office of Pag-ibig (love)!

140
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:25,176
Dumbass!

141
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:27,203
Let’s go girls.

142
00:23:27,203 --> 00:23:28,287
You’re just wasting my time.

143
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:29,121
Jerk!

144
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:50,411
Do you have a husband?

145
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:54,829
We didn’t get married.

146
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,002
We just lived together.

147
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,903
It’s already been two years
since we separated.

148
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:03,972
He has a new partner now.

149
00:25:05,232 --> 00:25:07,276
What went wrong?

150
00:25:08,432 --> 00:25:09,848
Nothing…

151
00:25:10,915 --> 00:25:12,959
I got pregnant…

152
00:25:14,557 --> 00:25:17,519
We have a child, a girl.

153
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,221
We lived together for a few years.

154
00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:25,521
But we never got along.

155
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:28,461
I don’t think we’re meant
for each other.

156
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:29,862
It’s what it is.

157
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:32,585
Just like that?

158
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:36,373
At least, you’ve sort of
experienced married life.

159
00:25:37,653 --> 00:25:39,530
Never again.

160
00:25:41,162 --> 00:25:42,872
You’re just saying that.

161
00:25:42,897 --> 00:25:45,066
But then, what do I know about you?

162
00:25:47,074 --> 00:25:48,784
Do you have a wife?

163
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:50,635
Do I look like I have a wife?

164
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,634
Do you have a girlfriend?

165
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,054
Do I look like I’m fooling my girlfriend?

166
00:25:57,386 --> 00:25:59,430
Just answer me.

167
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:04,245
Is it okay with you if
I have a girlfriend or a wife?

168
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,122
What if you were my girlfriend

169
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:13,875
and I regularly meet
someone else every Thursday?

170
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,443
That okay with you?

171
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,749
I don’t think so.

172
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:24,348
I have thought about that before-

173
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:29,343
can my husband love two women
at the same time?

174
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,235
Or he loves me

175
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:36,558
but is also having sex with other girls.

176
00:26:38,094 --> 00:26:40,179
What do you think?

177
00:26:42,637 --> 00:26:47,225
Nothing… we broke off
before I was done thinking.

178
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:51,708
In the end, we did not fight
over some woman.

179
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:53,973
I just couldn’t stand him.

180
00:26:54,853 --> 00:26:57,301
We’re not good for each other.

181
00:26:58,195 --> 00:26:59,817
It’s sad.

182
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,801
So this thing with you
is fine with me.

183
00:27:02,826 --> 00:27:04,153
It’s different.

184
00:27:05,138 --> 00:27:07,432
So you don't ever have to pay me.

185
00:27:07,457 --> 00:27:08,786
This is enough.

186
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:13,908
How about you,
why aren’t you married yet?

187
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:16,877
Still looking for someone?

188
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:21,640
Or found someone but lost her?

189
00:27:22,763 --> 00:27:26,183
And can’t find someone new anymore?

190
00:27:28,017 --> 00:27:30,561
By the way, what were you
doing on the sidewalk

191
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:32,504
the first time I saw you?

192
00:27:34,324 --> 00:27:35,497
Nothing…

193
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:39,079
I just came from work.

194
00:27:39,226 --> 00:27:44,648
I thought of just standing there and wait.

195
00:27:45,941 --> 00:27:47,901
Wait for what?

196
00:27:49,754 --> 00:27:51,089
I don’t know.

197
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:54,856
Well, a salesgirl
doesn't earn much.

198
00:27:55,684 --> 00:27:56,889
Is that so?

199
00:27:58,307 --> 00:28:01,895
Just kidding! I was just there
waiting for a jeepney.

200
00:30:37,216 --> 00:30:38,842
I can’t stay long.

201
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:40,980
Why not?

202
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:44,964
I have work later.

203
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:47,392
Work later?

204
00:30:50,103 --> 00:30:54,524
I'll be working extra
as a waitress in a restobar.

205
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,127
Why?

206
00:31:00,072 --> 00:31:02,241
My mom had a stroke last week.

207
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:03,659
I don’t have money.

208
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:06,161
School is opening next month…

209
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:08,669
And we need to pay
for my siblings' tuition fees.

210
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:10,666
You need money?

211
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:14,503
I can’t take money from you.

212
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:15,587
Why?

213
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:17,696
It’s like payment.

214
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,925
I don’t want that day to come…

215
00:31:20,717 --> 00:31:22,844
…that I’d feel obliged
to have sex with you

216
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:24,329
in exchange for money.

217
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,009
You can just borrow it if you like.

218
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:28,120
I can’t.

219
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:32,020
Aren’t we friends?

220
00:31:33,981 --> 00:31:36,525
I don’t know what to call us.

221
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:39,341
What is this that we have?

222
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:41,541
I don’t know too.

223
00:31:42,628 --> 00:31:43,962
Let me guess…

224
00:31:45,575 --> 00:31:47,411
We don’t want any labels right?

225
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:51,081
That’s why up to now
we haven’t exchanged numbers yet.

226
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:56,211
And we still have reservations

227
00:31:57,337 --> 00:32:00,215
even if we’ve already talked
about so many things.

228
00:32:00,424 --> 00:32:03,051
That’s why I really can’t take
any amount from you.

229
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:06,411
That’s crap.

230
00:32:07,178 --> 00:32:08,721
Here’s the money.

231
00:32:08,746 --> 00:32:10,581
Get it if you want.

232
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:12,790
You don’t get it don’t you?

233
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:17,792
Just take it please.

234
00:33:35,508 --> 00:33:37,385
Pops, that’s okay…

235
00:33:38,105 --> 00:33:40,065
You’ve helped her in a way.

236
00:33:40,857 --> 00:33:42,001
You’ve had enough of her.

237
00:33:42,317 --> 00:33:43,443
That’s okay.

238
00:33:43,777 --> 00:33:44,569
Caloy,

239
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,780
don’t say that.

240
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:49,825
I’m not done with her.

241
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,168
I enjoy talking to her Pops.

242
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:55,872
I feel happy every time I’m with her.

243
00:33:57,152 --> 00:33:58,946
But for some reason,

244
00:33:59,347 --> 00:34:01,140
I can’t force myself
to see her again.

245
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,797
That’s after I handed her the money.

246
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:06,034
Exactly.

247
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,818
That’s because you know
it’s time to let go.

248
00:34:09,772 --> 00:34:10,981
Small fling.

249
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,200
Didn’t you say it’s just for adventure?

250
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:15,397
Now it’s finished.

251
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:16,632
Why,

252
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:18,117
are you ready to have kids?

253
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:21,148
That’s instant family for you Pops.

254
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:23,316
That would be a big responsibility.

255
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:29,823
I just don't know
what I'm feeling.

256
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,007
I'm just thinking now...

257
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:36,592
why the hell did I take
that left turn to that area.

258
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,319
Well, you need that.

259
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:43,390
Experience is the best
source of inspiration.

260
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:45,730
They say,

261
00:34:45,755 --> 00:34:46,983
in pain,

262
00:34:47,313 --> 00:34:49,565
artists work the best.

263
00:34:50,941 --> 00:34:52,276
Right.

264
00:34:52,685 --> 00:34:54,812
I can’t even take care of myself…

265
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,686
…what more raising a family.

266
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:58,568
You know what Pops…

267
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,480
Get your canvas and start painting.

268
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,110
Express what you feel.

269
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:07,527
Who knows, we can
even sell your paintings.

270
00:35:08,587 --> 00:35:10,755
Well then, I’ll just drop by
your house tomorrow?

271
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,199
I'll bring booze.

272
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:23,874
Bro, lookin' for a good time?

273
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:27,139
Fuck, I know you…

274
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:29,601
Aren’t you Mr. Lover Boy?

275
00:39:32,198 --> 00:39:34,950
Have you found your love already?

276
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:38,645
Have you found your love already?

277
00:39:39,092 --> 00:39:40,133
Huh?

278
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:42,010
What?

279
00:39:42,635 --> 00:39:43,803
You jerk!

280
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:45,346
What now?

281
00:39:54,022 --> 00:39:55,190
You fucker!

282
00:39:57,508 --> 00:39:58,943
Jerk!

283
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,462
Sorry Liza.
