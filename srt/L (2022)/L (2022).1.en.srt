1
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:46,864
They say that a camera
is the real time machine.

2
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:49,491
With it, you can go back to the past.

3
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:05,424
Hey, Lucas, what’s that?

4
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:06,779
A camera.

5
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:08,765
Turn it off, for fuck’s sake…

6
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:11,298
Come on, Lana, just this once…

7
00:01:11,323 --> 00:01:12,866
You want to get hurt?

8
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:16,643
You said you’re getting a
shower, so go take a shower.

9
00:01:18,472 --> 00:01:20,147
Yeah, I'm gonna shower now.

10
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,091
Lucas, I have something to tell you…

11
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:52,666
Who is it?

12
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:56,236
It’s Caloy, Pops,
who else could it be?

13
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:07,684
How are you, Pops?

14
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:12,384
Can I borrow your cutter?

15
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:16,447
- Cutter?
- Yeah.

16
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:23,395
You’ve been here so long, look…

17
00:03:23,978 --> 00:03:27,608
you’ve grown roots, so
I need to cut you loose.

18
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:32,990
That would have been funny…
if I wasn’t drunk.

19
00:03:37,276 --> 00:03:40,203
So when do you plan
to finish our project?

20
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:42,497
Deadline’s almost up.

21
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:44,666
You’ll be the first one
to know when it’s done.

22
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:46,491
I should.

23
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:48,420
I’m the one who answers to our clients.

24
00:03:52,251 --> 00:03:54,086
What’s your problem, Pops?

25
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:55,927
You’ve been like this
for a month now.

26
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:00,515
Enough already, man.

27
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:02,511
Let her go.

28
00:04:04,308 --> 00:04:08,656
That’s life, sometimes you win…

29
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:11,693
Sometimes you lose.

30
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:14,696
Look at me.

31
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:17,366
You remember Nadia, right?

32
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,119
I’ve been friends
with that girl for years.

33
00:04:22,698 --> 00:04:25,916
But I still couldn’t tell her
how I really feel.

34
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:34,007
Fuck,

35
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:36,635
Pops, your depression is contagious.

36
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:39,304
Get out of this shithole, man.

37
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:40,889
I’ll wait for you downstairs, okay?

38
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,643
You know how much I love you, right?

39
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:55,070
But I really need to go.

40
00:04:56,523 --> 00:04:58,615
I feel like a prisoner here.

41
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:06,325
If we’re meant to be,

42
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:09,876
we’ll meet again no matter what.

43
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,933
Hopefully.

44
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,425
Definitely.

45
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:28,019
Tell me, Pops?

46
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,230
You’ve been alone for a month now,

47
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,150
so are you watching porn again?

48
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:35,986
I don’t see the connection.

49
00:05:36,955 --> 00:05:40,667
Pops, you’ve been watching porn

50
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:42,801
since we were in Plata Mayora High School.

51
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:46,247
You only stopped when
Lana moved in with you.

52
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,411
So you want me to watch
triple X movies again?

53
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:52,521
For what?

54
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:54,067
Triple X?

55
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:57,802
Wow, you’re way
behind the lingo, man.

56
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,587
They’re called adult videos now, Pops.

57
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:01,962
But you know...

58
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,698
You're right. That's what I meant.

59
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:08,268
Your logic sucks.

60
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:14,559
They say that the best
cure for a hangover,

61
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:16,211
is to drink again.

62
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,997
So the best cure for a break-up,

63
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:20,997
is to find someone new.

64
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:24,252
So, you want me to pick up hookers,

65
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:26,154
or find a new girlfriend.

66
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:29,366
This from a guy
who can’t get over a girl

67
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:32,144
he couldn’t even talk to.

68
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:33,704
That’s right.

69
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,254
But it’s easier for you, Pops.

70
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:38,924
Just let your hero complex take over.

71
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,295
I have a hero complex?

72
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,906
Yeah, think about it, Pops.

73
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:48,694
Every girlfriend you’ve had,
had a family problem.

74
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:50,971
Or a psychological issue.

75
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:53,800
And you always wanted to help them.

76
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,535
But, Pops,

77
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,395
women are stronger now.

78
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,839
Strong enough to even rescue you.

79
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:21,785
Stop it!

80
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,187
Enough of your delusions, Lucas!

81
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:26,089
I don’t want you anymore! It’s over!

82
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:29,401
Lana, please, I still love you!

83
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:30,886
Can’t you see,

84
00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:32,609
we belong to each other?

85
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:34,010
It’s over!

86
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:39,099
It’s over!

87
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:45,736
This is what I miss.

88
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,405
Painting…

89
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,369
for myself.

90
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,999
Not for clients with stupid demands.

91
00:16:12,713 --> 00:16:13,801
Hello?

92
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,351
Yes, it’s me.

93
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,496
Were you expecting someone else?

94
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,606
You know I don’t like
talking to you this way, right?

95
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,441
But I have no choice!

96
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,053
Is this some kind of joke to you?

97
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,199
Are we just fooling ourselves?

98
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,065
My God,

99
00:16:39,526 --> 00:16:41,737
how long will you keep bringing this up?

100
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,620
Come on.

101
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:46,783
It's not like you were
always the loyal boyfriend.

102
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:48,385
It's done already.

103
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,705
We’re even.

104
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:56,205
I’m only saying this once.

105
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,544
That story was long finished, okay?

106
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,478
It’s done!

107
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:06,463
Fine.

108
00:17:07,346 --> 00:17:08,866
I'll see you there.

109
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:15,189
This is what I need.

110
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:22,393
Sir?

111
00:18:23,678 --> 00:18:24,770
Sir?

112
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,349
Sir,

113
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,738
did you see a girl come out here?

114
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:39,952
Sir, first of all,
it’s already six PM,

115
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:42,104
and the gallery is closing.

116
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:47,084
But the coffee shop
is open until eight PM.

117
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:59,196
Babes, Babes, I’m sorry,
please forgive me.

118
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,201
Sorry for being late,
the traffic was terrible.

119
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:03,045
Don’t be mad, okay?

120
00:19:04,781 --> 00:19:06,287
Come on, let’s have coffee first, okay?

121
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:08,548
Let's go.

122
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:18,045
Sir?

123
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:20,061
Let me just remind you.

124
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,912
That cigarette smoking
is dangerous to your health.

125
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,101
Especially...

126
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:25,806
If you're broken-hearted.

127
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:46,560
Who are you talking to?

128
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:49,313
Nothing, just some of the guys.

129
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:50,814
- Come on, let's eat.
- Let me see.

130
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,858
I said it’s nothing.

131
00:19:52,883 --> 00:19:54,126
Then let me see!

132
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,477
I thought we’re okay now?

133
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:56,638
You said you trust me now.

134
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,256
- Then you want to check my phone?
- Liar!

135
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:01,635
Hey!

136
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,668
Babe!

137
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,155
Are you following me?

138
00:20:40,647 --> 00:20:41,661
What?

139
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:43,959
No way.

140
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:45,395
Really?

141
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,287
You’ve been following me all night.

142
00:20:48,022 --> 00:20:49,899
You think I wouldn’t notice?

143
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,607
You think I’m your stalker, or something?

144
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:54,676
Why would I do that?

145
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,257
I don’t know, maybe
you should tell me?

146
00:20:59,435 --> 00:21:02,636
Miss, I’m in a hurry,

147
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,396
so please, get off my car.

148
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:11,420
If you follow me again,

149
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:13,155
I’ll crash into your car.

150
00:21:16,638 --> 00:21:17,638
Shit.

151
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:23,891
Need help?

152
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:42,605
Thanks.

153
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:43,886
Louise.

154
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:49,667
Lucas.

155
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,840
I really don’t know
anything about paintings.

156
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,653
Karl was the one who suggested
that we get something for his condo.

157
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:03,514
He was expecting me
to move in with him.

158
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,696
But I don’t think that will happen now.

159
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,119
It’s not easy, but
it’s fun to live together.

160
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:11,096
I speak from experience.

161
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,565
Just like being married?

162
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:14,066
Yes and no.

163
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,944
Yes because you’re always together,

164
00:22:17,091 --> 00:22:19,947
you find out the good and
the bad about each other.

165
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,410
No because nothing’s keeping you
from leaving if things don’t work out.

166
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:28,405
No binding contract, and usually, no kids.

167
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,540
Exactly.

168
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:41,063
I don’t have an issue with nudity.

169
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:42,490
It depends on the person.

170
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,932
But why do they do it?

171
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,745
And how can they do it?

172
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,974
Is it just a job?
Are they paid that much?

173
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,477
I knew of a nude model

174
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,654
back when I was studying Fine Arts.

175
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:03,532
She said they have no
problem with the nudity.

176
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,702
Keeping a pose for an hour
was actually their concern.

177
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:10,206
I have no idea what
their hourly rates were.

178
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,500
Perhaps they just want to try it out.

179
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:15,369
Could be a means of expression for them.

180
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,506
You don’t need to get naked
to express yourself, right?

181
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:23,279
I don’t know, maybe they
just want to be free, to escape.

182
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,642
But I must say,

183
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,685
it has style.

184
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,063
Intensity.

185
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,606
Daring.

186
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,670
Yup, daring.

187
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,303
Why are you speechless?

188
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,472
It’s nothing, I was just
reminded of my high school days.

189
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,935
I was bullied then,
because I wasn’t daring.

190
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,771
Someone bullied a pretty girl like you?

191
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,121
Louise, do you drink?

192
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,497
Maybe you’d like to…

193
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,999
Okay, sure.

194
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,293
But not tonight, maybe next time?

195
00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:24,650
It's okay.

196
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:27,825
Give me your phone, and
I’ll give you my number.

197
00:24:34,027 --> 00:24:35,027
There.

198
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:39,019
Text me, so I can save your number.

199
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,813
See you soon.

200
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,565
Thanks.

201
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,108
Drive safely!

202
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:12,068
Hello?

203
00:28:13,481 --> 00:28:17,318
Yo, Pops! Are you watching
your triple X movies again?

204
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:20,712
Jerk. I told you
I don’t watch those.

205
00:28:20,924 --> 00:28:22,936
Are you sure?

206
00:28:23,093 --> 00:28:24,928
I told you, I don’t watch those, right?

207
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,131
In that case,

208
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:28,732
where are my materials?

209
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:31,443
I’m working on it, okay?

210
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,086
You know, Pops…

211
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:36,656
there are three reasons
why you’re my favorite artist.

212
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:38,489
First,

213
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,619
because you’re my best friend.

214
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:42,246
Second,

215
00:28:42,603 --> 00:28:44,396
you are very good at your job.

216
00:28:44,483 --> 00:28:45,707
And third,

217
00:28:46,153 --> 00:28:47,363
you’re fast.

218
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:50,108
And now, I need you
to be fast, okay?

219
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:54,850
And I’m cheap, say it,
man, okay? I am very cheap.

220
00:28:57,016 --> 00:29:00,102
That depends on your
definition of cheap. But, Pops,

221
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:03,353
the client will kill me if
we don’t deliver on time.

222
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:07,323
So, please, please stop watching porn.

223
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,848
Okay, okay!

224
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,548
Stop harping. I’m going
to finish this, I swear.

225
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,166
Hello? Damn it, man.

226
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,253
I told you, I don’t watch porn!

227
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:16,639
Will you just quit it?

228
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:20,636
Why? What’s wrong with watching porn?

229
00:30:24,108 --> 00:30:25,108
Louise?

230
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,575
Looks like you’re busy.
I’ll call some other time.

231
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,312
No, no, no, I’m not busy!

232
00:30:32,314 --> 00:30:34,483
And you’re not watching porn, either?

233
00:30:34,508 --> 00:30:36,860
I am not watching porn.

234
00:30:37,158 --> 00:30:40,870
Not that there’s anything
wrong with watching porn, right?

235
00:30:40,897 --> 00:30:41,897
I mean...

236
00:30:41,946 --> 00:30:43,531
Not right now.

237
00:30:43,556 --> 00:30:45,865
But I don't really watch porn.

238
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,513
How about you,

239
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:52,292
do you watch, you know…

240
00:30:52,365 --> 00:30:57,248
What if we talk about
that over a few drinks?

241
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,675
Sure! Let’s do that.

242
00:31:00,006 --> 00:31:01,126
See you later?

243
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,456
See you, bye!

244
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,162
He won’t even talk about it.

245
00:31:12,685 --> 00:31:14,523
I hate that.

246
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:16,900
There should be closure.

247
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:20,879
I’m okay with not having closure.

248
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,408
Like what the character
in my favorite movie said...

249
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,453
Sometimes, it’s okay to have
stories with unfinished endings.

250
00:31:29,118 --> 00:31:33,139
Maybe that’s okay
with men, not so with us.

251
00:31:33,336 --> 00:31:34,584
Maybe.

252
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:36,793
Wait,

253
00:31:36,825 --> 00:31:40,132
what was that you said about
being bullied in high school?

254
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,835
Because I was fat and nerdy.

255
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,464
Really? That sounds impossible.

256
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,550
Really! I was overweight.

257
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,787
I wanted to join the
cheering squad so much.

258
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:58,467
But my trainer said there
were no more slots open.

259
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,778
She said I should
just try cross stitching.

260
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,575
My schoolmates called me penguin,

261
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:09,644
because I waddled like
a penguin when I walked.

262
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:13,965
My one and only crush
didn’t even notice me.

263
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,392
Because of how I look, I guess.

264
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:21,296
You know that crush of
yours who calls you fat

265
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,066
probably has hypertension.

266
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,635
You’re so mean!

267
00:32:25,998 --> 00:32:27,012
Joke!

268
00:32:28,588 --> 00:32:31,341
But if I were him,

269
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:35,354
I’d tell you that a person shouldn’t
be measured by the size of her body.

270
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,939
It’s measured by
the bigness of her heart.

271
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,193
You know...

272
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,740
You are beautiful.

273
00:33:02,196 --> 00:33:04,490
Nice place.

274
00:42:10,337 --> 00:42:12,882
They say that cameras
are the real time machines.

275
00:42:13,141 --> 00:42:15,685
Because with it, you
can go back to the past.

276
00:42:23,954 --> 00:42:25,330
Unfortunately,

277
00:42:25,355 --> 00:42:28,863
it can never take you to the future.

278
00:42:32,911 --> 00:42:34,996
Which one are you, Louise?

279
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,107
How much longer?

280
00:43:37,516 --> 00:43:39,058
Just a few seconds more.

281
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,841
I was just reminded
of my high school days…

282
00:43:44,866 --> 00:43:46,576
I was bullied then.

283
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,212
My one and only crush
didn’t even notice me.

284
00:43:51,237 --> 00:43:53,781
Because of how I look, I guess.

285
00:43:53,806 --> 00:43:55,517
Just let your hero complex take over.

286
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:57,168
I have a hero complex?

287
00:43:57,193 --> 00:43:58,465
Every girl you’ve had,
had a family problem.

288
00:43:58,465 --> 00:43:59,955
And you always wanted to help them.

289
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,565
But one time,

290
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:04,802
he defended me from the bullies.

291
00:44:04,827 --> 00:44:06,704
That's why I couldn't forget him.

292
00:44:07,009 --> 00:44:09,387
Fuck you, Louise!

293
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:15,845
You've always been beautiful,
even when we were still kids.

294
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:26,814
I thought I was
the one stalking you.

295
00:44:27,991 --> 00:44:30,193
You got me there.

296
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:06,145
Thanks, Louise.

297
00:45:06,876 --> 00:45:11,526
If we’re meant to be,

298
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:14,695
we’ll meet again no matter what.
