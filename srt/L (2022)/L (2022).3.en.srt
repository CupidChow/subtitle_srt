1
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:00,238
What the hell?

2
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:02,432
Stop these fantasies, Lucas.

3
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:04,584
We’re done! I don’t want
to be with you anymore!

4
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:06,028
Lana, come on.

5
00:01:06,538 --> 00:01:07,914
I still love you.

6
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:09,024
Look,

7
00:01:09,397 --> 00:01:10,998
we’re together again.

8
00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:12,442
I don’t want this anymore!

9
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:17,343
No more!

10
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:13,386
Hi.

11
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:15,575
I brought food.

12
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:17,590
Prof.

13
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,018
How’s my favorite student couple?

14
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:24,193
Come in.

15
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:33,397
Coffee?

16
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:34,423
Water?

17
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:35,903
I’m good.

18
00:02:37,863 --> 00:02:39,406
Where’s Lana?

19
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:46,768
She’s gone.

20
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:48,245
She left.

21
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:51,170
Why, what happened?

22
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:55,972
Are you okay?

23
00:05:18,437 --> 00:05:21,231
Do you want to talk about what happened?

24
00:05:26,322 --> 00:05:30,993
Don’t tell me you told her
that I was the one who devirginized you?

25
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:34,424
No. I didn’t tell her.

26
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:37,915
Good.

27
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:39,166
I mean,

28
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,101
Lana is liberal and all,

29
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,939
but I don’t know how
she’d react if she found out

30
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:47,258
we had this thing going on.

31
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:52,304
So what did you do
that made my favorite student leave you?

32
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:54,806
Why are you assuming
that it’s my fault?

33
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:58,849
And I thought I was your favorite student?

34
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:02,533
So you’re denying that it’s your fault?

35
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:05,137
Yes ma’am. I didn’t do anything wrong.

36
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:07,504
If that’s the case,

37
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:09,656
why did she leave?

38
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:18,425
She told me she felt trapped here.

39
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,800
She just got up and left.

40
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:23,186
Weird, right?

41
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:27,326
How are you doing? You okay?

42
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:29,967
I still dream about her.

43
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:36,565
Everything here reminds me of her.

44
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,315
If that’s the case,

45
00:06:39,361 --> 00:06:41,906
maybe you need to move out.

46
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:46,703
If there are too many memories
in this place,

47
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,044
maybe it’s time for you to...

48
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:51,155
leave.

49
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,586
Unless you’re still hoping
Lana will come back.

50
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:02,773
You’re leaving already?

51
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:05,805
You didn’t even get to have some coffee.

52
00:07:07,146 --> 00:07:10,079
Coffee and sex are just the same.

53
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:12,843
I still have to go pick up my kid.

54
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:14,578
Thank you, Prof.

55
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:16,672
You’re always there for me.

56
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:20,810
Well anyway, just call me
for anything. Alright?

57
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:22,546
I have to go.

58
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:40,164
Sir, when will my contract here end?

59
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:44,779
Why are you asking about your contract?

60
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:46,722
Are you planning to leave?

61
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:50,042
I’m not sure yet.
Just wanted to check.

62
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:52,149
That would be a waste.

63
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:54,320
You and your wife have been
staying here for quite a while.

64
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:57,473
Lana’s not my wife.
She’s just my girlfriend.

65
00:07:57,498 --> 00:08:00,117
Ah, you just live together then?

66
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:03,234
You know, your place of residence...

67
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,617
becomes more important
the longer you stay there,

68
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:11,490
because you create so many memories.

69
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,367
Memories make the house
a home, as they say.

70
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:16,105
Have you talked to
your girlfriend about this?

71
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,859
Did she agree on
moving somewhere else?

72
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:23,148
We’re not together anymore.

73
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:27,679
So that’s why. I understand
why you want to leave.

74
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:34,803
Remember this: it’s hell to live in a house
where sad memories were made.

75
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:38,091
Okay, sir, thanks.

76
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:16,592
Cheers!

77
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:57,985
Welcome sir, to our duplex house.

78
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,549
Let’s go in.

79
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:01,964
This house has two bedrooms,

80
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:03,354
there’s a bathroom upstairs,

81
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:04,455
and another one downstairs.

82
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,378
Our kitchen is nice and...

83
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,293
Hello?

84
00:11:59,505 --> 00:12:00,506
Anybody home?

85
00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:07,096
Hello?

86
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:21,735
Hello?

87
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:30,828
For rent?

88
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:50,717
The flow of water is stong here.

89
00:12:51,348 --> 00:12:53,076
It never floods in the area.

90
00:12:53,851 --> 00:12:55,373
No blackouts in the area, either.

91
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:57,062
And best of all,

92
00:12:57,563 --> 00:13:00,732
the wifi signal is strong.

93
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:04,319
Your property is beautiful.

94
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:06,964
I saw that you’re renting it out
for only seven thousand pesos?

95
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:07,865
Yes.

96
00:13:07,906 --> 00:13:11,076
One month advance,
one month deposit.

97
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,970
One year contract,

98
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,458
and we’re signing contracts.

99
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:18,333
Is that so?

100
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:20,291
The rent is really cheap.

101
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:24,084
May I ask why you’re renting it out
for so low?

102
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:27,217
My friends told me.

103
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,469
There, around you.

104
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:33,903
Don’t you see them?

105
00:13:37,801 --> 00:13:39,364
Your friends?

106
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:40,813
Yes.

107
00:13:41,373 --> 00:13:44,293
They told me seven was
a lucky number.

108
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:47,154
So I’m renting it out to you
for seven thousand.

109
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:52,618
Were you baptized as a child?

110
00:13:55,787 --> 00:13:57,789
What’s your zodiac sign?

111
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:00,584
Were you born on the Year of the Tiger?

112
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:06,810
Uh, nevermind. I’m good.

113
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:08,420
Thank you, thank you!

114
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:43,380
This time, I will show you our most
in-demand unit here in our condo.

115
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:46,273
And of course, after just
a five percent downpayment,

116
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:47,833
you can move in right away.

117
00:15:47,858 --> 00:15:51,903
As you enter, you can see
there’s a mini pantry over here.

118
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,835
Son of a bitch, Shirley!

119
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,147
Didn’t I tell you not to bring
any of your men here?

120
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,272
You're so annoying!

121
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:02,924
Get out of here!

122
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:04,916
I’m so sorry.

123
00:16:05,335 --> 00:16:06,649
Unbelievable!

124
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:09,563
And of course, sir, as you can see,

125
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:12,125
that’s how sturdy our beds are.

126
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,734
That was just a demonstration.

127
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,346
I hope you get the place,
I’m sure you’ll love it here.

128
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:18,747
Here’s your key!

129
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,716
You bitch! I’m the man here!
I’m the man!

130
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:40,886
- What the fuck is your problem, Rey?
- You’re my problem! Bitch...

131
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:46,201
- Oh, I'm your problem?
- Yeah, you! Shit!

132
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,967
I’ve just been holding back.
You want me to beat the shit out of you?

133
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:50,420
Son of a bitch!

134
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,507
Don’t swear at me!
I might just beat you up, you bitch!

135
00:16:53,507 --> 00:16:56,318
You’re just a woman!
You want me to beat you up?

136
00:16:56,343 --> 00:16:57,969
- Just a woman?
- Yes!

137
00:16:57,994 --> 00:17:00,584
Just a woman?
Well here you go then!

138
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:11,662
Sir? What do you need sir?

139
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:14,736
Oh nothing, nevermind.

140
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:17,044
No, it’s okay, you can come in.

141
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,115
No, no, I’m good.

142
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,851
It’s okay sir, if you want to come in...

143
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,123
Sir!

144
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:31,792
Help... Help me...

145
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,233
Hello, Prof?

146
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:55,819
Lucas?

147
00:17:56,653 --> 00:17:59,990
How’s your house hunting going?

148
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:01,408
Not good.

149
00:18:02,492 --> 00:18:05,304
I didn’t know it would be so hard
to look for a decent place these days.

150
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:08,265
Are you sure you’re looking properly?

151
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,928
Of course I am!

152
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,980
You sure? Maybe you’re still hoping...

153
00:18:15,005 --> 00:18:16,834
you know!

154
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,925
That Lana might come back to you.

155
00:18:19,943 --> 00:18:22,215
You know, I have an old friend.

156
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,681
Her kid disappeared.

157
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:27,876
The kid just didn’t come home one day.

158
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:31,938
So my friend was too scared
to move anywhere else.

159
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:37,152
She kept hoping that one day,
her kid might come back.

160
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:39,387
She wanted to still be there, just in case.

161
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:41,888
Don’t be like that, Lucas.

162
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:47,996
If Lana looks for you,
she’ll really look for you.

163
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:50,625
She’ll find her way back to you.

164
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:53,091
But you have to move on,

165
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:55,785
in case she doesn’t come back.

166
00:18:56,505 --> 00:18:58,674
That’s what she told me as well.

167
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:03,232
If we’re meant to be together,
we’ll meet again. Right?

168
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:06,973
Oh by the way, I saw
an apartment for rent.

169
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:11,203
I thought of you,
so I got the address.

170
00:19:11,228 --> 00:19:12,938
I’ll send it to you, alright?

171
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:14,178
Okay, Prof.

172
00:19:14,773 --> 00:19:15,774
Thank you!

173
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:57,607
What can I help you with?

174
00:19:57,632 --> 00:19:59,009
Good morning, sir.

175
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,752
I was the one who called you earlier.

176
00:20:00,777 --> 00:20:03,279
Oh, it’s you. Come in, sir.

177
00:20:06,283 --> 00:20:07,284
This is huge.

178
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:09,135
It's like a house already.

179
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,288
The space is really big,

180
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:14,332
so Mr. Lee decided to divide it
into apartments.

181
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:16,771
That's why it's spacious.

182
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:18,920
Oh by the way, where do you work?

183
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:23,358
Oh, I work in advertising.
I’m an artist.

184
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:24,718
Oh for commercials?

185
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:25,577
Yes, sir.

186
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:27,802
This is just the place for you,

187
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:33,326
because you know, artists like you
really seem to like old houses.

188
00:20:33,351 --> 00:20:35,520
But this is big, spacious.

189
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:37,856
You can turn it into your studio.

190
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:40,650
Is that so. Hold on,

191
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:43,396
how much are you renting this out for?

192
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:44,613
Nine thousand a month.

193
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,074
You can go on ahead.
Look at the place.

194
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:48,658
Alright, sir.

195
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:51,661
I have something cooking on the stove...

196
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:53,608
I’ll leave you to it!

197
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:01,189
Hi ma’am.

198
00:22:07,437 --> 00:22:09,021
Good afternoon.

199
00:22:09,963 --> 00:22:11,757
Good afternoon, ma’am.

200
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,239
The place is nice, isn’t it?

201
00:22:16,728 --> 00:22:19,130
Yes, really nice.

202
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:23,265
How many bathrooms does it have?

203
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:24,379
Huh?

204
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:25,947
How many bathrooms?

205
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:28,357
Ah, bathrooms?

206
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,682
There’s one down here,

207
00:22:30,707 --> 00:22:32,458
and another one upstairs.

208
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:35,319
It’s so spacious.

209
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:38,169
There’s two rooms upstairs,

210
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:43,127
and...

211
00:22:43,354 --> 00:22:45,356
the living room is really big.

212
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:47,174
It’s beautiful.

213
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,919
Old, but looks well taken care of.

214
00:22:55,563 --> 00:22:58,566
Yes ma’am. This is
very well taken care of.

215
00:22:58,621 --> 00:23:00,956
So... how much is the rent?

216
00:23:01,021 --> 00:23:02,133
Huh?

217
00:23:02,411 --> 00:23:04,502
The rent... how much?

218
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:06,849
Oh the rent!

219
00:23:08,673 --> 00:23:10,383
Nine thousand per month.

220
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:12,408
That’s pretty expensive.

221
00:23:12,637 --> 00:23:13,763
What a shame.

222
00:23:13,788 --> 00:23:17,375
Maybe we can still negotiate?

223
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:21,227
Yeah I think we can...

224
00:23:21,227 --> 00:23:22,353
P8,500!

225
00:23:22,463 --> 00:23:25,174
That’s still kind of high.
Really a shame.

226
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:28,860
We can do eight thousand.

227
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:31,795
Wow, you’re easy to deal with.

228
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,279
No worries, ma’am.

229
00:23:33,304 --> 00:23:35,864
As long as you’re easy
to deal with as well.

230
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:39,970
If you want it, it’s yours.

231
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:45,877
Thank you.

232
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:48,563
I want it,

233
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:51,100
but

234
00:23:53,955 --> 00:23:57,083
I still have to think about it.

235
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:03,269
This isn’t an easy decision for me.

236
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:08,483
You should really take time
to think about it.

237
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:12,487
It’s not easy to keep transferring
to different houses.

238
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:15,732
That would be like starting a new life
over and over again.

239
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:19,050
You said it.

240
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:21,951
That’s what I need.

241
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:23,451
To start over.

242
00:24:23,476 --> 00:24:26,229
Looks like we’re after the same thing.

243
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:32,253
I’ll probably come back tomorrow.

244
00:24:33,424 --> 00:24:35,510
I can’t make this decision right now.

245
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:37,996
My mind’s too scattered.

246
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:40,682
But maybe tomorrow...

247
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:42,767
if that’s okay with you?

248
00:24:43,685 --> 00:24:47,856
For you, it’s no problem!

249
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:52,777
Thank you.

250
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:55,029
And you are?

251
00:24:56,155 --> 00:24:57,657
Well...

252
00:24:58,408 --> 00:25:00,201
Mr. Lee!

253
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:06,954
You don’t look Chinese.

254
00:25:10,545 --> 00:25:12,193
Well that’s because my mom is a Filipina.

255
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:14,597
Her genes must be really dominant.

256
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:17,262
See you tomorrow then, Mr. Lee.

257
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:20,495
You can call me Lucas.

258
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:23,310
What’s your name?

259
00:25:40,992 --> 00:25:42,755
I’m Lucy.

260
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:09,938
So? Did you like it?

261
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:11,347
It’s big, isn’t it?

262
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:12,148
Yes, it is!

263
00:26:12,148 --> 00:26:13,816
The other room is pretty spacious.

264
00:26:13,816 --> 00:26:16,107
You can turn it into a studio!

265
00:26:16,132 --> 00:26:19,302
Can’t we negotiate to a lower fee?

266
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,909
Oh no, my boss is pretty rigid.

267
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:25,286
- Is that so...
- Yes.

268
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,379
Okay, I’ll just come back tomorrow then.

269
00:26:27,404 --> 00:26:29,390
- Okay, sure!
- Thank you!

270
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:30,917
Hold on,

271
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:33,711
were you talking to someone
a while ago?

272
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:35,815
Ah, yes!

273
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,427
That was my mom. I was on
a call with her.

274
00:26:38,452 --> 00:26:41,622
Oh so that’s why I heard you talking.

275
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:43,648
Alright sir, thanks again!

276
00:26:43,673 --> 00:26:45,175
Okay, sir, take care!

277
00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:57,943
I can’t get the color right.

278
00:27:07,721 --> 00:27:09,849
This is so frustrating.

279
00:27:34,814 --> 00:27:38,026
Go sit with that guy.
Looks like he’s alone.

280
00:27:40,114 --> 00:27:42,230
Hi papi.

281
00:27:42,255 --> 00:27:44,173
Want some company?

282
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:46,534
Sorry, not right now.

283
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,561
Maybe next time.

284
00:29:07,073 --> 00:29:09,534
Hey boss, that’s not allowed.

285
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,869
No, hold on. Lucy!

286
00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:17,346
You're causing a scene.
Get out of here.

287
00:30:10,994 --> 00:30:14,539
What am I doing here?

288
00:30:21,105 --> 00:30:23,608
Why are you packing up already?

289
00:30:23,633 --> 00:30:26,136
You haven’t even found a new place yet.

290
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:31,882
And the quality of your work
is changing, man.

291
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:36,232
Mr. Limjoco has so many comments.

292
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,593
Shit, man.

293
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:40,120
I’m getting annoyed with you.

294
00:30:40,145 --> 00:30:42,773
These aren’t the specs we discussed.

295
00:30:43,823 --> 00:30:46,075
You’re so weird.

296
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,330
Seriously...

297
00:30:49,061 --> 00:30:51,563
If you don’t want to do this anymore,
then just quit.

298
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:56,278
And paps, I never dreamed of becoming
the villain in your life.

299
00:30:57,433 --> 00:31:01,229
I don’t want my role to be
your funny sidekick.

300
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:03,940
Or the guy who has to tell you off
about your angst.

301
00:31:03,976 --> 00:31:05,853
Or some kind of supporting role.

302
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:09,744
Paps, at least let me have some lines.

303
00:31:10,344 --> 00:31:12,360
Here’s the deal:

304
00:31:13,157 --> 00:31:16,410
If you don’t want to do this anymore,
if you’re not happy,

305
00:31:17,036 --> 00:31:18,118
if...

306
00:31:18,535 --> 00:31:23,623
you think our jobs,
or our lifestyle is bullshit,

307
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,417
then stop!

308
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:28,237
Do what you want to do.

309
00:31:28,501 --> 00:31:30,586
You don’t have to go with our flow.

310
00:31:31,154 --> 00:31:32,614
And with women?

311
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,844
Be straight with them
about what you want.

312
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:38,121
Stop the bullshit.

313
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:42,828
It’s not like you have anything to lose.

314
00:31:42,853 --> 00:31:43,853
Right?

315
00:31:50,705 --> 00:31:51,758
There you go.

316
00:31:52,274 --> 00:31:55,152
I know what that smirk means.

317
00:31:56,384 --> 00:31:58,469
You’re saying...

318
00:31:58,494 --> 00:32:01,097
“You’re so amazing, Caloy San Antonio!"

319
00:32:01,122 --> 00:32:05,251
"What would I do without you?”

320
00:32:05,918 --> 00:32:07,420
Well...

321
00:32:07,445 --> 00:32:10,072
you’re welcome, my friend.

322
00:32:15,553 --> 00:32:17,047
It’s really nice,

323
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:20,680
but I have to think about it.

324
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:23,333
This isn’t an easy decision for me.

325
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:25,267
That’s okay.

326
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:27,680
You really have to think about it.

327
00:32:29,011 --> 00:32:31,031
Moving to a new place isn’t
an easy thing to do.

328
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,086
It’s like starting over.

329
00:32:35,017 --> 00:32:37,883
You said it.

330
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,667
That’s exactly what I need.

331
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,443
Change.

332
00:32:42,468 --> 00:32:44,126
Looks like we’re after the same thing.

333
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:48,766
We both need change.

334
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,521
Who else is here?

335
00:36:03,565 --> 00:36:05,400
She came back, didn’t she?

336
00:36:06,115 --> 00:36:07,535
Who?

337
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:10,162
You hid her in the closet, didn’t you?

338
00:36:10,187 --> 00:36:11,480
No one else is here!

339
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:13,757
Did you talk to your mom?

340
00:36:13,782 --> 00:36:16,118
Will she come live with you here?

341
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,554
No, she won’t.

342
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:31,976
There’s no one there!

343
00:36:31,976 --> 00:36:34,103
I came in here
because I heard someone.

344
00:36:34,103 --> 00:36:35,104
There’s no one!

345
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:37,022
I heard someone...

346
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:40,943
Motherfucker!

347
00:37:48,052 --> 00:37:49,052
Hi Lucy!

348
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,595
I’m sorry, the caretaker isn’t here yet.

349
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,747
He didn’t even leave the key.

350
00:37:55,392 --> 00:37:57,686
Do you want to go grab a bite first?

351
00:38:12,993 --> 00:38:16,455
If you want to order anything else,
Lucy, go ahead.

352
00:38:16,497 --> 00:38:18,165
No, this is enough.

353
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:21,293
Lucy,

354
00:38:21,335 --> 00:38:23,379
can I be frank with you?

355
00:38:24,213 --> 00:38:25,881
Of course.

356
00:38:25,923 --> 00:38:27,633
What is it?

357
00:38:27,716 --> 00:38:29,343
When I first saw you...

358
00:38:29,802 --> 00:38:31,845
I was taken aback...

359
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:32,596
so...

360
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:33,722
So what?

361
00:38:34,598 --> 00:38:39,186
So I said something I shouldn’t have.

362
00:38:39,812 --> 00:38:40,938
What?

363
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:47,861
Don’t get mad but...

364
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,697
But what?

365
00:38:50,072 --> 00:38:53,242
But I don’t...

366
00:38:53,283 --> 00:38:54,910
You don’t what?

367
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:57,437
I don’t think I can lower the rent.

368
00:38:57,579 --> 00:38:59,957
It’s really P9,000

369
00:39:00,249 --> 00:39:01,250
Oh...

370
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,085
that’s a shame.

371
00:39:03,377 --> 00:39:04,712
I’m sorry.

372
00:39:05,225 --> 00:39:08,311
I wasn’t able to think
clearly at the time.

373
00:39:08,507 --> 00:39:10,426
I was really taken aback.

374
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:14,138
That’s okay. I understand.

375
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:16,744
At least you’re being honest.

376
00:39:16,769 --> 00:39:18,687
That’s what’s important.

377
00:39:20,147 --> 00:39:22,065
What’s so funny?

378
00:39:24,978 --> 00:39:26,483
Nothing. I was just so curious

379
00:39:26,483 --> 00:39:28,694
about what you were about to say.

380
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:31,013
I thought it was something personal.

381
00:39:33,323 --> 00:39:34,950
There’s something personal too.

382
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,702
I wasn’t done.

383
00:39:37,745 --> 00:39:39,413
What is it?

384
00:39:39,413 --> 00:39:40,956
The truth is,

385
00:39:40,956 --> 00:39:43,375
when you first entered the apartment...

386
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:45,794
I had a feeling about you right away.

387
00:39:46,795 --> 00:39:47,755
What feeling?

388
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:49,798
I just felt right around you.

389
00:39:50,215 --> 00:39:51,925
Like...

390
00:39:51,925 --> 00:39:54,344
Like I could be straight
with you right away.

391
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:56,930
Can we be friends?

392
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,642
Of course.

393
00:40:00,642 --> 00:40:01,894
Really?

394
00:40:03,604 --> 00:40:06,023
As long as you’ll lower the rent...

395
00:40:07,941 --> 00:40:09,068
joke!

396
00:40:09,985 --> 00:40:13,739
I came here to rent an apartment,

397
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,492
not to eat.

398
00:40:17,326 --> 00:40:20,829
If I wasn’t willing
to be friends with you,

399
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:23,190
then why would be here with you now?

400
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:26,135
Lucy, who are you moving with?

401
00:40:26,483 --> 00:40:27,734
No one.

402
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:28,927
It’s just me.

403
00:40:28,952 --> 00:40:32,748
Really? Don’t you have parents,

404
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,010
siblings, or anyone?

405
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:37,054
Maybe... A husband?

406
00:40:37,054 --> 00:40:39,181
No...

407
00:40:39,264 --> 00:40:40,682
not anymore.

408
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:43,852
We split up.

409
00:40:45,537 --> 00:40:47,122
I guess we’re in the same boat.

410
00:40:47,147 --> 00:40:48,565
Huh?

411
00:40:52,903 --> 00:40:55,364
Lucas, I’m sorry but...

412
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:58,283
I’m not going to
get the apartment anymore.

413
00:40:58,308 --> 00:41:03,313
I don’t think I can live
by myself yet.

414
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:07,605
I might just go back to my hometown
in Batangas for now.

415
00:41:09,086 --> 00:41:10,796
Lucy...

416
00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:13,757
what did he do to you?

417
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:17,803
My life is a mess, Lucas.

418
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:20,597
I thought...

419
00:41:21,455 --> 00:41:23,392
Jerry was the one.

420
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:31,024
All I wanted was loyalty.

421
00:41:33,026 --> 00:41:34,695
Simple as that.

422
00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:36,947
I get you.

423
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:40,008
Men are really hard to trust.

424
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:42,119
Not him, Lucas.

425
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:43,537
Me.

426
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:46,415
Loyalty,

427
00:41:46,415 --> 00:41:49,668
no matter how simple it is,

428
00:41:49,668 --> 00:41:53,755
even I couldn’t give that to him.

429
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,379
We were okay.

430
00:42:04,182 --> 00:42:06,018
Better than okay.

431
00:42:06,886 --> 00:42:09,013
One day,

432
00:42:09,038 --> 00:42:11,999
some guy just started texting me.

433
00:42:13,029 --> 00:42:15,782
He said he was my secret admirer.

434
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:18,643
At first, I didn’t reply.

435
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:20,503
But he was persistent.

436
00:42:20,528 --> 00:42:22,947
So I just went with it.

437
00:42:22,972 --> 00:42:25,642
I even told Jerry about it

438
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:27,335
He just found it funny.

439
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,821
It went on for three days.

440
00:42:29,846 --> 00:42:32,765
On the first day, we talked until morning.

441
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,626
It was getting serious.

442
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:39,163
I liked talking to him.

443
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,627
We had so much in common.

444
00:42:42,747 --> 00:42:47,293
More than me and Jerry.

445
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:52,111
I admit, I became interested.

446
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:57,271
We started sending pictures.

447
00:42:58,028 --> 00:42:59,446
Until...

448
00:42:59,738 --> 00:43:02,240
our conversation started to get dirty.

449
00:43:04,201 --> 00:43:05,827
We talked about sex.

450
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:08,956
But it was fine.

451
00:43:09,498 --> 00:43:11,083
Harmless.

452
00:43:11,108 --> 00:43:12,526
It was just texting.

453
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,505
Until he asked to meet up.

454
00:43:19,716 --> 00:43:21,551
I even thought...

455
00:43:21,551 --> 00:43:24,179
so what if we meet up?

456
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:26,390
It wouldn’t mean anything.

457
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,476
Finally,

458
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:32,271
even though I was really nervous,

459
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:35,232
I went to meet up with him.

460
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:39,361
When I got there, I saw Jerry.

461
00:43:40,737 --> 00:43:42,990
He told me he had just borrowed
his colleague’s phone

462
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,713
to text me because he ran out of battery.

463
00:43:45,738 --> 00:43:49,575
He had no intention of taking
the joke that far.

464
00:43:49,798 --> 00:43:51,509
But I fell for it.

465
00:43:52,552 --> 00:43:55,634
He got really sad when
I started taking it seriously,

466
00:43:56,024 --> 00:43:58,392
and when I agreed to meet up.

467
00:44:04,112 --> 00:44:05,905
That’s when he said goodbye.

468
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:15,603
I was so angry at myself.

469
00:44:16,423 --> 00:44:18,002
At what I did.

470
00:44:18,527 --> 00:44:22,291
No one can be trusted.

471
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:31,400
Everyone lies.

472
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,950
We’re all liars.

473
00:44:40,615 --> 00:44:43,951
You’re the only one who can
make me feel this way, Lucas.

474
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:47,312
You’re all that I need to be happy.

475
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:48,947
We’re different.

476
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:53,452
I’ve never felt this way before.

477
00:44:53,477 --> 00:44:55,020
If I lose you---

478
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,397
I won’t be able to pick myself up.

479
00:44:57,422 --> 00:44:58,840
Don’t leave me.

480
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:00,083
Don’t leave me.

481
00:45:00,108 --> 00:45:02,819
I will always wait for you, Lucas.

482
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:07,657
I should go, Lucas.

483
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:34,201
Lucy!

484
00:45:34,226 --> 00:45:35,226
Lucy!

485
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:37,269
Lucy...

486
00:45:37,632 --> 00:45:40,767
I’m not a liar.

487
00:47:49,527 --> 00:47:51,220
I trusted you...

488
00:47:51,488 --> 00:47:53,365
why did you lie to me?

489
00:48:56,289 --> 00:48:57,289
Lucy!

490
00:48:57,874 --> 00:48:58,874
Lucy!

491
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,140
Lucy!

492
00:49:02,846 --> 00:49:05,557
Can we talk at the restaurant instead?

493
00:49:05,582 --> 00:49:07,208
It’s too hot in here.

494
00:50:47,851 --> 00:50:49,645
Who else is here?

495
00:50:49,835 --> 00:50:50,916
Huh?

496
00:50:51,245 --> 00:50:52,579
No one!

497
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:55,956
What do you mean “no one”?
I heard someone.

498
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:03,805
There’s no one here!

499
00:51:03,805 --> 00:51:06,015
I came in here
because I heard someone.

500
00:51:06,015 --> 00:51:06,850
There’s no one!

501
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:08,643
I heard someone!

502
00:51:18,027 --> 00:51:19,142
Sorry sir.

503
00:51:20,613 --> 00:51:22,416
Looks like there’s no one here.

504
00:51:22,441 --> 00:51:24,443
I apologize.

505
00:51:28,329 --> 00:51:30,832
I just thought...

506
00:51:31,124 --> 00:51:32,625
I’m sorry.

507
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,402
There really is no one.

508
00:51:37,797 --> 00:51:40,717
- I saw it with my own eyes.
- There's really no one here.

509
00:51:40,717 --> 00:51:43,720
Nobody else has looked
at this place aside from you,

510
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,041
it’s been two months now.

511
00:51:45,597 --> 00:51:48,600
Who was living here before?

512
00:51:50,314 --> 00:51:52,845
A married couple, always fighting.

513
00:51:53,056 --> 00:51:54,477
They split up.

514
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,838
Not a happy ending.

515
00:51:57,901 --> 00:52:01,529
Don’t make me talk anymore, sir.

516
00:52:01,654 --> 00:52:03,364
Because...

517
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:05,975
it really wasn’t a happy ending.

518
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:10,430
The woman who used
to live here... Lu...

519
00:52:10,455 --> 00:52:12,373
Oh sir.

520
00:52:12,432 --> 00:52:13,975
I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

521
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,947
Don’t ask me about it.

522
00:52:16,669 --> 00:52:21,424
What happened here
was kind of dark.

523
00:52:28,022 --> 00:52:29,357
Well sir?

524
00:52:29,974 --> 00:52:33,394
Are you here to rent out the house?

525
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:35,900
Well?

526
00:53:32,828 --> 00:53:35,189
Lucas! How are you?

527
00:53:35,498 --> 00:53:38,017
So what, are you seriously leaving?

528
00:53:38,574 --> 00:53:41,202
I’m sorry, it’s just that...

529
00:53:41,227 --> 00:53:42,854
A bunch of people have been asking.

530
00:53:42,879 --> 00:53:47,258
I need to know,
so I can find a new tenant.

531
00:53:47,674 --> 00:53:49,033
New tenant?

532
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:51,162
Is someone moving in?

533
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,890
Of course!

534
00:53:52,915 --> 00:53:57,253
You’re leaving, so I have to find
someone else to rent the place.

535
00:53:57,312 --> 00:53:58,438
Oh no sir,

536
00:53:58,438 --> 00:54:00,982
maybe you can give me
a bit more time.

537
00:54:01,161 --> 00:54:04,540
I’ll let you know within this week.

538
00:54:06,487 --> 00:54:07,697
Alright.

539
00:54:07,697 --> 00:54:09,365
This week, okay?

540
00:54:09,365 --> 00:54:10,491
Yes sir, thank you.

541
00:54:10,491 --> 00:54:12,035
I’ll go inside.

542
00:54:35,558 --> 00:54:38,061
You know what, bro...

543
00:54:38,204 --> 00:54:44,627
I don’t think I can imagine other people
living here when I leave.

544
00:54:46,874 --> 00:54:51,712
Someone else will sit here in the
living room where Lana used to sit.

545
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:56,792
Someone else will be
cooking in the kitchen.

546
00:54:57,162 --> 00:55:02,084
Someone else will use
the bathroom that Lana uses.

547
00:55:04,895 --> 00:55:06,283
That bed...

548
00:55:07,523 --> 00:55:10,318
I don’t think I can accept the thought

549
00:55:10,343 --> 00:55:13,513
that other people will be sleeping
in the bed Lana and I used to share.

550
00:55:13,513 --> 00:55:14,972
And bro,

551
00:55:14,997 --> 00:55:18,667
other people will be fucking in that bed,

552
00:55:18,913 --> 00:55:20,624
in this living room,

553
00:55:20,687 --> 00:55:22,438
the kitchen,

554
00:55:22,463 --> 00:55:26,175
and the bathroom where you used
to do her as well.

555
00:55:26,864 --> 00:55:28,782
Fuck you, man.

556
00:55:29,414 --> 00:55:31,332
You’re drunk.

557
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,061
But seriously,

558
00:55:39,546 --> 00:55:41,214
it seems wrong.

559
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,877
I can't accept it.

560
00:55:45,269 --> 00:55:49,482
Bro, you’re still holding on to
your memories with Lana.

561
00:55:49,507 --> 00:55:51,384
You’re still in love with her.

562
00:56:19,662 --> 00:56:22,707
Hey Lucas, it’s late.

563
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:25,877
What’s up, is everything okay?

564
00:56:26,085 --> 00:56:27,462
Are you drunk?

565
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,356
Yes, Prof. Caloy and I have been drinking,

566
00:56:30,381 --> 00:56:31,931
but he’s drunk now too.

567
00:56:32,383 --> 00:56:34,392
Why did you call?

568
00:56:34,533 --> 00:56:38,688
Prof, I just wanted to ask you something.

569
00:56:39,015 --> 00:56:42,518
That story you told me,
about your friend...

570
00:56:42,543 --> 00:56:45,462
the one who was waiting
for her kid that disappeared.

571
00:56:45,487 --> 00:56:48,073
Did the kid ever come back?

572
00:56:48,098 --> 00:56:51,184
Yeah, the kid came home.

573
00:56:51,209 --> 00:56:53,955
Alright Prof, that’s all I wanted to hear.

574
00:56:55,089 --> 00:56:59,135
Good night, I’m sorry for disturbing you.

575
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,972
I miss you, I love you, bye Prof.

576
00:57:02,997 --> 00:57:04,373
But...

577
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:07,884
the kid was brought home dead.
