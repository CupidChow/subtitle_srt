1
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,160
It's getting close to the final stretch
of the pairing on "Love Moment."

2
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,120
Some pairs are becoming clear,
but others are still uncertain.

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,440
Still being polite back and forth.

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,640
But today, they have to fight for their own love.

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,480
In the end, who will end up with whom, anything can happen.
Let's cheer them on.

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,880
Honestly, I want to try with Pailiu.
I said I wanted to pair with her. I like her. I really like her.

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,920
When we went on a date
and when we filmed the miniseries, I felt...

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,400
I like her.

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,000
I want to stay paired with June.

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,000
But I have to see if she feels the same.

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,800
At first, I wanted to explore many people, right?

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,760
But after I got paired with Lita, it's become clearer that

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,480
pairing with her makes me happy.
Things flow and I'm myself when I work with her.

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,680
She's balancing me out.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,360
-Hello.
-Hello. Hello.

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,240
Have a seat.

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,240
Have a seat.

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,160
How are you feeling? You've been here six weeks now.

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,320
This is the sixth week.

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,280
I'm happy.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,200
-You're happy.
-Pretty good.

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,600
And how about your partner? How is it going?

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,160
It's suspenseful.

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,400
Right? I'm not sure if she thinks of me that way,
or if she already has someone in mind, you know?

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,680
Suspenseful.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,920
How about you, Dear? Confident or also uncertain?

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,520
I have no idea. I can't guess.

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,800
But you have someone you've set your heart on?

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,040
Yes.

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
For you, Neuanaow, I think it's quite clear.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,200
I'm very happy.

32
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,360
Ooh.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,000
You look in love. She looks in love.

34
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,480
She's showing off.

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,120
You four being this way is why I called you here.

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,080
Because from the info and the chemistry
we've observed in the Love Moment house,

37
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,680
you four seem to have genuine love and dedication
toward the partners you chose.

38
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,720
But the reason I called you here is
to tell you the challenge for today's pairing.

39
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,120
Which is...

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:23,120
Nice, Hling, Dear, and Neuanaow, you have to show
your dedication to your partners by making them a gift.

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,320
Hm.

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,840
Express your feelings through an object.

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,840
I'll give you some time to prepare
the gift for the partner of your choice.

44
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,040
This time you've got to give it your all.
The final stretch is approaching.

45
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,640
Good luck.

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,960
Thank you.

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,920
Go ahead.

48
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,720
I've decided who I'll make it for.
I'm aiming straight for her.

49
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,080
(arts and crafts)

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,560
Wow, the rule today is these four girls have to
make a gift for the person they want to pair with,

51
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,960
to show them their dedication. There are no restrictions.

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,560
They have to decide on
their own and use creativity.

53
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,800
I can't wait to see what each will make.

54
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,360
She's going to love it.

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,040
As for the other four girls,

56
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,520
it seems they have no idea what's going on.

57
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,520
Hold on. What are you girls up to?

58
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,720
-Hello.
-Hello.

59
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,760
Hi, I've got a mission for you to do.

60
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,000
Because today, all of you are the chosen ones.

61
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,400
We've been chosen?

62
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,760
-Yes.
-But you don't have to choose today.

63
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,240
Someone might choose you
and you might have to choose them back.

64
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,840
So I've brought some materials for you to make
a return gift for the person who'll choose you.

65
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,600
-You can make pretty flowers.
-Thank you.

66
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,400
She just spoiled it. Make flowers.

67
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,520
Can we open it?

68
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,320
Go ahead.

69
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,160
These are materials for making flowers.

70
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,080
Something like that.

71
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,240
To say thanks.

72
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Here's an example.

73
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Did you make that?

74
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,320
Yes, I did.

75
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,280
Really?

76
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,720
For real?

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,400
Maybe it'll inspire your return gift
for the person who'll choose you.

78
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,000
Good luck, girls.

79
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,480
Thank you.

80
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,680
This'll be easy.

81
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,400
My specialty.

82
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,440
This group has to make flowers
to give to whoever gives them a gift.

83
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,800
I wanna make one for everyone, but I don't have the skill.

84
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,920
Okay, I got one petal.

85
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
Ooh, looks pretty.

86
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,480
Meanwhile, the four girls who went shopping for materials

87
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,000
are in their corners,
putting their hearts into making gifts.

88
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,560
I've noticed she always wears jewelry.
She wears something different every day.

89
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,640
So I thought I'd make her a necklace.
Just a necklace I made from my heart, and...

90
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,680
I'll write her a letter, too.

91
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:56,560
I rewrote the letter five, six, seven times.
I kept revising it.

92
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,840
I feel like, okay, even though
I haven't really shown my feelings,

93
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,520
and we've never acted in the miniseries together
or been paired up, I still feel that...

94
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,760
at least I tried. I don't know how it'll turn out,
but for her, I'm willing to do it.

95
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,920
Not sure if Nice's decision to make a gift for Pailiu today

96
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,640
has anything to do with June asking to pair with Hling,

97
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,960
but either way, I'm rooting for all of you.

98
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,680
-Really?
-Yes.

99
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,720
You have to go all it.

100
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,640
I will. I'll try something new.

101
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
I will.

102
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,840
It's really okay. I'm happy.

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,680
Because she loves desserts and...

104
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,600
At first, I wanted to make chocolate, like chocolate gems,
but I felt it was too easy.

105
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,360
Jeab said we have to show our effort and dedication,

106
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,360
so I decided to make chocolate chip cookies
because she loves chocolate.

107
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,320
I picked everything carefully and checked
the list to make sure I got everything

108
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,160
because I'm pretty forgetful, so I was like,
"I can't fail. I don't wanna fail." Yeah.

109
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,200
My gift looks very serious.

110
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,640
"This one's definitely unique. Oh, Neuanaow, I love it."

111
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,240
I wanted that vibe, so I went with this.

112
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,960
I put my heart into every stitch.

113
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,800
I tried to make everything look perfect,
but still unique and somewhat special.

114
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,520
I strung the beads very carefully:
"I have to string two beads, I have to string four beads."

115
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,760
I was really focused.

116
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,320
I'm pretty sure it's this person.
No matter what her answer is, it's gotta be her.

117
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,240
Yeah.

118
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,640
Like I told you girls this morning,
you're gonna use your dedication

119
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,960
to win the hearts of the ones you want to pair with.

120
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,720
Now it's time.

121
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,240
So I'll let Pailiu go first.

122
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,840
Okay.

123
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,880
The ones who prepared a surprise for Pailiu,
please come out.

124
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,240
Both of you, come on out.

125
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:55,200
While Nice decided to move on,
Dear still chose to stay true to her original feelings.

126
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,760
It's understandable, because the time
she spent with Pailiu meant a lot to her.

127
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,240
Open your eyes.

128
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,720
Oh, my God.

129
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,760
It's playing with my heart.
This is totally playing with my heart.

130
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,680
So there are two people who made gifts
for Pailiu, which are Nice and Dear.

131
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,160
But doesn't Hling want to pair with Pailiu today?

132
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,000
At first, I really wanted to pair with her.

133
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,760
She was the one I liked from the start, so I fought for her.

134
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,520
I fought to get a date with her. And after we talked more

135
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,800
and went on that date, I started to feel that

136
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,880
I want Pailiu to meet more people
in case she finds someone who truly feels right for her.

137
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,720
Because at least we already acted
in the miniseries and went on a date.

138
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
So I'm already one of her options.

139
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,840
I'd rather she spends time in this house
to find the person who's really right for her.

140
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,640
But if I'm really the one for her, maybe she will return to me.

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,160
No, is this ship sinking?

142
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,240
No, there are still two weeks left.

143
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,520
If you ship this pair, don't give up. Keep on sailing.

144
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,360
All four girls really put their hearts into making gifts
for the people they chose today.

145
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,200
Like Dear, she woke up super early this morning to...

146
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,160
bake cookies.

147
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
I'm okay.

148
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,120
Because she knows you love desserts.

149
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,440
-I see.
-So she baked you something to enjoy.

150
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,280
And Nice, why did you make a necklace for Pailiu?

151
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,680
I feel that you like jewelry, so I made you

152
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,880
a necklace and a bracelet. I also wrote you a letter.

153
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,400
Pailiu, I'll give you some time
to decide who you want to pick.

154
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,640
Okay.

155
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,320
-Playing with my heart.
-No pressure.

156
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,280
Go ahead, choose with your heart.

157
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,160
It's so hard.

158
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,360
Thank you.

159
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,960
Nice and I have never
had the chance to be paired.

160
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Never even got to workshop together, so
I thought, okay, so I'll pick Nice this time.

161
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,680
My mind went round in circles,
then suddenly she poked me.

162
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,080
Everything went away. Like, "Oh, me?"
And I thought, "Okay, I'll do my best this time."

163
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,520
No, no, don't cry.

164
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,240
Don't speak. Don't speak.

165
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,440
So Pailiu and Nice are now officially paired up.

166
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,600
Okay, Nice and Pailiu, please take your seats.

167
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,200
Then can I taste Dear's cookies instead?

168
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,360
-You wanna try the cookies?
-Yeah.

169
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,200
-Go ahead.
-Let's trade.

170
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,160
Let's trade, okay?

171
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,720
Hold on. So Pailiu and Nice...

172
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,040
-Yes. And Dear and I...
-are paired up.

173
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,920
So Wafer is...

174
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,040
paired with Dear.

175
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,040
You want to eat these cookies instead.

176
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,480
Don't cry.

177
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,120
Dear was kind of scared to step out from the start.

178
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,880
I was the one who told her to go for it.

179
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,760
It's not wrong for Pailiu not to pick someone, you know?

180
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,440
It's like a crown. There can only be one winner.

181
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,920
How is it?

182
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,600
So good, thank you.

183
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,760
Oh, they're both crying now.

184
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,240
I was so surprised to see Wafer cry.

185
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,280
She probably cried because I did
because I was really crying. I couldn't hold it in.

186
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,520
I'm so sad. I didn't get my wish again.

187
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,880
She didn't choose you today, but there's always tomorrow.
Keep fighting, Dear.

188
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,400
Now we have two happy pairs, thanks to a lovely coincidence.

189
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,360
Congrats to both pairs.

190
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,840
But there are two people left
who still have to find their partners.

191
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,040
So next, Lita, please go stand in the middle.

192
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,840
And please close your eyes.

193
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,040
Whoever chose Lita, please step forward.

194
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,920
And the one who chose Lita...

195
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,920
wake her up.

196
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,200
In whatever way you like.

197
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,560
No, not like that.

198
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,080
She wants a different way.

199
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,120
Give me a hug.

200
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,480
Aww, that's so cute.

201
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,280
Lita, Neuanaow chose you. What did she make for you?

202
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,480
A handkerchief, right?

203
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,120
Right?

204
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,760
It's cute. Can I see?

205
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,400
It's my favorite color.

206
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,720
Yeah, baby blue.

207
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,960
I have to tell you. In my 27 years,
I've never made anything like this.

208
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,200
Until now.

209
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,440
This is my first time ever, so I put my heart into it.

210
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,760
It's a rose.

211
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,160
A red rose represents the love
that I want to give to the person I...

212
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,920
want to give it to.

213
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,160
I feel...

214
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,720
Thank you.

215
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,600
A rose. And she said she burned her fingers,
probably from using a glue gun.

216
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,280
And the burn looks like a heart.

217
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,880
That's that.

218
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,280
So there's only one left. June.

219
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,280
Did anyone make something for June?
June, could you walk there for a sec?

220
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,720
Can you walk with me?

221
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,520
No, because I already have a partner.

222
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,240
Yeah?

223
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,400
Go ahead. Did anyone make something for June?

224
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,640
Should I close my eyes?

225
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,880
Yes, close them.

226
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,520
Close them for formality.

227
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,280
I want to see it.

228
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,560
It's adorable.

229
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,760
I wore it all day. It fits perfectly around my neck.

230
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:16,000
And I just found out she couldn't measure my neck,
so she measured her own.

231
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,920
And it somehow fit me perfectly. That's kinda cute.

232
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,920
I'm happy that today you girls
got a partner who you truly wanted.

233
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,600
Even though some might be disappointed,
in the end something good still came out of it.

234
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,040
So now, come get the script and rehearse
before doing the workshop with Teacher Prang.

235
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,000
We'll meet again at the audition.

236
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,600
Eh? Who just entered the house?

237
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,640
That's not Teacher Prang.

238
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,840
Wow, Pock Piyathida is our guest today?

239
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,440
Eh?

240
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,720
Hello.

241
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,560
Hello.

242
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,000
What brings you here?

243
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,320
I came to visit you girls, so I brought some snacks.

244
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
I see. I'll go get everyone.

245
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,520
Where are they?

246
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,040
Upstairs. We're rehearsing. I'll go get them now.

247
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,200
Okay.

248
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,320
Whoa!

249
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,160
Guys, Pock's here.

250
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,760
What? Really?

251
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,640
Really!

252
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,400
Hello.

253
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,040
Hello.

254
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,280
Let's help her.

255
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,640
I want the purple one.

256
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,160
I figured since you're all young, you'd want some sugar.

257
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,960
Thank you.

258
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,800
Hello.

259
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,800
If you have questions, ask me.

260
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,240
Feel free to ask me.

261
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,000
When it's a crying scene,

262
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,280
I get worried I won't be able to cry.

263
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,440
Oh, I see, I see.

264
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,560
Hand them down. Sit.

265
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,600
Thank you.

266
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,160
Actually, I think...

267
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,280
when it comes to crying scenes,

268
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,880
Here you go, we're ready.

269
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,920
Go ahead, girls. I already ate.

270
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,240
I just want to say, for crying scenes,

271
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,840
it's enough that you feel it.

272
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,880
Whether tears come or not

273
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,600
depends on the real emotion inside.

274
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:33,480
Don't force it. Crying doesn't mean
you've reached nirvana or peak acting.

275
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,600
What really matters is whether your feelings are genuine.

276
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,040
If you read the scene and truly feel sad, that's enough.

277
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,400
But if you don't feel it yet, don't cry.

278
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,520
Do it until the feeling becomes real.

279
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:56,880
Don't force yourself to cry,
because that kind of emotion will look fake.

280
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,600
Alright, anyone more issues?

281
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,160
For me, it's like...

282
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,440
when there's camera, I feel I'm not myself.

283
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:23,120
When I act too. Once the camera's pointing at me,
I feel I can't act as well as when I rehearse without it.

284
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,560
I'm still camera shy.

285
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,840
Hypnotize yourself.

286
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,440
That there's no camera.

287
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,920
And boost your confidence that
you're a good actor, that you can do it.

288
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:40,840
Use your ambition as the drive
to make sure you become a good actor,

289
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,280
so everything else will disappear.

290
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,720
You won't feel awkward anymore.
And follow the method I suggested.

291
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,520
If you already have the script,
there's no need to improvise.

292
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,200
Just keep rehearsing.
The more you rehearse, the more confident you'll be.

293
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,080
Do you have any memorization techniques?

294
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,120
Read the whole story first.
Don't think about who says what yet.

295
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,800
Once you've read it all, no matter which character you play,

296
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,920
memorize everyone's dialogue first
and understand what that scene tries to say.

297
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,320
She gave answers like someone
who is fully in tune with themselves.

298
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,640
She doesn't rely on external tools or techniques.

299
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,640
It's all internal.

300
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,760
Okay, that means we need to find our own
technique to memorize lines and stuff like that.

301
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,640
Hello, girls.

302
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,000
-Hello.
-Hello.

303
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,880
Now, I'm gonna talk about last week first.

304
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,880
I'll be honest with you all. I was surprised
at how much each of you improved and got better.

305
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,200
At first I wondered if you
could cry in such a short time.

306
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,600
But in the end, I felt you could do it.

307
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,720
Keep going.

308
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,000
Don't take a step back.

309
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,080
If you got better at something, don't say,

310
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,360
"I'll take a step back today. I'll surprise you even more."

311
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,120
Today we're still focusing on the connection
between you and your partner.

312
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,640
We'll do it right here.

313
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,400
The improv challenge is
you'll be split into two teams.

314
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,800
You have to find your real girlfriend.

315
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,200
One person in the middle will have amnesia.

316
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,400
She doesn't remember her girlfriend.

317
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,360
While the other three will claim,
"I'm your real girlfriend."

318
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,280
Okay? Only one is the real girlfriend.

319
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,520
The first group:
Neuanaow, Lita, June, Hling.

320
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,680
Stand in the middle. The rest sit over here.

321
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,080
The one in the middle is Lita.

322
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,480
Lita, go stand there.

323
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,360
Got it?

324
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
-Okay?
-Yes.

325
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,920
-I have no idea who they are.
-Yes.

326
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,520
Let's start with...

327
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,160
Lita, trust me.

328
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,440
Come with me.

329
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,360
Trust me, Lita.

330
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,440
Let's leave.

331
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,640
Don't go with anyone else.

332
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,240
I miss you. I'll do everything to get you to remember.

333
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,800
I don't know what else to say. I've tried everything.

334
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,240
I'll take you everywhere, eat everything,

335
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,440
Every dish. Every message.

336
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,120
To make you remember me again.

337
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,320
That how much we loved each other.

338
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,120
I won't let you down.

339
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,800
I want you to come back. I think if you do, I'll do better.

340
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,000
And I want everything
to return to how it was.

341
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,440
I actually believe that you...

342
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,880
have always been waiting. And if you come back,

343
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,520
-You'll do better.
-it'll be right.

344
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,880
Everything you want.

345
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,400
Trust me. I'm the one you feel...

346
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,000
Let's go home.

347
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,760
Let's go home and eat.

348
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,280
Lita, come with me.

349
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,480
The car's waiting.

350
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,600
Let Lita choose.

351
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,520
Who do you think it is?

352
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,160
I don't remember any of you.

353
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,800
Okay, time's up.

354
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,120
Think first, don't leave yet.

355
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,000
Line up again.

356
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,040
Lita, choose.

357
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,120
The real girlfriend is here.

358
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,840
Neuanaow did a good job
sending her feelings and making eye contact.

359
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,440
It made me feel that the real girlfriend
was definitely Neuanaow.

360
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,640
I mean her energy is like that.
Who would try to steal her partner, right?

361
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,800
Can you guess who they are in your life?

362
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,160
June is her ex.

363
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,880
This one's a college friend who had a crush on her.

364
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,040
Yes.

365
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,040
Yes.

366
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,160
A college friend who what?

367
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,520
Had a crush on her.

368
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,680
And who's she?

369
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,400
Her ex.

370
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,080
Pai has amnesia.

371
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,200
Who first?

372
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,040
My specialty.

373
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,120
Just go blank. You don't need to think.
Just come receive it here.

374
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,520
Go ahead.

375
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,920
Pailiu, do you want anything?

376
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,200
I'll buy you anything.

377
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,520
And if you want to eat something, I'll take you.

378
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,760
Do you remember anything?

379
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,040
I don't know.

380
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,320
Thank you.

381
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,160
For what?

382
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,680
Thank you for still listening to me.

383
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,560
I'll do anything.

384
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,920
If it means we can be together again.

385
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,680
I'll do anything.

386
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,560
I'll do anything, Pailiu.

387
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,680
Let's go home.

388
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,240
Which home?

389
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,160
Our home.

390
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,520
Every time you had problems,

391
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,880
you came to me.

392
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,520
And I was always there with you.

393
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,960
When I had problems.

394
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,120
Every time.

395
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,960
With and without problems.

396
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,240
But...

397
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,120
Both when you had problems and when you were happy.

398
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,960
But mostly...

399
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,720
we talked about anything.

400
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,120
No subject is off-limits.

401
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,480
Let's go home.

402
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,120
Wanna get a dessert?

403
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,000
I've reserved the place.

404
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,280
The one you liked.

405
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,440
Where we used to go.

406
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,680
Chocolate. You love it.

407
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,840
I remember seeing you always...

408
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,560
keep this brand on you.
This shop is amazing. Wanna go together?

409
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,800
Pailiu, I'm sorry. Okay, you might not remember yet, but...

410
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,200
I want you to know I'm sorry that I might have not been...

411
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,080
a very good girlfriend.

412
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:22,560
I'm sorry for never taking care
of you properly like other couples do.

413
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,120
But this time...

414
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,720
this time I'll do my best.

415
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,040
Come back to me.

416
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,920
I know your favorite food.

417
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,160
And I can take you anywhere.

418
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,200
Even if you don't want to come with me.

419
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,200
But I believe that one day, you'll remember me.

420
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,240
You don't need to go anywhere.

421
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,200
Just come downstairs with me.

422
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,120
I have something I want to discuss.

423
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,080
I'm sorry for not being nice in the past and upsetting you,

424
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,080
but I want another chance to get it right.

425
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,920
Come eat desserts with me.
I prepared everything you like.

426
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,400
Cut.

427
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,600
Hey, stop crying.

428
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,280
I feel bad for you.

429
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,560
Hold it, hold it.

430
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,840
Hold it, hold it.

431
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,960
She's my friend.

432
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,400
This one's my ex, right?

433
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,440
Yes.

434
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,360
Revealed already?

435
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,160
Not yet.

436
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,680
I don't know who they are either.

437
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,800
Wait, no, no, I'm right, aren't I?

438
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,440
I'm right, right? She's my friend.

439
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,680
And this one's my ex.

440
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,920
-Yes.
-This one probably caused my accident.

441
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,640
Right?

442
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,040
-Yes.
-Right?

443
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,200
-Really?
-Yes.

444
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,280
Yes, because what I added was... I wrote that

445
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,640
the accident happened because of you.

446
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,800
She chose correctly.

447
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,200
My acting was clear. I talked about the past.

448
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,360
Yeah.

449
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,840
I want you to enjoy the audition

450
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,160
and make the audience enjoy it with you.

451
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,880
Split up to rehearse and meet again for the audition.

452
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,280
Thank you.

453
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,440
Today's script is difficult
because the characters are very deep.

454
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,680
One has to play someone with amnesia,

455
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,320
and the other is trying to take care of her loved one
so she can remember her again.

456
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,280
It's a very intense drama.

457
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,160
She's a bit unsure here.

458
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,200
And there's a short break after Fon starts to forget, right?

459
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,240
I was wondering how I should play Fon in a way that...

460
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,720
I call her Fon because she introduced herself
as Fon, Fai's girlfriend.

461
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,960
Or do I call her Fon and something flashed when I saw her face?

462
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,600
If it were me, I would try
many interpretations and act them out,

463
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,840
because the dialogue is open.

464
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,640
Yes.

465
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:15,400
So try different ways and see which one
feels right for your interpretation.

466
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,080
Fai.

467
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,760
Fai.

468
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,280
Take it slow, be careful.

469
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,040
Who is this, Mom?

470
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,320
She's a sweet kid. She's innocent. She's someone who's...

471
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:47,840
What's the word? She has this bright charm
that makes the world look pink.

472
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,920
Eh? What's going on? Why do I smell love?

473
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,560
You two are smiling so big.

474
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,440
But time's short. If you want to see the full moment,

475
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,920
check out the deleted scenes on
Kantana Motion Pictures' YouTube channel.

476
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,480
Thank you for always taking care of me.

477
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,320
No need to be shy, don't cover your face.

478
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,560
They're covering their faces.

479
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,120
We were to be stealthy.

480
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,400
I'm Fon, your girlfriend.

481
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,080
Girlfriend?

482
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,200
Sorry, I...

483
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:56,280
She's acting like she knows she'll...
And she thinks too far ahead that she'll...

484
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,800
know she won't remember her.

485
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,840
You have to forget.

486
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,240
You have to really forget.
You're not pretending to forget about her.

487
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,040
Because you're really don't remember.

488
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:16,800
If I play as if I really don't remember her,
the other person will feel it more and cry more.

489
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,960
Fai.

490
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,080
It's okay. I understand.

491
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,560
I wish I could remember.

492
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,840
Don't use that face.

493
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,200
"I wish I could remember."

494
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,640
I just can't.

495
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,840
It's okay. I understand.

496
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,760
Fai.

497
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,800
Mom.

498
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,320
Wait.

499
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,040
After that...

500
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,040
I'll help you get up.

501
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,160
I'll help you get up.

502
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,360
"Take it easy, Fai."

503
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,520
-Then you look.
-Okay.

504
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,960
-Come on.
-No.

505
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,840
-Come on.
-I'll act sleepy first.

506
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,360
Fai.

507
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,560
I'm Fon.

508
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Your girlfriend.

509
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,400
How's it going?

510
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,040
Holding steady.

511
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,600
I was wondering if Fai really doesn't remember.

512
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,200
I have to play her like...

513
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,280
She doesn't remember just Fon parts.

514
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,800
Just her girlfriend.

515
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,720
How much time you take is totally up to you.

516
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,640
Don't think that...

517
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,080
it has to be the same every time.

518
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Let it happen naturally each time.

519
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,080
It might not always be exactly the same,

520
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:47,600
but try to find the moment that best expresses your message.

521
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,840
Jun doesn't really show emotions much.

522
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,480
Somehow, I feel she's
not fully open with me yet.

523
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,280
And picking this role might be something that...

524
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,040
if she can challenge herself, she will be to play it.

525
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,520
Honestly, I was super stressed.
I'm the only one who hasn't won yet.

526
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:15,520
I'm very paranoid, wondering if I can overcome myself

527
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,560
and win over the judges so they pick me.

528
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,560
If this scene... So do you want to be Fai or Fon?

529
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,280
Both are hard, I don't wanna pick.

530
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,240
You pick.

531
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,360
I feel that Fai would be...

532
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,400
easier than Fon.

533
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
It seems Fon...

534
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,000
hides her feelings.

535
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,880
But with Fai, just act with a wall.

536
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,800
Yeah.

537
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,240
Okay, now let's try.

538
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,960
Do it seriously.

539
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,560
Lie on the floor.

540
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
I'll lie here.

541
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,080
You can improvise. Just know that
in the scene you don't remember anything.

542
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,880
No, Fai doesn't remember Fon.

543
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,000
Go ahead.

544
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,360
Wow, lying down for real.

545
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,560
Wow, sick for real.

546
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,440
You're being sick for real.

547
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,040
Come on.

548
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,320
Take it easy, Fai.

549
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,880
Try to rest, okay?

550
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,960
I'll come again tomorrow.

551
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,760
How did it feel afterward?

552
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,360
It felt a bit too fast.

553
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,160
Mm-hm.

554
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,160
Yeah, between the lines.

555
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,960
Mm.

556
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,000
You want to take more time.

557
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,800
Yes.

558
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,600
Okay.

559
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:43,680
Before the audition, I wanted Pock and Teacher Prang
to really see if we really connected.

560
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,720
I have to get the miniseries and a date with Lita.

561
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,800
No one's playing today because they all
want to act in the miniseries and go on a date,

562
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,920
so we have to root for them and see which pair does best.

563
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,800
Okay, thank you.

564
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,960
Thank you.

565
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,120
Thank you.

566
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,840
Before the audition,
the girls need to be at their most beautiful.

567
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,600
It looks uneven.

568
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,880
I'll blend it for you.

569
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,040
Hm, perfect. Ready? Let's go.

570
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,280
The script for today's audition,
"For You," is about a couple

571
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,760
where one got in an accident
and loses all memory of her girlfriend.

572
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
The other must do everything possible
to make their girlfriend remember her.

573
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,120
Pock, pick the first pair you want to watch.

574
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,040
I want to see the pair of...

575
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,120
Nice and Pailiu.

576
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,360
You probably drew her attention.

577
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,600
Just now Nice made eye contact with me.

578
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,000
Come on, Nice and Pailiu.

579
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,720
Start whenever you're ready.

580
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,560
Fai.

581
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,760
I'm sorry...

582
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,040
for making you...

583
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,840
It's okay.

584
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,720
What are you sorry for?

585
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,200
For not remembering you yet, right?

586
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,120
I'll try to remember.

587
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,520
We'll remember each other.

588
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,320
Thank you.

589
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,280
We're happy...

590
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,040
as we are now, right?

591
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,640
I know.

592
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,000
Even though I still don't remember,

593
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,640
I definitely will one day.

594
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,600
Wanna do the puzzle?

595
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,520
Looks like there are ten pieces left.

596
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,440
But...

597
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,640
I've been doing this for a while, but...

598
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,640
I don't know.

599
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,080
You're good at this.

600
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,400
What?

601
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,760
Hey.

602
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,880
Well, put it in there.

603
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,360
And where does this one go?

604
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,200
It goes here.

605
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,720
It doesn't.

606
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,840
Looks like one piece is missing.

607
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,480
Even with the missing part,

608
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,520
it's still beautiful.

609
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,000
Thank you so much, Fon.

610
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,520
For always taking care of me.

611
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,240
Thank you very much.

612
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,160
Okay, cut.

613
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,160
Great job.

614
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,080
Great job. Pock, how are the trainees in your agency?

615
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,200
I don't dare claim that.

616
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
It was good. It was cute.

617
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,000
But at the end, I was like, "Eh?"

618
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,560
Does she remember?

619
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,160
She started to.

620
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,120
I wanted to play like that.

621
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:43,640
I think you two flow well together. You go well as a pair.

622
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,760
It was good.

623
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,800
You were very clever for giving it life.

624
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,600
I feel you solved the challenge well.

625
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,320
Great job.

626
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,120
Thank you.

627
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,800
I didn't do as well as I could have.

628
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,760
Nice did really well. I'd rather praise her.
Yes, she was really good.

629
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,920
Honestly, overall nothing about this audition bothers me,
but Pailiu was stressed because she couldn't cry.

630
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,760
Which I don't think mattered at all for this script.

631
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:18,120
Since you didn't feel that sad,
you didn't need to force ourselves to cry.

632
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,760
It's fine as it is.

633
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,520
Next pair, which one?

634
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,520
I want to see June and Hling.

635
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,600
Fai.

636
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,480
I'm sorry...

637
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,120
for making me end up here.

638
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,920
It's okay.

639
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,960
I understand.

640
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,040
I wish I could remember you.

641
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,840
But it's fine like this.

642
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,000
Wanna do the puzzle with me?

643
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,160
This one.

644
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,920
Looks like one piece is missing.

645
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,600
Have you seen it?

646
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,680
I saw it on the table earlier.

647
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,480
It's okay.

648
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,040
Even with the missing part,

649
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,520
it's still beautiful.

650
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,960
Thank you for taking care of me and staying by my side.

651
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,360
Okay, cut.

652
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,600
I like you, Hling.

653
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,040
Your acting is...

654
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,680
I feel there are flavors.

655
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:53,120
As for June, maybe in terms of expression,

656
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,360
in terms of emotional expression, maybe...

657
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,680
you need a little work.

658
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,720
Because right now it feels a little floaty.

659
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,160
I feel you can do it, June.

660
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,840
Maybe you need to interpret it line by line.

661
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,440
Yes, I think it's about
interpreting the character in the script.

662
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,600
It's not bad. It's just...

663
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,080
You have to understand it a bit more.

664
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,680
Okay, great job, girls.

665
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,040
She delivered it well, but it's me who has to keep improving.

666
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,640
June's...

667
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,280
becoming more aware. But she's finding ways to fix it.

668
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,560
I'm rooting for her because I want her to get a date.

669
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,920
Third pair, boss?

670
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,960
Wow, I'm the boss now. I'm so happy.

671
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,520
I choose Lita and Neua.

672
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,000
Fai.

673
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,760
Fon, I'm sorry...

674
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,440
for...

675
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,360
It's okay.

676
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,520
I understand.

677
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,960
Actually...

678
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,280
I wish I could remember.

679
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,080
But...

680
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,320
we're happy as we are now.

681
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,600
I'm sorry.

682
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,960
Don't do that.

683
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,000
Let's do the puzzle.

684
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,160
I'm almost done.

685
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,640
I can't find this piece.

686
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,800
Oh, one is missing.

687
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,560
It's okay.

688
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,120
Even with the missing part, it's still beautiful.

689
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,600
Thank you.

690
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,560
For taking care of me and always being by my side.

691
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,280
Okay, cut.

692
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,400
Good, this pair is good. I like that you both...

693
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,480
looked into each other's eyes
and listened to each other for real.

694
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,680
And you go well together.

695
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:24,400
It's like I got to see a couple who tried to
communicate to us what this scene was about.

696
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,800
You communicated well.

697
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,400
I feel the characters are more alive.

698
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,560
Right?

699
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,160
That's the phrase. "More alive."

700
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:39,840
Besides the acting, I think
it's the trust and closeness between you two.

701
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,240
And those things enhance your performance in this round.

702
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,640
Great job.

703
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,800
Thank you.

704
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,440
Both roles are hard. At first I said to Lita that

705
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,400
my role was probably easier, but it was very emotional.

706
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,440
I was very focused and I listened to her.

707
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,920
I was invested in my character.

708
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,520
In the end, as you guys saw,

709
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,600
I felt I performed well today.

710
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,720
The last pair, boss.

711
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,120
The last pair.

712
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,680
Ah, no need to call. Come out, girls.

713
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,560
Wafer and Dear.

714
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,120
Fai.

715
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,600
I'm sorry.

716
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,160
It's okay.

717
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,800
I understand.

718
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,560
I'll try to remember.

719
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,880
Let's do the puzzle.

720
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,760
It's almost done.

721
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,600
Here.

722
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,720
Eh?

723
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,600
One piece is missing.

724
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,120
Help me find it.

725
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,560
It's really gone.

726
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,520
But even with the missing part,

727
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,280
the whole picture is still beautiful,
even if it's not complete.

728
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,720
Thank you for always taking care of me.

729
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,680
Why are you crying?

730
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,920
We're happy as we are now.

731
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,200
It's fine as it is.

732
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,400
Come on.

733
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,240
What should we do next?

734
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,680
This puzzle...

735
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,640
-doesn't need to be complete.
-Okay, cut.

736
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,640
I think it was good, but the speed was a bit fast.

737
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,600
You pressed the accelerator again.

738
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,280
It felt a bit too fast for the situation.

739
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:10,320
But if you fix the timing, I think it will be great.

740
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,280
Mm.

741
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,200
-They pressed the emotion pedal too early.
-Yes.

742
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,680
But when it needed to be pressed
and emphasized, it was forgotten.

743
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,600
Yes.

744
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,120
It was harder for Dear because Wafer...

745
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,120
She had to figure out how to soar alongside Wafer.

746
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,720
Just a little bit. But as I said, if you both

747
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,880
adjust the speed to match one another,
matching your pacing, it will be good.

748
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,800
Honestly, I forgot my lines.

749
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:47,960
But everyone said they didn't notice
until the end when I added my missing lines.

750
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,640
I've paired with Dear a lot, but...

751
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,760
this time around, it felt we weren't fully connected.

752
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,920
Thank you very much, everyone.

753
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:05,320
I think both Pock and I, along with Teacher Prang,
saw the acting skills every one of you showed us.

754
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,480
Especially Prang who's seen you every week.

755
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,680
We've seen the improvement in acting and relationships

756
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,440
of the pairs as well.

757
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,320
Part of it is trusting your acting partner

758
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,040
and going together.
It helps you sync your performance better.

759
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:28,920
So today we saw both aspects,
that they improved every pair's acting a lot,

760
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,480
But only one pair...

761
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,240
will get the roles in the miniseries.

762
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,800
Let me, Pock and Teacher Prang discuss it a bit
before we announce the result.

763
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,760
How do you feel, Teacher Prang, Boss? The boss at the agency.

764
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,600
I think it's quite clear.

765
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,720
The chemistry of one pair
really stood out during the audition.

766
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,920
It made me feel like I could ship them.

767
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,480
Like, "They're cute. I want to see more moments with...

768
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,480
more skinship." Something like that.

769
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,440
Is it the same pair on your mind?

770
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,840
I think so.

771
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,440
Right? They really stood out.

772
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,760
Any other pair?

773
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,040
Hling's acting was very detailed too. She was great.

774
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,040
I think Hling...

775
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,520
helped...

776
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,680
make June perform better.

777
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,520
Actually my favorite moment from June wasn't the dialogue,
but her improvisation with the puzzle.

778
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,760
-It made her more relaxed.
-Yes.

779
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,760
Relaxed and bright, like they were really talking.

780
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,960
But I think we've agreed on which pair is promising.

781
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,640
Yes. They really stood out.

782
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,880
So let's call the girls and announce the result.

783
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,880
Sure.

784
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,920
Pock, Teacher Prang and I have discussed
and decided who to choose.

785
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,320
I'll let you do it. Announce the result.

786
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,600
I can do it now?

787
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,400
Yes, you can.

788
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:10,080
And the winning pair today is...

789
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,240
Commercial break.

790
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:26,680
Today, the pair that caught our attention the most
and we felt had the best chemistry is...

791
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,480
Lita and Neuanaow.

792
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,680
Finally.

793
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,040
It's my turn at last.

794
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,200
Really? Really? You're been waiting?

795
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,040
I've paired with Lita for many weeks,

796
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,480
trying to get the miniseries and a date,
but my luck never came.

797
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,720
But it finally happened.
Thank you, Pock and Teacher Prang.

798
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,920
I have to say it's not luck.

799
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,880
It's something you achieved through your own effort.

800
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,720
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

801
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,800
Beyond acting, I feel that looking at each other,

802
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:09,320
noticing and caring about your acting partner
is crucial to you going well together.

803
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,640
It's like...

804
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:18,120
And good chemistry comes from
feeling in sync, understanding each other, getting along.

805
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,440
That's good chemistry.

806
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,720
And you two showed me today what good chemistry looked like.

807
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,600
But today the best thing we can create is
the chemistry that comes from the heart.

808
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,560
Congratulations to Lita and Neuanaow
for getting the roles on the miniseries.

809
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,600
And have the most fun on your date.

810
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,600
Thank you.

811
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,640
I'm so happy I got to film the miniseries this time.

812
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:55,040
I've been trying all along to get this chance,
to act with Lita, and today I finally got it.

813
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,560
I'm really happy because she wanted...

814
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,200
to go on a date several times.

815
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,720
I want that too. I want us to do activities together.

816
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,600
And now we finally got to be on the miniseries together.

817
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:16,920
Yes, I want to see what the big picture is like
when we act together.

818
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,320
I'm so excited about that.

819
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,240
After many weeks, Lita and Neuanaow finally succeed.

820
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,240
Let's check out the atmosphere on their set.

821
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,760
Action.

822
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,160
Slowly.

823
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,360
Fai.

824
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,120
Fai.

825
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,240
What?

826
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,320
I'll put these here.

827
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,000
And I'll put these here.

828
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,240
Like this.

829
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,760
And you put this one...

830
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,240
-Where?
-Here.

831
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,600
Here?

832
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,520
Yes.

833
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,640
I don't believe you. No way.

834
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,280
It can't be.

835
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,640
No way.

836
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,280
No way I did that.

837
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,280
Look at the phone.

838
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,280
Look at Fai.

839
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,920
Guys, we've finished
shooting the morning scenes, which...

840
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,400
means it's time to eat.

841
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,560
-Our lunch.
-Yes.

842
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,840
Fish.

843
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,920
Oh, thank you.

844
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,320
Here.

845
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,080
Great.

846
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,360
Have some liver.

847
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,440
Which outfit of Lita's do I like the most?

848
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,400
The brown cardigan with a top under
and matching brown pants.

849
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,440
It made Lita look like a café girl.

850
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,000
I'd never seen that before.

851
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,560
The sweater when we were looking at the photos.

852
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,200
It was so cute. I'd never seen
you wear something like that.

853
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,560
In real life, I don't really wear something that.

854
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,240
I can dress like that if requested.
If she likes it, I'll deliver it.

855
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,200
Ooh.

856
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,080
Have you ever wiped down anyone before?

857
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,080
I think Neuanaow is the first person I wipe down.

858
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,480
She's gone.

859
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,240
If the lips start doing this, that means she's sleeping.

860
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,680
Asleep and dreaming.

861
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,880
Someone actually fell asleep.

862
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,760
Such an emotional scene.

863
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,360
Are you okay?

864
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,920
Very dramatic.

865
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,360
Oh, she came to support me on set all the time.

866
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,560
Like, "Oh, you're crying
again? You're crying again?"

867
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,040
She came to check on me.

868
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,960
"How are you feeling? Are you tired?"
She was really encouraging and cute.

869
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,160
Hang in there, just a little more.

870
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,080
One more scene?

871
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,160
The last scene.

872
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,960
I'll boost it for you.

873
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,640
-What?
-I'll boost it for you.

874
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,680
Ugh, I'm exhausted.

875
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:18,520
Our of the three girls I've been in the miniseries with,
if you ask me who I feel most comfortable with,

876
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,040
I have to say Neuanaow. Yes. That's how I honestly feel.

877
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,600
Yay!

878
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,640
Jeez, it's a drama set,
but why does everything feel so sweet?

879
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,320
And where are you taking Neua on a date today, Lita?
(Suan Lung Mong)

880
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,200
Watch your step.

881
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,320
Be careful.

882
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,080
Got a beautiful girl braiding my hair.

883
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,240
Fabulous.

884
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,080
The braid is pretty like the braider.

885
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,320
Ooh.

886
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,280
It's true.

887
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,080
Let's go.

888
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,520
I'm scared.

889
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,280
Not screaming doesn't mean not scared.

890
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,200
You just didn't breathe.

891
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,800
I want to be able to do that.

892
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,760
Let's try.

893
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,920
Whoo! Did you get that?

894
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,800
I did.

895
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,720
Oh, the camera's recording.

896
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:21,920
I can't lose.

897
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,840
Go, Neua.

898
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,200
Wow!

899
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,120
At least it hit the board.

900
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,200
At least it hit the circle.

901
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,680
How do I hold it, sis?

902
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:31,960
Like this.

903
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,000
Lift this.

904
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,320
Then aim with one eye closed.

905
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,880
-Ready?
-One, two, three.

906
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,640
You do it.

907
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,120
Might need a little practice.

908
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,080
For both of us.

909
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,200
So powerful.

910
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,880
Slowly, gently.

911
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,880
Mister!

912
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,080
I crashed it!

913
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,480
I wasn't used to it.

914
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,520
I couldn't turn in time and crashed.

915
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,600
I let Lita drive. No more.

916
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,280
Hey, when you drove, it looked smooth.

917
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,040
When I did, I crashed.

918
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,040
You crashed.

919
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,200
(Khun Koei)

920
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,160
This shop is so cute.

921
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,360
Neua, what do you want?

922
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,800
Guess what I want.

923
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,800
A Southern stir-fry, right?

924
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,880
Correct.

925
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,320
-One more.
-Southern stir-fry

926
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,240
I love it.

927
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,400
Guess.

928
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,720
Chili sauce.

929
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,520
Correct.

930
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,400
Really?

931
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,480
Really?

932
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,760
All types of chili sauce, except one with stink bugs.

933
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,080
-Oh, okay.
-I love it.

934
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,360
-I love it.
-Wait.

935
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,520
I'll memorize this.

936
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,520
Got it, okay.

937
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,760
Suppose in ten years I play zipline again, I'd be like,

938
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,600
"Oh, I remember my first time was with Lita."

939
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,680
At Suan...

940
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,400
Lung Mong.

941
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,080
Maybe not the location, but I'll remember who I did it with.

942
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,120
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

943
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,440
Of course.

944
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,120
It looks so good.

945
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,160
This is it.

946
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,720
I'll serve you rice.

947
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,240
Oh, it smells so good.

948
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:50,960
Thank you.

949
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,520
I'm so happy to be on this date today.

950
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,880
Finally we're on a date.

951
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,480
After fighting for several weeks.

952
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,000
Finally we're on a date.

953
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,120
You said you wanted this first.

954
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,480
Oh, thank you.

955
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,920
I'll serve you too.

956
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,400
Here.

957
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,680
Wow, looks so good.

958
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,520
So good.

959
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,480
Let's go.

960
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,560
I love it.

961
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,480
But I feel at ease.

962
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,920
-Delicious.
-Because...

963
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,200
-Because...
-I'm with you.

964
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,160
Southerners are mischievous.

965
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:24,640
And she just sat there smiling like,
"I'm so happy. I'm so happy."

966
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,080
It was cute.

967
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,480
Besides the beach,

968
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,720
I remember you said you like going to the beach.

969
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,560
But where else do you like?

970
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,360
I like the mountains, actually.

971
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,440
But I like the mountains when it's raining.

972
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,760
Like when I go out of town and
stay in a hotel room while it rains outside.

973
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,640
I look outside and see the rain and the mountains.

974
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,880
I love that atmosphere.

975
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,960
I've never stayed in a hotel on mountain trips.

976
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,520
-You sleep in a tent?
-Yeah.

977
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,960
I like camping. So I don't like when it rains.
Because things get wet.

978
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,600
Mostly I like mist.

979
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,120
Thank you.

980
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,600
Honestly, I want to watch our miniseries.

981
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,320
It was really hard for me.

982
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,560
I'm gonna sleep, hearing that.

983
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
She got so comfy.

984
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,200
She was sleeping.

985
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,760
At first I walked over.

986
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,640
"Neua." They didn't tell you to sleep yet.

987
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,520
"Neua."

988
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,040
Your mouth starts doing this. And you sleep like this.

989
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,640
If your mouth does that,

990
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,400
it means you're dreaming.

991
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,600
Means you're asleep.

992
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,400
I was dreaming.

993
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,840
-I was.
-You were like this.

994
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,520
You fell asleep so quickly.

995
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,360
But today we got to talk casually, like no tension.

996
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:42,240
I was asking her this and that,
so I learned a lot about Lita I hadn't known before.

997
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,520
Some things I already knew,
but things I didn't know, I learned today.

998
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,000
I was happy. Delicious food, beautiful view.

999
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,520
Sharing a meal with someone cute makes it even better.

1000
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:59,680
No need to get desserts today.
I'm sure this ship won't sink like Titanic.

1001
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,880
Hey, let's watch the miniseries.

1002
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,240
I bought some snacks.

1003
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,400
This one's so good.

1004
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,400
Hold on.

1005
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,080
Two for this side.

1006
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,120
That one is so good.

1007
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,040
We'll share it.

1008
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,360
You can eat it, or...

1009
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,560
This one is so good. For real.

1010
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,240
Can't wait to watch.

1011
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,960
-It smells good.
-It's good.

1012
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,120
Let me try.

1013
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:35,960
Fai.

1014
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,000
Fai.

1015
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,080
Fai.

1016
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:39,960
Fai.

1017
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,280
You're beautiful.

1018
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,640
Slowly, baby.

1019
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,120
Take it easy, Fai.

1020
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,520
Here, we went to Japan for our anniversary. Remember?

1021
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,520
You look like...

1022
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,640
You look like a stingray.

1023
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,600
It's cute.

1024
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,760
It's cute.

1025
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:00,880
I'm sad.

1026
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,280
Physically, Ms. Fai...

1027
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,880
Was I really sleeping?

1028
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:05,800
She was.

1029
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Great acting.

1030
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:08,640
Really?

1031
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,760
Preparing to plead.

1032
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:12,840
I'm scared.

1033
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,360
I'm not watching that.

1034
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,480
I'd rather watch this.

1035
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,800
I turned and saw...

1036
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,200
B1, B2.

1037
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,400
Your love stinks.

1038
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,480
Your love stinks too much.

1039
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:31,480
That was cute.

1040
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,520
My heart raced while I was watching it.

1041
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,560
The chemistry between them keeps coming.

1042
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,840
Like they surprise us every week.

1043
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,440
I feel they're a really captivating couple.

1044
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,480
I really like the miniseries with Lita and Neuanaow.

1045
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,680
Lita is so beautiful and Neuanaow is super cute.

1046
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,640
(For You)

1047
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,600
Physically, Ms. Fai is recovering very well.

1048
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,840
But in terms of memory,

1049
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,480
I still can't say for sure...

1050
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:09,640
You can watch episode six of the Love Moment miniseries

1051
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,640
titled "For You"

1052
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:16,200
only on Kantana Motion Pictures' YouTube channel and WeTV.

1053
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,120
However you feel about it, don't forget to tell our girls.

1054
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:20,920
Fai!

1055
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:22,920
She slept.

1056
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,480
She slept.

1057
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,760
She was like this.
If your mouth moves, you're asleep.

1058
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,840
How was it?

1059
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:29,480
Good.

1060
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,520
I love it.

1061
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,280
This one is the hardest for me.

1062
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,280
I can tell how hard it was.

1063
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,080
Yeah.

1064
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,640
Yes, so much crying. And there are many emotional scenes.

1065
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,760
But it turned out beautifully. It looks really good.

1066
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,640
Thank you.

1067
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:46,720
Worth it.

1068
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:47,560
Yeah.

1069
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,960
Because it was our first time.

1070
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,760
Let's talk about the kiss.

1071
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,240
I'd never kissed you.

1072
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,800
It was our first. And I was blindfolded,
anticipating when she'll come in.

1073
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,800
No time to prepare.

1074
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,200
When we kissed, I was like...

1075
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,720
stiff and embarrassed.

1076
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,760
Embarrassed.

1077
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,120
I'd never kissed Lita,

1078
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,160
-even after getting paired many times.
-Yes.

1079
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,560
-Yes.
-And we didn't know there'd be a kiss.

1080
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,960
Yeah, saw it when we got the full script.

1081
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,440
And you went back to sleep.

1082
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,880
She came to support me too.

1083
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,360
-Yes.
-"Are you okay, Lita?" Because I cried.

1084
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,080
No, I'm praising this much because I'm waiting for
the person next to me to praise Neuanaow.

1085
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,720
You don't praise her at all. I'm confused.

1086
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,400
No, I praised you all the time, right?

1087
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,640
But she really did.

1088
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,240
-What did she say?
-What did she say? Tell me.

1089
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,520
"You look beautiful today."

1090
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,200
They praised each other in secret.

1091
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,800
Without us there.

1092
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,800
She was blushing so she went back to eating.

1093
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,840
In the final episode when we leave the house,

1094
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,480
I won't leave with anyone else.

1095
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,280
I'll leave alone because I'll only leave with Lita.

1096
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,200
I don't know.

1097
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,880
My other choice...

1098
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,880
is Pailiu.

1099
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,480
It's decided. No regrets, right?

1100
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,440
But I'm sad.

1101
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,080
It's obvious with Dear.

1102
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,440
What if I hadn't said anything?

1103
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,080
Pailiu, it's up to you to decide who you want.

1104
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,640
Yeah, that's it. It's...
