1
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,640
It's been two weeks since the eight GL actresses
started living together in the Love Moment house.

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,760
We've started to see the chemistry
between each pair, both on and off camera.

3
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,600
We can already notice who's especially interested
in whom, and how close each pair has become.

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,840
This week, how interesting will their stories get?
Let's find out together.

5
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,680
I wonder how they're pairing us up today.

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,560
Who do you want?

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want you.

8
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,840
Oh, I want you too.

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,280
Let's lock it up.

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,240
How's our chemistry?

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,040
I mean our pair.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,320
I don't know what other people think,

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,120
but I just know I feel at ease.

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,520
I feel at ease too.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,840
I like being around someone I feel at ease with,
easy to talk to because we have deep talks a lot.

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,520
If today they suddenly switch things up...

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,200
Maybe they say...

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,840
- I'll protest.
- Find a new partner.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,040
No!

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,800
No!

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,760
Maybe drawing lots.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,120
- Done.
- Drawing lots is scary.

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,800
It's so random.

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,680
Don't know if they'll do it.

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,240
Don't know who's with who.

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,000
Hello.

27
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,960
Hello.

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,920
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,920
- Gossiping.
- Where's everyone?

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,320
They're probably...

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,760
Upstairs, I think.

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,320
- Upstairs?
- I'll go get them.

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,040
Okay, get everyone down here.

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,160
I'll wait right here.

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,400
- Got it.
- Okay.

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,040
- Okay.
- Just a sec.

37
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,160
Girls.

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,760
- Yeah?
- Come downstairs.

39
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,000
Jeab wants to see us.

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,760
- Really?
- Really?

41
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,560
Yeah.

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,120
Okay, let's go.

43
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,280
What were you doing?

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,280
Everyone, hurry up!

45
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,040
- Come on!
- What were you doing?

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,640
Come on, sit, sit, sit.

47
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,400
Go ahead, sit down.

48
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,160
Come on, come on, come on.

49
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,520
Did you just wake up?

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,200
Come on, come on.

51
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,520
Woke up pretty.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,440
I didn't wash my face last night.

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,160
Here she comes.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,920
Hello.

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,560
You're late.

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,840
There's a punishment.

57
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,640
- A punishment.
- There's a punishment.

58
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,080
You're eliminated.

59
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm just kidding.

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,880
Alright, after two weeks,
you all seem very comfortable being yourselves.

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,840
You're super close.

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,240
Right?

63
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,840
So today, I'm switching things up.
I'm gonna tell you the pairing rule.

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,440
That sounds scary.

65
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,200
Yeah.

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,120
Today's rule is simple.
It's whatever I and the crew want.

67
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,560
So I'll be choosing who gets paired with whom.

68
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,520
Why?

69
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,720
Now that everyone kind of knows who they'd pick,

70
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,920
why are you deciding for us now?
Why didn't you do that earlier?

71
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,840
I'm telling you,
today's episode is peak, peak, peak!

72
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,280
I'll start.

73
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,600
Right now?

74
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,360
Alright, the first pair is...

75
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,280
Pailiu

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,160
and Neuanaow.

77
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,080
Let's settle this.

78
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,920
There must be one episode
where I get to pair with her.

79
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,840
It's fine.

80
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
And the second pair is...

81
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,000
Lita...

82
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,360
and Nice.

83
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,360
Didn't see that coming at all.

84
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,840
Totally unexpected.

85
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Wait, am I really paired with Lita?
I feel like someone's jealous.

86
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,920
Which is Neuanaow.

87
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,280
I feel like she wants to be paired with Lita.

88
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,840
Since we've come this far, let's keep going.

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,080
Next up...

90
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,280
Ling and Dear.

91
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,840
Oh, that works.

92
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,080
- We did our makeup together this morning.
- Yes.

93
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,080
I didn't expect to be paired with Ling

94
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,400
because she's the one
I've talked to the least out of the eight of us.

95
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,880
So the last pair is you two: Wafer and June.

96
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,240
I heard you picked each other's outfits.

97
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,960
Yes, I picked her this outfit,
told her to wear it.

98
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,680
Maybe because...

99
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,440
Wafer picked my outfit.
I don't know if it's related.

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,280
But this morning I asked her,

101
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,440
"Wafer, what color should I wear
between brown or red?"

102
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,120
And she picked this one
because the back has "08" and she wears "88."

103
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,280
She said, "Pick this one so we match."

104
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,600
How do you feel about the pairing?

105
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,920
Did you ever wonder,
"Oh, would we make a good pair or not"?

106
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,440
Why are you shaking your head?

107
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,920
I never expected to be paired with Lita.

108
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,720
- Right?
- Yes.

109
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,640
This is exactly what I wanted to see.

110
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,480
You might not expect to become friends,
or date, or get paired with someone.

111
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,560
But you and this person might make a perfect pair.

112
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,400
Right? You might discover something new.
So for now I'm gonna let you guys

113
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,160
do whatever you want, maybe chat,
while waiting for the workshop with Teacher Prang.

114
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,840
You got it.

115
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

116
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,040
Make yourselves at home.

117
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,240
Let's spy on what the girls are talking about.

118
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,240
I'm someone who, in real life
outside of this show, is usually...

119
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,200
- Quiet?
- Likes the vibe to be...

120
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,680
- Good?
- No, I like to make jokes.

121
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,440
But other girls don't really joke,
so I don't dare to, afraid it'll flop.

122
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,360
- Because...
- The others seem mature, so I don't dare.

123
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,400
But we're actually the same age, you know?

124
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,520
Yeah, we are.

125
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,120
We're actually the same age,
but I keep calling you "P." Funny, right?

126
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,920
And I always thought you were younger.

127
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,960
See? I kept doing that, then I realized...

128
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,920
- "We're the same age." I forgot.
- Right?

129
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,440
From day one, this filter in my head said
you were definitely older, then I realized...

130
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,360
"Wait, we're the same age."

131
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,400
I'm '03.

132
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,440
I'm '02.

133
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
- Oh?
- See?

134
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,360
Oh, really?

135
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
I'm older.

136
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,760
Do I look like an '03 baby?

137
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,320
But it stuck. She calls me "Nong" too.

138
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,600
I guess my vibe is still quite young,
while she's worked before, so she feels older.

139
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,320
The chubby kid vibe.

140
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,440
Totally.

141
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,480
So how do you see your future?

142
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,120
Let's say ten years from now.

143
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Ten years from now?

144
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,040
- Or five.
- Too long.

145
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,560
Five years? In five years, I'd be around 31.

146
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,520
Probably running my own business.

147
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,440
Yeah, probably some kind of business.

148
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,880
But by that time
I don't know if I'll be in the industry or not.

149
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,840
I actually love talking about the future.

150
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,720
Really?

151
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,360
Because when I ask someone these things,
it shows me their mindset...

152
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
as well.

153
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,240
And what kind of partner do you want?

154
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,400
The first thing I think everyone
would agree on is compatibility.

155
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,360
Someone you feel comfortable with.
When they're around, you feel...

156
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,560
Like a best friend. No need to force yourself.

157
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,760
And she's very open. She says what's on her mind,

158
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,160
and doesn't care at all
whether or not I judge her.

159
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,720
She's not afraid to be herself and says,

160
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,360
"This is who I am,
these are my flaws, this and that."

161
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,840
So I feel this girl is really genuine,
you know? Yes.

162
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,520
It reminds me of...

163
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,560
this auntie at Bang Lamphu.

164
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,640
- Oh.
- Aunt Tim.

165
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,400
Aunt Tim.

166
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,360
Aunt Tim, I want this one for 90 baht.

167
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,440
She's like, "Got it."

168
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,880
- "Got it. I'll give you extra."
- Wow, these two are discussing food.

169
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,280
Like, "I'll give you extra."

170
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,120
Right?

171
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,800
But it might be her gimmick.

172
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,760
What's that sound?

173
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,680
Maybe.

174
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,720
Ah, these two mischievous girls
are skateboarding in the house.

175
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,000
I need practice.

176
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,680
Look, look, I wanna eat this.

177
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,920
Not this one. This one.

178
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,120
- Ooh.
- It's crunchy.

179
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,600
I want it. Let's go.

180
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,520
I want some.

181
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,800
Let's take the No. 2 bus.

182
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,000
She can't tell us yet.

183
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,920
But will you be tired if you drive there?

184
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,160
Don't, you'll fall.

185
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,160
I'll stop.

186
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,960
We'll play after some practice.

187
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,800
We haven't really talked much, honestly.

188
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,800
True.

189
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,440
How do you feel being paired together?

190
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,800
I was like, "Whoa!"

191
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,920
Yeah?

192
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,880
I was like, "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa."

193
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,120
You can do it.

194
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
- Let's go.
- But it was so funny.

195
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,200
We looked at each other like, "I can't."

196
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,920
But it's worth trying. I want to try.

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,280
Me too. It's fun.

198
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,040
It's like meeting...

199
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,560
Because in the future
when we work, in the end we'll...

200
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,800
act with all types of people.

201
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
It's a way to train us too,
so we'll have some idea

202
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,120
what's it like to act with
someone very experienced,

203
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,680
someone who's been acting for 20 years.

204
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,040
Our character's father.

205
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,080
If we mess up our lines a lot...

206
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,600
- They probably...
- Yeah, so we'll...

207
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,000
get a lot of experience,
trying with different people, stuff like that.

208
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,680
- Are you sensitive?
- Yes.

209
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,000
Do you cry watching animal clips?

210
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,600
I cry watching animal clips too,
like on TikTok and stuff.

211
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,400
I'm like, "Why?"

212
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,000
I watched this clip where
a dog they'd raised since birth died.

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,760
Yeah, and you...

214
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,320
I cried so hard.

215
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,640
I feel that she's very innocent, very pure.

216
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,040
She's someone who
pays attention to everyone's details.

217
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,120
Lita shared her past experiences,

218
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,200
and I thought,
wow, this woman's gone through a lot.

219
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,320
What Lita said is partly true.

220
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,600
The crew paired them this way in this episode
in order to give the girls new experiences

221
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,360
and interact with people
they haven't talked to much,

222
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,480
so they can share perspectives
and develop their mindset.

223
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,400
How's it going, girls?

224
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,040
Newly paired, right?

225
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,240
- Yes.
- Yes.

226
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,200
Now, next step.

227
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,600
As I told you,
to build emotions, you need the five senses:

228
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,160
sight, taste, smell, sound, touch.
Plus the inner monologue.

229
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,720
Today, we'll focus on one important sense: touch.

230
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,400
Okay?

231
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,280
One person will act as a receiver
and stand still with eyes closed.

232
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,840
As for the sender, come to me.
I'll give you a prompt.

233
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,480
Your task is to touch your partner
by hugging or whatever you want

234
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,600
while making them feel what the prompt describes.

235
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,880
Let's move over here, girls.

236
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,440
I want the pair with...

237
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Lita.

238
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,360
Nice, you'll be the receiver.

239
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Lita, come to me.

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,520
You two can make eye contact until I say cut.
Then you can guess, Nice.

241
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,720
Okay? Ready, Lita?

242
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,800
Go.

243
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,120
Three, two, one.

244
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,400
Nice, open your eyes.

245
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,520
Okay, cut.

246
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,080
Nice, what do you think?

247
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,760
It feels like, "Good job."

248
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,800
Like a soft, positive energy.

249
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,720
"Soft, positive energy."

250
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,800
Lita, reveal.

251
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,920
"I'm always rooting for you."

252
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,760
Yeah.

253
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,720
It wasn't verbal but it came from the inside,

254
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,600
so I could receive it,

255
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,000
and we ended up smiling at each other.

256
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,680
Ling and Dear.

257
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,160
You're sitting in that order.

258
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,560
Ling, come to me.

259
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,760
The sender must stay very calm,
otherwise the vibe will be interrupted.

260
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,800
Three, two. Open your eyes.

261
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,520
Okay.

262
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,160
Cut.

263
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,160
Hold on, hold on.
Looks like Dear knows. Looks like Dear knows.

264
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,080
It feels like...

265
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,560
"Hey, keep going. I can do it."

266
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,200
Like, believe in yourself more
because even she believes in me.

267
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,920
Reveal.

268
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,520
"Believe in yourself. I'm right here."

269
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,440
"I'm always right here."

270
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,960
I'm happy you received it.

271
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,160
Yeah.

272
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,160
I really felt she was here with me,
especially when she hugged me. It was like...

273
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
"Yeah, the person understands me."

274
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,080
Just holding her hands and looking into her eyes,

275
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,480
I teared up without realizing.
When I looked into her eyes, I saw sadness.

276
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,920
There was something inside
that wanted to burst out and keep coming out.

277
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,480
I tried not to cry
while I was looking into her eyes.

278
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
I'm gonna cry too.

279
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,280
Two sensitive people.
More than two, actually. Very sensitive.

280
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,200
Ling cried too. I was like, "Whoa." Like...

281
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
I wanted to get in there and like...

282
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,920
Deep down I wanted to wipe away her tears.

283
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,960
Neua and Pai.

284
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,360
Three, two. Open your eyes.

285
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,880
Okay.

286
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,040
Cut.

287
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,840
I feel like she said, "Good job."

288
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,640
And she seemed proud.

289
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,560
Yeah, but...

290
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,200
Yes.

291
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,960
Oh?

292
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,040
No, I'm just trying to get a feel.

293
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Tell her.

294
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,440
- "Good job for overcoming everything."
- For real?

295
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,280
"You're the best."

296
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,880
- Oh.
- Something like that.

297
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,960
What is it again?

298
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,560
You got everything right. "I'm proud of..."

299
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,200
"I'm very proud of you."

300
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,120
And "Good job for overcoming everything."

301
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,800
- Good job.
- Good job for receiving that.

302
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,640
No, you did great sending me that. You did great.

303
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Five, four, three, two.

304
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,000
Keep going, June.

305
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,560
Open your eyes.

306
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,720
Cut.

307
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,440
It feels like cute aggression.

308
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Like, "Smile, don't make a serious face."

309
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,920
Reveal.

310
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,440
It's cute aggression. Like "You're so cute."
Encouraging her that she's beautiful.

311
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,440
Many emotions, June.

312
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,080
- She sent many things.
- Many things.

313
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,840
It's like this. So I felt she couldn't be
pinching my cheeks and saying, "Keep going."

314
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,880
It was more like cute aggression
and wanting to tease.

315
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,160
It's unbelievable that
after a short conversation between each pair,

316
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,360
during the workshop using only touch and no words,

317
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,200
everyone guessed correctly. It's truly amazing.

318
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,800
I'm gonna cry too.

319
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,600
How was it today, Prang?
How did the girls do with the new partners?

320
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,000
Someone cried, Jeab.

321
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,640
Huh? Really? Why?

322
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,760
They just opened up to each other.
There was no drama.

323
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,640
I see. You scared me.
I thought something bad happened.

324
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,600
That's good. It helps build trust
and closeness among you guys.

325
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,440
But now I'm sure you all want to know
what today's audition scene is all about.

326
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,200
"The Reason Stars Orbit."

327
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,600
But before you get the script to rehearse,

328
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,720
I have role models who are the OGs in Thai GL.

329
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,920
They're pro and legends
from the earlier days of Thai GL.

330
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,200
And they will perform for us

331
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,320
Please welcome Aom Sushar and Tina.

332
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

333
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,800
Wow, today's guests are Thailand's legendary OTP.

334
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,040
- As everyone knows,
- The girls must be so excited.

335
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,280
Aom Sushar and Tina

336
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:30,000
are the first generation of GL actresses
who became famous internationally.

337
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,160
Today they'll audition for us
to show how professionals perform.

338
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,040
Are you both ready?

339
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,400
Felt old for a second, Jeab.

340
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,080
Aom, are you ready? You too, Tina.

341
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,480
- Yes.
- Yes, Jeab.

342
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,080
We're gonna watch they perform.
Use it as your inspiration.

343
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,160
Wow.

344
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,720
She's the mother.

345
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,720
The mother was right in front of us.
And she hasn't aged at all.

346
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,040
I watched it when I was a kid.
And I feel that movie was such a big hit.

347
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:06,440
Never thought I'd meet them in person.
And I feel that Aom is really, really cute.

348
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,600
When I made this,

349
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,080
I wanted the person wearing it
to feel comfortable and be themselves.

350
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,000
And happy to wear it.

351
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,560
But back then
I didn't think I'd let anyone wear it

352
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,200
So why do I get to wear it?

353
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,720
Ay!

354
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,080
Perfect!

355
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,080
It was like...

356
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,680
I wanted to bite off my own fingers.
In my head, I was like, "That's it!"

357
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,240
Cut!

358
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,600
Cut! Cut!

359
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,960
Give a round of applause for Tina and Aom!

360
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,080
See? That's chemistry.
It's chemistry between these two. See?

361
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,560
They're...

362
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,960
It's actually being a duo,
being buddies who click really well.

363
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,360
Is there an experience you want to share?

364
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,000
Wow, it was a long time ago.

365
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,880
First, I have to ask
if you guys were born in time to see...

366
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,320
- Yes.
- Yes.

367
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,440
- "Yes or No?"
- Ah.

368
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,720
See? She even knows the movie title.

369
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,480
Talking about my experience
filming the movie "Yes or No," in which...

370
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,960
this kind of love
is another kind of love that's normal.

371
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,120
So I got rid of the idea that it was abnormal,

372
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,760
then I put my whole heart into the character.

373
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,360
My character is in love.

374
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,920
I believe the chemistry
between me and Tina came from...

375
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,920
being very genuine with the characters,
that we were those characters,

376
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,200
and that we truly loved the other person
without any conditions whatsoever.

377
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,840
It was my first movie.

378
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,200
I didn't know how to act,
so I acted naturally, like a rock.

379
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,040
No, you were cute. You were natural in a cute way.

380
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:41,680
But that naturalness, when I was with Aom,
created the chemistry that was...

381
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,800
It's hard to describe.

382
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,480
That's it. That's it.

383
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,120
Sometimes OTPs don't have to be the best actors.

384
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,360
But they have the kind of chemistry
that can take them to the finish line.

385
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,440
I want every one of you to remember the feeling
when you watched them perform earlier.

386
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,000
What do you have to do
to make the viewers giddy with joy

387
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,920
just from them
bringing their faces close together?

388
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,440
It's about chemistry too.

389
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,160
Acting is part of it, but mainly it's about
how you communicate with your partner

390
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,400
to make the viewers really feel it.
That's today's challenge.

391
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,520
Keep fighting.

392
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,400
If you're ready, I'll let you rehearse.

393
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,000
We'll meet back here
when it's time for the auditions.

394
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

395
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,560
Mint, a 25-year-old talented stylist.

396
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,120
Face, hair, wardrobe, she can do it all.
Her style...

397
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,680
A little artistic, likes simplicity,
but playful, easily embarrassed.

398
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,320
Easily embarrassed is so you.

399
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,480
Okay.

400
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,160
All of this is very emotional.

401
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,040
Don't rush the acting.

402
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,400
When I say something...

403
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,600
- Think.
- Think with your feelings.

404
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,800
You can have an inner voice.

405
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,560
"Oh, I'm so embarrassed."

406
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,480
You can use your breath.

407
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:08,880
Hey, I think earth-tone,
nude-colored clothes suit you.

408
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,760
And the size should resemble baby tees.

409
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,040
- Let's go again.
- Okay.

410
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,520
Which part should we do?

411
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,160
Earlier one, maybe. I feel...

412
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,560
We're not in sync.

413
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,560
- I felt that too.
- Just now I felt that you...

414
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,480
You tried to control it.

415
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,280
Get it? You tried to control the situation.

416
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,360
So it's like you're balancing between
the director's instructions and your acting,

417
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,920
So you weren't in sync.

418
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Lita genuinely tried to teach me.
She wanted it to come out well.

419
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,440
So I want to try and make it come out well
because she puts in her effort.

420
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,280
So I feel a little pressured.

421
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,560
You're researching styling for me?

422
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,640
Of course.

423
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:54,760
Ugh, you know,
Um gave me two nights to deliver it.

424
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,720
And I'm not sure if I can finish it in time,
but I will make it happen.

425
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,640
For you, I can do it for sure.

426
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
I'm sorry the deadline is so tight.

427
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,640
But if...

428
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,120
Nice, while you were acting,

429
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,560
were you holding your breath?

430
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,680
Are you?

431
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,720
I was after my line.

432
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,480
- Yes.
- Why were you?

433
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,440
- It just happened.
- Yes.

434
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,400
Because you try too hard, baby.

435
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,760
When you try too hard... Right now,

436
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,040
the person who needs to breathe smoothly
in this scene is you.

437
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,160
- Otherwise she will feel uncomfortable.
- Yes.

438
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,760
Even I feel uncomfortable as an audience.

439
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,720
I get her completely.

440
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,720
But it's her strength.
I told Nice it was her strength because...

441
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,080
it gave her a clear purpose and goal:

442
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,600
what to do step by step,
and she has to do her best to reach the goal.

443
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,920
Do I need to hold you up or not?

444
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,440
- No need to.
- No need to.

445
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,800
- Like this.
- I see.

446
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,080
"It's me."

447
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,120
It's me.

448
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
- "Sorry."
- Sorry.

449
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,720
- Yeah.
- Couldn't help messing with you.

450
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,240
Yeah, that's it.

451
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,760
Try it on.

452
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,520
Thank you.

453
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,880
Great.

454
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,280
Excellent.

455
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,320
Hey, I think it's good
I'm Tangtang.  I feel like...

456
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,960
I think now it looks great.

457
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,920
Hey, are you okay?
Want some water or snacks? I'll...

458
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,200
get some for you.

459
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,800
No, it's fine. We can start.

460
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,640
Dear, the voice register you're using now
is different from when you act.

461
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,680
Yes.

462
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,880
Dear, say the first line in this voice register.

463
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,000
Which brand is this dress?

464
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,800
Okay, use a lower voice.
Ask Ling if she had breakfast.

465
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,480
Ling, did you have breakfast?

466
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,160
Use this voice when you act.

467
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,080
Mint, which brand is this shirt?

468
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,400
Now, try grabbing your shirt
and feeling that it deserves you.

469
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,120
Feeling you're beautiful.

470
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,560
Then slowly turn and speak.

471
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,640
Mint.

472
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,840
You went up. "Mint."

473
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,680
What's wrong with you?
Should we audition on the third floor?

474
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,160
See?

475
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,560
Yeah, you're right.

476
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,640
Mint.

477
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,720
Time's up!

478
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,840
Time's up.

479
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,360
You have to tune your voice.
Bring a piano to the set with you.

480
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,280
Thank you.

481
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:17,520
When I act, I use another voice register that
makes me uncomfortable, unlike my normal self.

482
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,440
I didn't realize it at all.
I never knew. Teacher Prang is amazing.

483
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,400
She knows me better than I know myself.

484
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,760
It helped me discover more about myself.

485
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,280
It's not enough. Find that vibe, then walk out.

486
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,920
Whoa, I was startled for real.

487
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,840
- I was startled for real.
- Find that vibe.

488
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,480
I was startled for real just now.

489
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
Amazing.

490
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,120
Do it like that.

491
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,720
I'm sorry.

492
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,280
Couldn't help messing with you.

493
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,280
Jeez, Tangtang, I was in the zone.

494
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
Oh? No wonder.

495
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,480
I was knocking for ages
but no one opened the door.

496
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,720
I came in myself. The door wasn't even locked.

497
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,600
Then we kissed.

498
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,400
It's like...

499
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,600
Whoa.

500
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,320
I never thought our paths would cross.

501
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,000
But it fits the title, "Stars Orbit." Yes.

502
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,160
This one's got a bigger frame.

503
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,320
I like that.

504
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,480
Yeah, it's cute.

505
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,520
Go all out.

506
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,800
Yeah.

507
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,200
I feel like you two
could even swap roles and it'd still work.

508
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,600
But this works too.

509
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,880
I feel more relaxed than the last round.

510
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,240
So it's like, "All right,

511
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
what do you think? Okay, let's go with that."

512
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,080
Um gave me only two days,
so I've been rushing like crazy.

513
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,720
I'm sowwy the deadline is so tight.

514
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,000
"I'm sowwy."

515
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,320
It's okay. It gives out a cute vibe.
It can be comedy, whatever.

516
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,280
Why does it always turn into comedy?

517
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,760
It's fine. That's good. We're the comedy type.

518
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,920
What's funny?

519
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,720
It's you.

520
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,160
I was acting proud.

521
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,920
It's not like that.

522
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,840
I was acting proud about...

523
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,960
You were acting proud like this.

524
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,520
What do we do? It keeps turning into comedy.

525
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,960
Comedy can be cute.

526
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,480
It's cute. It can be your thing.

527
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,640
It's comedy.

528
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,360
Stop reading, put it down.
You're about to audition.

529
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,320
Then wear a ring.

530
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,880
Give me another one that's not this one.

531
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,560
Was that a comedy scene?

532
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,560
No, at first we...

533
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,760
When we were rehearsing, it was really funny.

534
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,200
- I see.
- We laughed at each other.

535
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,880
You mean the comedy from laughing at each other.

536
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,920
But don't forget,
when you audition or work for real,

537
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,320
there'll be a lot of people.

538
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:17,040
Or sometimes a camera's
just a palm length away from you.

539
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:24,080
So you'll need focus. Don't mind anyone else.
Just stay with your partner.

540
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,000
When Wafer and I were rehearsing,

541
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,600
we were having fun, probably more than
other pairs. We weren't stressed at all.

542
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,640
While we acted, it felt very comedic.

543
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,320
Until...

544
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,320
Until Tina and Aom came to watch.

545
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,160
Then suddenly it got serious.

546
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,840
Boom, mode switched.

547
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,520
Like this, right?

548
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,600
Well, I couldn't help messing with you.

549
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,800
Right now, in terms of pacing, the beat is...

550
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,080
What you should keep doing is...

551
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,680
I feel like something's missing.
Can you take a look?

552
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,360
This primer. They say it's really good.

553
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,840
It gives such a glow.

554
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,800
Eyebrows are really the crown of the face. Here.

555
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,160
Oh, Nice, you're so cute.

556
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,880
And today's audition script,

557
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,240
"The Reason Stars Orbit,"

558
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,760
is about a young stylist who's secretly in love
with someone older who's an actor.

559
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,280
They've always been close,
but neither has ever admitted to themselves

560
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,480
why they feel so comfortable
being around each other.

561
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,080
THE REASON STARS ORBIT

562
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,880
Now it's time for the auditions.

563
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,840
But let me remind you
that acting is only a part of it.

564
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,000
But this show's goal is finding an OTP.

565
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,160
So you must bring out that perfect chemistry.

566
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,240
So you guys need to deliver that.

567
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,640
Okay. Ready?

568
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,000
- Yes!
- Yes!

569
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
Okay.

570
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:00,160
I'm gonna let you two
decide which pair you want to see first.

571
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,360
Then let's start with Pailiu and Neuanaow.

572
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,120
Okay, if you're ready, please come out.

573
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,040
Again?

574
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,680
We're always first in line.

575
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,080
Whoa.

576
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,120
Mint.

577
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,560
What brand is that dress?

578
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,680
This one?

579
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,280
It's gorgeous.

580
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,840
This dress is...

581
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,960
actually my own project.

582
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,040
Besides...

583
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,200
This dress...

584
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,760
I've never let anyone wear it before.

585
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,520
Really?

586
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,680
Actually this dress,

587
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
when I made it...

588
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,240
I...

589
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,440
I was imaging...

590
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,440
your face, Tangtang.

591
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,040
Yeah.

592
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,200
I'll.... I'll get you a necklace.

593
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,160
Wait a sec.

594
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,080
Uh...

595
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,040
Oh, here it is.

596
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,280
This one should pair well.

597
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,000
How do you feel?

598
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,240
Cut.

599
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,600
My lipstick's all smudged.

600
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,120
That almost-kiss moment at the end,

601
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,920
when you leaned in and paused,
I think that part was interesting.

602
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,880
But overall, the beat feels a bit heavy.

603
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,320
I agree with Teacher Prang, but I could see
the effort you both put into designing the scene.

604
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,960
For me, I think you did really well.

605
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:17,840
I could see that you tried to build the pacing
that made the scene feel dynamic, and...

606
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,680
I feel you two have great chemistry

607
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,720
because I actually got goosebumps at some point.

608
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,840
Pailiu seemed more relaxed, so I felt relaxed too.

609
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,200
Like we didn't pressure each other. So for me,

610
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,400
I'm very happy with this round.

611
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
There, they're sitting in the middle.

612
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,000
- Oh.
- The middle pair, Wafer and June.

613
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,400
June.

614
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
You got this.

615
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,640
Would you be okay with a dress?

616
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,920
What brand is this dress, Mint?

617
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,440
It's my own project called "Comfort Girl."

618
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,720
I never planned for anyone else to wear it.

619
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,200
But when you let me wear it. It fits me perfectly.

620
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,080
Well, when I made it, I was thinking of you.

621
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,760
But I think something's missing. Hang on.

622
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,520
I love it.

623
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,200
What are you doing?

624
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,000
Okay, cut!

625
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,000
I wanna know what you were gonna do.

626
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,800
Teacher Prang, what do you think?

627
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,440
Actually, if we take away the acting skills,

628
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,840
their chemistry can be developed.

629
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,800
But right now you just don't understand

630
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,400
what you're talking about
when you speak each line.

631
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,040
That's why you kept clashing.

632
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,120
Like you two couldn't quite sync.

633
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,880
June's voice faded again
halfway through the scene.

634
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,280
Yeah, that's the issue.
We couldn't really hear you.

635
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,800
Aom even turned to me saying she couldn't hear.

636
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,000
Such a shame.

637
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,560
Out of a hundred percent, about thirty percent
of that I was like, "Huh? What?"

638
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,440
Like, "What was that? Or am I getting old?"

639
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,320
"Or is my hearing bad?"

640
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,600
I just couldn't hear you clearly.

641
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,600
Like the energy you gave,

642
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,360
it stuck at the tip of your nose.

643
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,840
Okay.

644
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,640
You'd stopped focusing on my surrounding.
I focused on me and my partner.

645
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,920
I feel it changes in every episode,
but I still get nervous.

646
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,760
Which pair would you like to see next?

647
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,160
Which one? What about you?

648
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,080
Okay.

649
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,360
So Lita and Nice.

650
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,240
Mint.

651
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
What brand is this dress?

652
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,920
This dress...

653
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,560
Actually, I made it myself.

654
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,760
It's from the "Comfort Girl" collection.

655
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,040
I think it suits you perfectly.

656
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,920
And I...

657
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,040
never let anyone wear this dress before.

658
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,520
Then how come it fits me perfectly?

659
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,440
Look, it fits so well. It's gorgeous.

660
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,720
Actually, when I was made this dress,

661
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,440
I was thinking of you.

662
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,360
I really was.

663
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,360
Oh, and...

664
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,000
there's a necklace in the same collection.

665
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,000
I think it'll suit you very well.

666
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,760
Let me put it on you.

667
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,920
How do you feel?

668
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
Thank you.

669
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,240
Cut.

670
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,600
Much better than the rehearsal.

671
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,760
During rehearsal,
they were tense around each other,

672
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,520
like there was a bit of a blocking issue.

673
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Teacher Prang wouldn't say "cut,"

674
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,080
- but they improvised really well.
- Yeah.

675
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,920
It really showed improvement from the rehearsal,

676
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,520
and their chemistry is interesting.

677
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,120
I got pulled in for a moment there.

678
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,640
And it feels like
size difference chemistry, you know?

679
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,400
A small girl with a big sister.

680
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,880
And the thing we asked Nice to fix,
she did it instantly.

681
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,240
I didn't just fix the blocking.
I asked her to change her breathing pattern.

682
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,960
Nice usually inhales
through her nose and holds it.

683
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,400
So when she delivers lines, she looks too tense.

684
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,480
But at the beginning, she started exhaling.
So everything flowed beautifully.

685
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,600
A small girl.

686
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,800
A small girl.
And the chemistry feels more tough, right?

687
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:15,080
I'm happy they praised me
and I'm happy they saw something in me.

688
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,080
I was really surprised that I was actually
felt it with her during the performance.

689
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,360
Yeah.

690
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,840
It was cool.

691
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,640
And the final pair is Ling and Dear.

692
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,400
Please come out here.

693
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,240
Mint.

694
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,360
Hm?

695
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,200
What brand is this dress?

696
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,160
It's mine.

697
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,960
It's a special project called "Perfect Girl."

698
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,760
Never thought anyone would get to wear it.

699
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,000
Why does it fit me so perfectly?

700
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,880
Well...

701
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,080
When I was...

702
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,880
designing this dress...

703
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,880
I was...

704
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,280
thinking of you.

705
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,360
Oh, there's a necklace too.

706
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,920
Well?

707
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,240
How do you feel?

708
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,920
I feel more at ease now.

709
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,120
Thank you.

710
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,360
Deservedly got first place, huh?

711
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,960
Cut.

712
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,040
- I was waiting to see if she'd go for it.
- Yes.

713
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,280
- You felt it too?
- Yes.

714
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,760
Or maybe they were planning to...

715
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,280
Told you to go for it.

716
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,040
So you actually planned it?

717
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,240
No, we didn't, but I could tell she wanted
to go for it, but she was too afraid.

718
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,080
Such a shame.

719
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,120
I was invested.

720
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:45,360
I was invested. Because their chemistry
actually works in a different kind of way.

721
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,240
And Dear's performance was so natural.

722
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,880
From what I've seen so far. Yeah.

723
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,760
You looked relaxed.
And your smiley vibe really fits this character.

724
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,680
Yeah.

725
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,960
Just toward the end,
there were a few on-and-off moments.

726
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,520
but the beginning was great.
It made me go, "Oh, here we go."

727
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,480
But after a while, something felt slightly off,
like something was missing at the end.

728
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,200
Dear, if you'd gone in for the kiss
and you both smiled afterward,

729
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,000
the ending would've been fulfilling.

730
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,280
After the kiss,
there was awkwardness when you backed off.

731
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,520
But this episode's theme is "comfort."

732
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,400
So it felt like, "Give me just a bit more."

733
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,320
But I love the scene design,
the part where she puts on the necklace.

734
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,920
The timing there was interesting.

735
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,440
And there was a bit of pro-level move,
a blocking trick.

736
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,000
Worried we wouldn't see.
"Here, arms around the waist!"

737
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,160
You saw that too, right?

738
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,840
- Twisted to help her.
- She pulled her.

739
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
She pulled her. Total pro move.

740
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,280
That's good.

741
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,200
- Great job.
- Great job.

742
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,720
I felt my nervousness went down a lot.
I tried to...

743
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,800
think that it was just me and Ling there,
no one else. And it really made me feel lighter.

744
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,800
I felt a lot less tense.
I tried to imagine it was only the two of us.

745
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,200
We can see every pair has shown
improvement in their acting skills,

746
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,800
and the chemistry between
each pair has become more visible.

747
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,480
We're starting to see how they connect.
OTPs are starting to form.

748
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,360
So I'll let Teacher Prang, Tina and Aom

749
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,200
decide who deserve the roles for today.

750
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,040
Wow. Getting paired with someone
they haven't interacted with much

751
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:42,480
actually made their performances today
feel like a huge leap in growth.

752
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:48,720
Everyone did so well that it's almost impossible
to decide which pair deserves the roles.

753
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,440
Today let's start with Pailiu and Neuanaow.
How did they do?

754
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,000
There's chemistry. It's not that there's none.

755
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,680
Yeah, every pair had chemistry.

756
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,080
But this pair had
a little bit of sexy appeal, right?

757
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,320
Do you think so?

758
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,000
Their eyes were kind of...

759
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,720
- sexy.
- Yes.

760
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,040
There was that little spark
when they looked into each other's eyes.

761
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:19,560
And I like their choreography.
Their body shapes really work for the love scene.

762
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,960
Next, Lita and Nice.

763
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:27,280
I was a little surprised because between
what I saw in rehearsal and the real thing,

764
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,560
it was totally different.

765
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,760
Yeah, they did a 180.

766
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,080
It was totally different.

767
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,520
What did you see in rehearsal?

768
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,320
They seemed super tense.

769
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,080
Which one?

770
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,680
Nice was really tense.

771
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,120
And her character drives the story.

772
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,720
When she was tense, the scene ended up...

773
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,360
very boring at first.

774
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,720
During rehearsing,
she didn't seem to know what to do.

775
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,840
Like this.

776
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,520
- Like she was a bit buggy.
- Buggy.

777
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,280
And Nice told me,
"I've been breathing the wrong way all along."

778
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,360
She said she always breathed
through her nose while acting.

779
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,800
That's why she always looked...

780
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,960
- Tense.
- Yeah, very tense.

781
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,000
But once she fixed it... The good thing is...

782
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,400
she fixed it right away.

783
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,640
She improved quickly.

784
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,480
- Within a few minutes.
- Yeah.

785
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,640
Once she fixed the bug, she really flowed.

786
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,040
- Yes.
- It's like...

787
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,480
a little bunny in the hands of...

788
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,360
A wolf.

789
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,880
A wolf that's ready to pounce on her or something.

790
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,480
Yeah, I think their audition is cute.
I was really surprised.

791
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,560
It has substance. It has character too.

792
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,440
Yes. What about this pair? Wafer and June.

793
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,360
Honestly, I really feel
this pair can be developed.

794
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:34,680
This pair has skills. They have everything.
They just lack interpretation skills.

795
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,920
Yeah, they don't...

796
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,240
They don't know the purpose of each line.
But once we guide them like...

797
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,880
"It's because of this and that," they get it.

798
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,400
This means they need someone to guide them.

799
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,840
And the last pair, Ling and Dear. How did they do?

800
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,840
Dear really flowed.
I never saw that version of Dear.

801
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,360
Earlier I worked on her voice, right?

802
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,680
She used her "second voice"
when she acted, like...

803
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,920
"Mint." Like that.

804
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,280
Then I told her to compare it
to her actual voice that she uses every day.

805
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,280
Once she used her real voice,
everything started to flow.

806
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,760
Her character brightened up.
Combined with Ling who has that knowing look.

807
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,360
Like someone older
who's got it all figured out. It worked.

808
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,880
Yeah, this pair is another one
that's very interesting.

809
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,280
In terms of chemistry and personalities.

810
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,440
Maybe because...

811
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,720
I think her acting is strong. Ling.

812
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,120
She has her techniques.
She's technical, I'd put it that way.

813
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,880
Not "strong" as in stiff,
but strong as in capable.

814
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,040
Like she's skilled, technically strong.

815
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,760
And she was touching her partner's hair.

816
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,440
She added little surprises for the audience.

817
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,640
Her performance was heavily designed.

818
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,840
So we've now seen all four pairs.

819
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,320
And honestly, it's really hard to choose.

820
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,440
Because every pair did equally well, almost.

821
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,160
Their chemistry is really starting to show.

822
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,160
But we can only pick one pair.

823
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,400
Ooh.

824
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,000
Once we've decided, we'll tell them together.

825
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,480
Okay.

826
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,040
I have to say this week is really tough,

827
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,400
because almost every pair
improved and did so well.

828
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,080
But we can only choose one pair.

829
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,920
Are you ready to hear who get the roles today?

830
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

831
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,920
And the pair who will get the roles today is...

832
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,600
the pair of...

833
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,240
Lita and Nice.

834
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,240
And Nice really did great.

835
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,040
Plus she was paired with Lita,
so they elevated each other even more.

836
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,400
So I was like, "This pair is perfect."

837
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,040
I'm happy for both of them for getting a date.

838
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,680
I'm really looking forward to their miniseries.

839
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,400
I really want to see Nice and Lita together.

840
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,880
Congrats!

841
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,840
Congrats!

842
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,720
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

843
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,520
Good job.

844
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,640
Why did you choose this pair?

845
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:13,320
I think they both acted well,
but in terms of chemistry,

846
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,240
this pair really stood out.

847
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:22,840
One was like a wolf ready to pounce
the other who was like a small bunny.

848
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:29,360
Watching them today for the first time,
I felt their chemistry stood out the most.

849
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,120
Thank you.

850
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,440
Thank you everyone
for putting your all into this audition.

851
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,320
And for those who got the roles,
give it your best.

852
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,640
We'll look forward to see your show.

853
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,920
And make the most of your special date.
Today I say congratulations.

854
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,080
Thank you.

855
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,040
I'm happy we get to act together.
It'll be nice to see

856
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:56,120
what our chemistry is like, to get to know
each other better. That's a good thing.

857
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,960
We might have met and talked before,
but never got paired up on the show.

858
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,200
But we're paired today

859
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,840
and it turned out surprisingly well.
So I find that interesting.

860
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:15,880
Alright, let's check out the vibe on the set
with Lita and Nice. Let's see how it goes.

861
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,200
LOVE MOMENT: THE REASON STARS ORBIT

862
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,400
And... action.

863
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,800
Back up a little. Create a moment.

864
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,240
- So when we zoom in, we can capture everything.
- Got it.

865
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,600
Mix it with the wide shots.

866
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,920
- Got it.
- Got it.

867
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,160
Sorry, I couldn't help messing with you.

868
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,760
Cut.

869
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,360
Great job.

870
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,560
You said, "Mint."

871
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,120
- You called me Mint.
- I messed up?

872
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,440
- She called me Mint.
- Really?

873
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,960
"Mint, what do you wanna eat?"

874
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,200
Oh, you're right.

875
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,120
Have you had it?

876
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,720
Just one sip.

877
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,960
It's matcha latte.

878
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,480
How was it earlier?

879
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,440
It was like...

880
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,600
- But you're good.
- something new.

881
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,880
But you were so good.
If I compare my first time to your first time,

882
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,960
you're so natural already, and...

883
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,800
I'm being serious.
The first time on set I wasn't as good as you.

884
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,760
No, you delivered well too.
You were great, so it was easy to respond.

885
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,560
Aww, they're both so supportive of each other.

886
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,120
- We're good scene partners.
- That's so nice.

887
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,280
Lita and Nice, watch out for the lights!

888
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,800
Squid.

889
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,760
Squid?

890
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,800
Here.

891
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,240
Oh, thank you.

892
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,200
- Want some?
- Okay.

893
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,880
So can you cook at all?

894
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,960
I can make pasta.

895
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,280
What kind of pasta?

896
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,240
Basic ones, you know.

897
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,000
Like carbonara or tomato sauce.

898
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,000
Thank you.

899
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,280
Do you like squid?

900
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,960
- I love squid.
- Stir-fried with garlic.

901
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,800
Sorry.

902
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,880
That take was good, right?

903
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,560
Your eyes...

904
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,960
are shining so brightly.

905
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,120
Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.

906
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,880
I love you. Thank you.

907
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,800
I feel sorry for her.

908
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:57,720
It was her first time
to do a romantic scene with a kiss.

909
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,720
At first, we didn't really click.

910
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:08,120
I felt that sometimes.
But after a while, we started to click. I'm happy.

911
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:15,920
When I act with Lita,
it feels like I'm her little sister.

912
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,080
Like a freshman having a crush on a senior.

913
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,680
But it's a kind of chemistry that's unique.

914
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,840
It's not chemistry between friends, but it's...

915
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:30,480
more distant, yet they fit together really well.

916
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:37,080
For today's date, both Lita and Nice
chose to go to Dream World amusement park.

917
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,280
It's funny how they both picked the same place.

918
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,920
There are gifts too.

919
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,680
You could tell Lita actually
wanted to go there even more than I did.

920
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,120
Even though they rode all the scary rides,

921
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,360
Lita still looks very chill.

922
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,440
But it looks like Nice can't keep going.

923
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,920
Someone said, "I'm fine."

924
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,960
Fine how?

925
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,920
Totally fine.

926
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,760
Fine how?

927
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,560
I'm chill.

928
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,960
- I'm fine.
- Her face was like....

929
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,440
Yeah, I felt really bad for her
because she almost fainted.

930
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,360
I'll get... What do you want?

931
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,600
I want minced chicken flavor.

932
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,080
One minced chicken and one tom yum, please.

933
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,200
You're not fine.

934
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,080
My head still throbs sometimes.

935
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,920
Feeling any better?

936
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,600
Why do you get like this?

937
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,640
I'm a thalassemia carrier.

938
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,840
Really? Me too.

939
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:22,920
I am.

940
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,440
I'm a carrier too. Yes.

941
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,440
You're anemic, right?

942
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,440
Yes.

943
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,520
We get dizzy easily, right?

944
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:34,280
Yes. Sometimes I have low blood pressure too.
I get tired easily and...

945
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,520
- Dehydrated.
- Huh?

946
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,400
Dehydrated.

947
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,480
And dehydrated.

948
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,960
We're a bit weaker, but we don't admit we're weak.

949
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,080
They have more in common than they thought.

950
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,640
Snow house.

951
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,720
Snow town.

952
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,240
Here, Tangtang.

953
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:02,920
Ready?

954
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:03,760
Ready.

955
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,480
Let's go.

956
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,080
Let's go.

957
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,800
See if it works.

958
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,440
- Yes.
- Okay.

959
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,080
I got it in my eyes.

960
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,880
Are you okay?

961
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,920
What is this?

962
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,960
Oh, it's ice, like shaved ice.

963
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,080
She's so tiny, so I hugged her
because I wanted to take care of her.

964
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,080
Yeah. And she was wearing shorts too.

965
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,280
They only allow an adult and a child
to ride together.

966
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,680
But honestly, Nice is a child.

967
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,600
She just turned three.

968
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,360
Yes.

969
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,880
Let's go. One, two, three.

970
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,000
Lita's gone.

971
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,760
It's been a while.

972
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,760
It makes us feel closer
when we do activities together.

973
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,680
Going on a date.

974
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,720
Going on a date.
Getting cold, hot, and a headache.

975
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,360
This and that.

976
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,360
Getting dizzy and a headache.

977
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,960
"Hey, take care of her."

978
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,360
I feel like...

979
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,640
I feel so close to you now.

980
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,760
Compared to before we workshopped together.

981
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,040
We didn't talk much.

982
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,520
Because in early interviews,
I said I didn't talk to you much.

983
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,800
Today's date is good. It helps us get to know
each other better. I'm glad.

984
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,800
I had a blast today. Thank you so much.

985
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,880
You too. Okay?

986
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,720
I feel like we're starting to
understand each other more,

987
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,320
even though we hadn't talked much
before we were paired together.

988
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:13,040
It feels like our chemistry
is kind of cute, but there's a big age gap.

989
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:18,320
Because Nice is very lively, tiny, and cute,

990
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,920
while I'm tall, big,
and gives out the oldest sister vibe.

991
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,120
They may look like sisters when they're together,

992
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,040
but they're a really cute pair of sisters.

993
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,360
Lita takes really good care of Nice.

994
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,800
I wish I had a big sister like her.

995
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,360
Really? Me too.

996
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,280
I am. I'm a carrier too.

997
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,480
You're older,
so you should be more emotionally mature.

998
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,640
- Back to Love Moment house.
- What did I do?

999
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,720
- What's happening?
- Can't you see?

1000
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,800
- From the first day here.
- Looks like Nice and

1001
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,080
- Neuanaow are fighting.
- What did I do?

1002
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,240
Look at yourself.

1003
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,800
Can't you see?

1004
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,320
And Dear came back from her exams

1005
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,440
- just in time.
- You think you're so great?

1006
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,400
Speak up then.

1007
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,320
It's been several days.

1008
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,600
You think you're so great?

1009
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,600
Speak up then.

1010
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,200
I'm sorry.

1011
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,720
Sometimes I ignore it, okay?

1012
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,280
It's about manners.

1013
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,560
You can't live with anyone if you act this way.
There are so many of us.

1014
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,160
You think the crew didn't see?

1015
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,360
- They did. They talked to me so many times.
- Hold on.

1016
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,280
- Sometimes...
- Don't fight.

1017
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,000
Let Dear talk to Nice first.

1018
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,800
You go talk to Nice.

1019
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,200
Calm down, guys.

1020
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,040
Your girl always does this.

1021
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,160
The crew talked to me so many times.
She never listens when I warn her.

1022
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,320
Calm down, Neua.

1023
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,000
Why don't you Look at yourself?

1024
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,760
You think you're so great?

1025
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,320
It's not about who's better.

1026
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:42,240
I warned you to help you,
but you didn't want to see...

1027
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,480
what I said at all.

1028
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,560
Then let's not talk.

1029
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,800
I don't want to anyway.

1030
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,400
Then let's leave each other alone.

1031
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,360
Who would want to be around you
if you act this way?

1032
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,800
Have you asked the crew?

1033
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,040
You're on camera.

1034
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,680
Let's just stop.

1035
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,200
Look at yourself.
You think other people wanna be around you?

1036
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,000
Ask her.

1037
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:04,280
If you want to know
how everyone else sees this situation,

1038
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,120
go ask them in the kitchen.

1039
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:10,000
Oh, coming to back this,
Dear is in complete shock.

1040
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:27,720
Happy birthday to you.

1041
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:32,920
Happy birthday to you.

1042
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:38,080
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

1043
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:44,440
Happy birthday to you.

1044
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,720
Happy birthday!

1045
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,720
Happy birthday.

1046
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,960
I'm crying for real.

1047
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,600
Why did you guys do that?

1048
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,680
Such bad behavior.

1049
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,560
I came back and was so confused.
Why did you do that?

1050
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,720
Dear, make a wish before you yell at us.

1051
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,440
It won't go out.

1052
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,560
It's wet now.

1053
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,960
Happy birthday.

1054
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,760
No more birthdays because
I don't want to see anyone fight again.

1055
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,240
Actually, Nice and Neuanaow
weren't really fighting.

1056
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:34,240
But the girls planned a birthday surprise for her,
so they had to give her a little shock.

1057
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,240
And everyone carefully decorated
the cakes for her.

1058
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,520
In short, it was a surprise.

1059
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,040
Cakes.

1060
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,520
At first I was shocked

1061
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,600
because I didn't expect it today.
It's not my birthday. My birthday's tomorrow.

1062
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,600
But everyone said
if it were the actual day you'd know, so...

1063
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,800
I was really surprised, and I'm happy that
everyone welcomed me warmly.

1064
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,680
Now everyone is sitting together
to watch the miniseries.

1065
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,040
So beautiful.

1066
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,960
Sorry. I couldn't help messing with you.

1067
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,920
Wow, a movie star.

1068
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,760
So beautiful. Lita, remember
the pink dress. It's the most stunning.

1069
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,480
Here it comes.

1070
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,520
It's nice.

1071
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:53,400
It's a different kind of chemistry that
I've never seen in this house before.

1072
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,960
I never thought
these two would get to act together.

1073
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,600
Wow, Lita being a movie star, so beautiful.
She looks amazing in everything.

1074
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,840
THE REASON STARS ORBIT

1075
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:10,600
And you can watch episode three
of the Love Moment miniseries

1076
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,040
titled "The Reason Stars Orbit"

1077
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:17,760
only on Kantana Motion Pictures'
YouTube channel and WeTV.

1078
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,800
Don't forget to follow the show
and support our girls.

1079
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,680
Let's pause for a moment.

1080
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,120
I know which look will suit you.

1081
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,640
- The hugging scene is good.
- So cute.

1082
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,000
Looks like you really adored each other, Lita.

1083
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,240
Wait a sec.

1084
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,480
I just noticed something.

1085
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,800
They have the same mole?

1086
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,520
Where?

1087
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,360
Lita, turn this way.

1088
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,080
- No, hers is on the right side.
- This side.

1089
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,520
Yeah, it's here.

1090
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,120
No, I saw it on the screen.

1091
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,160
There, just now on the screen.

1092
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,000
Their moles line up.

1093
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,360
Whoa.

1094
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,280
- It's destiny.
- On the right, right?

1095
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,440
There, on the cheek.

1096
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,040
So when their lips meet,
the moles align perfectly, right?

1097
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,840
Look at that.

1098
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:08,840
Really.

1099
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,680
Really.

1100
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,560
I'll take a picture for you.

1101
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,320
Wow, that's so cute.

1102
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,080
I'm being serious, not joking.

1103
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,360
Whoa.

1104
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,600
You're right.

1105
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,880
It's totally destiny.

1106
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,320
Or they're...

1107
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,280
Or maybe...

1108
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,520
So cute.

1109
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,960
Such a coincidence.

1110
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,160
I just noticed it.

1111
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,560
I'll get a mole tattoo.

1112
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,480
- Lips meet and moles align.
- I'm a villain again.

1113
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,800
- She won't give up.
- Love triangle.

1114
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,960
I'll be a villain to every pair.

1115
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,440
I'll be a villain to every pair.

1116
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,120
If it's destiny that two people
have a mole on similar spots

1117
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,000
and the moles line up when they kiss,

1118
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,240
I'll get a mole tattoo. I won't give up.

1119
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,880
It's not just you two who can have a destiny.
Destiny can be created.

1120
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,640
So next week will be my time.

1121
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,520
I want to tell Lita that

1122
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:10,960
thank you so much for helping me today,
and we succeeded.

1123
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,520
Our pair won and...

1124
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:20,080
I wouldn't have been able to perform at all
if the person in front of me weren't you today.

1125
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,840
Today's vibe is very different from before,

1126
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,160
but I'm impressed by the friendship of the girls

1127
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:32,080
and happy that some walls have been broken down.

1128
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,360
Please stay tuned to see what happens next.

1129
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:44,920
The pairing rule is: answer questions
about the person you choose.

1130
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,320
Whoever gets the most correct answers
will get to pair with that person.

1131
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,640
What sport did Lita play before?

1132
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,040
What was Ling's stage name before she became Ling?

1133
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,560
- Who got this right?
- I did.

1134
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,160
We're finally paired up
after I fought for so long.

1135
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,040
Really?
