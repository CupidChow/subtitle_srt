00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,240
Hello, this is the second week
the eight girls who dream to be an GL actress

2
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,280
have lived together in this Love Moment house.

3
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,760
Last week, both in pairing and auditions,

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,880
some were happy
while others were left disappointed,

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,480
but this week
they've spent more time together.

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,240
Will the relationships of each pair change?

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,040
What will happen? Let's check it out.

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,440
<iIt's now an evening at the Love Moment house.</i

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,480
<iWhat are the girls doing?</i

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,720
<iIt looks fun.</i

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,200
<iOoh, some people are painting.</i

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,280
<iThey're quite good.</i

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,680
I wanna eat spicy salads.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,840
What's your favorite food?

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,120
Spicy salads?

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,880
Anything. Any types of food.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,120
Actually, I like noodle dishes.

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,600
Mm, like pasta?

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,400
- No, like...
- Noodles.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,880
Stir-fried noodles. Yeah, noodles.
Stir-fried Hong Kong noodles with...

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,440
- Mm.
- With the breath of the wok.

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,720
Any kinds of noodles.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,640
Interesting.

24
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, it's so good.

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
What about you?

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,840
I like noodles too.

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,680
Really?

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,040
I like instant noodles.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,880
Yeah, but we eat that often.

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,520
True.

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,480
- I'm very worried for your shirt
- Right?

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,160
Maybe fold up your sleeves.

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,400
Oh, it's stained, Nice.

34
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,280
It's already stained. Is this stain old or new?

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,040
It's new.

36
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,760
Will this kind of paint wash out?

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
I don't think so.

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,800
I wasn't sure if anyone would paint with me,

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,080
but suddenly June joined me.

40
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,840
After we talked, I wondered if
there was something between us that clicked.

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,560
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,680
Good job.

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,320
<iOver in the kitchen, it looks like</i
<itwo people are having a private conversation.</i

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,560
And at first, it was like
Lita and I were each other's second choice.

45
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,440
And I felt I wouldn't have chemistry
with Lita. At first.

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,480
Yes, but if I have to be honest,
on the first day I chose you right away.

47
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,560
I was monitoring

48
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,840
my own heart rate.

49
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,240
It spiked like I was exercising.

50
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,120
123.

51
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,240
Oh, my God.

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,480
Honestly, you were one of my choices.

53
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,520
No, but today I saw you interact with Lita,

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,480
I was like, "I see. Okay." So now I know.

55
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,040
Did I completely change the game?

56
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,160
Yeah.

57
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,640
At first when I wrote the letter,

58
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,880
I got my eyes on you,
because when I held your hands

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,960
while they taught us in the workshop,

60
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,240
I felt very good with you.
I thought you were cute and talented.

61
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,960
Oh, you're making me blush.

62
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,560
When I'm with her, I have a feeling that...

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,400
I can't describe it. Earlier I was very nervous.

64
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,040
I...

65
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,080
I really want to be paired
with Pai for everything.

66
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,480
<iThe morning comes and everyone has to pair up.</i

67
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,360
There's Hainanese chicken rice?

68
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
You can reheat it.

69
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,560
I think that's light.

70
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,280
Yeah, it looks two-tone.

71
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
The skin's both olive and light.

72
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,480
- Yeah.
- Here she comes.

73
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,920
Hello, girls. Hello.

74
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,200
-Hello.
-Hello.

75
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,240
What's the chat?

76
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,280
Excited about what exercises
are in store for us today.

77
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,640
I'm not telling, but let's just say
that you will be exhausted.

78
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,400
Whoa!

79
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,760
I can hint that you will be exhausted.

80
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,960
But how has it been? You've here for a week. Lita?

81
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,560
It's been fun and I'm still nervous.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,480
Last week, you got to shoot a video, right?

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,080
How was it? Tell me.

84
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,000
It was fun. I felt that

85
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,680
it was challenging.

86
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,440
If you ask me,
I was nervous in the scene, but not too much.

87
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,880
We're close now.

88
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,800
Okay.

89
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,560
After hearing these two
had a blast shooting a scene,

90
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,160
do you guys want to take on a role too?

91
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,080
I like watching.

92
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,520
Oh, you like watching.

93
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,200
You're not trying to win a role at all?

94
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,080
That won't do.

95
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,840
These two won their roles last week.

96
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,880
So the rest of you have to try harder.

97
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,600
So you get to be on a real set for once.

98
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,400
Acting is important.

99
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,720
But the other important part
on this show is pairing.

100
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,440
See? A good partner who suits you
helps you get into the character better.

101
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,040
I'm here to tell you that
the pairing rules will change every week.

102
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,680
So you guys have to reveal what's on your mind.

103
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,840
Show the person you want to pair with
that you want her.

104
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Because someone else
might want her too and steal her.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,600
That's all I came here to tell you. Do your best.

106
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,440
When you're ready, I'll see you
in the workshop. Keep fighting, everyone.

107
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,920
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

108
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,480
Hello, girls.

109
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
- Hello.
- Hello.

110
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,000
How are you doing?

111
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,320
Tell me the truth.
Who was nervous during last week's audition?

112
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,320
Almost everyone.

113
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,080
Another exercise I prepared to unlock your spine.

114
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,400
It's called the animal exercise,
or copying animals.

115
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,880
Find your own space.

116
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,280
Close your eyes for a moment.

117
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Imagine there's a cute cat in front of you.

118
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,000
Imagine it walking around,
and notice how it walks.

119
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,720
Slowly copying it.
Copy its spine first. Go. Crawl out.

120
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,760
No big movements yet,
or you'll crush your friends.

121
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,040
How does it breathe?

122
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,520
Copy its breathing.

123
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,240
Crawl like that cat.

124
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,000
Go.

125
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,000
The prompt has changed.

126
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:42,440
The people who are still cats
are Pai, Neua, June, and Dear.

127
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,920
The rest stand up and be humans.

128
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,520
Humans, stay away.
Humans' duty is to watch.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,200
Pai and Neua...

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,600
are affectionate cats.
The other two are standoffish cats.

131
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,840
Now, let's try.

132
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,400
Pai, go to Ling.

133
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,760
Neua.

134
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,680
Go to your master, Lita.

135
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,760
Cat June, go to Nice.

136
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,320
Cat Dear, go to Wafer.

137
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,200
This time, you don't see other cats.
Each master is alone with her cat.

138
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,440
Masters become slaves.
Yeah, masters become the cats' slaves.

139
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,000
You can talk to your own cat.
Don't talk to someone else's cat.

140
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
Hmm.

141
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,320
The last 20 seconds to play with your cat.

142
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,360
Here, the last bite.

143
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,640
Yeah.

144
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,760
Good job. Good job.

145
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,400
Jeez.

146
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,280
The look in her eyes
was very affectionate and sexy.

147
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,240
Her eyes were...

148
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,880
You can talk to your own cat.
Don't talk to someone else's cat.

149
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
She's leaving.

150
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
My cat's leaving.

151
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,080
Hey, don't be her slave.

152
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,560
Tell her that you're her master.
Do whatever it takes to control her.

153
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,960
Nice, control her.

154
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Give me your hand.

155
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,760
The masters can speak.
You're humans. You can speak.

156
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
She was a very stubborn cat,

157
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,480
but playing with June was fun.
I thought it was funny.

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,040
Can you give me your hand?

159
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,440
<iWait, why does Herling look so nervous?</i
<iIs your cat making you blush?</i

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,800
Give me your hand.

161
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,960
Good job.

162
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,400
Did you...

163
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,440
Did you sneak out of the house?

164
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:43,960
Hm?

165
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,720
Stop. Sit down.

166
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Give me your hand.

167
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,920
She's the cutest.

168
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
My cat.

169
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,760
Give me your hand.

170
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,760
Give me your hand.

171
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,760
Hey, give me your hand like this.

172
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,440
Mm.

173
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,320
Yes, have a treat.

174
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,720
Don't be naughty. Don't fight with other cats.

175
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,000
All right, let's go to sleep. Go to sleep.

176
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Ling was like,

177
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,200
"Oh, so cute." She interacted with me a lot.

178
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,080
Yes.

179
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,520
It was very thrilling for me.

180
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,720
How could a cat be that sexy?

181
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,240
Cut. Clap for your friends.

182
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,640
Great job.

183
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,480
How was it? Are you tired, girls?

184
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,240
- No.
- No.

185
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,520
Really?

186
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,280
Really.

187
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,160
I'm glad they have a lot of energy, Teacher Prang.

188
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
How are they doing today?
Are they doing well?

189
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,320
Quite good.

190
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,000
Hold on.

191
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,080
Do you mean the opposite?

192
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,760
Like no good.

193
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,480
And I'm here to tell you that

194
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,480
one of the scenes we will audition
involve a dance.

195
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,680
But this dance is not a normal dance.
You can't just wing it.

196
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,840
But it's a dance called contemporary dance.

197
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,720
Whoa.

198
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,560
Many people look worried, Teacher Prang.

199
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,840
Some may not know it.

200
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,120
"What is contemporary dance?"

201
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:20,120
But don't worry, because today I have
an expert in contemporary dance to teach you.

202
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,240
Please, Teacher Fin.

203
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,360
Hello.

204
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,360
Hello.

205
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,640
What is contemporary dance?
The girls are very confused.

206
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,240
Contemporary is another word for nontraditional.

207
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,280
In the past, there were ballet and jazz, right?
Everything was quite fixed.

208
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,120
When the actors performed
and felt a lot of emotions,

209
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,400
they wanted to use their body too.

210
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,600
But they couldn't do it
because the ballet requires stillness.

211
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,840
So they used the body
with more head and arm movements,

212
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,920
so a lot of it is based on ballet,
but it's still more free-form.

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,800
There are more free movements.

214
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,480
Do you want to see Teacher Fin demonstrate?

215
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

216
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,280
I really want to see it.

217
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,440
I need some space.

218
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,040
You're amazing.

219
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,720
That was amazing.

220
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,000
Awesome.

221
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,400
Girls, can't wait to learn, right?

222
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,480
Don't make that face.

223
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,320
Wow, it looks very appealing.

224
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,640
And Teacher Fin will not only teach you,

225
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,840
she will also be one of the judges
who decide who gets the roles.

226
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:55,200
So I and Teacher Prang will get some rest.
We'll let you guys learn from Teacher Fin.

227
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,360
Okay.

228
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,280
Pair up. You can pair with anyone.
Pair with someone nearby.

229
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,760
A contact can start from anywhere.

230
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,840
If you want your partner to stay away,
push her body.

231
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,800
Push her away gently. Yeah, any way you want.

232
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,600
And lead her where you want her to be.

233
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,160
Maybe you want to stop here
and push her body back.

234
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,320
Ah, correct.

235
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,800
Resist at the same time.

236
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,720
Yeah, and pull each other back.

237
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,000
During the workshops, I tried playing with Pai.
I was curious what it would feel like.

238
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,840
I'm blushing.

239
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,160
Either zero space or with contact,
but not for very long. Let's go.

240
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,280
Go slow so your friends can see.

241
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,480
Okay. Good.

242
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,320
That's right. Go slow. Push.

243
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,480
Step.

244
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,800
Slide.

245
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,400
Yes, that's right.

246
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,280
That's it.

247
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,880
Keep eye contact. Good.

248
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Yes.

249
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,440
Beautiful.

250
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,120
Okay.

251
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,600
Good.

252
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Okay.

253
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,640
Good. Eight and one. Good.

254
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Two. Yes. Three.

255
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
One.

256
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Yeah. Beautiful. Come on.

257
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,920
Step slowly. You can keep it slow.

258
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,480
Very good. Okay. Touch her gently.

259
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,800
Slowly. Slower. A little slower.

260
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,280
Knowing what's the other's thinking
is very important in this dance.

261
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,840
The dance she taught us. Yes.

262
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,160
Wow.

263
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,160
How was the dance class?

264
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Are you intimate with your own body now, girls?

265
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,480
Not yet.

266
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,000
- Not yet?
- I want to be.

267
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,280
We're acquaintances now.

268
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,480
It doesn't want to be yet.

269
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,320
Yes.

270
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,080
If that's the case, you'd better hurry up.

271
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,640
Because do you see what's in my hands?

272
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,480
- "The Right Person."
- "The Right Person."

273
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,640
This is the script for the audition in Episode 2.

274
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,200
So the most important thing is the pairing.

275
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,960
That will start now.

276
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,760
- Huh?
- How?

277
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,080
Per this week's rules,

278
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,640
I will let the person who got
the most votes last week choose her partner.

279
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,520
And the person
who got the most votes last week is...

280
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,080
Pailiu.

281
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,000
Please come here.

282
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,440
Another tough decision.

283
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,440
To be honest, it was quite hard. Very hard.

284
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,720
Pailiu got the most votes last week.

285
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,160
Now it's Pailiu right to choose.

286
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,960
But those who want to be paired with her,
please step forward.

287
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,120
Anyone else?

288
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,760
<iEh? It looks like June was about to take a step,</i
<ibut she retreated. Why?</i

289
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,000
Anyone else?

290
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,360
Anyone?

291
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,240
I really wanted to step forward,

292
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,440
but I had a feeling
that Pailiu had someone else in mind.

293
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,520
So I didn't dare throw my hat in the ring
in that moment.

294
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:16,600
Okay, three people stepped forward.
Ling, Dear and Nice.

295
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,080
Who do you choose, Pailiu?

296
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,240
Right now?

297
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,600
Yes, right now.

298
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,520
It's so hard.

299
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,800
Give me a sec.

300
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,080
-We're chilling.
-We're chilling.

301
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,960
Tough, right?

302
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,000
Yes.

303
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,560
So I want the three of you
to tell Pailiu how you really feel.

304
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,560
Start with Nice.

305
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,160
I feel I clicked with you
when you told your story,

306
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,000
that you'd been through a lot,
both good and bad.

307
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,040
I feel I could give you support when you need it.

308
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,320
My heart dropped when she told me how she felt.

309
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,960
She made this pose
and was like, "I'll support you."

310
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,920
This girl is so clever.
She knows how to seduce me.

311
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,800
But it might be her personality
that I'm weak for. It's very hard.

312
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,120
Dear.

313
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,600
Don't be nervous. Don't be nervous.

314
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,480
Um...

315
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,120
I feel that...

316
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,000
I've spent a lot of time with you
and I feel that I'm a very detail-oriented person.

317
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,880
I think I know you very well.

318
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,160
That's it.

319
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,480
Her taking a long time
made it hard for me. But I get her.

320
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,000
She was probably nervous,
pressuring herself, or overthinking.

321
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,160
Yes, I get her.

322
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,400
Ling.

323
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,760
For me, as I said yesterday
when I talked to you a little.

324
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,800
I'm someone who wants to explore and experiment.

325
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,080
I wanna do a scene with you once.

326
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,080
You're very intriguing to me. Yes.

327
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,200
Okay.

328
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
All three have voiced how they feel.

329
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,280
Who do you choose?

330
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,000
If you're ready, go take
that person's hand and bring her here.

331
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,480
Okay.

332
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,800
Okay.

333
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,280
I'll do it from behind.

334
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,840
Please let me have this.

335
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,040
It's so hard.

336
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,080
Take Ling's hand and come here.

337
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,120
Okay, congrats.

338
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,880
Thank you.

339
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,440
The first pair.

340
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,520
If I considered only what they said
right there, I might've picked Nice,

341
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,800
but I'm someone who always
looks at the big picture,

342
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,960
so I felt for this round it has to be Ling.
Yes. So I picked Ling.

343
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,680
The first pair. We got the first pair.

344
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,560
I'm sorry, really sorry.

345
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,280
I was dreading, like,
"Will she pick me? What will happen?

346
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,200
Or is she going to
pick one of the other two?" I was...

347
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,760
It was very uncomfortable.
Until she made her decision to pick me.

348
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,360
<iFinally, Ling achieves her goal</i
<ifrom the first day.</i

349
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,680
<iI'm very happy for her.</i

350
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,080
We got the first pair. Very exciting.
I feel uncomfortable for you. I'm excited for you.

351
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,960
The person who got the second most votes last week

352
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,840
and has the right to choose next
this week is Neuanaow.

353
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,840
And those who want to be paired
with Neuanaow, please step forward.

354
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,360
Anyone else?

355
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,920
Anyone else wants to be paired with Neuanaow?

356
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
I was thinking to myself,

357
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,040
"Is there a competition?"

358
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,720
I turned.

359
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
No one stepped forward? Um.

360
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,400
Okay.

361
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,880
One,

362
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,080
two,

363
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,040
three.

364
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,360
Time's up.

365
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,760
Is that it?

366
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,600
Do you want to choose?

367
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,160
Choose now.

368
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,800
Okay, congrats.

369
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,080
There's only Lita.

370
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,080
And I was happy
because I actually wanted to pair with her.

371
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,640
She probably wanted me too.

372
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,400
So it was okay. I wanted to pair with her anyway.

373
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:17,240
And the last person who has
the right to choose a partner today is Nice.

374
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,000
If you want her, step forward.

375
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,840
Okay, now there are three people
who want to be your pick.

376
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,320
Can you choose?

377
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,560
I choose you.

378
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,480
You choose me?

379
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,960
Wait, I'm not one of the choices.
You have to choose one of them.

380
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
If you're ready, please choose.

381
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,640
Embrace her from behind.

382
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,480
Whenever you're ready.

383
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Congratulations.

384
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,400
Congrats.

385
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,160
And I thought who I should will connecting with.

386
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,680
I never acted Wafer.

387
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,880
And I see Dear as a CUTU.
I get a friend vibe from her.

388
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,800
So June was the only one left that
I felt some attraction during the cat exercise

389
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,440
and when we painted together.

390
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,120
So I chose June.

391
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,760
I was very happy. I was like,
"Aww, she's so lovely for picking me."

392
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,800
So Nice is paired with June.

393
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,280
And Wafer is paired with Dear.

394
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,160
You were already.

395
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,560
It's the same pair.

396
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,440
I'm with Dear.

397
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,120
Again.

398
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,720
Which is fate playing tricks again.

399
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,600
Now everyone has been paired.
Both by fate and by you guys.

400
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,240
It's time to rehearse with the script.

401
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,080
The first pair, come and take it.

402
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,600
<iToday's assignment is difficult for the girls.</i
<iI'm rooting for every pair.</i

403
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,280
She seems to really like you.

404
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,440
Why are you asking me that, Nam?

405
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,160
You two look very close.

406
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,160
You knew each other.

407
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,240
Thank you.

408
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,080
Thank you.

409
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,440
Belle feels that...

410
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,960
"Belle keeps her head down, not answering."

411
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,440
Like I show my sincerity that I love Kwan...

412
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,080
- No, love Nam.
- Love Nam for real.

413
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,320
- Love Nam.
- Love Nam.

414
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,640
Got it.

415
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,640
There's some kind of attraction
that makes me find her interesting,

416
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,720
making me feel I can't take my eyes off her.

417
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:28,000
There's something that makes me feel that
we can get along. Like we understand each other.

418
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,560
It's easy to exchange lines.

419
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,720
<iWhen they painted together,</i

420
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,320
<iworkshopped together,</i

421
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,320
<iand now rehearse together,</i

422
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,680
<ithis pair seems to connect really well.</i

423
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,960
<iEverything seems to flow.</i

424
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,880
<iAs for Ling and Pailiu,</i
<ithey're rehearsing in the kitchen.</i

425
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,000
This one too.

426
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,200
There's nothing.

427
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,760
Here, I'll make a note for you.

428
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,640
Should be easier this way.

429
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,520
Easier, right?

430
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,120
Yes.

431
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,400
I'll be right back.

432
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,080
Have some water first.

433
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Thank you.

434
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,880
Sit down.

435
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,640
So you're calmer.

436
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,280
We have to dance for one minute, right?

437
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,680
We'll dance later. Let's memorize lines first.

438
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,360
- Okay.
- So let's start from the top.

439
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,200
This time speak with...

440
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,480
the emotions...

441
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,600
you have in mind.

442
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,560
Yes.

443
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,600
"Belle walked out of the..."

444
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,600
"Belle walked out of the studio's entrance."

445
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,560
I'm so nervous my hands are shaking.

446
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,200
Don't be nervous.

447
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,040
They told us to try to relax.

448
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,040
Okay.

449
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,320
Trust them.

450
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,640
You can look at me as anybody you wanna see.

451
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,480
Yes.

452
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,040
I'll look at you as Belle.

453
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,080
And Belle ideally must be older than me.
I'll be her younger jealous girlfriend.

454
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:07,320
I love you very much.
Besides, I still want to dance with you...

455
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,200
for the rest of my life.

456
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,720
So good. The look in your eyes was so good.
Wow. That was very convincing. It was like...

457
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,200
We're like yin and yang,
giving each other very good advice.

458
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,360
I don't dance well yet.

459
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,080
I'll be a puppy type.

460
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,400
And you'll be black cat
who's in control. I'll follow.

461
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,000
Okay.

462
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,040
You lead.

463
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,520
You can touch or move my face anywhere.

464
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,000
Ooh.

465
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,040
You're so fast.

466
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
So fast. I'm confused.

467
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,400
I was messing around. Sorry.

468
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,760
Sorry.

469
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,240
Go ahead and lead.

470
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
Run your hand down my body or whatever.

471
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,560
It's hot, right?

472
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,680
It's very hot right now.

473
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,400
Yeah, it's very hot.

474
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,640
It's very hot right now.

475
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,880
<iI want to tell them</i
<iit's getting hot for this viewer too.</i

476
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,000
And then...

477
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,880
push first. No, you push me.

478
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,560
No, I want you to spin like this.

479
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,120
I see, okay, got it.

480
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:18,960
Yes.

481
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,360
Mm, okay.

482
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,080
And then, let's me think.

483
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,720
I'll move away.

484
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,320
Then it's my turn.

485
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,400
But we have to stay calm and really hold hands.

486
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,240
Mm.

487
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,160
Do you want to do that move. I'll do it.

488
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,640
Anything goes.

489
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,320
Okay. Let's do it.

490
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,840
Yeah.

491
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,480
And we can do that next.

492
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,880
And make it hot.

493
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,840
Make it hot. Make it hot.

494
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,080
<iJeez, so very hot.</i

495
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,120
<iThis pair really flows.</i

496
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,080
We listened to each other when we danced.

497
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,760
I proposed something and she wanted to try it.

498
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,840
She didn't know if she could do it,
but I like that she was willing to try first.

499
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,040
Yes, she went all in.

500
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,080
Then let me ask... Let me... Ugh.

501
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,080
Do you still love Kwan?

502
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,840
I love you.

503
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,880
And I want to dance with Kwan...

504
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,360
- No.
- Hey.

505
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,080
That's not right.

506
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,960
Dance with...

507
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,680
What's Nam like?

508
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,440
From the script,

509
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,760
I think she's...

510
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,680
One, she must be someone who's...

511
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,120
who's mentally weak and not very confident
because confident people wouldn't ask.

512
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,600
Mm.

513
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
Because confident people would know

514
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,520
and not get jealous like this.

515
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:44,880
Mm.

516
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,680
They can get jealous, but they won't cry
because someone else looked at her girlfriend.

517
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,760
They have to trust each other.

518
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,640
Mm.

519
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,720
We tried to speak with ours eyes
as much as possible.

520
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:03,040
And I feel we speak the same language,
but I don't know if she gets me, but I get her.

521
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,280
She's cute. I had a cute girl beside me
and I was like, "Ooh."

522
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,520
<iOh, and this pair is sugary sweet.</i
<iAnts are gonna come for that sofa.</i

523
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,120
At the beginning, who's gonna lead?

524
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,320
I lead, right?

525
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,000
No, I was just figuring out how to do it.

526
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,880
Oh, okay.

527
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,160
Should I lead or do you want to lead?

528
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
- You first.
- Okay.

529
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,360
And start making contact.

530
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,800
And stand back-to-back.

531
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,800
The leg must...

532
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,040
Yeah, the leg must...

533
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,920
Or we can touch our hands, but...

534
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,280
The leg must go straight, right?

535
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,240
<iThis pair seems stressed about the dance.</i

536
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,640
<iYou guys can relax.</i

537
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,160
<iOr the real dance will look tense.</i

538
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,160
Maybe a leg sweep is easier.

539
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,280
We're very stressed about the dance.

540
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,080
We're the two people who always complain
we're not intimate with our bodies.

541
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,360
Please don't make us dance.

542
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,200
We're overthinking.
Like what should we do? How should we execute?

543
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,480
I'm a little worried if we can do it,

544
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,680
but it was like... I told Dear to do
whatever that resonated with how we felt.

545
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,960
<iBut today's assignment is really difficult.</i

546
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,840
<iIt emphasizes every girl's determination</i
<iand dedication to become an actress.</i

547
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,000
<iAfter seeing each pair rehearse,</i
<iwhat do the teachers think?</i

548
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,640
Which pairs look promising?

549
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,720
Pailiu and Ling.

550
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,320
And Lita.

551
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,800
- And Neuanaow.
- Neuanaow.

552
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,240
I feel there's some kind of chemistry
that makes them look compatible.

553
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,840
And when they dance,
they're brave enough to touch each other.

554
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,160
What about the acting, Teacher Prang?
Are you worried about any pairs in particular?

555
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:01,200
We haven't seen Wafer and Dear act together,
but we've seen them dance together.

556
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,880
When they dance,
they're not connected with their partner at all.

557
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,320
They're too busy anticipating the next move.

558
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,000
If they're not connected while dancing,

559
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,120
it's very likely that in the end

560
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,240
they will disconnect while acting.

561
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,080
I think rehearsal time is over.

562
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,040
Let's start the auditions.

563
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,240
I can't wait.

564
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Lita.

565
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,320
Do you think my face is missing something?

566
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,080
Make your cheeks, eyebrows and mouth look juicier.

567
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,080
Kiss.

568
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,160
<iAnd the script for today's auditions</i
<iis a story about a love triangle</i

569
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,720
<iwhere the characters have to decide</i
<iwho is the right person for them.</i

570
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:47,240
<iMore importantly, the challenge of this script is</i
<ithe fact that both main characters are dancers.</i

571
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,200
I'll let Teacher Fin choose
the pair you want to see first.

572
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,440
I want to see Lita and Neuanaow first.

573
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,440
Okay, whenever you're ready.

574
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,400
And do you like Kwan?

575
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,120
Why are you asking me that, Nam?

576
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,360
Before you met me,

577
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,720
you two danced together,

578
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,600
knew each other,

579
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,640
and got close.

580
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,320
I used to date Kwan too.

581
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,120
Nam.

582
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,480
The two of us are dating now.

583
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,440
Don't let the past hurt our future.

584
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,480
There's really nothing.

585
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,040
Then let me ask you one question.

586
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,480
Do you still love Kwan?

587
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,320
I don't love Kwan anymore.

588
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,080
I love you.

589
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,320
And you're the only one I love.

590
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,560
I want you to be my dance partner
for the rest of my life.

591
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,760
Oh, you get jealous.

592
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,680
There's nothing. Let me see you.

593
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,600
Stop crying.

594
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,920
You know how much I love you.

595
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,960
Okay, cut.

596
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,400
How did you do?

597
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,120
I'm a bit surprised, because when I
watched them earlier, they were still awkwardness.

598
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,400
But I feel this time it really flowed better.

599
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,000
It seems both of you lead with emotions
rather than choreography.

600
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,600
If Neua stayed with Lita a little bit more...
Very little. Like 0.5% in my opinion.

601
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,440
And if you accept everything,
every touch Lita delivered,

602
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:43,120
you will find more nuanced emotions,
and your acting will go further.

603
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Thank you.

604
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,440
Great job.

605
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,680
I was quite happy with it. She delivered well too.

606
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,960
If I just...

607
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,760
I might have not done not as well.

608
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,000
I might have pressured myself to cry more
and the result might have been worse.

609
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,880
The problem is very small
that takes time to finesse.

610
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,600
Because it's the first time that we...

611
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,880
act together, but she did really well.

612
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,240
The second pair is Wafer and Dear.

613
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,080
Do you still love Kwan?

614
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,640
It was a really long time ago.

615
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,160
Can we not fight about this?

616
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,760
Look at how she looked at you.

617
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,240
It's was a long time. Really.

618
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,600
Right now you're the one for me.

619
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,520
And I feel like I want to dance with you
for the rest of my life.

620
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,080
I don't want anyone else. I mean it.

621
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,440
How can I believe you?

622
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,160
I love you.

623
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,040
Cut.

624
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,800
I feel the thing that got a lot better,
and I want you to keep it, is taking your time.

625
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,400
It seemed you were still worried.

626
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,800
Like I can tell when you were worried,

627
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,480
and it was pretty clear which part flowed
and which part was awkward.

628
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,560
But as an actress, you have to pretend
there's nothing to worry about.

629
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,000
But I think you did very well.

630
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,480
Good job.

631
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,320
Good job.

632
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,400
From the last workshop,
I realized my acting was too fast.

633
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,400
I wasn't acting between the lines with my partner.

634
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,800
So this time I had to slow down my acting
and be more present with my partner.

635
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,320
Let's go to the next pair.
I'll let Teacher Fin choose.

636
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,080
I choose...

637
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,560
Nice and June.

638
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,720
First time too.

639
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,520
Let us know when you're ready.

640
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,960
I know.

641
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,920
I know...

642
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,480
that...

643
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,480
Kwan likes you.

644
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,440
I know.

645
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,680
What about you?

646
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,840
Do you like Kwan?

647
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,920
Why are you asking me that, Nam?

648
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,400
Because you knew each other.

649
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,480
You two were close.

650
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,080
- I dated her.
- You lived together.

651
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,280
But it was a long time ago, Nam.

652
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,680
Let me ask you one question.

653
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,520
Do you still love each other?

654
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,760
Do you still miss each other?

655
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,240
Nam, the two of us are dating now.

656
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,280
Don't let the past destroy our future.

657
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,800
There's nothing between us, Nam.

658
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,680
You still love me. You love me, right?

659
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,480
I don't love Kwan anymore.

660
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,280
I love you and I want to dance with you
for the rest of my life.

661
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,400
Really?

662
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,840
Thank you.

663
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,960
Cut.

664
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,280
How did they do, Teacher Fin?

665
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,160
I noticed you used your eyes more.

666
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:21,480
And you were brave enough to touch each other.
It felt like your attraction was well-balanced.

667
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,000
In terms of acting, I feel this time,
June has gotten more still.

668
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,520
By "still" I mean you're mentally still,
not in a hurry and get past moments.

669
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,200
That's very good.

670
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,080
In the meantime, Nice, I understand that
when the scene needs you to cry,

671
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:45,560
you feel like, "Should I cry or not cry?"
I'm not sure if you're a sensitive person.

672
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,760
I actually feel that
you're very sincere in your emotions,

673
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,960
and you're likely to get
sensitive easily by default.

674
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,960
But when you're worried about it,
those worries cover what you have.

675
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,560
So it keeps you...

676
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,560
with only your own emotions, and you forget
to find a trigger from the person in front of you,

677
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,240
to see which reaction of hers makes you feel

678
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,760
"She really loves me" to the point
you want to cry. Something like that.

679
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,520
Right now you can't find a trigger
from your partner,

680
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,720
so you can't use
what you have to its full potential.

681
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,120
Actually, I'm happy with my work today.

682
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,600
And I did my best
and I'm satisfied to a certain extent.

683
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:33,360
But I think I improved.
I mean I tried harder. So I'll keep fighting.

684
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,920
It's...

685
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:44,480
When we acted for fun,
when I talked to June for fun, I felt I could act.

686
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,560
But if it's a dramatic scene,
we have to stay in the same situation.

687
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,840
I feel that I and June don't quite look
at the situation in the same way yet.

688
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:01,240
The last pair. Please. Pailiu and Ling.

689
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,480
I wanted to do my best to help her win
and get to go on a date with her.

690
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,160
Nam.

691
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,480
So it's true that Kwan likes you.

692
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,120
Why are you asking me that, Nam?

693
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,560
Before you met me,

694
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,880
you knew Kwan.

695
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,840
And you used to dance together.

696
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,280
- And...
- And we used to date.

697
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,440
But Nam...

698
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,320
No wonder.

699
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,480
There's nothing.

700
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,280
You look good together when you dance.

701
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,760
And your timing with her is better than with me.

702
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,520
Right now...

703
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,920
I'm dating you.

704
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,240
And we're girlfriends, right?

705
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:51,120
Don't let what I did in the past
destroy the future we're about to share. Please.

706
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,600
Because these days
there hasn't been anyone but you.

707
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,240
Do you still like Kwan?

708
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,680
No.

709
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,120
Do you still love Kwan?

710
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,080
I don't love Kwan anymore.

711
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,080
I love you.

712
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,920
I love you so much.

713
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,640
I love you so much.

714
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,280
And besides,

715
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,600
I want to dance with Kwan.

716
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,960
I want to get tired from practicing
like we just did.

717
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,120
I want to get you water.

718
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,920
I want to be with you.

719
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,760
I want to live with you like this forever.

720
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,040
Stop crying.

721
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,640
You don't look pretty.

722
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,280
Okay. Cut.

723
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,480
How was that, Teacher Prang?

724
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,680
If you felt how they felt, then you felt it.

725
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,200
Mm.

726
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,560
An easy way to evaluate is if you feel it.

727
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,280
What I love is that they took their time.

728
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,400
Get it now?

729
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:05,680
Keep affirming her that you really love her.
And it was a real emotion. So it made you feel...

730
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,840
"Really?" And it made you cry.
That's called taking your time.

731
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,280
Find a trigger from your partner
and let it make you feel.

732
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

733
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,720
In terms of dance, I think it flowed very well.
I mean there weren't many awkward parts.

734
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,000
I feel both of you
listened to each other very well.

735
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,200
Okay.

736
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,640
The emotions were stronger than the rehearsal.

737
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,640
I don't know where they came from.

738
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,560
I don't know if it was because
everything else was quiet.

739
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,880
The look in her eyes made me believe her.

740
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,160
I was blushing. Inside it feels like...

741
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:44,240
And the acting today gave me a relief.
We opened ourselves to each other more.

742
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,720
What do you think?

743
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,200
Everyone improved very quickly within a week.

744
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,080
In terms of acting,
everyone is really more detailed.

745
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,800
Mm.

746
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,400
As for the dancing, I'm quite shocked

747
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,080
because we had a short workshop,
but they did well and did it by themselves.

748
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,320
Every pair.

749
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,720
They're all good, to tell you the truth.
It's hard to say,

750
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,440
but personally, I like Lita and Neuanaow.

751
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,320
- Okay.
- Yes.

752
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,720
What about you, Teacher Prang?

753
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:16,800
For me it's Pailiu and Ling,
because they made us feel what they felt.

754
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,560
So let's go tell them.

755
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,480
Yes.

756
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:23,840
Both teachers and I talked it over

757
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,440
to choose the best pair
to get the roles this week.

758
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,440
And the winning pair is...

759
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,520
Pailiu and Ling.

760
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,680
Congratulations.

761
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,000
You're the pair whose dancing and acting

762
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,640
convinced us that you two were really dating.

763
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,840
Both the dance was sensual.

764
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,760
Yes, it was.

765
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,960
And the acting was convincing. We felt it.

766
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,280
But in addition to these two, another person

767
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:07,320
will get to shoot a miniseries with them.

768
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,440
And that person is...

769
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,960
Neuanaow.

770
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,480
She's still confused.

771
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,640
I was happy. I wanted her to try and act on a set.

772
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,840
Come back and pair with me for the next series.
And we'll act together on a set.

773
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,400
It didn't even occur to me I'd get to shoot.

774
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,040
And I'll be on set without Lita,
I was like, "Goodness."

775
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:38,560
Neuanaow, you got this opportunity
because both teachers think that

776
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,680
your dancing and the acting were missing...
How much?

777
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,800
0.5%.

778
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:49,280
You're 0.5% from being perfect.
So you'll get the role of Kwan.

779
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,280
Congratulations to all three.

780
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:58,360
But the special date prize
still applies to only two people.

781
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,840
And that's Ling and Pailiu.
I hope you enjoy your date.

782
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,600
Everyone did very well today. Thank you very much.

783
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:10,400
I hope you guys improve every week.
Thank you for today. See you next week.

784
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,040
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

785
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,520
If I wasn't for Ling, I might have not won.

786
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,600
I give all the credit to Ling
because she was really good.

787
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:25,480
And she made me believe that
she was Nam and I was Belle.

788
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,760
Oh! I'm so happy.

789
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,480
<iEh? But while everyone is happy,</i
<iwhy does Nice look so sad? Are you okay?</i

790
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,920
When we acted for real,

791
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,840
when I looked into June's eyes, I felt nothing.

792
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,880
I felt that her eyes were empty.

793
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,840
So I couldn't act.

794
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,840
When you rehearsed, it was like...

795
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,800
You were more connected.
The chemistry was very strong.

796
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,280
You're... more masculine.
The masculinity is very strong.

797
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:10,520
And Nice's very feminine. It's not well-balanced.
But I felt like you were stressed.

798
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,360
This is normal, girls. Don't think that...

799
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,760
you failing an audition and crying
is a big deal. It's very common.

800
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,280
We all have good days and bad days.

801
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,440
"Okay, today's bad. Okay.
Maybe next week's better." That's it.

802
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,840
It's not like the end of the world.

803
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,160
The world hasn't ended.

804
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:30,960
Okay?

805
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

806
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,600
She's actually very natural.

807
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:53,640
After I acted with her, I feel that the way
she looked at me sometimes made me wonder...

808
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,960
"Does she really have feelings for me?"

809
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:03,560
<iAfter spending a lot energy, the girls gather</i
<ithis evening to enjoy Thai BBQ and recharge.</i

810
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,720
I'm curious, Pai.

811
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,600
When you had to choose between three people,
how did it feel? Did you feel pressured?

812
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,080
So pressured to the point that I thought,
"Who came up with this game?"

813
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,520
I was curious because it was very hard.

814
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,280
I was very hard to choose between three people.
And it was like...

815
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,920
Each person had to speak their mind. It was hard.

816
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,200
And I felt guilty for not choosing the other two.

817
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,480
It's okay.

818
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,920
- True, don't feel pressured.
- Next time. Next time.

819
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,320
But I understand in that moment.

820
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:41,280
I chose you because you've chosen me in the past.

821
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,160
And you came to talk to me last night.

822
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,760
So touching. Let me cry a little.

823
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,120
So I went with Ling first, you know.

824
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,680
In this round.

825
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,800
In this round.

826
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,040
No, I mean...

827
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,480
Next round, we'll see.

828
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,080
No, maybe we get paired together again. Who knows.

829
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,840
She... She has a few tricks up her sleeve.

830
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,400
Yeah.

831
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,960
Dear, I want to know how you felt
when you stepped forward.

832
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,320
At the time, I couldn't think at all.
I was so nervous.

833
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,400
There was pressure and I couldn't say anything.

834
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,160
I could tell.

835
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,640
Yeah, I didn't know what to say.

836
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,800
I want to know if you were disappointed.

837
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,360
Give it to me straight.

838
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,760
Of course I was.

839
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,920
Like, will there be a day she chooses me?

840
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,400
Hold on.

841
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,280
Calm down, this is just EP 2.

842
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,120
How did it feel to be chosen?

843
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,440
No, I had already approached her yesterday.

844
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,280
I hurried and asked to talk to her in the kitchen.

845
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,880
Yes, at least I wanted her to know
I was interested in her.

846
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:49,160
Today when I stepped forward, I was very worried
because I feel Pai cares about everyone.

847
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,920
There were Nice who looks promising
and Dear who's talented.

848
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,400
So I felt, "Oh boy, if Pailiu picks someone else

849
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,480
and not me, and blow me off,
what will happen?" I was very worried.

850
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:09,680
But I actually would respect
Pai's decision, whoever she chose.

851
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,960
But when she chose me, I was like,
"Okay, good." I wanted to do my best.

852
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,360
What about you, Nice? How do you feel about today?

853
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,040
At first I felt my acting wasn't very good.

854
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,560
But when you guys comforted me,
I felt that maybe today's not my day.

855
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,440
June?

856
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,720
I stepped forward for Nice because I like her.

857
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,280
I mean I like her style and how she talks.
I wanted to try.

858
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,280
But I didn't know if she would be happy with me.
But I'm happy with her today.

859
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,200
But the problem was me.

860
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,040
No, I know. I mean I made that decision
because I'd planned to choose you.

861
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,960
Maybe this time there was too much pressure
and I was overthinking things.

862
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,520
If I try freeing my mind, I might get better.

863
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:06,280
<iWith limited time, they all should be</i
<icommended for their work so far.</i

864
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,120
When did you go to bed?

865
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,120
Me?

866
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:13,920
About 2 a.m.

867
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,320
Are you up for this?

868
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,000
Oh.

869
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,520
There she is.

870
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,640
And... action.

871
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,200
They danced so beautifully.

872
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,040
I love Neuanaow's movements. They looked...

873
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,280
They looked mesmerizing. They looked sexy.

874
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:55,840
As for Pailiu,
it really looked like they'd planned this.

875
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,640
But now that I have to work this week,
I feel a little bit homesick.

876
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,280
But I'm happy because this is
an experience I didn't think I would get.

877
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,880
I'm sorry.

878
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,480
She used her eyes very well. Extreme pining.

879
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,480
Will you come back?

880
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,080
Huh?

881
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,360
Will you come back to me?

882
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,960
That's for the future.

883
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,680
She never plays along with me.

884
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,400
What? There's someone else here.

885
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,480
I mean... No.

886
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,360
I mean the whole crew.

887
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,040
- I see.
- There are people around.

888
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,560
I thought someone was monitoring you.

889
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,680
The whole crew.

890
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,120
Ah, I got it wrong again.
Where did "Belle" come from?

891
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,240
I'm sorry. Belle again. I'm confused.

892
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,720
Cut.

893
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,560
Why couldn't I cry? I don't understand.

894
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,160
I feel I didn't do that well.

895
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,600
But I'm grateful to Ling that
she kept running up to me and hugging me.

896
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:19,440
Yes. Like I was trying to
experience her touch too.

897
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,080
Mm.

898
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,760
Can I ask you one question?

899
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,720
Cut.

900
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,960
From what I saw, they were compatible.

901
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,840
There was this glimpse of chemistry.
When I looked at it, I was like,

902
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,720
"How can I get that good?
How can I get that good?"

903
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

904
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,640
<iAfter the shoot</i
<iit's time for Ling and Pailiu to go on a date.</i

905
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,880
Where's the photo booth?

906
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,720
Over there.

907
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,720
Oh, wrong way.

908
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,280
Come here.

909
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,640
So beautiful.

910
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,640
So beautiful. So beautiful.

911
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,440
Thank you.

912
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,680
How should we pose?

913
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,600
I'll be the stern.
I have to do this to be the stern.

914
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,560
I have to paddle.

915
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,760
I'll be the bow.

916
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:43,960
Go.

917
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,880
Let's try.

918
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,640
Why aren't we making pretty poses?

919
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,840
Why are we trolling?

920
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,640
Ling is actually goofy and funny.

921
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,520
I feel very comfortable when I'm around her.

922
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,160
<iLet's take a look at the girls back home</i

923
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,800
<iand see what they're up to.</i

924
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,920
I make Thai food.

925
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,320
Really?

926
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,000
I make...

927
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,480
green curry.

928
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,320
Do you want some?

929
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,040
Omelet too.

930
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,360
- Tonight.
- With dry curry.

931
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,600
Green curry is good.

932
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,680
Tonight?

933
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,000
- Let's make it tonight.
- So...

934
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,040
Dry curry with chicken breast.

935
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:16,880
Green curry.

936
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,640
A grocery truck is here.

937
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,240
Buy stuff from the truck.

938
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:22,880
A grocery truck is here.

939
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,560
Buy stuff in front of the house.

940
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,440
Wait for me!

941
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,600
I'll go. Just a sec.

942
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,880
- Who's coming with me?
- Me!

943
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,440
Okay, let's do some shopping.

944
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,240
Fab.

945
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,200
<iOoh, Neuanaow volunteered quickly</i
<ito come with Lita.</i

946
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,200
<iCan this be considered a mini date?</i

947
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,600
There are desserts. Want some? I want some.

948
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,480
I do!

949
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,200
- You want some?
- Yes.

950
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,160
About three boxes.

951
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,600
Three boxes.

952
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,560
But it's good.

953
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,640
- I wish you good health.
- Thank you.

954
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,840
I had a blast. Buying stuff at a food market.
I felt I got to live a different kind of life.

955
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,680
It was so fun, and when we came back,
we worked a team.

956
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,440
The chef assigned each person a job.

957
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,120
Coconut sugar.

958
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,600
- Where is coconut sugar?
- Here.

959
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,400
Coconut sugar.

960
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,840
This is coconut sugar, right?

961
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:10,240
I told the crew from the beginning
that I would make green curry for everyone.

962
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,720
<iOkay, the vibe back home is all good.</i

963
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,600
<iLet's check in with Herling and Pailiu again.</i
<iWhere are they now?</i

964
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,200
There was a river view. Very relaxing.
It was perfect for a very romantic date.

965
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,800
And across the river, we could see Wat Arun.

966
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,680
It's relaxing.

967
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,520
Yeah, it is.

968
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,440
Let's try.

969
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,920
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

970
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,800
Hmm!

971
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,240
It's good.

972
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,120
So good.

973
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,240
Chicken galangal coconut soup.

974
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,280
- Coconut milk.
- Thank you.

975
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,840
Let's eat. Let's eat.

976
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,360
Thank you. You're so sweet.

977
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:21,960
I'll get some for you.

978
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,640
I'm giving you veggies too.

979
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,000
Thank you. Wanna clink our food together?

980
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,560
Okay. One, two, three.

981
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,480
In one bite?

982
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,000
Hmm, do good.

983
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:38,840
I'm in heaven.

984
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,600
Hmm!

985
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,200
Actually, when I'm with you,
I feel today is the day I feel more comfortable.

986
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:43,880
Really?

987
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,600
- Yes.
- You weren't before?

988
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:49,440
Before today I felt kind of
self-conscious, not quite myself yet.

989
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,680
But today I'm more myself.
I feel more comfortable.

990
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,320
If I'm being honest, I felt self-conscious

991
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,680
and didn't know how to act
when someone makes a confession.

992
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,160
But do I like it? I do.

993
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,960
I like people who are straight with me
about their feelings

994
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,400
so I don't have to making things up
in my own head.

995
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:14,280
I didn't know what to expect from today,
but you're actually fun to be around.

996
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:19,640
You're fun. You're not worried
about your image all the time.

997
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,000
We can goof off together,

998
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,840
so I like this kind of vibe.
I don't have to worry about my appearance either.

999
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,160
I feel that you're the reason I'm more relaxed.

1000
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,240
- Really?
- Yes.

1001
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,480
Oh, thank you. Ah! Thank you.

1002
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,160
I like this version of Ling. It's another side...

1003
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,240
Is this a love confession?

1004
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,840
No, no. I mean it's another side
I don't get to see often.

1005
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,800
- Like you're very goofy. Yeah.
- Really?

1006
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,480
You really let loose.

1007
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,960
Yes, but at first I was tense around you.

1008
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,040
Really?

1009
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,480
But today we laughed like maniacs.

1010
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,320
Yeah, we did.

1011
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,680
I think I've counted three times?

1012
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,560
Yeah, it was really funny.

1013
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,640
It's been fun.

1014
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,440
After shooting a miniseries
and going on this date,

1015
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,040
Do you feel like you want to win again? Or...

1016
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,680
I'd like to win to get a date.

1017
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,440
Really?

1018
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,600
Yeah, I want to go on a date again.

1019
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,880
But before getting a date,
we have to get past the pressure.

1020
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,800
Yes.

1021
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,000
It's raining.

1022
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,160
Let's move.

1023
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:22,280
<iJeez, everything was going so well.</i
<iWhy does it have to rain right now?</i

1024
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,280
<iBut...</i

1025
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,800
<imaybe this is better than when it wasn't raining?</i

1026
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,680
It's not really fulfillment, but it's like
the other person makes me feel more balanced.

1027
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,760
And I don't have to be afraid
or considerate, or cares about her opinions

1028
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,440
because she shoots straight too,
so it feels comfortable.

1029
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:50,680
We went on a date with someone and then it rained.
It could be like, "We picked a wrong day."

1030
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,600
But I felt, "We didn't pick the wrong day.
We picked the right day."

1031
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,280
And there was this moment
we were enjoying the view in the rain.

1032
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,600
It was very romantic.

1033
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,640
They're back.

1034
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,760
Where?

1035
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,480
Have you guys eaten?

1036
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,360
We did.

1037
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,920
We kept you one bundle of rice noodles each.

1038
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I'll make you omelet.

1039
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,520
Not leftover. We kept it for you.

1040
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,880
We kept it for you.

1041
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,400
- I want a taste.
- You said you were good. I have to try.

1042
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,720
- It's delicious for real.
- Very proud to present.

1043
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,800
How was it today?

1044
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,560
It was fun.

1045
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,840
Give me three words.

1046
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,240
Let's go with "a good story."

1047
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,240
- A good story.
- It was very fun.

1048
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,720
<iHerling and Pailiu brought everyone something too.</i

1049
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,240
<iEveryone looks very happy about it.</i

1050
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,560
<iNow it's time for everyone</i
<ito watch the miniseries together.</i

1051
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,640
Pailiu is so handsome.

1052
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,720
- True.
- True.

1053
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,160
True.

1054
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,040
I'm embarrassed.

1055
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,200
- Her eyes...
- Look at her eyes.

1056
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,520
Wait, wait, wait.

1057
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,800
I want to get tired with you.

1058
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,600
And I still want to dance with you,

1059
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,480
live my life with you,
rehearse with you every day.

1060
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,440
You were great.

1061
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:48,960
It hurts.

1062
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:54,480
I was gonna cry with both Ling and Neuanaow.
It was all mixed up.

1063
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,520
It's a real love triangle.
Their acting was very good.

1064
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,920
I was like, "Neuanaow, cover your ears right now."

1065
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,080
I was hurting for her.

1066
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,080
THE RIGHT PERSON

1067
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,280
Kwan, why are you still here?

1068
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,400
Happy birthday.

1069
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:20,640
<iYou can watch the second episode of the miniseries</i
<i"Love Moment" titled "The Right Person"</i

1070
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:25,320
<ionly on Kantana Motion Pictures' YouTube channel</i
<iand WeTV.</i

1071
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,760
<iDon't forget to follow the show</i
<iand support our girls.</i

1072
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,240
In the crying scene, I cried very hard, but...

1073
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,280
You can cry on demand.

1074
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,360
I didn't see any tears.

1075
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:40,640
Shame.

1076
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,720
I saw your tears.

1077
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,080
- I saw them.
- I saw them.

1078
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,600
I saw it run down your cheek.

1079
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,360
We saw them.

1080
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,000
I saw them.

1081
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,080
Good. Awesome.

1082
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,760
I like these two when they danced.

1083
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,800
You two, clap.

1084
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,640
Honestly, the person in my mind is Pailiu.

1085
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,200
I want to try. I don't know if she will choose me.

1086
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:06,320
She's very popular. It is what it is.
I might not be chosen.

1087
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:07,920
Really?

1088
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,280
Neuanaow?

1089
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:15,840
I'm happy. We don't talk a lot,
but I'm still one of her choices.

1090
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,880
But she's lovely.

1091
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:23,000
In the future, I might meet someone
who can act with me,

1092
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:27,680
someone who can give and take,
someone who really understands me.

1093
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,840
I understand her completely.

1094
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:34,360
It gives me a purpose, a clear goal
of what I should do step by step.

1095
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,440
And I have to do my best and achieve my goal.
