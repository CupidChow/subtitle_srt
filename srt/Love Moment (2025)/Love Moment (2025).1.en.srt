But when it comes to actual acting, I don’t really have much experience yet.

31
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,666
I'm drawn to someone who’s cool and also into art, like me more mature then me.

32
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,000
Hello

33
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,300
You brought a doll with you!

34
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,600
You can sit here.

35
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,600
What's your name?

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,966
Nice.

37
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,900
How old are you?

38
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:34,733
19

39
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
I'm Dear, 22 years old.

40
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,600
Nice.

41
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,600
I don't know where the other girl is.

42
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,466
I see.

43
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:48,600
I saw another pair of shoes up front when I arrived.

44
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,700
I have no clue, I guess we can get to know each other first.

45
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,700
I think someone is coming.

46
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,900
True.

47
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,266
And another one arrives.

48
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,400
Wow! She looks so cool.

49
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:06,533
Where do I put my bags?

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Right here.

51
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,633
What's your name?

52
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:16,533
I'm Moniejaya Tanaryan, you can call me Herling.

53
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:21,900
Hi ladies! I'm Herling. 22 years old.

54
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:29,133
I first started out as a runway model, and after a while I began doing commercials I gradually got into films.

55
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,866
Then I booked this GL series called Reverse 4 You.

56
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:39,100
I don’t really have a fixed type, but the ones who tend to catch my eye are usually more mature.

57
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:46,000
And I like someone who doesn't talk too much. But when they do, their words have impact.

58
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,666
What time did you wake up today?

59
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:51,366
6am.

60
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,733
You?

61
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:54,433
4:30am.

62
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:56,166
Woke up to do my makeup.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,100
I'm not good at doing my own makeup.

64
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,100
But it came out so pretty.

65
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,433
Great job.

66
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:02,400
Thank you.

67
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,566
The first one to arrive.

68
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,133
How is it.

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,600
Very big house.

70
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:11,266
Really.

71
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:12,566
Very cozy too.

72
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:14,266
This is all of us for now.

73
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:15,800
What is your name again?

74
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,533
Neuanaow.

75
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:18,400
Hi everyone.

76
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,133
Neuanaow.

77
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:19,933
Hello.

78
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,200
My name is really Neua... like the north.

79
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:24,900
But the reason it's Neuanaow

80
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,200
I wanted to make it interesting.

81
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,266
So I'm like

82
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,266
Neuanaow, two syllables seems popping.

83
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,733
I'm Dear.

84
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:32,933
Dear.

85
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:33,800
Dear.

86
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,166
Dear.

87
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,000
Dear.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,200
Yes

89
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:37,166
I'm Nice.

90
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,066
Hi, Nice.

91
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,600
Do you spell it Dear or Deer?

92
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:41,866
Dear as in my dear.

93
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:42,533
Oh...

94
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:42,900
Yes.

95
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:46,500
Who's here?

96
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:50,500
And here comes another one... arriving with a giant shark plushie!

97
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:52,933
I'm Wafer.

98
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:54,366
Natnatcha Puttikittipon

99
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:55,600
I use to be an Idol performer.

100
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,400
From the group 7th Sense and Violet Wink.

101
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:03,933
When I was an idol, my dream was to be a singer... to be part of a girl group and all that.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,800
And I did it.

103
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,333
Now I want to be an actress.

104
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,033
If I had to choose a partner, between feelings and logic, I’d choose feelings.

105
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,300
because I can’t fake how you truly feel.

106
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:13,766
Shall we make room for her?

107
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,466
Let's make room.

108
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:18,933
Yes make room for others.

109
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,200
We can squeeze 2 or 3 more here.

110
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:21,933
Here too.

111
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:22,766
Maybe one more.

112
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,800
Yes.

113
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,333
There thought it through.

114
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,166
I here more people coming.

115
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,300
I hope I'm not the oldest.

116
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,333
Ooh! This time, two girls are arriving together!

117
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:37,733
You got this?

118
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:39,533
Yes, all good.

119
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,900
Don't worry.

120
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:43,566
Thanks.

121
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:47,366
That's cute, helping out with the bags.

122
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,400
This is why.

123
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,000
Hi I'm Pailiu, Kamonwarai Prajakrattanakul.

124
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:02,766
I'm currently an Idol performer.

125
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:08,833
My recent work is filming the show Chuang Asia

126
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:13,000
I was one of the 9 girls to be debuted.  And before that, I participated in the Miss Grand Pageant.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,466
I have so many dreams. Before this, it was to become an idol performer.

128
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:29,933
and now I’ve already stepped into that world. What I really want is to reach a point where people truly recognize my talent. But to get there, I know I have to keep improving and training myself, in every skill I can.

129
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,533
Hey.

130
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:39,366
Hi I'm June Lalida Ngamsomchat.

131
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:43,566
I'm currently a commercial model.

132
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:47,800
My past experience I made it into the top 10 of Thai Supermodel competition.

133
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:55,666
If I like someone, I’d probably just admire them from afar at first… then eventually go up and talk to them or maybe find an excuse to start a conversation with them.

134
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:58,066
Hi.

135
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,400
Hello.

136
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:01,400
What are you names.

137
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,900
June.

138
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,133
Hi June.

139
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:05,100
I'm Pailiu.

140
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:05,800
Pailiu?

141
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,300
Yes

142
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,166
I'm Neua.

143
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:07,533
Hi Neua.

144
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,533
Herling.

145
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:08,800
Hi Herling.

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,500
I'm Dear.

147
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,300
Hi.

148
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:10,733
I'm Nice.

149
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:11,300
Hi.

150
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,200
I'm Wafer.

151
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,133
Hi.

152
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:14,633
I'm June. I got it all now.

153
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:16,733
More coming.

154
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:17,533
The last one arriving.

155
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,733
I like her style and her pants.

156
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,200
Can't tell from afar.

157
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:24,666
And finally, the last girl has arrived.

158
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,900
Even from a distance, you can tell this one’s definitely cool.

159
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,500
I'm Lita Kaliya Niehus

160
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,666
I’m currently a freelance actress, and I also help run my family’s business.

161
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,866
My past experience includes acting in TV dramas and

162
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:42,400
commercials and photoshoots.

163
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,333
Honestly, I’m not someone who has a specific type.

164
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,966
I tend to like someone I can really click with when we talk.

165
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:54,800
I don’t have a set checklist of what they must be like — if we talk and they’re charming, magnetic, and have that special something, that’s enough.

166
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,966
I want to keep finding out more about the person.

167
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,733
I guess that's my type.

168
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:00,333
I'm 27.

169
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,800
I'm the oldest.

170
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,500
Just by a little.

171
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:02,900
Consider us the same age.

172
00:09:02,966 --> 00:09:03,766
26,27,28

173
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:04,800
I guess we all are.

174
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:06,800
I thought I was going to be the oldest one here.

175
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,900
I really did.

176
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,400
We're friends.

177
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,600
I had omelette with rice.

178
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,200
Oh..

179
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:33,966
Did you guys eat yet.

180
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,666
When I saw her...

181
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:36,533
I find her charming.

182
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:37,366
She really looks like a halfie.

183
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:38,266
She truly does.

184
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:39,766
Yes

185
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:40,400
First couple

186
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:42,166
First couple of the show.

187
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,000
Hello everyone.

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,900
Hello, and welcome officially to the Love Moment.

189
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,566
I just saw you all chatting and having such a good time.

190
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:07,333
But don’t forget why we’re here.

191
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,633
We’re not just here to make friends or find a fun on-screen partner.

192
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,600
Because each week, everyone will have to pair up and audition for a role.

193
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:16,766
And the couple who performs the best

194
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:19,433
will be chosen to film a short series scene.

195
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:25,000
Also, the chosen couple will win a special date from the show.

196
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,433
You will be able to spend quality time together.

197
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,166
You can go anywhere and do what you wish on your date.

198
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,900
Sounds good?

199
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,266
Sounds great!!

200
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,200
I want to go.

201
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,333
I know you do, but why do I see some of you looking very stressed out.

202
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:46,000
I know everyone's acting skills are different.

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,133
Some have no acting experience at all.

204
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:56,166
But don’t worry, ladies — each week we’ll have an acting coach here to help you develop your skills.

205
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,666
Introducing our acting coach...

206
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,300
Hello.

207
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,166
Hello.

208
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:01,966
Hello.

209
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:03,266
Hello.

210
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:04,066
Hello.

211
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,466
The ladies are so excited!

212
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:11,133
Everyone’s feeling nervous now, some have experience in the entertainment industry, while others have none at all.

213
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:20,400
No need to worry, the workshops we’ve prepared will start from basic acting and gradually move up to more advanced levels together. Okay?

214
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:21,766
Okay.

215
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:27,733
I don’t know if I'm more nervous than everyone else, but inside I feel really thrilled.

216
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:30,966
I’m a little worried about whether I can do it. I'm feeling the pressure.

217
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:34,966
Besides Coach Prang, who’ll be our acting coach

218
00:11:34,966 --> 00:11:41,666
Coach Prang will also be one of the judges for our auditions deciding who will land a role and who won’t.

219
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,066
Oh wow.

220
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:44,700
Oh my god.

221
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,166
Are you all ready?

222
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:47,900
Yes!

223
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,133
Okay.

224
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:51,600
Coach Prang, I leave it with you.

225
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:52,866
My pleasure.

226
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:53,900
Let's go everyone.

227
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,066
Welcome to our first acting workshop.

228
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,733
Raise your hand if you have some acting experience.

229
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,900
Show them.

230
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:03,666
Some.

231
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:04,666
Some.

232
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:11,900
For those who already have acting experience — listen up. Whatever you’ve learned before is great. We’ll just figure out which techniques work best for you.

233
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:18,700
Every technique, every bit of experience from each coach — keep it with you, it will definitely help. Alright, everyone, ready?

234
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:19,933
Ready

235
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:21,066
Great.

236
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,366
The task is simply to walk… and stop suddenly when directed.

237
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:25,666
Okay walk.

238
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,266
Stop.

239
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,366
Walk.

240
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:30,333
More active.

241
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:30,900
Stop.

242
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:31,733
Walk.

243
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:33,133
Stop.

244
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:35,166
This is too easy.

245
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:42,033
Changing it up. Now, you have to do the opposite: when I say ‘walk,’ you stop; when I say ‘stop,’ you walk.

246
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:42,433
Walk.

247
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:44,333
Stop.

248
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,333
You guys need to react faster.

249
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,033
Stop.

250
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:49,466
Walk.

251
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:53,833
Okay face me now.

252
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:57,800
Next step, we’ll have you sit in different corners of the room.

253
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:03,300
To explore and embrace your own shadow — find a spot where you feel comfortable and settle in

254
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,400
Remember this way to reset your breathing: inhale through your nose and let your tummy expand.

255
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,500
Count to four as you hold your breath, then count to four as you exhale through your mouth

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,933
Let the air flow out through your mouth, drop your jaw, relax your chin — then check your own spine: notice where it feels too tight and where it’s too loose.

257
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:32,766
Find your own center… quietly thank yourself, whisper it softly, and then slowly open your eyes.

258
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:38,366
Now...Quickly pair up. Just grab whoever’s nearest to you

259
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,100
Go go!

260
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:53,233
The moment I turned around — bam — I saw either Nice or Dear, one of them. But Ling rushed in first, so I was like…I guess I'll go with her.

261
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:53,966
How are you.

262
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:55,333
How was it.

263
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,366
What did you discover.

264
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,700
She didn't ask for my hand but I was like

265
00:13:58,766 --> 00:13:59,200
hmmm

266
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,500
I ask for her hand first.

267
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,366
Love yourself.

268
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:12,000
Even though you're far apart, let your eyes meet.

269
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,566
Share whatever you can with your partner about what you just experienced.

270
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:17,566
Share what you feel comfortable sharing.

271
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,266
What I dream of will come true one day. I keep encouraging myself.

272
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,233
For me it's keep fighting, you’re doing great...something like that.

273
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,033
Thank myself.

274
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:32,500
I thank and love myself.

275
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:40,900
For me, whenever I feel like I’ve made a mistake or something goes wrong… it feels like I can’t breathe.

276
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,733
I speak to myself a lot.

277
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:49,133
I don't normally speak to myself but to my friends.

278
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:49,566
Right?

279
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,333
Sometimes I speak to my friends and disregard my own feelings.

280
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:56,666
It's complicated.

281
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:57,900
Is it?

282
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
Your eyes are turning red.

283
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,700
What I shared was that the picture in my head is really complicated — so many things come up at once.

284
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,800
I'm

285
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:14,733
Sometimes I have goosebumps out of nothing.

286
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:24,600
When I opened my eyes, I just said that there’s so much going on — and when I looked at her, it felt like she was the same way too, like she couldn’t put everything into words either.

287
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:29,466
She just said that she’s been through similar things too, so I felt like… there was this quiet connection between us.

288
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,900
There's an unspoken understanding.

289
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,366
Keep the same emotion, but keep changing your masks — just keep your face turned the same way.

290
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:38,933
We met someone we really, really like… but we have to stay professional.

291
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,866
But if you open your eyes and see them for the first time… and they already know your name.

292
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:44,333
3

293
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:44,733
2

294
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,300
1

295
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:45,966
Open your eyes.

296
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:47,766
Hi.

297
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,700
Hello.

298
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:49,933
Hi.

299
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,300
Hello.

300
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,500
Hi.

301
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,133
Hello.

302
00:15:58,766 --> 00:15:59,566
Hi.

303
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,700
Hello.

304
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:11,333
I noticed the difference... both in my own gaze and in P’Lita’s. It felt like we were really sending something to each other, It felt like we truly understood one another.

305
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:14,333
Think of one person you like.

306
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,566
Someone that

307
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,900
oh my

308
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,133
Holy shit.

309
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,500
When you open your eyes

310
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:22,466
You can only say hi.

311
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,666
3

312
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:24,266
2

313
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:25,566
Action! Open your eyes.

314
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,333
Hi.

315
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:29,166
Hello.

316
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,100
Hello.

317
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,133
Hello.

318
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,000
Hello.

319
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:36,233
Hi.

320
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:39,733
Okay close your eyes.

321
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:48,700
And after doing the exercise together — saying similar things, looking into each other’s eyes with that same look — it made me want to get to know her even more.

322
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,700
It makes me want to do more activities together.

323
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This afternoon, you’ll have your first audition. I hope you’ll take these little bits of knowledge about truly staying in the moment

324
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:06,366
into your performance. Don’t just keep reciting lines we’re not looking for someone who only memorizes the script.

325
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:08,900
Goodluck with your audtion this afternoon.

326
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:20,400
After the workshop, the girls sat down for lunch and got a chance to chat again... though it seems the excitement still hasn’t worn off.

327
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,933
How is everyone doing.

328
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,700
Very full.

329
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,566
Good for you.

330
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,500
I meant the work shop.

331
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,700
It was very fun

332
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,466
Good to hear. Anyone extra nervous still?

333
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,000
At first, I was worried because I’d never studied acting before. But once I tried it, it was actually really fun.

334
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:48,633
Fun, right? No need to worry. We still have time to grow and improve. But remember, the game has already begun too.

335
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:54,400
In my hand right now is the script you’ll be using for your very first audition.

336
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:57,200
It’s a story about love at first sight.

337
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:59,133
Love at first sight.

338
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,866
Are you excited yet?

339
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,266
Yes!

340
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes!

341
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,133
Let the acting challenge begin.

342
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:07,400
Great.

343
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,333
But before we start rehearsing...

344
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,300
Are we forgetting something?

345
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:14,300
Time to pair up!

346
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:22,066
That’s right — everyone will have to pair up. But it won’t be that easy, because I’ve got some rules for today’s partner selection.

347
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,933
Today's rules.

348
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:28,333
There's nothing under there!

349
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:36,466
Today’s rule is this: you’ll each choose the person who impressed you and who you’ve wanted to talk to since that very first moment your eyes met.

350
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:40,200
You’ll each write down your feelings for that person on a piece of paper.

351
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,266
And if two people choose each other,

352
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,433
that pair will get to team up for this audition.

353
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:55,600
So now, I’ll have everyone go off and write down your feelings for that person on paper. Once you’re done, drop it into the box in the center of the house.

354
00:18:56,066 --> 00:19:03,866
Okay, if you’re ready, go ahead — but remember, write from the heart. Let your feelings guide you and say whatever’s truly there. This is your moment — go for it!

355
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,933
It’s pretty tough, isn’t it — having to pick someone, knowing they have to pick you back to be a pair. I wonder if the girls are feeling the pressure right now.

356
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:16,100
In that moment, I hesitated a bit… wondering if any of the seven would choose me.

357
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:26,733
I felt impressed by someone — it was like love at first sight, right from the very first moment, so I became interested.

358
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:34,533
I wanted to try talking to her, get to know her... so I wrote her name down.

359
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:50,533
Honestly, I was so torn between Herling and June. I know I seem indecisive but I had my reasons…It's hard though.

360
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:55,166
Is Herling comtemplating as hard over there?

361
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:59,866
I wrote Pailiu with a heart.

362
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:06,933
Because I didn’t know how she felt, I just wrote that today we got to do the workshop together and it felt like our feelings were in sync.

363
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:15,733
It turns out that when Herling got paired with Pailiu during the workshop, it sparked a certain feeling — and that’s what made Ling start to take an interest in Pailiu.

364
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:25,100
But we don’t know yet if Pailiu feels the same...after all, there are plenty of others here, and everyone can write to whoever they want. We’ll just have to wait and see!

365
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:30,766
It feels like I don’t even have to plan what to talk about... being with her just flows naturally.

366
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:38,366
I'm blushing.

367
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,566
Now, let’s find out who managed to pair up successfully... and what they wrote to each other.

368
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:51,133
I'm feeling a lot of good tension in here.

369
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,166
Everyone please breathe!

370
00:20:55,533 --> 00:21:03,066
Alright, here’s how it’ll go: if I read out a message that’s yours, take one step forward

371
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:08,166
But I won’t say yet whether the person I’m reading about is your match or not.

372
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,666
Alright then, let’s start reading everyone’s heartfelt messages.

373
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,100
Okay.

374
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:18,133
I can feel everyone's heart beating out of your chest.

375
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:19,566
Ready

376
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:28,600
Because from the very first time I met her, I just felt like she is a good person someone I’d really like to get to know.

377
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:37,200
And then, once we actually talked and met, I just felt so at ease. I don’t even know if she wants to keep talking to me or not but it's nice to meet you. Who wrote that message?

378
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,466
Ah.

379
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,200
I want to pair with ...

380
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:56,000
My first impression? She was the very first one to smile at me — and wow, what a gorgeous smile. So friendly, so bright, so gentle. Yay, yippee… suddenly I miss my mom!

381
00:22:03,766 --> 00:22:04,566
Congratulations guys.

382
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,800
You are now paired up.

383
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,733
I thought so.

384
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,500
I thought so.

385
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:14,366
So proud thank you!

386
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,500
I'm happy.

387
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,166
I love her face.

388
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:19,900
I love her features.

389
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,800
I love her smile.

390
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,400
That is why I felt

391
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,566
I should write Nice down.

392
00:22:24,866 --> 00:22:33,800
I like Neuanaow because her smile is so cute and she seems really friendly. I just feel like we might get along. We’re from the same generation after all.

393
00:22:34,866 --> 00:22:38,600
We still have one more pair who just successfully matched!

394
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:42,200
Only one pair left?

395
00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:45,200
Please step forward after I read your letter.

396
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:56,200
We might not know each other well yet since we just met, but while everyone else was looking around, I chose to look at you… dot dot dot… whose message is this?

397
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:15,100
First impression — we just happened to arrive together and met at the door. My bag was so heavy, and she came to help me. She was so, so sweet. Whose message is this?

398
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,566
Congratulations! you two are officially paired up!”

399
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:26,500
Can we start right away?

400
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,500
It hurts, she didn't put my name down.

401
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:44,366
Congratulations to both pairs! But we still have some who didn’t get their match.

402
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:49,600
so now I’m giving everyone the chance to choose who they want to pair up with.

403
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,900
Alright, let’s start with Wafer. Who would you like to pair up with?

404
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,200
Dear.

405
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:59,066
There's only 4 left I'll just choose the girl next to me.

406
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:00,533
Right next to you.

407
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:01,533
Sure.

408
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:07,133
Dear, just because she picked you doesn’t mean you have to accept.

409
00:24:07,366 --> 00:24:14,700
So, Wafer has chosen you — but who would you like to choose?

410
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:16,166
Will it be one of these two?

411
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:26,166
I can stay with Wafer, or I could choose someone new. But I feel like I’m the kind of person who trusts my first instinct — so I decided to follow it and pick the person I originally chose.

412
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,700
I choose Lita.

413
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:31,800
Because my letter was intended for her.

414
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,700
I see.

415
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:41,200
I feel comfortable talking with her — I think if we were together, whether in happiness or sadness, we could share every moment. Turns out, this heartfelt message from Dear was written for Lita.

416
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,766
Lita what is your decision?

417
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,566
Will you choose Dear or someone else.

418
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:54,666
Honestly, when I wrote the letter, I had two people in mind. I chose that other girl… but the other one I had in mind was Herling.

419
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,600
What?

420
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:02,766
Now it's all up to you.

421
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:09,566
I wanted to choose someone else, but she picked another partner. So my backup choice was indeed Lita.

422
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,933
Then you guys can pair up.

423
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,933
My other choice was also you.

424
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:17,966
I'm blushng

425
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,000
Too late.

426
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:19,866
Too late.

427
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:20,766
Truly!

428
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:31,300
Lita got to choose first and said that she’d had me in mind as her second choice — and funny enough, I’d had her as my second choice too.

429
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:32,733
Hurts.

430
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:34,000
The backups now pair up.

431
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,866
Something like that.

432
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:38,400
Pairing up is almost like love at first sight.

433
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
There's disapointment.

434
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:40,566
or happy ending.

435
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:44,966
But who knows...Next time, the universe might just bring the person we’re hoping for to be our partner.

436
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:46,500
Now that everyone is partnered.

437
00:25:46,566 --> 00:25:48,200
Please come pick up your script here.

438
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,500
Feel free to rehearsed anywhere in the house.

439
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:54,900
When you're ready let's all meet here.

440
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,500
Come, get your script.

441
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,900
Thank you.

442
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:07,066
I feel sad… and kind of guilty toward Herling, because I didn’t choose her, you know? But…

443
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,766
I didn't think I was even a choice for her.

444
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,300
It’s so awkward and nerve-wracking to just look at her, to stare like

445
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:27,666
‘uh… I’m interested in you.’ I just can’t do it. Even sitting close to her makes my heart race thump-thump-thump — like, is she going to notice? What will she think?”

446
00:26:56,466 --> 00:27:07,900
After the girls wrote their heartfelt letters to choose a partner, Neuanaow and Nice picked each other and became the first successful pair.
The other pair who chose each other and successfully matched was Pailiu and June.

447
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:24,600
As for Herling and Wafer, who both wrote to Pailiu, they had to face disappointment.
In the end, Lita, who had written her heartfelt message to Neuanaow, was paired with Herling instead, while Dear ended up paired with Wafer.

448
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:37,266
Before practice began, IN2IT gave the girls a special gift set — a welcome present to the Love Moment house and something to help boost their confidence throughout the eight weeks.

449
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:48,333
And now it’s time for each pair to head off and rehearse their scenes. Let’s check in on each couple and see how they’re doing.

450
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,566
What do you want me to do?

451
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,066
Kiss me.

452
00:27:56,566 --> 00:27:57,633
How do you want to do it.

453
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:01,100
Maybe it needs to be faster.

454
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,700
I see.

455
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:04,966
Or should I sit higher.

456
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,933
Maybe.

457
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:06,466
Right?

458
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,100
When talking with Dear, she wondered if it all had to feel real — or if it was more about camera angles, since she brought up the idea of playing to the camera.

459
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:19,200
So I felt that the camera angle she suggested didn’t seem very real, so I tried to figure out how to make it look as genuine as possible...doing whatever I could to make it feel authentic.

460
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:21,233
I guess I'm meeting my fanclub

461
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:23,266
More like the one.

462
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,000
Don't leave the kiss yet.

463
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:37,400
I think if I had to do it alone, I definitely couldn’t.  I just wouldn’t get it. But with her helping me, it feels so much easier.

464
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:42,900
I think right now it’s still a feeling of not really being interested yet.

465
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:49,733
Until you meet and it's love at first sight. I don't know, I need some help.

466
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:57,133
Since both June and I are total beginners. We've never read a script like this before.

467
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:05,533
If you crack my powder I'll scream.

468
00:29:07,466 --> 00:29:08,433
Then walk this way.

469
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:09,000
Can we start again?

470
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:09,366
Sure.

471
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:11,333
I don't feel confident about this yet.

472
00:29:12,366 --> 00:29:13,166
I feels like...

473
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:15,866
Do you feel the connection yet, if not let me know.

474
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:16,600
I do.

475
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,900
I'm still worried about memorizing the script.

476
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,366
I totally get it.

477
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:29,766
I'm blushing. She's so cute.

478
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:35,266
But I want to perform the scene right with her.

479
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:39,433
Did I meet my fanclub?

480
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:41,100
No, you've met the one.

481
00:29:52,266 --> 00:29:55,633
We're supposed to rehearse this!

482
00:29:58,133 --> 00:29:59,233
I'm shy.

483
00:29:59,266 --> 00:29:59,800
Oh.

484
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,300
So shy there you go.

485
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,500
Let's move on.

486
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,366
Let's start from the moment we bump into each other.

487
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:08,066
Walking time.

488
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,766
Don't forget to feel sad.

489
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:11,933
As for me I'm supposed to be very tipsy.

490
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,466
Let's go.

491
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,666
I'm sorry I was in a rush.

492
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:23,000
Okay let me sit here and you walk in.

493
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:26,733
Did I meet my fanclub?

494
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,366
No, you've met the one.

495
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:49,200
We kissed for real during rehearsal. Actually, Herling initiated the kiss first. I'm like, okay, I guess we're there!

496
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,866
There weren't any rules against a real kiss...

497
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,200
especially during rehearsal.

498
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:59,633
And she kissed back so...

499
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:02,600
How do you want the kiss to be?

500
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,300
Like this maybe.

501
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,100
Which one?

502
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:09,600
Whatever you feel comfortable.

503
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,133
I met the one.

504
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,166
And then kiss.

505
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:15,666
How should we kiss.

506
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,233
Just lips touching lips?

507
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:18,366
Let's kiss for real?

508
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,666
Sure.

509
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,133
Okay.

510
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,133
Okay let's start with this line.

511
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,366
Did I meet my fanclub?

512
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:26,666
No.

513
00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:27,566
Wait wait wait!

514
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,900
3 2...

515
00:31:29,533 --> 00:31:30,933
Did I meet my fanclub?

516
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:32,266
No.

517
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:34,466
You've met the one.

518
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:37,900
Maybe we should linger longer.

519
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,900
Take our time.

520
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:45,333
I’ve never had to kiss a woman I just met a few hours ago.

521
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:48,500
Being like okay let's go!

522
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:50,200
Let's run through this again!

523
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,766
Keep going until the director says cut!

524
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:54,500
Sure.

525
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,000
Okay.

526
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Let's get back to that line.

527
00:31:57,466 --> 00:31:58,900
Did I meet my fanclub?

528
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:02,266
No, you've met the one.

529
00:32:05,866 --> 00:32:06,666
Again.

530
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,000
Again and again.

531
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:16,566
No, you've met the one.

532
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:28,700
So many thoughts swirling around, but maybe none of it really showed on the outside.

533
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:32,300
But inside I'm screaming.

534
00:32:32,366 --> 00:32:41,466
After a while of rehearsing, Coach Prang and Jeab went around to observe each pair without giving any extra advice. I wonder what the two of them think about the rehearsal so far.

535
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:45,933
What line did we not cover.

536
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,200
Is this your hidden truth?

537
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,066
The real challenge here is chemistry.

538
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:50,366
Right.

539
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:52,600
What is between the lines is most important.

540
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,466
Because it’s really about the characters connecting with each other.  That matters even more than the actual lines being spoken

541
00:32:57,566 --> 00:33:02,733
But just now, I'm sure we've noticed. There are some pairs who might not have anything going on yet, but I caught a certain look in their eyes.

542
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:03,800
Goosebumps

543
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,366
Yes

544
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:07,400
I hope that during the real audition

545
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,866
they are not too nervous

546
00:33:08,966 --> 00:33:10,066
and forget all their lines.

547
00:33:10,066 --> 00:33:10,300
Yes.

548
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:12,000
If you forget your dialogue,

549
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,966
the chemistry will disapear.

550
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:23,966
Now that each pair has rehearsed their scenes, giving us a glimpse of their chemistry. And now, it’s time for the real auditions.

551
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:32,700
Today, besides me and Coach Prang, we’ll have one more special guest joining as a judge.

552
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:42,466
Everyone, please welcome Oat Vatanyu Ingkavivat. He’s a director, and will also be directing the short series for the pairs who get selected.

553
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,066
Welcome! Which pair would you like to see first.

554
00:33:49,866 --> 00:33:52,766
Let's start with Pailiu and June.

555
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:55,266
Pailiu and June get ready.

556
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,600
Ok.

557
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,100
Please start when you're ready.

558
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,500
Before the car gets here,

559
00:34:05,566 --> 00:34:07,133
Want to play one more round?

560
00:34:07,766 --> 00:34:10,666
Truth or dare?

561
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,600
Truth.

562
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:14,733
I'll tell the truth...three hundred percent.

563
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,100
Are you interested?

564
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,333
Like I said...I'll tell the truth...three hundred percent.

565
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,566
Don't you want to know anything about me?

566
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:21,733
and...

567
00:34:21,933 --> 00:34:24,033
Why did you invite me to your table?

568
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,133
I...

569
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,266
If you really want to know the truth.

570
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,666
I don't want to see you sad.

571
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:32,600
I don't know why.

572
00:34:32,933 --> 00:34:35,266
I just feel it.

573
00:34:35,466 --> 00:34:36,266
One more thing.

574
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,500
And I want to send you home. Will you let me?

575
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,966
Is this your hidden truth?

576
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:44,100
If yes, what would you say?

577
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:48,100
What do you want me to do?

578
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:49,966
Kiss me.

579
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,066
You're not my girlfriend, you're just pretty.

580
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:01,900
You're not my girlfriend, you're just pretty.

581
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:02,833
So.

582
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:04,500
So you have feelings for me?

583
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:11,466
She’s nervous about the role and not fully focused yet.

584
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:14,800
Did I meet my fanclub?

585
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,166
No, you've met the one.

586
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:25,733
Let's go home then.

587
00:35:26,866 --> 00:35:28,133
Cut.

588
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:39,800
I know you are nervous. Coach Prang what are your comments?

589
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:46,766
If you can manage your nerves better, you’ll be able to connect more with your scene partner.

590
00:35:49,266 --> 00:35:56,400
I’m satisfied to a certain level, but not completely. I think there’s still a lot I’ve learned from this experience that I need to study and practice more.

591
00:35:56,966 --> 00:36:02,800
I probably still need to improve a bit more, since acting is still really new to me.

592
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:05,000
Now that the first pair is done.

593
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:05,666
Yes.

594
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:08,200
Will let the director choose.

595
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,500
Wafer and Dear.

596
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:19,900
Want to play one more round?

597
00:36:20,466 --> 00:36:24,533
Truth or dare?

598
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,466
I'll tell the truth...three hundred percent.

599
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:31,066
Why did you invite me to your table?

600
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,900
I don't like seeing you sad.

601
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:36,766
I don't know why.

602
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,800
Can I take you home?

603
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,966
Is this your hidden truth?

604
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,300
If yes, what would you say?

605
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,566
Your turn, truth or dare?

606
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:49,933
Dare.

607
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:52,033
Want do you want me to do?

608
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:52,933
Kiss me.

609
00:36:54,966 --> 00:36:58,666
Not having a partner is fine — but just being pretty probably isn’t enough.

610
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,166
Did I meet my fanclub?

611
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,500
No, you've met the one.

612
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:11,166
Okay, cut.

613
00:37:11,766 --> 00:37:12,566
Thank you.

614
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,533
What are you comments?

615
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:22,200
It’s a bit of a shame — emotions and feelings happen in the moment,

616
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,266
and that’s what creates the magic between a pair.

617
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,000
I see.

618
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,500
But if we rush, it can cut short the moment that’s just about to happen — it might get lost too easily.

619
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,700
Right.

620
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:36,233
Thank you.

621
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:46,166
Yeah, we really did seem rushed — like we just wanted to finish quickly. But we could’ve let the moment breathe more, really listened to each other, and it would’ve given us so much more.

622
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:56,366
For my first time, I feel like this is probably as far as I could go — and I should be proud of what I was able to do.

623
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,066
The third pair will be...

624
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,800
Herling and Lita.

625
00:38:12,766 --> 00:38:14,466
I'm so tipsy today.

626
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,200
You good.

627
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:19,133
Yea, my car is coming.

628
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,133
Before the car gets here,

629
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,866
want to play one more round?

630
00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:25,366
Sure.

631
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:27,066
Then...

632
00:38:28,066 --> 00:38:29,366
You start.

633
00:38:31,966 --> 00:38:33,200
Truth or dare?

634
00:38:33,533 --> 00:38:34,200
Truth

635
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:37,100
I'll tell the truth...three hundred percent.

636
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,900
Sure.

637
00:38:43,766 --> 00:38:45,600
Why did you invite me to your table?

638
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:48,700
I don't like seeing you sad.

639
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,266
I don't know why.

640
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,366
And I feel like I want to take you home.

641
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,700
Can I?

642
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,933
Is this your hidden truth?

643
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:07,166
If yes, what would you say?

644
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,700
Sorn.

645
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,466
Your turn.

646
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:14,366
Truth

647
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:16,200
or Dare?

648
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:18,866
Dare.

649
00:39:20,933 --> 00:39:21,733
Sure.

650
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:23,466
What do you want me to do?

651
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,933
Kiss me.

652
00:39:32,466 --> 00:39:33,266
Sure.

653
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:37,366
No girlfriend no problem.

654
00:39:39,533 --> 00:39:40,866
But just being beautiful

655
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:43,866
isn't enough.

656
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,933
Did I meet my fanclub?

657
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,800
No, you've met the one.

658
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:17,300
I really admire both of them — I feel like they deserve it. They’re both so talented, and their performances were spot-on, truly bringing their characters to life.

659
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:18,733
Cut.

660
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:34,266
I’m actually pretty satisfied with myself — at first, I didn’t plan out in my head how it should go, but once I performed, I thought, hey, that turned out pretty well.

661
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:35,766
So I'm happy.

662
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:48,800
I was nervous because I really got into the moment — and when we kissed, I was like, oh wow, we’re actually kissing. My heart started racing and I thought, huh… what does it mean when my heart’s beating like this?

663
00:40:50,266 --> 00:41:06,500
I think this pair stayed calm and took it slow — they felt each moment, then acted on it bit by bit. It gave the audience room to feel the tension, like that moment just now when it seemed like they might kiss any second.

664
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,866
Thank you.

665
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:08,333
Okay.

666
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:11,233
Next.

667
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:11,966
The last pair.

668
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,900
Nueanaow and Nice.

669
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,000
Let's begin.

670
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,566
Before the car gets here,

671
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:32,500
want to play one more round?

672
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:36,366
This time I start first.

673
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,933
Truth or dare?

674
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:39,800
Truth.

675
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:42,900
I'll tell the truth...three hundred percent.

676
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,700
Sure.

677
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,933
Why did you invite me to your table?

678
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,933
I don't like seeing you sad.

679
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:53,533
I don't know why.

680
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,900
Can I take you home?

681
00:41:57,866 --> 00:42:00,566
Is this your hidden truth?

682
00:42:01,733 --> 00:42:03,500
If yes, what would you say?

683
00:42:04,466 --> 00:42:05,266
Sorn.

684
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,100
Yes.

685
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,100
Well...

686
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
It's your turn.

687
00:42:13,266 --> 00:42:14,800
Truth or dare?

688
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,700
Dare.

689
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:21,166
What do you want me to do?

690
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,300
Kiss me.

691
00:42:27,466 --> 00:42:32,300
Too pretty to have a girlfriend is that still true?

692
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:34,133
Sure.

693
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,366
Did I meet my fanclub?

694
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:43,000
No,

695
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,500
But you met the one.

696
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,600
What do you do think about our last pair.

697
00:42:57,933 --> 00:43:02,066
Once they started making eye contact, that’s when things really began to spark.

698
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,466
Slowly but surely.

699
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:05,733
Yes.

700
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,266
It's very interesting.

701
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:09,800
I agree.

702
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:20,600
I feel like for our first time — me and Nice meeting and working together like this... we did pretty well for a first try.

703
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,400
I just let the feelings flow.  Feels great.

704
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:37,733
Thank you so much, everyone, for putting your heart into the performances. I know many of you might have felt nervous, or it may have been your very first time, but I want to praise you all — you did really well. Let’s give ourselves a round of applause!

705
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:52,266
And now, the judges and I will take some time to discuss which pair delivered the best performance and deserves the role this time. In the meantime, everyone can take a break while we deliberate.

706
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,600
Thank you.

707
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:56,700
Which pair should we start first.

708
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,200
In order.

709
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:00,933
Pailiu and June.

710
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:01,466
Yes.

711
00:44:01,466 --> 00:44:03,466
First pair.

712
00:44:03,533 --> 00:44:03,800
Yes.

713
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,833
I felt that they were tense.

714
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,066
June's personality is quite static.

715
00:44:08,266 --> 00:44:08,600
Right.

716
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,700
It will impact her performance.

717
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:14,866
I feel like theres something she needs to unlock with herself.

718
00:44:15,266 --> 00:44:16,333
Open up.

719
00:44:16,866 --> 00:44:21,333
Bring out those real feelings — we feel that doing so will make her acting work even better.

720
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,066
I agree.

721
00:44:22,066 --> 00:44:35,266
Next up — Dear and Wafer. Honestly, if you watch closely toward the end, you can see Wafer getting shy — her face even started turning red. But the thing is, she was blushing all on her own and didn’t let that shyness connect or show together with her partner…

722
00:44:35,733 --> 00:44:38,166
She should’ve shared that shy, flustered chemistry with her scene partner.

723
00:44:38,366 --> 00:44:44,366
Instead, they seemed to rush to finish, which made it hard for us to really catch and feel their connection.

724
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,566
Next, Herling and Lita.

725
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,300
Sure.

726
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:52,566
Their eye contact was great — it really conveyed emotion, and the chemistry was quite strong.

727
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,533
Watching them, even we judges felt something… it was the kind of moment that made me catch my breath.

728
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,600
Agree.

729
00:44:58,166 --> 00:45:00,933
Nueanaow and Nice.

730
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,066
Ah, that part at the end when they sat down knee to knee and talked…

731
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:04,600
Yeah.

732
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,500
I made me start to see then connect

733
00:45:07,466 --> 00:45:08,766
more to the script.

734
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,933
They began to feel relax around each other.

735
00:45:12,533 --> 00:45:21,866
I think the strength of this pair is that, at their core, they really trust each other. Because of that trust, they could take their time and let things unfold naturally — and you could really feel it in that final scene.

736
00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:30,933
I believe all the judges seem to be in unanimous agreement today about who should get the role. So, let’s go and announce the results to the girls.

737
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:49,666
And the pair chosen to film the very first short series on our show — unanimously agreed upon by all three judges — is the one that truly made us believe they were experiencing love at first sight.

738
00:45:51,933 --> 00:45:53,100
is....

739
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,200
Herling and Lita.

740
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,800
Thank you

741
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:08,933
I'm blushing watching you guys.

742
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,166
Hey

743
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:14,266
Is this what great acting feels like.

744
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,666
Oh my god it's too good.

745
00:46:15,866 --> 00:46:17,733
I'm so happy watching them

746
00:46:17,866 --> 00:46:19,000
This is it.

747
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:26,500
Your pair made us believe in love at first sight.

748
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,000
It was really convincing.

749
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:41,933
To the other pairs — don’t be discouraged. I know how much effort everyone put in. This was the very first time and the very first day, so it’s natural to feel nervous and hold back a little. We still have many weeks ahead to grow and practice, and Coach Prang will be here to guide and help you.

750
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:49,133
And there’s still time to find new on-screen partners — who knows, maybe the person you’ve been hoping for will end up paired with you next time.

751
00:46:49,133 --> 00:46:59,066
And as I mentioned earlier, the winning pair will also get a special reward from the show: the two of you will go on a date and do whatever fun activity you want. Congratulations!

752
00:46:59,966 --> 00:47:01,400
Thank you thank you!

753
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:13,266
I was pretty lucky because Lita has experience...and I’ve learned a bit too. So when we worked together, our focus really connected and flowed.

754
00:47:13,266 --> 00:47:21,733
We clicked so well since rehearsal, so I feel really lucky that I got paired with Herling

755
00:47:23,266 --> 00:47:27,766
And this morning, Ling (Herling) and Lita have to head out to the shoot at the crack of dawn

756
00:47:28,266 --> 00:47:31,700
Meanwhile, the other six girls are just chilling back at the house, waiting to see what happens

757
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:36,533
Normally

758
00:47:36,966 --> 00:47:39,666
I only cook for myself. So it's my first time cooking for others.

759
00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:41,200
Why did it turn out like this.

760
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:45,500
Don't blame me.

761
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:46,666
First egg, just a mistake.

762
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:48,133
Then the second.

763
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:50,433
then again...

764
00:47:50,433 --> 00:47:51,100
then again...

765
00:47:51,633 --> 00:47:52,566
Maybe we should stop here.

766
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:58,500
Sunny side turns to omelette.

767
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,533
This is high is calcium.

768
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:02,666
I'll eat it.

769
00:48:02,866 --> 00:48:04,066
I drop the egg shells in it!

770
00:48:04,066 --> 00:48:04,566
But...

771
00:48:04,866 --> 00:48:05,466
It should be fine.

772
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,400
Calcium

773
00:48:06,733 --> 00:48:07,333
Where is it.

774
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:08,133
It's fine, calcium.

775
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:08,933
It's fine, calcium.

776
00:48:09,466 --> 00:48:11,333
Dear can't flip an egg

777
00:48:11,733 --> 00:48:13,366
to save her life.

778
00:48:13,466 --> 00:48:15,566
But that was fun to witness, I couldn't do any better.

779
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:22,133
How was this mornning when they left?

780
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:23,333
They were really quiet, actually.

781
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,833
Yea I didn't hear them leave.

782
00:48:25,366 --> 00:48:27,533
Got ready really quietly and left.

783
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,666
I saw Lita practicing her dance moves.

784
00:48:33,533 --> 00:48:34,700
So determined.

785
00:48:35,133 --> 00:48:36,733
You're such a good person.

786
00:48:37,766 --> 00:48:40,866
You been here a while, can you at least take the trash out first.

787
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:42,466
Where do I take the trash?

788
00:48:42,566 --> 00:48:43,300
It's outside.

789
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,066
I'm happy to just eat and then do the dishes.

790
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:47,900
Good.

791
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:56,700
I mean, at first I was just sitting around ‘cause I felt like there wasn’t much I could help with… but after a while I was like, “Come on, do something useful.” So I went and washed the dishes.

792
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,166
The six girls back at the house seem to be having a pretty chill time.

793
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:04,933
That's great! It’ll probably help everyone bond so much faster

794
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:19,500
Meanwhile, over on the other side, Herling and Lita are getting ready for their very first scene.
Let’s sneak a peek at the set and see if this shoot brings them a little closer together.

795
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:25,066
Alright… so what’s gonna happen next?

796
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:26,200
Like this.

797
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,133
Okay.

798
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,266
It's so different from the audition round.

799
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,566
It already felt real during audition.

800
00:49:33,733 --> 00:49:39,733
With the set and the atmosphere. It even feels more real now.

801
00:49:41,933 --> 00:49:43,266
And we've reached the final destination everyone!

802
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:45,733
Are you okay?

803
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,800
How are you?

804
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,800
Good, waiting for you to make a move on me.

805
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,766
I'm on it.

806
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:05,066
Her friends please root for me. I like her but too shy to make a move.

807
00:50:06,266 --> 00:50:07,566
And you guys are flirting in front of us.

808
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:11,933
We got the shot?

809
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,700
Yay!

810
00:50:16,533 --> 00:50:17,333
Next scene.

811
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:21,800
Lita didn’t really make me feel pressured or nervous at all.

812
00:50:22,566 --> 00:50:27,366
And once we really focused on the scene, we stayed in character — no breaking, no laughing

813
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,800
We totally synced up, so working with Lita felt super easy

814
00:50:32,066 --> 00:50:32,900
Kanom Jeen please.

815
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,266
I'll take 2 please.

816
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:37,166
I'll take your tomatoes.

817
00:50:37,466 --> 00:50:38,333
Sure.

818
00:50:38,866 --> 00:50:39,666
You want?

819
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,200
Here.

820
00:50:41,533 --> 00:50:42,333
Haha.

821
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,266
Thank you.

822
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,166
It's my favorite.

823
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:49,566
You like it?

824
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,466
If you make it yourself will it be more delicious?

825
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:52,900
Much more delicious.

826
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:53,766
Really.

827
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:57,200
This is already delicious, but if I make it

828
00:50:57,366 --> 00:50:58,300
I make it with my heart.

829
00:50:58,733 --> 00:50:59,566
I put my heart into it.

830
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,966
I really want to try it.

831
00:51:01,466 --> 00:51:03,500
Sure, I'll make it for you at home.

832
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,166
I can only witness.

833
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:06,900
Sure.

834
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,800
With my heart.

835
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:09,300
That's good enough for me.

836
00:51:14,466 --> 00:51:16,266
When you love someone...

837
00:51:16,933 --> 00:51:18,566
We should first know how to be happy on our own...

838
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:19,966
You have to say it like this...

839
00:51:20,466 --> 00:51:22,266
Did I meet my fanclub?

840
00:51:22,466 --> 00:51:23,266
Like...

841
00:51:23,566 --> 00:51:24,766
Did I meet my fanclub?

842
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,966
You are already beginning to feel something.

843
00:51:28,066 --> 00:51:28,333
Sure.

844
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,900
That's why you are able to say it out loud.

845
00:51:32,266 --> 00:51:32,966
Cut.

846
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,033
I only met her for the first time yesterday, but today it already feels like we’ve known each other forever — at least that’s how it feels to me.

847
00:51:50,033 --> 00:51:51,800
Do I feel it getting stronger?

848
00:51:53,066 --> 00:51:54,200
Yes.

849
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:56,133
Yes indeed.

850
00:51:56,166 --> 00:52:08,533
Even though Herling and Lita didn’t originally pick each other as their first choice, their chemistry was so good the judges just had to give them the roles. And after spending the whole day on set together, it seems like their connection has definitely grown stronger.

851
00:52:08,766 --> 00:52:28,000
For the first date of the season, I’d love something simple — maybe a relaxed dinner at a cozy, quiet spot. Somewhere peaceful so Lita and I can really talk, get to know each other’s lifestyle, what we like, and see if we might vibe enough to travel together someday.

852
00:52:28,533 --> 00:52:40,600
Then I thought, “Oh! I’ve been wanting to try this restaurant for ages — I’ve seen it online but never had the chance to go.” So I figured this would be the perfect opportunity to check it out on a date with Herling.

853
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:50,766
And for the show’s very first date, Lita and Herling chose to have dinner at Praline — a super cozy, laid-back dining spot with such a lovely vibe.

854
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,133
Thank you.

855
00:53:06,133 --> 00:53:07,966
Welcome.

856
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,466
Thank you.

857
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,100
Look.

858
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:17,700
Signature dish.

859
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:18,866
I want this one.

860
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:19,566
Been craving it for a couple days now.

861
00:53:19,566 --> 00:53:20,966
Me too.

862
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,600
Let's order this.

863
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,200
Shall we try this too?

864
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,400
Sure if you want.

865
00:53:26,533 --> 00:53:27,700
There's one thing I don't eat.

866
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,133
What's that?

867
00:53:29,133 --> 00:53:29,933
Squid.

868
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:31,200
Okay.

869
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:31,600
You?

870
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,533
I'll remember this.

871
00:53:32,533 --> 00:53:34,000
That you hate squid.

872
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,300
Anything you don't like?

873
00:53:35,366 --> 00:53:36,333
Or you eat everything?

874
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:38,100
I eat everything.

875
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:39,133
Really?

876
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,700
My favorite is prawns.

877
00:53:41,866 --> 00:53:42,666
I love prawns too.

878
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:43,566
We have to split this.

879
00:53:43,866 --> 00:53:45,133
Ofcourse don't worry.

880
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:45,866
Good.

881
00:53:45,866 --> 00:53:46,666
I'll sacrifice.

882
00:53:48,466 --> 00:53:49,300
Cheers!

883
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,333
Cheers for

884
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,800
our short series today.

885
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:54,466
Good job.

886
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:55,333
You too.

887
00:53:58,166 --> 00:53:58,966
Wow.

888
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,400
It's delicious.

889
00:54:00,933 --> 00:54:01,666
Right?

890
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:02,466
How's yours.

891
00:54:02,766 --> 00:54:04,100
Want to try?

892
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,166
So refreshing.

893
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,500
Wow.

894
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,666
This drink is very YOU.

895
00:54:10,266 --> 00:54:11,066
What do you mean?

896
00:54:11,266 --> 00:54:14,900
It feels kinda edgy, sexy, and a little mysterious

897
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,400
I see.

898
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:25,700
I remember you said you look forward to this dish.

899
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:26,800
Absolutely.

900
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:29,733
Let me give you some salad.

901
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:30,766
Thanks

902
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,000
Thank you.

903
00:54:41,066 --> 00:54:41,866
How is it.

904
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,366
What do you normally like to eat?

905
00:54:48,866 --> 00:54:51,766
Somtum

906
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:52,933
You?

907
00:54:54,866 --> 00:54:56,866
I love Thai food.

908
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,933
Japanese comes second.

909
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,300
What's your favorite dish.

910
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:02,900
Green curry.

911
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,000
The one you said right?

912
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:07,700
That you like to cook.

913
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,100
I can cook Thai food.

914
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,100
I learnt from my grandmother.

915
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,400
Where did you go to highschool?

916
00:55:15,933 --> 00:55:17,566
Oh wow your question...

917
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,466
You are going to know my life story.

918
00:55:19,966 --> 00:55:20,766
I want to know.

919
00:55:20,766 --> 00:55:21,866
I went too...

920
00:55:21,866 --> 00:55:23,000
So I can get to know you better.

921
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:26,333
non-formal highschool

922
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,166
It was during a transition period in my life.

923
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,266
Were you a difficult kid?

924
00:55:30,866 --> 00:55:31,666
Not really.

925
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,933
Nerd?

926
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:33,900
Not at all.

927
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,966
But I had to grow up fast.

928
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:47,800
I had to go out and work, you know… because my family doesn’t really have connections or a lot of know-how to help manage things.

929
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,100
in an organized way.

930
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:51,600
And that’s why our family kept struggling

931
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:52,800
for a while.

932
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:56,966
Back then we didn’t really have any money, so I just stopped going to school.

933
00:55:57,466 --> 00:55:57,966
I left home to work

934
00:55:58,366 --> 00:55:58,700
kept working

935
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,600
and working.

936
00:56:00,766 --> 00:56:16,900
We had such a good deep talk — it really helped me see what kind of person she is. And I felt like I could just be myself with her. We definitely got closer, and it was such a good chance to really get to know each other more on the date.

937
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,266
What does your family do?

938
00:56:21,733 --> 00:56:22,200
Guess.

939
00:56:22,733 --> 00:56:23,166
What do you think?

940
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:24,933
My family does?

941
00:56:25,766 --> 00:56:26,366
Here are some clues.

942
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:31,766
Sathu and Heng.

943
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,300
Related to Chinese Temple or what?

944
00:56:35,766 --> 00:56:36,600
Sathu and Heng.

945
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:37,933
Chinese temple?

946
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:39,400
Okay I'll tell you.

947
00:56:40,566 --> 00:56:42,800
It’s okay if you get it wrong — no worries, I’ll take you to see it for free.

948
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,700
I thought you’d be kinda upset about it.

949
00:56:45,066 --> 00:56:47,266
My family makes gold leaf sheets.

950
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,100
It’s like we got to spend some private time together without anyone else knowing.

951
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,366
We got to talk about so many things and really got to know each other better.

952
00:56:56,533 --> 00:56:58,333
It was very nice.

953
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:13,600
Lita and Herling wrapped up shooting their short-series scene, and then went out for dinner — giving them some real one-on-one time to get to know each other even better.

954
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:22,266
After that, when they got back to the house, the vibe among the girls was still great — no one seemed upset about not getting a role in the first episode.

955
00:57:22,533 --> 00:57:25,933
And the ones who got the roles shared their on-set experience with the others, telling everyone what it was like.

956
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:27,633
Lita come sit next to Herling.

957
00:57:28,533 --> 00:57:33,000
Right now, the girls are all gathering to watch the short series scene that Herling and Lita filmed.

958
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:34,466
Let me prepare your spot.

959
00:57:34,733 --> 00:57:36,466
So sweet!

960
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:39,466
I'm so shy.

961
00:57:39,766 --> 00:57:41,400
The girls are really pushing it.

962
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,466
Something like that.

963
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,600
Let's start.

964
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,200
And we've reached the final destination everyone,

965
00:57:46,966 --> 00:57:49,300
don't forget what I told you.

966
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:51,566
So beautiful!

967
00:57:52,133 --> 00:57:54,333
What a beauty blogger.

968
00:57:54,966 --> 00:57:56,500
Oh my!

969
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,200
That glance.

970
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:06,500
The anticipation.

971
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,766
I can't

972
00:58:20,066 --> 00:58:20,900
Oh my!

973
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,300
It's so right.

974
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,666
It's so good.

975
00:58:25,466 --> 00:58:27,733
My heart is beating fast.

976
00:58:27,866 --> 00:58:28,266
So fast.

977
00:58:28,266 --> 00:58:29,166
When they kissed.

978
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,500
Why did you invite me to your table?

979
00:58:34,933 --> 00:58:41,066
And for all the fans out there, you can catch the very first episode of the Love Moment short series....coming up next.

980
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:50,933
“Not a Coincidence” is streaming exclusively on YouTube: Kantana Motion Pictures and on WeTV — don’t forget to watch and cheer the girls on!

981
00:58:51,733 --> 00:58:52,533
Will you?

982
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,866
How did it feel when you kiss?

983
00:58:59,566 --> 00:59:01,000
I really felt into the moment and the scene.

984
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,400
I really felt real.

985
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:08,533
I didn’t look at her as Lita at all — I saw her as Sorn. Because if I kept thinking of her as Lita, I’d be way too shy to act.

986
00:59:12,766 --> 00:59:13,733
Why so shy?

987
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,100
Yes why?

988
00:59:15,266 --> 00:59:17,066
I mean, her face is just so cool and handsome.

989
00:59:18,266 --> 00:59:20,000
and Sorn is not?

990
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,166
So yeah, with Sorn it’s like… you kinda wanna make the first move, you know?

991
00:59:24,533 --> 00:59:25,733
I'm not worried.

992
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,666
Like Lita Lita Lita !

993
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:29,800
How are you so hot right now.

994
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,133
What?

995
00:59:31,566 --> 00:59:33,866
Well, in the end it’s really up to her — she’s the one who gets to choose who she wants.

996
00:59:33,966 --> 00:59:35,966
But does she already have someone in mind?

997
00:59:36,066 --> 00:59:36,866
Getting ready to pinch her.

998
00:59:37,066 --> 00:59:37,866
Getting ready to pinch her.

999
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:38,766
Choose wisely.

1000
00:59:39,866 --> 00:59:40,966
She will choose wisely

1001
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:42,700
Yes.

1002
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,266
Its hard to give an answer on the first day.

1003
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:59,700
For Lita, this is something you’ve gotta take slowly — you really have to like that person. I mean, you need to feel comfortable and be yourself with them. But if you ask about Herling… yeah, the chemistry is there, and I can feel it too.

1004
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,800
So

1005
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,166
It's a good thing.

1006
01:00:09,566 --> 01:00:22,333
There are eight of us in this house, so I kinda want mix it up — like, if the activities let us pair with someone else, I’d love to try teaming up with someone new next time.

1007
01:00:24,566 --> 01:00:27,200
Very likely Pailiu.

1008
01:00:28,266 --> 01:00:29,066
Yes.

1009
01:00:31,533 --> 01:00:32,733
Hi

1010
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,000
Hello

1011
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,700
Okay.

1012
01:00:37,966 --> 01:00:39,600
Close your eyes… and check in with your feelings.

1013
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,000
Really

1014
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:50,100
How cute!

1015
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,566
Okay, so I decision will be easier.

1016
01:00:58,933 --> 01:01:03,500
I still want it to be Pailiu
