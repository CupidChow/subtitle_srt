1
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,120
The journey of the eight girls in the Love Moment house

2
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,840
is reaching a turning point.

3
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,280
This will be their final audition for the miniseries

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,400
before each of them decides
who they'll walk out of this house with

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,360
to continue their story outside.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,360
Right now, many of you might be cheering for June,
because she hasn't gotten a role yet.

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,400
Let's see if she can win it this time.

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,080
Hello, everyone.

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,600
-Hello.
-Hello.

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,400
It's our last week of workshops.

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,960
Everyone's improved, right?

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,040
Maybe not yet.

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,800
Maybe not yet.

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,480
No, you've come a long way. Trust me, you have.

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,440
Since it's the final week, I want to confirm
what's at the heart of being an actor.

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,680
So today's workshop challenge is comedy.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,480
It's hard.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,520
Comedy is hard.

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,040
I'll go through the
theory really quickly.

20
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,040
People usually think comedy means overacting,
but that's not true.

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,640
Comedy depends on beats.
You need contrasting beats to create comedy.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,120
That's all you need because you're already good.

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,760
Now I'm stressed.

24
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:44,280
Pair up and tell a story that has never existed in this world.

25
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,720
And in your storytelling, you must use a variety of beats.

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,720
You can improvise as much as you want
since your story has never existed before.

27
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,560
Use your imagination freely. Okay? Pair up first.

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,360
Who will help your comedy survive? Pair up.

29
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,640
Can we do ones-and-twos?

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,280
So that the groups are more spread out.

31
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,560
Ones-and-twos.

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,120
Oh, today's workshop is comedy?

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,880
Actually, making people laugh
can be even harder than doing drama.

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,640
Ones-and-twos.

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,880
Ones-and-twos.

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,360
-You're together.
-What's this?

37
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,160
You're with Hling.

38
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,760
Ones-and-twos.

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,680
Ones-and-twos.

40
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,200
Who's with Pai?

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,040
Pailiu.

42
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,440
June. Okay.

43
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,840
-June.
-Come, Dear.

44
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,560
Comedy's my specialty.

45
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,440
One pair at a time.

46
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,440
Okay?

47
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,840
I'll start each pair with an opening line,
like, "Once upon a time, there was a girl,"

48
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,480
and you'll continue right away.

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,680
Your smile is suspicious.

50
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,560
While you're performing, I'll clap,

51
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,680
and throw you a word to use.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,760
Oh, my God.

53
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,000
Include that word...

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,880
-Sounds fun.
-Yeah.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,760
naturally as if you planned it.

56
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,000
No shocked faces.

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,480
Who wants to go first?

58
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,160
Point them out.

59
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,720
-No.
-Point.

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,720
Them.

61
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
It's unanimous then.

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,560
Here's the prompt.

63
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,920
Oh, there's a prompt.

64
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,200
Once upon a time, there was a rabbit and a frog.

65
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh, actually the frog's name was Lita.

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,240
The frog's name was Lita, and the rabbit's name was...

67
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,880
Wafer.

68
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,480
Oh, the rabbit's name was Wafer.

69
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,320
One day, the rabbit was walking to a house.

70
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,680
If I remember right, she walked into a house
and found five more frogs.

71
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,840
And they were all Lita's siblings.
How was that even possible?

72
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,240
Don't stop.

73
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,520
That's promising. Now, was their tone of voice high or low?

74
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,320
High all the time, right?

75
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,440
Is there contrast yet?

76
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,520
Not yet.

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,480
Gotta be brave to pull it out. Lita, think less.

78
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,680
Start talking rambling Wafer.

79
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,120
Hold on.

80
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,120
Reset first.

81
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,680
Ready?

82
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,000
Go on, continue.

83
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,040
You know what she found in the pot?

84
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,720
What?

85
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,760
All the frogs were boiled.

86
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,600
All the frogs got boiled inside.

87
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,000
So in this story, the frogs became stew.

88
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,960
The end.

89
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,800
What happens next?

90
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,400
It's over.

91
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,320
No, it's not.

92
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,200
You can't end it there.

93
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,480
No, because there's a twist.

94
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,320
Tell me.

95
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
After that she found frog stew.

96
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,920
It's fine, but she already ate it.

97
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,640
No, it's...

98
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,800
Wrap it up already.

99
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,840
Oh, yeah?

100
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,360
We were about to.

101
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,240
But Lita refused to end it.

102
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,400
Just keep rambling.

103
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,200
So I was being myself.

104
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,040
It was fun.

105
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,640
You have to help your two friends save face.

106
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,560
Got it.

107
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,800
Once upon a time, there was a girl in a cap.

108
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,640
That girl had bought her cap from Gap,
but just realized it was fake.

109
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,440
Really?

110
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,840
Yeah, she bought it from Nakhon Ratchasima,
but she ordered it from Lopburi.

111
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,720
How did she know it was fake?

112
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,640
Because after checking the item, she realized...

113
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,720
it wasn't authentic.

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,080
How did she check?

115
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,600
How?

116
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,200
Because they didn't truly love each other.

117
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,640
They were never real friends.

118
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,520
The caps?

119
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,720
-The caps and...
-Not being...

120
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,760
Who are not friends?

121
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,160
They used to be secret lovers.

122
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,640
The caps were lovers?

123
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,400
Girls, this is not a conversation.

124
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,640
I'm so confused how the caps became lovers.

125
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,480
You're telling a story. You have to understand it?

126
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,960
Make us understand it.

127
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,240
But right now, Dear's like...

128
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
"I don't understand."

129
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,200
I see.

130
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm someone who rambles on.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,840
So it came out kinda confusing
because I didn't understand it myself.

132
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,720
Hling and Neuanaow, come on.

133
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,200
I'm disappointed.

134
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,360
Once upon a time, there were thirty pigs.

135
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,640
That day I was walking, right?
Then a pig came and crawled right under my legs like this.

136
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,960
And you know what happened? I fell!

137
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,480
But I passed out.

138
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,760
Then I saw you...

139
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,840
Hling, open your body.

140
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,680
in my dream.

141
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,160
Huh? In your dream?

142
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah, you were riding a pig.

143
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,960
For real?

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,040
-You were.
-Really?

145
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,560
-And it pooped.
-Like this?

146
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,560
Oh, no?

147
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,360
No.

148
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,440
You were like this.

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,560
You know what's crazy, Neuanaow?
I also dreamed I was riding a pig,

150
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,920
but I was doing this.

151
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,000
-Really?
-Yeah, why did you see this?

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,160
No, it's...

153
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,720
-Finish the story.
-Actually my dream...

154
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Let's go back to sleep. We might dream again.

155
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,400
Or we might be dreaming right now.

156
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,680
Wake up.

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,680
-Should we slap each other?
-Now?

158
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,640
So we'll wake up.

159
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,680
Girls.

160
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,960
You're ending with "Should we slap each other?"

161
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,360
No, just to wake each other up.

162
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,240
I see.

163
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,040
Oh, to wake each other up. Okay.

164
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,560
I just rambled.

165
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,880
Did this and that, moved around like...

166
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,200
I wasn't worried about the character because I was being me.

167
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,480
Alright, watch how the master does it.

168
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,400
Go. Here comes the Mother.

169
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,520
Once upon a time, there was a young duck herder.

170
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,520
Once upon a time, there was a young...

171
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,680
Duck herder.

172
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,360
Duck.

173
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,360
Okay, correct.

174
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,520
How did that duck walk?

175
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,400
Quack, quack, right?

176
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,920
No, it walked like this.

177
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,200
Was it that badly hurt?

178
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,280
It needs physical therapy.

179
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,640
No, then what happened to the duck? Explain.

180
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,120
My duck walked like this. How did your duck walk?

181
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,560
-My duck.
-Walked like this?

182
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Guess what? When the duck walked like that...

183
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,080
What?

184
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,400
Its legs were broken.

185
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,640
-Huh?
-Its legs were broken.

186
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,080
How many legs were broken?

187
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,640
Two.

188
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
So how did it walk?

189
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,960
It used its wings.

190
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,080
Show me.

191
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,080
Like this.

192
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,880
-What if its wings were broken?
-Don't pull jokes on each other.

193
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,240
We shouldn't?

194
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,120
We love our school.

195
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,400
I wear a sarong, right?
So I go to school. We do a hand salute there.

196
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,480
You know what we say?

197
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,280
What?

198
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,400
"We won't love our school."

199
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,240
At all?

200
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,960
Yeah, "We won't love our school." So that means...

201
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,360
It means we're ungrateful.

202
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,080
Ungrateful. We love our school. In our school
we must love each other, so wanna love each other?

203
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,240
-Is that a good idea?
-Wanna love each other?

204
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,160
End the story.

205
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,880
-You wanna?
-Of course.

206
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,160
Let's go.

207
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,000
Hey!

208
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,480
Awesome.

209
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,600
Hey!

210
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,360
They managed to wrap it up perfectly somehow.

211
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,080
I'm not good at comedy
where you just ramble like that.

212
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,120
I'm not that good at. Yeah.

213
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,440
Since this is...

214
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,880
the last lesson, I wish you...
I'm not saying this just for this audition.

215
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,880
I wish you success in the future, whatever you do.
May you be loved by everyone and the power that be.

216
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,920
Okay?

217
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,480
She's gonna cry.

218
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,200
No, I won't because my mascara will smudge.

219
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,840
I hope you get to do what you love for a living,
and once you...

220
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,200
have fans, one thing to never forget is
to keep developing your abilities

221
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,160
so you'll deserve the love people give you. Okay? Got it?

222
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,880
-Okay.
-Thank you.

223
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,440
I'm not gonna cry.

224
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,640
I will miss you.

225
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,960
The workshops are over. Now the girls must be wondering

226
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,760
how they will be paired up today.

227
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,840
Hello.

228
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,480
This is the final audition.

229
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,080
I dreaded hearing that.

230
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,760
-I don't wanna leave.
-So fast.

231
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,840
Right?

232
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,760
Do you still remember the first day we met?

233
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,000
I can picture it.

234
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,400
Yeah, I remember.

235
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,360
It's like a déjàvu.

236
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,720
We were all sitting here,
but I was the one who saw the big picture.

237
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
On the first day, you were still nervous.

238
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,720
No relationships had been formed.
No one knew each other. Everyone was shy.

239
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,600
That day we asked you to write
a love letter and express your feelings.

240
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,240
-Right.
-You remember, right?

241
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,120
That time has come again.

242
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,280
This is the final pairing for the audition.

243
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,280
The word "final"...

244
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,680
-I hate it.
-Yeah.

245
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,800
-Right? It sounds sad.
-It breaks my heart.

246
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,720
Are you crying?

247
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,480
Not yet or my lashes will fall off.

248
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,440
Calm down. I get it though because seven weeks have flied by.

249
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,480
It's quite a long time to live together in this house.

250
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,080
Many of you have shared good memories and great moments.

251
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,360
So this time, I'll let you guys pair up based on...

252
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,040
mutual agreement.

253
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,800
Today's rule is the girls have to decide for themselves.

254
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,960
It sounds easy, but it's actually quite a tough decision.

255
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,360
This time will this partner help me
win the role in the final audition?

256
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,760
Or am I choosing her because...

257
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,120
I feel comfortable with her,
I've already given her my heart,

258
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,160
and no matter what happens, I'll still choose her.

259
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,080
It's up to us who we want to pair with.

260
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,320
I still want to pair with Neua because right now I feel...

261
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,200
she's the only one I want to pair with

262
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,800
Alright, is anyone...

263
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,680
ready to go first?

264
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,920
-They're obvious.
-They're clear about each other.

265
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,080
This pair is quite obvious. Some pairs are already clear,
but maybe someone might change their mind.

266
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,920
Neuanaow and Lita.

267
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,680
Yes.

268
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,760
Are you sure? Anyone wants to break them up?

269
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,720
The question is "Can we?"

270
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,800
Yeah, can we?

271
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,480
They've been obvious since EP 1.

272
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,880
Judging from our hands, I think...

273
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,440
Okay, okay.

274
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,640
Leave them be.

275
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,520
Next.

276
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,280
Anyone wants to go next?

277
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,960
-We need to talk first.
-Can we talk first?

278
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,840
Yeah, talk first.

279
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,360
Let us process this first.

280
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,520
Right.

281
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,240
Nice, who do you have in mind?

282
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,680
Honestly...

283
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,080
I'd be happy to act with everyone.

284
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,880
Whether it's June,

285
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,520
Hling, or Pailiu. Any of them would make me very happy.

286
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm okay acting with any of them.

287
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,960
So you want one of them.

288
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,080
I wanna talk first.

289
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,120
What about Wafer?

290
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,520
I actually want to pick...

291
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,200
these two.

292
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,680
Hling and Pailiu.

293
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,920
Maybe she means the one behind us.

294
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,360
No, she's joking.

295
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,480
I've talked to everyone quite a lot,
but sometimes when the conversations...

296
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,040
got deep, I could talk to them.

297
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,720
What about you, Dear? Who do you really want?

298
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,360
She's direct.

299
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,920
I've always been clear about this.

300
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,440
Yeah, she's always been clear.

301
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,320
Everyone knows. Even my fans know.

302
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,680
So who do you want to pair with?

303
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
-Point.
-Will it make her uncomfortable?

304
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,600
Say it.

305
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,480
I'm like, "Just say it."

306
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,080
-If you don't fight...
-Say it.

307
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
I'll spank you.

308
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,960
Pailiu.

309
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,880
I mean, I'm used to it, but not numb yet.

310
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,600
I'll keep fighting. I'm not giving up for sure.

311
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
She didn't pick you last time, yet you still...

312
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,920
I was heartbroken, but I'll keep fighting.

313
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,160
Attagirl.

314
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,880
She's got her heart.

315
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,160
Jeab, I have to be honest with my feelings.

316
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,960
Yes.

317
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,560
Okay, what about you, Hling?

318
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,400
I'm feeling a bit conflicted.

319
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,200
Why?

320
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,200
At first I had one person
in mind, but after some reflection,

321
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,440
I started asking myself what I really want.

322
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,120
Wait, who's that one person?

323
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,040
At first, it was June.

324
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,480
Then why aren't you sitting together?

325
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,680
-It's not serious.
-Is it me?

326
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,920
Is it my fault?

327
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,000
We were paired last week, right?

328
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,840
Yeah, we've been paired all along, but now...

329
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,160
I've started to hesitate
because I've been thinking more about the future.

330
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,000
I don't think about what happens here as much anymore.

331
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,040
I've been thinking what it'll be like once we leave.

332
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,520
And I've been overlooking
someone who's always been around me

333
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,600
but I've never noticed her.

334
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,720
When I was down, she's there.

335
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,640
Or when I didn't feel like doing anything.

336
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:44,440
When I talked to her,
she always seemed ready to, like, "It's up to you."

337
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,840
I never felt she demanded anything.

338
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:52,520
And I started to wonder, "Could this person be my safe zone?"

339
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
And who is that?

340
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,680
Not only is everyone in the house surprised, we are too.

341
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,640
But honestly, we have witnessed
some moments between these two.

342
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,040
Wafer, did you have an inkling?

343
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,240
No, but I...

344
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,880
I'm close with everyone, so I'm always
wandering around chatting with everyone.

345
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,920
That day I was mentally tired, kinda drained,
and I didn't feel like going on a date...

346
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,480
with anyone.

347
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,560
So I told her, "If you're paired with me,
is it okay if we don't go on a date?"

348
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,520
And she said yes. So it confused me,
like why was she agreed to pair with me

349
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,600
even when I didn't want to do anything?

350
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:00,720
And I genuinely wanted to help her.
So Hling must've processed that and thought, like,

351
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,440
"Why am I overlooking her?" I'm not sure.

352
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,480
And I thought, "Who else would even think like that?"

353
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,240
Because if it were me, I wouldn't either.

354
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,600
I was just ready to support her. I mean...

355
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,480
It was okay if we didn't go.

356
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,640
I just felt if she wasn't up for it,

357
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,760
I'd still be there to support her no matter what.

358
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,240
As long as she felt comfortable.

359
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,280
There was no pressure that she has to take me somewhere.

360
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,560
It was fine with me. I just wanted to support her.

361
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,800
That's all.

362
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,240
Aww, come here.

363
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,160
I'll give you the hug of the season.

364
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,920
Jeab, do it.

365
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,560
There, there.

366
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,280
Come here, come here.

367
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,760
Get up, get up.

368
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Please sit.

369
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,320
Even I thought you two were an obvious pair,
like Neuanaow and Lita.

370
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,320
But this week I'm surprised that suddenly you're hesitant

371
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,880
and want to pick someone else.
June, how do you feel about that?

372
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,080
When I was listening to Hling,
at first I was like, "It's fine,"

373
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,720
because I've been feeling that
I was pulling her down basically.

374
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,120
-All the time.
-But I never thought that.

375
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:29,160
No, I really felt that way, so I thought, okay,
if she wants to go, then go. Like, it's fine, really.

376
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,280
Yes.

377
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,200
But I'm not hurt or anything. I even understand.

378
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,720
But her answer kind of hurts me.

379
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,080
You might not feel hurt or you just say
you're not hurt about cutting me loose.

380
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,800
So I'm a little hurt when June said that
she was ready to cut me loose and pick someone else.

381
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:56,640
I felt like she didn't realize how much I tried
when I taught her or gave it my all.

382
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,480
I really gave it my all, but I'm hurt that...

383
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,720
she said she was okay, but when problems came up,
she wasn't actually okay like she'd said.

384
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,080
So I feel hurt.

385
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,720
Okay, okay, I think I understand what's going on now.

386
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,720
So, June, who will you choose?

387
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,880
My other choice is Pailiu because we acted together in EP 1.

388
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,840
And I want to perform better than the first time.

389
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,440
You two were paired in EP 1, right?

390
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,280
-Yes.
-And have you been paired again since?

391
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,200
Never.

392
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,760
Oh, so you were paired just in EP 1 and...

393
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,520
So you want to try one last time

394
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,720
to see if you'll get to pair with her again?

395
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,520
Yes.

396
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,560
I understand everything now.

397
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,560
And I see the big picture of what's happening right now.

398
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,720
So take some time to talk to each other.

399
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,320
I'll come back when you're done, okay?

400
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,560
-Yes.
-Okay.

401
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,120
At first I talked to Hling about picking you,
but it seemed you didn't really want to pick me,

402
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,840
so I was like, okay, I won't pick you
because you don't want me anyway.

403
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,400
If I pick you, it might not work.

404
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,640
You didn't seem to want to pair with me.

405
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,320
But didn't you want to pair with Hling or Pailiu anyway?

406
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,120
No.

407
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,080
-I never...
-She never...

408
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,560
I never told anyone who I wanted to pair with.

409
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,600
She's crying again.

410
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,360
Sorry. Once she starts, she can't stop.

411
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,880
Tissue, tissue, tissue.

412
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,280
Sis.

413
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,240
Guys.

414
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,000
I have to tell you something. Do you know why?

415
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,440
Because I feel comfortable talking to you.

416
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,440
Let me be the middleman.

417
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,880
For me, right now my heart is empty.

418
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,280
Right now it's up to you, Pailiu, who you want to choose.

419
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,520
Because I don't feel like choosing anyone.

420
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,080
Like, my heart's not ready. I don't want to choose anyone.

421
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,480
I understand.

422
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,840
This EP is heavy.

423
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,240
Tears galore in EP 7.

424
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,200
This is just picking audition partners.

425
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,400
No, I think everyone's already thinking about that.

426
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,160
I get it. This is the last one.

427
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,560
But now that June's clear, I'm okay with her choosing Wafer.

428
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,520
Yes.

429
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,440
Good. I'm happy for you.

430
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,960
I'm not blaming you, but those words

431
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,760
-really hurt.
-You two are hurt

432
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,840
-You both are hurt.
-So...

433
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,400
when I sat next to you and you said that, I just...

434
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,000
I realized I have to make a tough decision.

435
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,840
Eh? Pailiu, why did you suddenly walk away
without saying a word?

436
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,760
I felt so uncomfortable. Like that situation was
so uncomfortable.

437
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:12,080
My chest was about to explode. My heart was
pounding so hard I couldn't stay there anymore,

438
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,920
so I ran off to the kitchen.

439
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,520
Dear's already made it clear.

440
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,640
What if you don't get paired today?

441
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
-It's fine.
-It's fine.

442
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,880
No, I just...

443
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,040
I just wanted to show how I feel about her.

444
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,960
Yeah, you did great today.

445
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,280
If you didn't say it earlier,

446
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,840
I'd be like, "Say it. Say it."

447
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,400
Everyone kept nudging you.

448
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,920
Nice got up and followed her.

449
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,280
You can totally understand how pressured Pailiu must feel.

450
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,680
Not only because this week is the first time
many people want to pair with her,

451
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,120
but also because it's the final audition,
which makes it even more stressful.

452
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,000
I just wanted to say don't stress yourself out.

453
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,840
Just let it go, and...

454
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,200
Want some water?

455
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,440
No, I'm fine.

456
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,480
So I thought...

457
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,400
I'm here too.

458
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,720
Yeah, do this together.

459
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,280
It's just that I felt like...

460
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,480
I already thought that...

461
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,680
Wanna sit?

462
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,600
In the end, when...

463
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,120
-Let's sit.
-Let's sit.

464
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,360
I can stand.

465
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,960
No, no, come sit together.

466
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,840
Dear, you sit too.

467
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,720
Wanna use this for the vibe?

468
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,880
Kinda weird. You're too direct with that.

469
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,320
It's stressful when you have to choose
between three people, especially at the end like this.

470
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,920
I imagined that if I could keep going in this house,

471
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,680
I'd want to leave with you because...

472
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,840
I really imagined that because,
like I told you, if we got paired,

473
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,440
I'd want to go to Ocean World.
So I thought, when that happens...

474
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,720
Aww.

475
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,480
I'd want it to be you. Do you get it? Because...

476
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,400
I just feel I want it to be you.

477
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,080
But it's the feeling that...

478
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,720
But you can choose whoever, it's okay.

479
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,560
Yeah, I understand.

480
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,200
Are people actually rooting for you two?

481
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,880
-No.
-I don't know if...

482
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,000
No, no, no. Maybe it's because I'm someone who's...

483
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,280
Everyone has known this for a while,
but I'm not brave. I'm...

484
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,720
How do you say it? Too scared to show how I feel.

485
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:31,240
And too considerate. Like, I don't know
if showing it would make you uncomfortable.

486
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,120
-I'm sorry if I did that.
-No, don't apologize.

487
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,360
Yeah, but everyone kept telling me...

488
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,520
to be braver since we were in the last stretch.

489
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:48,120
So you don't need to stress yourself out because I just...

490
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,200
wanted to show you that I...

491
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,480
choose you, that's all.

492
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,560
-Yeah.
-I get it.

493
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,400
Maybe you want to be alone.

494
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,480
We're gonna step out.

495
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,400
Yeah, sure.

496
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,800
Now that June, Dear, me, all three of us choose Pailiu,

497
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,080
I figure she's got plenty of choices
and doesn't need to pick me.

498
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,600
Ooh, why are you all alone?

499
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,480
-Did you flee?
-It was uncomfortable.

500
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,680
So I fled.

501
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,320
Let's drink some water. Have you had some?

502
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,560
-There's some here.
-I see.

503
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,520
There's a glass here.

504
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,880
Water might help.

505
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,960
I'm so stressed.

506
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,920
Here.

507
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,920
Oh, thank you.

508
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,120
What should we do?

509
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,040
But I'm not here to force or pressure you.

510
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,320
I just feel that...

511
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,200
you've always been my choice.

512
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,480
Really?

513
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:00,920
I mean it. But back then Hling and I
agreed to pair up since it was almost over.

514
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,320
But now everything's changed, and when I saw the teaser...

515
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,320
I was like, why did I go in and hug you like that? Did you see it?

516
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,640
-I don't know if you saw it.
-I did.

517
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,480
So I felt that...

518
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,680
maybe we should give it another try, you know?

519
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,200
But that's what I thought to myself,
that maybe we should try again.

520
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,120
But it's up to you.

521
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,600
No pressure.

522
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,320
I get it.

523
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,440
-It's up to you. No pressure.
-I know.

524
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,760
I understand.

525
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,760
No.

526
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,320
I'm just worried that...

527
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,960
I don't want to hurt anyone.

528
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,800
I don't want anyone to feel bad.

529
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,480
But I believe that...

530
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,360
all of us are...

531
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,400
bracing ourselves.

532
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,440
Right?

533
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,560
Honestly, I'm taking a big risk, you know?

534
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
But...

535
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,440
Let's just do what we planned for, what we started.

536
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,240
Let's finish what we started properly.

537
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,720
At first I thought maybe I should leave the house alone.

538
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,960
I really did.

539
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,360
Don't think like that.

540
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,760
Hm?

541
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,200
You do it too.

542
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,320
No.

543
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I thought about leaving alone because...

544
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,280
no one picked me. You get it?

545
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,840
That's a lie. A lot of people picked you.
But you kept picking different people the way you wanted.

546
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,800
No.

547
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,640
-Jeez.
-That's not true.

548
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,920
You were the one who hesitated. You were never clear.

549
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,040
At first you picked Nice. I was like, "Okay, Nice."

550
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,840
Then you picked Hling. Who would dare pick you?

551
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,200
Who would dare pick you?

552
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,800
No, I was...

553
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,400
I was gonna pick her but she suddenly changed her mind.

554
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,400
Serves you right.

555
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,280
See? It's karma. I'm so confused.

556
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,000
But now no one's picking me.

557
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,240
Now that no one's picking me, then what?

558
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,040
I walk back into the house alone, even though I came with you.

559
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,080
You dropped other people first.
Because in the second round,

560
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,320
when they asked those picking me to step forward,

561
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,680
you didn't, so I thought, "Okay, she's dropped me."

562
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,480
I did.

563
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,760
-You took one step.
-But many did.

564
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,280
Yeah. See?

565
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,040
Did I mess up?

566
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,000
Whoa, June is finally opening up
to Pailiu how she really feels.

567
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,920
It seems Hling choosing Wafer today
brought back all of June's memories,

568
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,080
possibly making her feelings clearer.

569
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,640
Got your heart broken by Hling, huh?

570
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,960
No, no. I don't want you to fix my broken heart.

571
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,400
I just... Please don't think that way.

572
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,200
That's funny.

573
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,640
But it's understandable.

574
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,240
I really am fine with everyone.

575
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,080
Right?

576
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,040
Totally fine.

577
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,120
Then we can do ones-and-twos.

578
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,000
I just feel it'd be nice if I get to pair with you.

579
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,520
I see, okay.

580
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,160
I'm okay even if I don't get to go.

581
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,080
Are you really okay?

582
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,800
Yes.

583
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,600
Are you sure?

584
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,720
I just don't get a date.

585
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,240
You want a date, right?

586
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,160
I wanna fall in love.

587
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,120
See?

588
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,920
See? You dropped other people first.

589
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,640
No, honestly, I've had you in mind.

590
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,880
Yeah? And then?

591
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,120
I've had you in mind.

592
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,120
All along.

593
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,040
And then what?

594
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,200
But you kept going to other people, never to me.

595
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,480
Oh!

596
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,920
Whenever I asked you who you'd pick,

597
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,720
you'd be like, "I don't know. I'm so torn.
I have so many people in mind."

598
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,680
-No.
-You were never clear about it.

599
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,200
But at first, I really didn't have anyone. I meant that.

600
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,360
Then Nice and I started drawing together and got close.

601
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,840
I saw that.

602
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:14,480
Yeah, I thought she was cute, but then I realized...

603
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,640
I mean we could be siblings for real, you know?

604
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,240
After that, I didn't know who to pair with.

605
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,000
As for Hling...

606
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,000
She said she wanted to teach me, so we paired up.

607
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,800
Then she changed her mind.

608
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,400
You get that?

609
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,880
-I do.
-And I was like, who do I really want to pair with?

610
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,840
Then when I saw myself...

611
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,960
what it looked like when I was with
someone I truly saw, it was... yeah.

612
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,720
I kinda wanted to try again.

613
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,920
It's understandable.

614
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,800
Shall we?

615
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,720
I don't know how to say it,
but I don't want to see anyone get hurt.

616
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,680
So I became a coward who's too scared
to show that I choose this person.

617
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,080
Now it's up to Pailiu to decide
who she'll pick as her partner.

618
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,960
Yeah, in that EP someone have to make a decision.

619
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,280
You won't get to act again.

620
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,440
So don't act.

621
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,600
-I mean...
-Do it together.

622
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,360
That's it.

623
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,960
Because we already did it.

624
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,400
We did.

625
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Everyone did it.

626
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,280
Right.

627
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,600
Now we can act with anyone, but when the time comes,

628
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,640
use your real feelings.

629
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,840
Hello.

630
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,320
Did you figure it out?

631
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,760
Yes.

632
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,080
Have you guys decided?

633
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,880
There are four left.

634
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,760
Four left. I mean four people...

635
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,120
The last... The final four.

636
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,640
-Who still undecided?
-Yes.

637
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,480
-Wait, still?
-But I...

638
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,080
We're gonna do ones-and-twos.

639
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,880
Yes.

640
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,560
-Ones-and-twos?
-Yeah.

641
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,880
But I forbid it.

642
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,880
Why?

643
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,960
Harsh.

644
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,000
There are four left, so Naow and Lita are all set.

645
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,120
And...

646
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,440
Me and Wafer.

647
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,640
Hling and Wafer.

648
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,320
So now Pailiu has to choose between Nice, June, or Dear.

649
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,440
Yes.

650
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,200
And all three of you pick Pailiu.

651
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,440
So Pailiu, pick who you want.

652
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,520
Don't stress, bro. Chill.

653
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,360
Let's try pairing with June first.

654
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,000
-So you chose June.
-Yes.

655
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,200
At the time, I really sympathized with Pailiu.
I know she thought really hard.

656
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,960
Whoever she chose, I'd be happy.

657
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,640
Why June?

658
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,000
Because in the first round
when we acted together, we were too new.

659
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,920
So I want to try again now that we both
have more experience, to see how it goes.

660
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,160
With Dear, I already know
we'd work well together.

661
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:00,720
Nice too. She's talented.
I acted with her and she was a great acting partner.

662
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,520
And with June, from the first time, I feel like I want to...

663
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,480
improve on that.

664
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,680
Make it better.

665
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,160
Yes.

666
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,080
I feel like maybe she's had
feelings for me from the beginning.

667
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,200
It gave me hope right away.

668
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,800
It's like...

669
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:25,000
exciting and it made me think,
why didn't I choose her sooner? What was I even doing?

670
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:30,280
Even though Pailiu said she chose June this time
to improve her own acting,

671
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,520
I wonder if there are feelings involved.

672
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,640
Why does the atmosphere feel so tense?

673
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,600
Do you know the script we'll audition
with today is a romantic comedy?

674
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,320
You guy were just crying and stressed out.

675
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,400
The person you're paired with today
might not be the one leave the house with.

676
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,560
Or maybe you won't leave holding anyone's hand at all.

677
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,760
Let's focus on the present.

678
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,560
Alright, come get your script with your partner.

679
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,520
Lita and Neuanaow are still
together with no one trying to cut in.

680
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,920
And Hling and Wafer chose each other,
which surprised everyone.

681
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,960
Pailiu decided to pick June again today,

682
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,000
leaving Dear and Nice as the remaining two who had to pair up.

683
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,040
They've shed liters of tears,

684
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,200
but the girls have to switch modes quickly

685
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,400
to rehearse a romantic comedy.

686
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,280
And today's challenge is that it's not an ordinary rom-com.

687
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,520
It's a period fantasy.

688
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,400
Aside from acting skills,

689
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,720
the language in this script is definitely
a big challenge for everyone.

690
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,840
I'm still thinking... like, how goofy should I be?

691
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,800
Just act confused like you were just now.

692
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,560
Pailiu.

693
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Just act confused like you were just now.

694
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,600
Let's read through the script,
then we'll get into this part.

695
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,880
-But this part's hard.
-Which part?

696
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,920
Do I have to act it out?

697
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,160
And you push me, right?

698
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,200
And then…

699
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,360
Ms. Yoong.

700
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,560
Farewell.

701
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,280
Ms. Yoong?

702
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,480
Ms. Yoong!

703
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,400
Yeah, that was great. Perfect.

704
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,520
Do it like that.

705
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,360
The end. Perfect.

706
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,920
Hey, you got better at acting.

707
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,720
Jeez.

708
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,400
You'll win this time.

709
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,520
You'll win this time.

710
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,760
I wanna act with you.

711
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,160
-Please.
-You'll win.

712
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,240
Let me have one.

713
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:29,960
Sure.

714
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,040
Let's go. Which part?

715
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:41,760
Hello, my name is Tia.
I'm 22 years old and a senior undergrad.

716
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,880
I was on a field trip with my friends.

717
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,400
Let me change something. Make it chattier at the start.

718
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,640
-Chattier?
-Try saying, "Hi, I'm Tia."

719
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,960
Hello, my name is Tia.
I'm 22 years old and a senior undergrad.

720
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,640
The light.

721
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,760
Is that the light that brought you here?

722
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,080
When you say, "That light," keep your eyes fixed on it.

723
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,040
Hold your gaze, June. Try it.

724
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,160
-That light.
-Hope.

725
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,840
Is that hope in your eyes?

726
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,520
The light.

727
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,000
Is that the light that brought you here?

728
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,680
Yes.

729
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,400
Then you must hurry back.

730
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,880
I won't, Miss.

731
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,880
Run.

732
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,000
If you're not safe, I'm not leaving.

733
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,320
That was good. Make it firmer. "I won't, Miss."
Try using a firm voice.

734
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,000
I won't, Miss. If you're not safe, I'm not leaving.

735
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,320
These aren't words we use in daily life,
so it was really hard for me.

736
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,240
But once I tried it, it was fun.

737
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,000
And the biggest surprise was June.

738
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,520
Ms. Yoong.

739
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,120
Ms. Yoong.

740
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,040
-Like this?
-Yeah.

741
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,040
You're pushed, right? So it's like...

742
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,440
"Ms. Yoong!"

743
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,800
"No!"

744
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,920
"No!" And...

745
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,120
Then...

746
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,920
I see.

747
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,880
"Ms. Yoong?" Something like that.

748
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,880
Yeah, like you don't wanna leave.

749
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,480
"I'm not going!"

750
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,240
"I'm not going!"

751
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,440
I don't know.

752
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,520
Got it, got it.

753
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,760
Great job.

754
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,600
Great.

755
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,880
My lips are so dry.

756
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,120
I'm starting to have it memorized,
but the words still don't flow in my mouth.

757
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,880
Want some water?

758
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,440
Thank you.

759
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,280
"You may leave."

760
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,280
"From now..."

761
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,160
"Secure the area."

762
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,600
"So I can't let it go."

763
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,120
Ask ChatGPT for me.

764
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,840
For synonyms of "lifestyle"?

765
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,920
The word "lifestyle."

766
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,400
Ask for old-fashioned words similar to "lifestyle."

767
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,880
"Lifestyle."

768
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,400
You seem a bit crazy.

769
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,920
That was good. Your reactions were on point.

770
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,160
Don't change your voice. Use your real voice.

771
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,440
I think you're kind of crazy.

772
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,200
It's not surprising.

773
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,280
No. I don't think I'm surprised anymore.

774
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,960
You're definitely not a prisoner
sent by the Hanthawaddy kingdom.

775
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,360
Are you trying to say "kalamang" or "kramang"?

776
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,360
I'm trying to say "kramang."

777
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,320
-Yeah, correct.
-I thought of "kalamang."

778
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,280
Yes, correct.

779
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,760
When she says "kramang," you misunderstand.

780
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,040
I don't understand.

781
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,120
-"What kalamang?"
-So you're like, "What kalamang?"

782
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,440
There's no kalamang here. Something like that.

783
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,560
Not too strong, right?

784
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,440
Yes, keep it light, like a
bonus. It should be subtle.

785
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,400
Then you feel resigned. You can sigh quietly.

786
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah, like you're talking to an idiot. Yeah.

787
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,440
Dear, your acting flows better.
You just need to work on your reactions.

788
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,840
Like, "What does that mean?"

789
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,800
Then go to the next part.

790
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,800
The next part was good.
Try scene seven. The one in the forest. "Run!"

791
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,560
Nice, you stay here. Alright, one...

792
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,440
It's confusing now.

793
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,600
One, two, three.

794
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,440
You must leave this place.

795
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,240
No, I'll stay with...

796
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,040
-I'll stay...
-You can't. You must leave this place right now.

797
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,120
They're coming.

798
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,040
No, I'll stay until you're safe.

799
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,320
You can't.

800
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,920
Hurry back home.

801
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,120
This place is no longer safe for you.

802
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,120
I reacted too strongly.

803
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,840
I reacted like slapstick comedy.

804
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,640
At first I was like, "Hey! Hey!"

805
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,640
But Teacher said not to go that hard.

806
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,720
Just make it cute and a bit goofy.

807
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,720
Yes.

808
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,840
When I'm home, I don't really do anything.
I shoot videos and post it online sometimes.

809
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,160
I don't do chores. Our housekeeper does everything.

810
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,680
You see? When the lines are long,
if you deliver them all in the same way,

811
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,040
it ends flat. You just delivered them,
like, "I'm like this, like that."

812
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,000
Try...

813
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,280
-switching up more.
-Really?

814
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,520
When the dialogue is hard, you get stuck. Listen.

815
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,640
The harder the dialogue,
the stronger your emotion needs to be.

816
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,760
-Got it?
-But today we're tired.

817
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,600
Yeah, I know you're all worn out.

818
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,160
-I can't.
-You're done.

819
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
Push through it.

820
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,840
Go.

821
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,320
Come on, you can do it.

822
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,160
Sometimes I post dance videos online.

823
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,600
As for our chores, our housekeeper does them all.

824
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,440
As for my hobbies, I cook sometimes and I love snacks.

825
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,640
And I...

826
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,480
What are you rambling about?

827
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,240
You don't make any sense.

828
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,680
I definitely struggle with the language.

829
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:24,440
So I find it challenging and quite hard
given the short time we have.

830
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,280
I'll make you look pretty.

831
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Do it.

832
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,480
Let's read through it.

833
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,760
It's Tia. Say the line.

834
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,880
Ms. Yoong.

835
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,240
No!

836
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,760
Ms. Yoong!

837
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,240
Ms. Yoong!

838
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,080
-Farewell.
-We're so serious.

839
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,040
Ms. Yoong!

840
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,880
Ms. Yoong!

841
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,520
Let's do it like this.

842
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,880
Since it's a rom-com.

843
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,160
You play the character who rambles.

844
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,160
Sure.

845
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,800
You can be yourself.

846
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,520
She really rambles.
Suddenly she talks about home. I'm confused.

847
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,320
This is really you.

848
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,920
"Oh, and usually, I just stay home,
watch movies and listen to music." You know what I mean?

849
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,520
Oh, got it. Just be me.

850
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,360
Chatty vibes.

851
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:34,240
When I rehearsed with Lita, I was super chill
because my lines were everyday speech. And...

852
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,560
she's like me, just rambling on and on.

853
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,840
My lines weren't hard, but Lita got really stressed.

854
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,320
I'm here.

855
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,520
-Teacher.
-Mama.

856
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,240
It's hard because it's..

857
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,960
But you usually enunciate.
If you enunciate, you'll be fine.

858
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,080
-I played a slave in a period drama once.
-Yeah.

859
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,000
I feel you must've had done that.

860
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,440
But it took me a whole week
to memories lines from a period drama.

861
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,800
Just memorize the keywords. Improvise the rest.

862
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,560
You can't memorize it 100% anyway.

863
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,280
Yeah, don't focus on... Perform for me.

864
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,240
Get up, girls. Can you get up?

865
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,680
It's not surprising if
you don't understand,

866
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,600
-because I'm from...
-Oh, she hits the stool too, right?

867
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,800
-You know "hit the stool"?
-Like...

868
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,160
Hit.

869
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,320
While sitting.

870
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,400
Yes, exactly.

871
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,720
As for my hobbies, I love cooking
and I love snacks. I love...

872
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,280
What are you rambling about? You don't make any sense.

873
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:36,600
We did quite well. Her delivery was good.
It was cute too when we rehearsed together.

874
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,320
I can't just leave you...

875
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,880
I can't just leave you like this.

876
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,720
Run and find your way back home.

877
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,240
Understand the script and don't focus on what to say...

878
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,680
-Yes.
-exactly, but...

879
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,720
Try to connect.

880
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,320
Try to keep the ancient tone.

881
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,600
-Keep the character.
-Yes.

882
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,000
In comedy, you act within your character,
what she's capable of.

883
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,720
Today's script is really hard.

884
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,440
But everyone's determined to do their best.

885
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,120
Because today is also the final audition.

886
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,680
Especially for June, the only one who's never been
chosen for the miniseries or gone on a date.

887
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,120
Macarons from...

888
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,080
I'm under so much pressure.
I'm probably the most stressed in the house

889
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:24,480
because it's ending soon.
And everyone else has improved. But what about me?

890
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,400
I want to go too. I want to go on a date.
I want to get out of the house and have fun. I wanna go...

891
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,000
somewhere with her, you know?

892
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:41,040
And the script for week seven's audition,
which is the final audition of the season,

893
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,360
is called "Because Love Calls."

894
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,320
It tells a story of Tia, an undergrad who accidentally
travels back in time to the Ayutthaya era

895
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,600
and falls in love with a noblewoman called Ms. Yoong.

896
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,760
The mood and tone of this story must be romantic comedy.

897
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,800
So not only do the girls have to memorize
long dialogues with an unfamiliar linguistic style,

898
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:07,040
they also have to make the judges smile,
which is no easy task.

899
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,480
This is the final audition.

900
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,120
And today, besides me and Teacher Prang,

901
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,720
we also have a very special guest judge.

902
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,640
You guys probably know him very well.

903
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,240
Please give a round of applause to Poramet Sukontakajorn.

904
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,440
Hello.

905
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,880
Hello, hello, hello.

906
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,880
You guys know him well.

907
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:36,520
He's the producer of this show and the director
of the miniseries on "Love Moment."

908
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:41,600
Today, he'll be joining as a judge and directing this story.

909
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,360
-Choose.
-Right away?

910
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,040
Which pair you'd like to see first.

911
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,280
Today is the final audition.

912
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,760
Do your best.

913
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,200
Unclutter your mind for now.

914
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,600
Just focus on this performance.

915
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,560
Okay then.

916
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,000
I want to see Dear and Nice first.

917
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,200
Who exactly are you?

918
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,200
My name is Tia.

919
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,640
I'm 22. I'm a senior undergrad.

920
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,320
I came to Ayutthaya on a field trip with my friends,

921
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,680
but I got separated from them.
Then there was a flash of light.

922
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,920
I walked into it and fainted. When I woke up, I saw all of you.

923
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,240
Are you tired from talking so much?

924
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,320
I didn't understand a single word you said.

925
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,440
Oh, it's not surprising that you don't understand

926
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,760
because I'm from the future, hundreds of years from now.

927
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,480
My lifestyle there... No, my way of life
was totally different from people in this era.

928
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,000
After listening to you,

929
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,160
if I think you are a prisoner of war,

930
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,280
I would be wrong.

931
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,240
The general of Hanthawaddy must be a fool if he sent you here.

932
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,840
Are you calling me stupid?

933
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,320
Yes.

934
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,440
No.

935
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,440
I mean...

936
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,920
Never mind.

937
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,240
Anyway,

938
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,440
stay here for now.

939
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,440
If you don't stay in the kitchen,

940
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,600
I'll capture you as a prisoner.

941
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,520
That's fine. I'll stay in the kitchen.

942
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,120
But how long do I have to stay here?

943
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,600
You told me

944
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,720
that light had brought you here.

945
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,000
If you encounter that light again,

946
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,720
it might be your way home.

947
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,240
What kalamang?

948
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,960
What did I say?

949
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,320
You said "kalamang."

950
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,960
I said "kramang."

951
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,560
Whatever a kalamang is, I don't want to know.

952
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,840
You mean a laundry basin?

953
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,800
You're going to do laundry?

954
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,920
No, Miss.

955
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,440
Then go take care of your chores. Come see me later.

956
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,280
Go back.

957
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,040
No, Ms. Yoong.

958
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,560
Go back.

959
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,320
No, I'm staying with you.

960
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,600
You can't. You have to go back. You have to go back.

961
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,640
Ms. Yoong...

962
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,800
It's already too late.

963
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,320
-No, Ms. Yoong.
-It's where you belong.

964
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,480
You'll be safe there.

965
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,000
-No, I'm gonna stay with you.
-Go back.

966
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,400
Go back! Go back!

967
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,440
No, Ms. Yoong!

968
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,080
Cut.

969
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,840
How was that?

970
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,800
What I really liked was that...

971
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,680
Dear, your improvisation is spot on.

972
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,480
When you improvise, you know exactly
what to say and it's spot on.

973
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,240
Your body flows, so everything feels smooth and natural.

974
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,800
Meanwhile, Nice, in the second scene,
you're starting to get the hang of it.

975
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,920
I think you're better in dramatic or emotional scenes.

976
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,520
Great job.

977
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:46,920
Thank you.

978
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,680
Honestly, I think I gave it my all.
I'm happy and had fun with Dear.

979
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:58,360
Like in the past episodes, every time
I acted with her, we always had fun together.

980
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,480
Which pair should go next?

981
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,800
Lady Her and Wafer, please.

982
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,960
-"Lady Her and Wafer"
-Awesome.

983
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,440
Where did you come from?

984
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,080
Um, hello. My name is Tia. I'm 22. I'm an undergrad.

985
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,760
I went on a field trip to Ayutthaya
and couldn't catch up with my friends.

986
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,000
Then suddenly there was this bright light,
and when I woke up, I was here.

987
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,680
I saw you here. I don't even know how I got here.

988
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,040
What are you rambling about?

989
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,800
You don't make any sense.

990
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,760
Actually...

991
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,680
I...

992
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,520
I mean, I...

993
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,080
I came from a hundred years in the future.

994
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,280
My lifestyle just...

995
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,400
It just doesn't go well in this era.

996
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,640
So you probably don't understand me much.

997
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,640
That light!

998
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:50,840
That light...

999
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,920
is your way home, is it not?

1000
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,040
Hurry and go back.

1001
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,520
No! I'll stay here with you.

1002
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,760
-I'll stay until you're safe.
-You fool.

1003
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,800
If there's a way home, you must hurry.

1004
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,320
No! I'm staying with you.

1005
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,880
You're not safe yet. I'm staying here.

1006
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,600
Why don't you go home?

1007
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,680
Thank you very much.

1008
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,360
But this time I can't be selfish.

1009
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,400
I'm worried about you as much.

1010
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,200
If it's truly fate,

1011
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,640
we shall certainly meet again.

1012
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,560
No, Ms. Yoong.

1013
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,320
Run.

1014
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,080
Run!

1015
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,360
No.

1016
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,240
Go now.

1017
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,440
Farewell.

1018
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,640
Ms. Yoong!

1019
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,880
Cut.

1020
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,360
You almost made me laugh, Wafer.

1021
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,960
I don't know if it's because I looked at your face.

1022
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,160
The timing between you two.

1023
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,120
But something's missing.

1024
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,760
It still felt too big for me. It could be smoother.

1025
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:02,920
Great job.

1026
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,800
The mood and tone of this episode are comedy, right?

1027
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,880
But there has been some drama.

1028
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:15,160
Wafer and I were crying so hard earlier,
so it's kind of hard to switch to comedy.

1029
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,320
Like our minds still have
unfinished business with some people.

1030
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,400
Which pair is next, Met?

1031
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,560
Let's go with...

1032
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,520
June and Pailiu.

1033
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,200
June and Pailiu, please.

1034
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:41,960
Hello, my name is Tia. I'm 22 years old.
I'm a senior undergrad.

1035
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:47,400
I came on a field trip to Ayutthaya,
and I couldn't catch up with my friends.

1036
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,440
Suddenly, there was a flash of light.

1037
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,240
Then I woke up and found myself here.

1038
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,200
And I met everyone here.

1039
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,400
Hmm, but I don't really know how to do anything.

1040
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,640
I eat, watch movies, listen to music,
and post some dance videos.

1041
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,560
Wanna see them?

1042
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,880
Dance videos.

1043
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:08,960
Like dancing.

1044
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,760
Dancing.

1045
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,280
Lisa's dance.

1046
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,040
Lisa.

1047
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,400
And…

1048
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,480
Oh, hobbies.

1049
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,760
Mine are…

1050
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,080
cooking,

1051
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,320
eating snacks… burgers…

1052
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,480
macarons, cheese macarons.

1053
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:31,000
Hey, what on earth are you babbling about?
You don't make any sense.

1054
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:32,920
I'm sorry.

1055
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,600
It's not surprising that you don't understand.

1056
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,760
Because I'm from the future hundreds of years ago.

1057
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,160
No, hundreds of years from now.

1058
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,600
And my lifestyle...

1059
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:52,040
My way of life there is completely different from here.

1060
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,560
From now on, you'll have to live here.

1061
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,840
Here?

1062
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,720
And what will I do?

1063
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,000
I'd rather go home.

1064
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,280
Didn't you say you can cook?

1065
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,840
Then...

1066
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,200
you will work in the kitchen.

1067
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,560
But I don't want to.

1068
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,280
Run.

1069
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,760
No, if you're not safe, I'm not going anywhere.

1070
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,720
Run. You have to find your way home.

1071
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:28,840
I won't.

1072
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,120
Go now.

1073
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,520
That light…

1074
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:37,920
The light.

1075
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,040
Is that the light that brought you here?

1076
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,480
Yes.

1077
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,320
Then hurry back.

1078
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,280
No.

1079
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,240
Go back.

1080
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,360
I'm not going if you're still in danger.

1081
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,440
You fool.

1082
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,920
You have a chance to go home. Why are you not hurrying back?

1083
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,600
No.

1084
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,600
Thank you very much.

1085
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,720
But I can no longer be selfish.

1086
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,240
If fate truly binds us, we shall certainly meet again.

1087
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,280
No! Ms. Yoong!

1088
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,720
Farewell.

1089
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,000
No!

1090
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,160
Cut.

1091
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,480
June, I feel like you unlocked something
in yourself today with comedy.

1092
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,760
Which I find more charming.

1093
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,840
You're so much better than before.

1094
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:53,040
As for Pai, I love the tone of voice you chose.

1095
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,320
You made me want to keep watching to see what you'd do next.

1096
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,960
Great job, both of you.

1097
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,120
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1098
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,960
I think we've got a real shot,
because June was really amazing.

1099
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,400
I... I was honestly surprised by her.

1100
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,360
I think her audition was even better than the rehearsal.

1101
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,840
You're the last pair.

1102
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,080
Lita and Pailiu.

1103
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,320
No, Lita and Neuanaow, the last pair.

1104
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,400
Or...

1105
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,480
Allow me to introduce myself.

1106
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,680
My name is Tia.

1107
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,720
I'm 22 years old.

1108
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,440
Right now, I'm a sophomore.

1109
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:28,800
Well…

1110
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,080
I'll tell you what happened today.

1111
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,520
I was on a field trip to Ayutthaya with my friends.

1112
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,000
But I've got short legs. After a while, I fell behind.

1113
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,960
I mean I couldn't catch up with them.

1114
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,120
Sorry, I'm not used to meeting new people.

1115
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,440
I'm talking too much.

1116
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,560
I fell behind. And...

1117
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,920
suddenly there was this flash of light.

1118
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,080
Like a UFO.

1119
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:52,960
And then…

1120
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,560
when I woke up,

1121
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,200
I'm here.

1122
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,520
But…

1123
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,680
What are you rambling about?

1124
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,320
You don't make any sense.

1125
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,080
No wonder you don't understand.

1126
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,920
Because I'm from hundreds of years in the future.

1127
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,800
Ms. Yoong.

1128
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,280
Run away.

1129
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,800
No!

1130
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,240
I said run away.

1131
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,320
If you're not safe,

1132
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,640
I'm not leaving.

1133
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,280
Find your way back.

1134
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:31,640
Run.

1135
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,000
That light is your way home, is it not?

1136
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,160
Go now.

1137
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,120
No!

1138
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,560
I'm not going back if you're not safe. I won't.

1139
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,280
Thank you for your kindness.

1140
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,120
But I can't think only of myself.

1141
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,200
If it's truly fate,

1142
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,160
we shall certainly meet again.

1143
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,120
Farewell!

1144
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,120
Cut.

1145
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,320
It got away, like...

1146
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,480
I was about to get emotional.

1147
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:14,960
It became...

1148
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,720
It went the wrong way. The mood of the story is wrong.

1149
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:24,000
But overall, I think your chemistry
keeps getting better and better.

1150
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,560
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1151
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,480
Thank you.

1152
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,520
Thank you.

1153
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:36,040
I was so nervous.
I kept thinking, "What if I forget my lines?"

1154
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,680
I was scared I'd say the wrong words
since it's a period piece.

1155
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,520
But when we started, I let all of that go and did my best.

1156
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,880
We can really see everyone's progress this time around,

1157
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,120
but in the end, only one pair will get the roles.

1158
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,960
Let us three discuss it first.
We'll call you in for the results.

1159
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,040
That was the final round of auditions.
How were they, Teacher Prang, Met?

1160
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,120
The first pair, I feel like…

1161
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,160
they tried too hard to be funny
to the point I didn't know what they were doing.

1162
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,640
Like, what's the story about? I was totally lost.

1163
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,280
They can be funny within their characters.

1164
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,160
Wafer and Hling.

1165
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,800
What do you think?

1166
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,640
Overall, they were okay.

1167
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,200
But they didn't...

1168
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,400
impressed me, I guess.

1169
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,120
They both seemed exhausted.

1170
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,360
Like their energy was drained,
so the joy of acting wasn't there.

1171
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,440
Even though I believe they could do it
with the potential they have.

1172
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,080
Next, we have Pailiu and...

1173
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,400
June.

1174
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,680
Right. How were they?

1175
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,640
I was actually surprised by June.

1176
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,440
She's usually very quiet,

1177
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,080
but today she was quiet in a way in the way that fit the role.

1178
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,680
Just seeing her face made me smile.

1179
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,920
And Pailiu keeps improving every time.

1180
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,960
I really felt it today.

1181
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,120
A huge leap in her development.

1182
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,640
Yes, she's kept getting better every day.

1183
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,040
And this week I still think she can go far.

1184
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,240
She can adapt to all types of actors.

1185
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,880
With someone like Pailiu,
she can take and respond to all kinds of deliveries.

1186
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,320
So I feel that's her true strength.

1187
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,800
And like Met said, she'll definitely go far.

1188
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,200
And the last pair, Neuanaow and Lita.

1189
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,920
I don't understand their interpretation.

1190
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,480
But I feel they were off the mark in a different way.

1191
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,600
This pair is the most natural.

1192
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:44,680
Because Lita looks very Thai,
while Neuanaow looks very modern.

1193
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:49,960
Her mannerisms, she's super modern.
But they over-planned the performance.

1194
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,160
So who should we choose today?

1195
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,480
I think we're all on the same page.

1196
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,840
Let's call the girls in.

1197
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:03,440
We've reached a conclusion on
who will get the roles for this final round.

1198
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,400
But I want to say that every one of you did well.

1199
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,720
You have improved much more than
you had in the previous weeks.

1200
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,440
But of course it's not perfect.

1201
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,200
There were some mistakes.
Maybe some of you had things on your mind today.

1202
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,960
But today one person really surprised all the judges.

1203
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,480
We didn't think she would pull it off.

1204
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,640
But...

1205
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,040
she did.

1206
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,920
So the pair who won the roles today is…

1207
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,000
June and Pailiu.

1208
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,560
I've been waiting to hear this.

1209
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,640
-Pailiu, thank you.
-You got it.

1210
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,520
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

1211
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,320
June has really improved.

1212
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:47,560
I was so happy. I turned to hug Pailiu.
I said, "Thank you, Pailiu. I got this because of you."

1213
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,200
You truly earned this yourself.

1214
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,840
It's not like we gave it to you
just because it's the last round.

1215
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,960
Because there were parts you weren't perfect,

1216
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,520
but there were parts that showed us that
this character fits you best.

1217
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,680
-Got it.
-Congrats.

1218
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,280
Thank you. Thank you.

1219
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,280
Great job. Great job.

1220
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,680
I'm so happy today.

1221
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,160
Stand up and give each other a hug.

1222
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,280
I'm gonna cry.

1223
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,240
Leave all the past disagreements behind you.

1224
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,200
Okay?

1225
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,920
You can talk to each other. You're good now.

1226
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,880
Make up, make up.

1227
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,880
Make up, make up.

1228
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,360
Come on, everyone, group hug.

1229
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,760
We're all friends here.

1230
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,000
Great job.

1231
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,560
Congratulations.

1232
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,320
Don't cry.

1233
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,760
Be careful with your eyelashes.

1234
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,400
Your eyelashes may fall off.

1235
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,640
They're magnetic ones.

1236
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,000
Thank you.

1237
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,920
The crew's treating us to a nice meal today.

1238
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,720
Yes.

1239
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,480
Sit down first, sit down. Let's wrap up the show properly.

1240
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:02,840
And the pair who got the roles today
will also go on a date by the sea.

1241
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,200
A very special date by the sea.

1242
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:15,360
Have fun on your date.
And next week will be our final week together.

1243
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,960
We'll find out who leaves the house with whom.

1244
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,720
See you all next week.

1245
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:22,880
Goodbye.

1246
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,320
Goodbye. Thank you.

1247
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,920
Finally, June got the role.

1248
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,160
And it's a victory she shares with Pailiu.

1249
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,720
Give it your all on set, and enjoy your date.

1250
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,400
I'm truly happy for you.

1251
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,560
Action.

1252
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,640
No, this one is...

1253
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,280
It's okay, I can walk.

1254
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,040
I'm telling you, I'm not just here for filming.

1255
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,600
See?

1256
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,200
I can handle hiking too.

1257
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:44,880
I keep going.

1258
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,840
Hey, I'm Thai. What's going on?

1259
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,760
Let's share.

1260
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,440
Whoa, it's huge.

1261
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,120
Did you bring this with you?

1262
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,320
It's not mine.

1263
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,640
Stay still. Let's chop its head off, Ms. Yoong.

1264
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,640
Hey, I'm Thai.

1265
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:09,160
Duh. That's why Som said,
"Stay still. Let’s chop its head off, Ms. Yoong."

1266
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,160
Hey, I'm Thai.

1267
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,320
Don't do that.

1268
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,120
Don't. I'm just here on a field trip.

1269
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,360
Hey, I'm Thai.

1270
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,760
What's going on?

1271
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,680
Let me know what sound's ready.

1272
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,800
I'm just here on a field trip.

1273
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,040
Take her back to the house.

1274
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,040
Cut.

1275
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,680
Yes, Miss.

1276
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,400
Want some lemon?

1277
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,640
She's losing her voice.

1278
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,720
Take her back to the house.

1279
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,600
I felt both excited and pressured.

1280
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,320
I really wanted to do better.

1281
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,080
This is called cosmetics.

1282
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,920
Get started right away.

1283
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,560
Cut.

1284
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,480
That was good. Do it again.

1285
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,000
My legs are cramping.

1286
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,120
Insolent.

1287
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,280
Insolent.

1288
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,240
Insolent.

1289
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:30,960
Insolent.

1290
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,320
Insolent.

1291
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,400
Insolent.

1292
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,840
It sounds Chinese.

1293
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,640
Yeah.

1294
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,520
Insolent.

1295
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,680
It's the "hao." Hao. Ni hao.

1296
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:42,320
This is June's first time acting in a series, right?

1297
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:45,720
I think she did really well, but I felt bad for you because

1298
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,480
it was her first time, and she had to do the hardest role.

1299
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,000
I think this one was the toughest role.

1300
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,120
How was your first shoot?

1301
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:55,440
You saw it yourself.

1302
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,440
It was a tough one.

1303
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,480
-I felt bad.
-Right?

1304
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,760
Yeah, you had to lie on the ground right away.

1305
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,160
On the ground right away.

1306
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,440
I walked through mud since this morning.

1307
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,640
-Really?
-Yeah.

1308
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,720
Before you saw me.

1309
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,400
Yeah, I didn't see. I was getting into my costume.

1310
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,280
Exactly.

1311
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,200
You should rewatch the clip.

1312
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,640
I thought you wanted me to join you in the mud.

1313
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,120
Would you go if I asked?

1314
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,560
-I'm telling you...
-Of course.

1315
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,080
After the mud, we'll wash off at the water park.

1316
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,240
Whoa, can I rest first?

1317
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,200
Really?

1318
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,760
-You might not be up for it.
-Let me rest first,

1319
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,240
Let me take a nap, then we'll go.

1320
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,760
When are we going? Tomorrow?

1321
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,680
I think so.

1322
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,680
Stop playing around.

1323
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:53,880
Come on.

1324
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,360
Who's playing?

1325
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,680
We're working.

1326
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,480
You're talking nonsense, Met.

1327
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,160
Our director's talking nonsense.

1328
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,280
I had to run. I fed you earlier.

1329
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,360
You're exhausted.

1330
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,520
You want encouragement.

1331
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,040
What kind do you want?

1332
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,240
Just encouragement.

1333
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,400
What kind though?

1334
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,240
I don't know.

1335
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,320
I don't know.

1336
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,880
Despite the tough roles,

1337
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,120
the atmosphere on set is cheerful and fun.

1338
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,640
But…

1339
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,920
there's something going on with this pair.

1340
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,120
-I'm scared.
-War... What are you scared of?

1341
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,040
Of falling down.

1342
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,880
Yeah, I saw that.

1343
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,840
Just stand back a bit diagonally.

1344
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:36,760
Handfuls...

1345
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,360
That would be hilarious.

1346
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,520
Handfuls of mud.

1347
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:41,920
Set.

1348
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:42,720
Set.

1349
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,240
And action.

1350
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,080
Let's go.

1351
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,480
Run, Miss. I'll hold them back.

1352
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,600
Run, Miss.

1353
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,480
I ran off.

1354
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,520
I ran off with a girl.

1355
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,640
Keep fighting.

1356
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,120
Keep fighting.

1357
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:02,440
Cut.

1358
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,320
Slate!

1359
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,080
Working with June was a lot of fun.

1360
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,880
I feel she's a fighter.

1361
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,440
Because she had a lot of tough scenes.

1362
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:19,640
And... I don't know... she's just so endearing,
that girl June. "That girl June."

1363
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,320
So heavy. Wanna hold it?

1364
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,040
No way.

1365
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,520
How can I hold that? Goodness.

1366
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:32,000
This is actually called an ant egg stick.
You know what that is?

1367
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:32,840
Really?

1368
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:34,560
Not really.

1369
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,480
Hey, I'm giving it back. I changed my mind.

1370
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,640
-We switched roles.
-It's pretty chill.

1371
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,880
It's not that heavy. Wanna try?

1372
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,000
Huh? No?

1373
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,720
Where did he go?

1374
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,320
Somebody, come take this.

1375
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,400
The last one.

1376
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,360
Want some?

1377
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,440
I'm good. You take it.

1378
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,480
I'll give you more.

1379
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,600
Fine.

1380
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,680
Adore her. Adore her.

1381
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,280
You wanna pinch her cheeks.

1382
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,880
Cut. Okay.

1383
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,120
That's a wrap.

1384
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,240
Alright everyone, that's a wrap!

1385
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,600
Yay. The last episode of the miniseries was really tough.

1386
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:46,520
But June and Pailiu will later
go on a date at a water park in Hua Hin

1387
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:51,040
and stay in a private villa
with a pool by the sea. Totally worth it.

1388
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:57,880
This last episode I got to film with June
was actually my own decision too.

1389
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,680
I chose to go with her because...

1390
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,160
What's the word?

1391
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,600
Because something was unresolved in EP 1.

1392
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,200
I feel I've unlocked a lot of things in myself.

1393
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,800
I feel working with her was so much fun.

1394
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,600
It actually unlocked something in me.

1395
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:19,160
It helps me... It might help me make a better decision

1396
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:23,440
when I have to choose the person to leave the house with.

1397
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,200
Now back to the house.

1398
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,880
Oh, you don't eat veggies.

1399
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,560
-Yeah, you don't eat veggies.
-Especially pickled ones.

1400
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,560
Oh, you're sleeping here, Jeab?

1401
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,360
-I thought you left.
-Jeab.

1402
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,600
Don't tell me you're a secret member?

1403
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,920
I thought you left.

1404
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,480
I wanted to let you know something.

1405
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,840
It's something pretty serious.

1406
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,800
What I want to tell you is…

1407
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,000
you're going to the beach too!

1408
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,280
But...

1409
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,160
those two can't know that we're going to surprise them.

1410
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,640
Okay.

1411
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,520
Always have something up your sleeve.

1412
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,760
Because we want you guys to spend quality time together

1413
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:13,480
outside this house before you make your decision on
who you want to leave house hand in hand with you.

1414
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:19,680
So have fun at the beach, share good moments,
and make the most of this beautiful experience.

1415
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:26,120
Spending time together at a beautiful place
might help clear your hearts and minds.

1416
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:30,960
It should help you make your decision next week.

1417
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,840
I hope all of you have fun there. See you later.

1418
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,120
Thank you.

1419
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,320
Oh, my God.

1420
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:39,880
We get a free trip. I'm so happy.

1421
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,480
(Bangkok, Phra Ram Ratchaniwet, Cha-am)

1422
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:56,200
Wow, the villa with a pool the girls came to today
has such amazing atmosphere.

1423
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:00,600
Hopefully they have good moments here
which will help them decide

1424
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,160
who they want to leave the house with hand in hand.

1425
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,720
So pretty.

1426
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,200
The vibe is amazing.

1427
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,720
Wow, it's huge.

1428
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,360
I haven't gone out in so long. Seeing this is so refreshing.

1429
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,280
-Yes.
-Right?

1430
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,480
Feels like we're on a trip.

1431
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,920
Like a whole new world.

1432
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,400
Ooh, a new place. So bright and shiny.

1433
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,760
I wanna live here.

1434
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,040
So how are we gonna sleep tonight?

1435
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,400
Let the couple sleep together.

1436
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,000
We're planning on that.

1437
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:32,800
What?

1438
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,080
Well, Wafer and...

1439
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,640
Hling, go ahead.

1440
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,360
Yeah, the newlyweds.

1441
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,200
Left or right?

1442
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,680
-I'll take this one.
-Then you take this one.

1443
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,040
-I'll take this side.
-I'll take that one.

1444
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:41,880
Okay, let's go.

1445
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,400
-Okay. See you in a bit.
-Wait.

1446
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,080
You four gonna stay in that room?

1447
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:48,040
Well, it's settled... It's not settled yet.

1448
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,200
-Take your time.
-Stay together.

1449
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,160
One episode left.

1450
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,800
Go unpack and we'll meet later.

1451
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,520
-See you in a bit.
-See you later.

1452
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,720
Maybe we'll be a foursome.

1453
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,920
Wait, really?

1454
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,800
An open relationship.

1455
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:07,360
Okay, shall we divide our tasks for today?

1456
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,640
-Sure.
-Sure.

1457
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,800
What are our tasks?

1458
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:14,880
As for the seafood, I can't really tell if it's fresh or not.

1459
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,520
I can tell. I know how to spot male and female crabs.

1460
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,720
I can tell which one has eggs.

1461
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:20,920
Okay, that's your job.

1462
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,400
-Sure.
-Then I'll go get drinks with Neua.

1463
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,280
And as usual, Nice and I will just watch.

1464
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,080
-Yes.
-And we'll help plate the food.

1465
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,720
Okay, that's settled then.

1466
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,360
-Okay, so...
-Shall we split up now?

1467
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,200
Before it gets dark.

1468
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,360
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

1469
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,000
Yeah, so our friends will have food.

1470
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,400
-Let's go.
-See you guys later.

1471
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,520
Shall we?

1472
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:46,960
We're here.

1473
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,360
We're at Vana Nava.

1474
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:55,720
Let's see.

1475
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,200
Looks good on you.

1476
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,600
So we're matching.

1477
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,560
How are we not?

1478
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,160
-This one.
-Which one?

1479
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,560
-Got everything?
-Let's go.

1480
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,200
Cute.

1481
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,120
And for the first date...

1482
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:24,080
No, I feel like whenever someone get to film
the miniseries with me go somewhere with me,

1483
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,760
they always end up having to do something difficult.

1484
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,440
Oh, it's an adventure.

1485
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,440
-Really?
-Yes.

1486
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,360
Okay, awesome.

1487
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,320
I've never been here.

1488
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,320
Why is my side going backward?

1489
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,040
Why is it my side?

1490
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,600
Today Pailiu is treating me.

1491
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,960
Yes, whatever you
want to eat today, I'll buy.

1492
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,160
But first, let me walk straight.

1493
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,760
I don't really talk until I'm close to the other person.

1494
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,000
But if we're close, I talk.

1495
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,600
Yeah, true.

1496
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,520
At first you didn't talk at all.

1497
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:12,480
I'm quiet.

1498
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,840
Completely silent, like...

1499
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,160
I was so scared.

1500
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,360
-I was...
-Really?

1501
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,000
You're really quiet, but I used to be just like you.

1502
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,080
I used to get an introvert result on the MBTI test even.

1503
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,200
I didn't get along with people right away.
I had to be around them first.

1504
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:29,160
And I didn't dare start a conversation.
If I sat next to someone, I'd get so tense.

1505
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:32,800
It's not that I didn't want to talk. I did.
I just didn't know what to say,

1506
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,760
or how to start, so I'd rather stay quiet.

1507
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,040
-Yes.
-I was scared.

1508
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:41,320
Exactly. But outsiders would think we're arrogant.

1509
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,400
But we're not. We just don't know
how to start a conversation.

1510
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,880
We overthink things in our heads.

1511
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,880
Oh, we're stuck again.

1512
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,440
Rock, paper, scissors.

1513
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,080
And she's the one who asked me to play.

1514
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,360
She's the one who wanted to play,

1515
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,440
-but I'm scared.
-To challenge ourselves.

1516
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,520
Never been so scared of a round of rock, paper, scissors.

1517
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,800
Loser goes first, okay?

1518
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,400
Oh my God, please.

1519
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,120
In case heaven is real.

1520
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,760
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

1521
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,440
Should you be in front?

1522
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,640
Do it like this?

1523
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,600
Like this.

1524
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,240
Like this, right? How did they do it in "Titanic"?

1525
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,000
They held hands.

1526
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,400
Outer space.

1527
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,560
June!

1528
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,920
I'll follow you.

1529
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,360
Pailiu.

1530
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,160
Ready?

1531
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,200
She's going.

1532
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,080
One, two...

1533
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,600
Pailiu!

1534
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,560
Are you okay?!

1535
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,200
Pailiu, are you okay?!

1536
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,560
How much do you weight?

1537
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,520
She's gone.

1538
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,600
Before she went, she said, "June..."

1539
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,880
-Then she went.
-Okay, ready?

1540
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,160
-Yes.
-Okay.

1541
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,520
Wow, Liu and June are having so much fun.

1542
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:29,760
After using so much energy, they must be hungry.

1543
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,560
-Come on.
-So hungry.

1544
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,440
Haven't eaten anything today.

1545
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,040
Yeah, we've been in the water all day.

1546
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,560
-Yeah.
-Totally worn out.

1547
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,440
But I had a blast today.

1548
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,920
What did you like the most?

1549
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,320
Getting to take you to play.

1550
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,000
-I wasn't messing with you.
-Thanks.

1551
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,960
-I wasn't. I just...
-I'm the victim.

1552
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,920
-It was just fun.
-I'm the victim.

1553
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,240
I got you to try something new.

1554
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,160
Thank you.

1555
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:03,480
So how do you feel coming here with me?

1556
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:09,160
Today was fun, but honestly
you surprised me since the audition.

1557
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,320
The one that we both won the roles.

1558
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,200
Because I'd never seen that side of you.

1559
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:20,480
It was crazy to me. You were totally yourself.
You were bold, not afraid to act, not tense.

1560
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,040
I found that very charming.

1561
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,400
And you've improved so much.

1562
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,080
-Really?
-Yeah, so much better.

1563
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,720
I had to try and fight. And look, I made it.

1564
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:31,640
Yeah, you did.

1565
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,840
-And I got to play in the water.
-Great job.

1566
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,080
I love it.

1567
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:38,040
But there are so many people choosing you.

1568
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,040
-It's stressful, honestly.
-Is it?

1569
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,360
Yeah, I don't wanna hurt anyone.

1570
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:45,600
I even thought maybe I should leave the house alone.

1571
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,640
You can't do that.

1572
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,040
Like, maybe I should just leave
by myself so no one would get hurt.

1573
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:54,600
They might still be sad,
but at least it wouldn't be too painful.

1574
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:58,000
I don't know. It's been weighing on me, but...

1575
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,600
Yeah.

1576
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,360
It's okay. Spaghetti will cheer you up.

1577
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,920
Yeah, comfort food...

1578
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,360
That was so loud.

1579
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,240
-Wow.
-That was totally me.

1580
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,520
Even though both of them seem so happy today,

1581
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:22,560
they look worried about the final day
when they'll have to leave the house.

1582
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,040
Take your time to think.

1583
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,720
There's still some time to decide.

1584
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,960
Better to fully enjoy this moment.

1585
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,080
(Welcome to Pu Chak-Saphan Yok
Traditional Fishing Lifestyle)

1586
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:36,520
Meanwhile, the other six girls split up
to do the tasks they were assigned.

1587
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,920
Squid, right? They'd probably want that.

1588
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,680
What do they want to eat?

1589
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,640
Pailiu likes shrimp and crab.

1590
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:47,160
And the others?

1591
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,400
The others…

1592
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,400
Maybe we get everything?

1593
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,240
Let's just get everything.

1594
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:53,560
How do you know that?

1595
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:56,400
-Well...
-How do you even know that?

1596
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,120
-No, we're together...
-How? I don't even know.

1597
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,040
We're together a lot, that's why.

1598
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,880
But I don't know about the others
since we've never eaten together.

1599
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,040
-There's more.
-I'm giving you extra.

1600
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,720
Wow, thank you.

1601
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,320
You're the prettiest here.

1602
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,080
Thank you.

1603
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,960
Prettiest in the market, thank you.

1604
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,240
Thank you very much.

1605
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,320
-That one.
-Yeah.

1606
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,960
-You'll grill it yourself?
-Yes.

1607
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,240
We'll clean it for you.

1608
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,720
-Thank you.
-Take out the ink.

1609
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:20,480
Get the eyes out.

1610
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,880
-Yes.
-Thank you.

1611
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:30,560
They're gonna be so happy.

1612
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,400
Yeah, we'll head back to the villa.

1613
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,240
What drink do you want?

1614
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:36,880
Water.

1615
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:38,960
Just water.

1616
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,560
Let's get the green drink.

1617
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:41,920
Okay.

1618
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,480
The black drink.

1619
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,480
It's not here.

1620
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,360
Let me hold that for you.

1621
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,720
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1622
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,000
Let's go.

1623
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,080
We're not worried about the shoppers.

1624
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,240
We're more worried about the girls preparing the grill.

1625
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,720
Everyone will have food today.

1626
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,520
-It looks...
-Yes.

1627
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,160
It's starting to look good.

1628
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,800
Looks like it'll work.

1629
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,400
Blow it yourself?

1630
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:13,440
Yeah, see?

1631
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,760
See? See?

1632
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:15,720
Yeah.

1633
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,120
Feels like a scout camp.

1634
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,360
It's coming!

1635
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,240
Hey, hey!

1636
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:20,960
We really lit the fire.

1637
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,960
Wow, Wafer's really reliable.

1638
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:30,200
So these two get to chill before everyone else.

1639
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,560
The villa is ready. Are the other two girls ready?

1640
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,520
The internet here...

1641
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,080
Oh.

1642
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,160
Guess where we are right now?

1643
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,800
Eh? Where?

1644
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:47,600
Not at the house?

1645
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:48,720
At the market?

1646
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:50,960
Nope.

1647
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:51,960
Where?

1648
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,040
We're in Cha-am!

1649
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,600
Hello!

1650
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,320
Have you been there long?

1651
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:03,440
Just arrived.

1652
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:04,600
Just got here.

1653
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,000
-Having fun?
-We're all here.

1654
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,200
I'll send you the location.

1655
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,880
I'll send you the location, okay?

1656
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,360
Meet us at the villa.

1657
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,880
-Okay.
-Hurry back.

1658
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,600
The villa's gorgeous. See you.

1659
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,040
-Look.
-Okay.

1660
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:17,960
Bye-bye.

1661
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:18,760
Bye-bye.

1662
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,680
Bye-bye.

1663
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,600
Why are you pretty?

1664
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,560
Eh?

1665
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:23,880
Eh?

1666
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,800
-Eh?
-Eh? They're gone.

1667
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,480
-Wow.
-What a surprise.

1668
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,280
Yeah.

1669
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,080
-When did they get here?
-Let's hurry.

1670
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,840
Come on, let's go there.

1671
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:41,880
What are you doing?

1672
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,160
Touching up.

1673
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,040
Wanna some lip gloss?

1674
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:47,720
Let's go.

1675
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,600

Yeah, let's take some pics.
