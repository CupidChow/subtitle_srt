1
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,760
(Because Love Calls)
I had never believed in fate...

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,200
until something incredible happened to me.

3
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,680
What is this?

4
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,760
She can speak our language, Khun Yoong.

5
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,440
Well, I'm Thai.

6
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,280
And what's going on here?

7
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,080
Where am I?

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,840
Who are you people?

9
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,320
Why are you pointing a sword at my face?

10
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,360
Are you going to rob me?

11
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,560
Please don't hurt me.

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,560
How much do you want? I'll give you everything.

13
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,680
Stop. Stay still.

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,840
Shall I chop her head off, Khun Yoong?

15
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,280
No.

16
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,600
I'm just here for a field trip.

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,360
Why would you kill me? I haven't done anything wrong.

18
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,680
Looking for this?

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,640
I don't need it anymore.

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Just let me go.

21
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,280
What are these strange items in your satchel?

22
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,880
Are you a Hanthawaddy spy sent
to carry out a nefarious plot in the capital?

23
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,600
Hanthawaddy?

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,040
Hanthawaddy what?

25
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,440
And where am I?

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,560
You are in Ayodhya, the holy city of Rama. Did you not know?

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,360
Take her back to the house.

28
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,840
I shall interrogate her myself.

29
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,560
Yes, milady.

30
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Come on.

31
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,400
Now I realized I'd slipped into the Ayutthaya era.

32
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,920
But I didn't know why or how it was even possible.

33
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,560
My name is Tia.

34
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,080
I'm 22 years old.

35
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,600
I'm a senior undergrad.

36
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,360
I came to Ayutthaya for a field trip.

37
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,880
All of a sudden I couldn't keep up with my friends.

38
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,280
While I was walking, I saw this flash of light.

39
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,600
Next thing I knew, I ended up here with all of you.

40
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,640
I'm from Bangkok.

41
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,320
My father owns a logistics business,

42
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,040
and my mother is a homemaker.

43
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,920
My hobbies include makeup, dressing up,

44
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,960
and visiting cafes like a typical Gen Z...

45
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,800
What are you babbling about?

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,640
I do not understand a word.

47
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,840
It's not surprising you don't understand,

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,240
because I'm from hundreds of years in the future.

49
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,640
Our lifestyle...

50
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,720
Our way of life then is very different from now.

51
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,240
So you claim you are from the future?

52
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,920
How is that possible?

53
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,480
Seeing that right now...

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,080
Ayodhya is surrounded by enemies on all sides,

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,920
so much so that it is almost impossible to see a future ahead.

56
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,440
You must hear the cannons

57
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,560
exploding not far from here.

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,520
Uh... I understand what you're saying, Khun Yoong.

59
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,720
But no matter how many times Ayodhya falls,

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680
someone will always rise to reunite our people.

61
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,560
How dare you!

62
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,840
Ayodhya shall not fall that easily.

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,560
But you just said so yourself, Khun Yoong.

64
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,760
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,800
But what I said is true.

66
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,120
And I'm really not a Hanthawaddy spy.

67
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,520
That I can believe.

68
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,360
No Hanthawaddy's General would be foolish enough

69
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,720
to send a simpleton like you

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,400
to carry out an important mission in the capital.

71
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,680
Are you calling me stupid, Khun Yoong?

72
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,960
What are those strange items in there?

73
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,320
This?

74
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,280
It's called makeup.

75
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,280
Makeup?

76
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,320
You are rambling nonsense again.

77
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,480
Makeup is used to make your face pretty.

78
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,680
You are saying this is a cosmetic?

79
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,360
Yes, milady.

80
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,040
Why did I say "milady"?

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,800
Do not believe her, Khun Yoong.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,920
It must be poison from Hanthawaddy.

83
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,160
They must have sent her to put it in
the water supply in the capital, milady.

84
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,080
That's not true.

85
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,560
Since you claim this is a cosmetic,

86
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,720
Yes.

87
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,920
Then I would very much like to see

88
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,000
how you use it.

89
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes.

90
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,720
Apply it on Som, my servant,

91
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,720
to prove your claim.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,720
Yes. Make my beautiful.

93
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,120
Khun Yoong, if it is poison, wouldn't I die?

94
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,640
We have Laurel Clock Vine on hand to detoxify.

95
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,560
If you show even the slightest symptom,

96
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,600
I shall behead her before you die.

97
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,400
Am I going to survive this?

98
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,480
Hurry up.

99
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,120
You got it.

100
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,360
Fine.

101
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,960
I'm done, milady.

102
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,160
Much more beautiful.

103
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,680
Like...

104
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,880
night and day.

105
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,240
Oh, in my era we say, "like heaven and hell."

106
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,560
Did you say "hell"?

107
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,120
I believe now that you are not
a secret agent from Hanthawaddy.

108
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,520
But I still have many doubts about you.

109
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Especially since my brother assigned me
to oversee the rear echelon in the capital,

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,680
I cannot let you go that easily.

111
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,200
From now on, you shall serve as my personal maid.

112
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,720
But I don't know how to do anything, milady.

113
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,560
And how long do I have to stay here?

114
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,200
I'd rather go home.

115
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,720
Since you said that bright light brought you here,

116
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,000
the day that light appears again...

117
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,960
will probably be the day you return home.

118
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,680
After that, I had to live in Khun Yoong's house.

119
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,840
I served her in whatever she wanted.

120
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,240
No.

121
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Ticklish?

122
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,200
Stop.

123
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,360
Don't.

124
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,880
Please don't.

125
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,720
Oh, did I get it on you?

126
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,480
Phetchaburi palm sugar is no match for my mistress and Tia.

127
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,760
You beast.

128
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,280
I went from not wanting to be here even for a minute,

129
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,080
to being elated to get to serve Khun Yoong here.

130
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,800
Lord Phichaidecha has returned home!

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,800
Brother.

132
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,440
Brother, why have you returned home?

133
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,880
You should be stationed at Fort Mahachai right now.

134
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,760
I came to bring you news.

135
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,320
Soon, the Hanthawaddy army will breach the capital.

136
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,000
Gather the servants and leave the capital as fast as you can.

137
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,560
You mean...

138
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,640
the capital will soon fall?

139
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,520
Yes.

140
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,480
Leave immediately. Do not delay.

141
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,640
That is all I came to tell you.

142
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,760
And make sure you survive.

143
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,480
Brother!

144
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,800
Som, tell the servants to pack only what is necessary.

145
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,280
We must leave at once.

146
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,280
Yes, milady.

147
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,000
Run, milady. I'll hold them off.

148
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,080
Run.

149
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,520
No, I'm not going anywhere.

150
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,280
Run.

151
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,440
No, Khun Yoong, watch out!

152
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,400
The light...

153
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,280
Is that your way home?

154
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,960
Go quickly.

155
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,840
No.

156
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,520
I'm not going anywhere.

157
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,360
Go quickly.

158
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,600
No.

159
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,520
Not while you're still in danger.

160
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,720
I'm not leaving.

161
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,320
Foolish girl.

162
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,440
When your chance to return home has come,

163
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,400
why will you not take it?

164
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,800
I...

165
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,480
I can't leave you like this.

166
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,080
Thank you very much.

167
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,200
But I cannot be selfish and think only of myself.

168
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,400
I care about you deeply as well.

169
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,440
If fate allows,

170
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,120
we shall surely meet again.

171
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,160
Khun Yoong, no!

172
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,240
Farewell.

173
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,840
No, Khun Yoong!

174
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,720
Khun Yoong?

175
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,920
Khun Yoong?

176
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,520
Khun Yoong?

177
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,880
Khun Yoong.

178
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,920
Leave me alone.

179
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,600
Hey, I said leave me alone.

180
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,960
Khun Yoong!

181
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,520
What are you babbling about? I am right here.

182
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,240
Where are we?

183
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,040
Why does it look so desolate?

184
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,360
Khun Yoong.

185
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,360
Whether it was by fate or any other cause

186
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,960

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,840
And I will not let her go easily, that's for sure.
