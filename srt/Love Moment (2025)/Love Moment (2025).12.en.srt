1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,680
(For You)
Some memories that are lost...

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,480
(For You)
I hope they're still beautiful.

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,040
Fai.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,120
Fai.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,680
Fai.

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,040
Fai.

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,560
Fai.

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,240
Slowly, baby.

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,400
Take it easy, Fai.

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,560
Take it easy.

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,040
Mom.

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,640
That's...

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,200
That's Fon, baby.

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,280
She's your girlfriend.

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,480
Here, we went to Japan for our anniversary. Remember?

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,440
I'm sorry, I don't remember you.

17
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,720
It's okay.

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,480
I'm just glad you woke up.

19
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,880
It's okay.

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,240
Fon.

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,360
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,120
Get lots of rest.

23
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,520
I'll come back tomorrow.

24
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,160
It's okay.

25
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Physically, Ms. Fai...

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,680
is recovering very well.

27
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,640
But in terms of memory,

28
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,320
I still can't say for sure

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,040
when it will come back.

30
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,480
Whoa.

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,320
I want both of you

32
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,600
to spend time with Ms. Fai

33
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,120
and slowly guide her

34
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,480
through activities she used to do.

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,760
Memorable past events

36
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,000
might trigger her memory.

37
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,000
But I don't want you to rush things

38
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,800
because everything takes time.

39
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,640
How are you doing, dear? Are you okay?

40
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,360
Fai doesn't look at me like she used to.

41
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:09,040
But she seems happy when she's with you.

42
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,640
Why were the memories of me the ones she lost?

43
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,040
She'll remember you soon.

44
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,480
She'll keep getting better, dear.

45
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,680
Trust me.

46
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,040
Hey.

47
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,880
Can I try something?

48
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,200
What is this, Fon?

49
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,280
Please, Miss.

50
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,680
Wow.

51
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,640
I've brought your favorite restaurant here.

52
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,360
Really?

53
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,120
Mm.

54
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,560
Try it.

55
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,600
This dish

56
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,360
is also one of your favorites.

57
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,600
You love it.

58
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,240
Is it good?

59
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,520
Fai.

60
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,440
I have something for you,

61
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,320
but you have to close your eyes.

62
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,120
What is it?

63
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,000
Close your eyes first.

64
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,520
No peeking, okay?

65
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,960
No cheating.

66
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,000
Ready?

67
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,680
Fai?

68
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,040
Fai.

69
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,080
What's wrong?

70
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,360
Fai?

71
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,800
Fai?

72
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,920
Fai!

73
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,440
Fai!

74
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,560
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

75
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
I understand.

76
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
And you've shown me...

77
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,280
that you truly love my daughter.

78
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,560
She almost remembered me.

79
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,440
I know.

80
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,560
Fai.

81
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,800
I'm sorry...

82
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,400
for pushing...

83
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,520
It's okay.

84
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,320
I get it.

85
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,120
But...

86
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,680
we're happy as we are now, right?

87
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,040
Thank you.

88
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,160
Let's finish the puzzle.

89
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,880
I'm almost done.

90
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,720
This one.

91
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,280
There.

92
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,480
Oh?

93
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,160
Where did the last piece go?

94
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,800
Fon.

95
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,720
No need to look for it.

96
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,240
Even with the missing part, it's still beautiful.

97
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,560
Thank you...

98
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,720
for always taking care of me...

99
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,520
and being by my side.
