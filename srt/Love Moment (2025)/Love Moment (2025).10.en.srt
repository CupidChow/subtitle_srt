00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,920
(Flower of Memory)

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,600
I never thought about how my love journey would end.

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,240
You said you were in a hurry. Why aren't you eating?

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,040
Too many veggies.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,680
I'll feed you.

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,680
If you don't eat, I'll kiss you.

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,600
Then I'm not eating.

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,440
Ran.

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,880
Hm?

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,880
Do you love me?

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,240
I love you.

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,680
My ride's here.

13
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,600
I have to go.

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,360
Can you not go?

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,920
I don't want to go either.

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,320
But I have to.

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,040
Bye.

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
Okay?

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,160
Can you not go?

20
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,560
Can you afford to feed me?

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,280
I eat a lot, you know.

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Give me a second.

23
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,960
Safe flight, hot shot.

24
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,000
You're so sweet.

25
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,040
But take care of yourself

26
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,480
when I'm not here, okay?

27
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
Give me a hug.

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,360
Work hard, okay?

29
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,680
I have to go.

30
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,880
Bye-bye.

31
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,680
Bye-bye.

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,160
(Placed Order)

33
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
What's all this?

34
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,800
Surprise!

35
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,440
Why are you wearing this dress?

36
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,360
Wan.

37
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,520
I have something to tell you.

38
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,760
Please marry me.

39
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,120
I want to be with you.

40
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,480
Every minute.

41
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,920
Every single second.

42
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,400
Thank you very much

43
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,880
for making me realize when we truly love someone,

44
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,720
we can love them more every single day.

45
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,360
But if one day...

46
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,640
I'm not here anymore,

47
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,040
you have to live on.

48
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,360
Why are you saying that?

49
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,400
I can't live without you.

50
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,280
Please promise me...

51
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,800
that you'll find a way to live on.

52
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,840
It has been a shock for all Thai people

53
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:32,560
when an FL Airline flight
crashed just minutes before landing,

54
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,720
killing all passengers and crew instantly.

55
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,480
Authorities are now trying to control the fire
and thoroughly investigate the crash site.

56
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,360
Our news team is closely
following the situation.

57
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,120
Once more information is available,
we will report immediately.

58
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Ran.

59
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Ran.

60
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,040
I will never forget our love story.
