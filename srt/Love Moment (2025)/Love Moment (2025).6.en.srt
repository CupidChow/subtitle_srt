00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,160
Do you know why the moon orbits around the Earth?

2
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,680
Hello.

3
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,400
Sure thing.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,800
I think I can handle it.

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,720
Sure, ok.

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,640
TungTung is coming in today?

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,640
Ok, sure.

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,080
Sounds great.

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,960
But...

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,720
What's the theme?

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,840
I see...

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,440
Soft glam.

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,920
No problem, I got this.

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,720
Thank you.

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,880
Sorry.

16
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,480
I couldn't help myself.

17
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,080
TungTung!

18
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,840
Are you researching my styling?

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,280
Sorry for the last minute request.

20
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,760
But you really are the only person I trust with this.

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,520
I will do my best.

22
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,520
Congratulations on your award.

23
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,200
My first one.

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,040
TungTung...

25
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,520
Sorry, Mint.

26
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,160
I need a break.

27
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,680
My bad, I know you don't have much time.

28
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,760
Thanks.

29
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,920
For what?

30
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,600
For being honest with yourself.

31
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,720
If you wear something you are not confident in...

32
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,640
it will show.

33
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,800
You know me very well.

34
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:24,040
I know what when you're worried, you look down a lot and sigh. Like what you just did.

35
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,560
Thank you for understanding me.

36
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,040
Then be honest again now...

37
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,880
How do you feel at this moment?

38
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,200
I'm happy and very excited.

39
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,600
But I'm also terrified.

40
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,800
Almost as if I'm not deserving.

41
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,320
It's a mix of feelings.

42
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,000
I still remember the first day we met.

43
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,960
That day you were shining and determined.

44
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,960
Your eyes were sparkling.

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,800
Really?

46
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,560
Yes.

47
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,680
Your eyes was what drawn.

48
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,440
To look at you.

49
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,760
I see.

50
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,840
If I don't have you,

51
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,640
I probably wouldn't be there.

52
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,280
You are very deserving of all your achievements.

53
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,040
I will make you the most confident in your moment.

54
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,080
Hey.

55
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,920
I know which look would suit you.

56
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,880
What a stunner.

57
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,680
Thank you.

58
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,160
It's so beautiful.

59
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,720
What brand is this?

60
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,360
It's actually my own design.

61
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Then why does it fit me exactly?

62
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:31,640
Well, let's just say you were my inspiration.

63
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,280
How do you feel in this?

64
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,880
I'm...

65
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Not sure.

66
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,880
Why?

67
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,240
Because I know you well...

68
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,720
If I choose this dress...

69
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,280
We may need a few more things to match it.

70
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,200
You do know me.

71
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,400
Let's see...

72
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,480
Hmm..

73
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,680
This one maybe?

74
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:29,120
Maybe the reason is simply that the moon just feels comfortable orbiting around the Earth.
