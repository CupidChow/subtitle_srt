<iLet’s find out together.</i

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,520
It’s already been three weeks

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,480
since everyone started living together

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,680
in this house.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,040
I believe by now

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,840
you’ve all gotten closer.

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,120
Maybe even started to understand
each other’s hearts a bit better?

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,280
Maybe.

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,440
I think so.

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,840
- Maybe a little.
- Perhaps.

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,720

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,720
Let’s start with our first contestant,

00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
June!

32
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,680
Are you ready?

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,200
I’m ready.

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,360
What’s June’s favorite food?

35
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,400
No discussing.

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,360
No discussing.

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,600
Answer. Answer.

38
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,360
Everyone’s written their answers.

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,080
June, what’s your favorite food?

40
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,960
Salmon.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,800
Ooh!

42
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:40,880
I'm correct.

43
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:41,920
Correct!

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,960
No changing answers!

45
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,000
No changing answers.

46
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,320
Moving on to the second question.

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
What’s June’s type

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,800
when it comes to women?

49
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,720
Time’s up!

50
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,120
What’s your type?

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,520
Fair-skinned, Chinese-looking girls.

52
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,240
I wrote “cool girl.”

53
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,480
I wrote Chinese-looking girl!

54
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,800
And now, the last question for June.

55
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,280
Does she prefer the mountains or the sea?

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,280
All done.

57
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,960
Five.

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,960
Four.

59
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,880
Three.

60
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,680
Two.

61
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,720
Time's up.

62
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,280
I like mountains.

63
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,400
All correct!

64
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,920
Oh! How did you know?

65
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,400
Honestly,

66
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
I feel like

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,720
whenever it’s about June,

68
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,800
any question,

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,480
her answers are my answers.

70
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,840
We’re so alike.

71
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,920
Almost like we’re the same person.

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,120
<iWow, awesome! The same person!</i

73
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,240
Alright, next up,

74
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,200
Lita.

75
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,280
Okay, starting with the first question,

76
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,720
What’s Lita’s favorite color?

77
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,840
Ooh, I know this one!

78
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,760
Lita, what’s your favorite color?

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Baby blue.

80
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,720
Correct!

81
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,360
Same, because she always talks about it!

82
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,640
I even wrote baby blue.

83
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,800
Second question,

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,320
What was Lita's old name?

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,080
Oh!

86
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,960
I already told this story before.

87
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,320
What was your name?

88
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,200
It was Amy.

89
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,720
Who got it right?

90
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,600
All correct.

91
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,400
All correct.

92
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,000
And the last question.

93
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,200
What sport did Lita use to play?

94
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,520
I know this one too.

95
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,240
Wow, they know everything!

96
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,520
Time’s up

97
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,680
What’s the answer?

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,800
Gymnastics.

99
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,200
Who got that right?

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,360
All correct!

101
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,600
<iNeuanaow got all of Lita’s answers right,</i

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,480
<ishe can’t even hide her excitement!</i

103
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,200
Amazing!

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,160
Okay, next up. The first question is

105
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,400
what food does Dear love the most?

106
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,040
Food that she love?

107
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,360
Answer please.

108
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,440
French fries.

109
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,400
She really loves French fries.

110
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
What did you answer?

111
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,400
Spicy salad.

112
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,200
Oh geez!

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,320
Second question.

114
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,600
Her name is Dear, right?

115
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,040
Does her ‘Dear’ mean deer, the animal,

116
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,560
or, dear, as in beloved?

117
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,480
Choose. 'The animal' or 'beloved'?

118
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,080
Answer please.

119
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,400
It means beloved.

120
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,600
And the last question for Dear.

121
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,280
What’s her favorite cartoon character?

122
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,520
Answer please.

123
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,400
Hello Kitty!

124
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,400
Ah!

125
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,120
Who got this correct? Hands up.

126
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,720
All three.

127
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,600
She pays attention to her friends.

128
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,400
Lita and Pailiu got them right.

129
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
Alright, next person, Ling!

130
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,880
Yay, I’m ready.

131
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,680
- First question.
<i- Oh? Wafer,</i

132
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,600
<iwhy do you look so eager?</i

133
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,360
What’s Ling’s favorite color?

134
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,960
Hey, hey, hey!

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,840
No giving hints!

136
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,080
I didn’t!

137
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,040
I’m just itchy. Really itchy.

138
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,120
Itchy eyes.

139
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,400
Answer please.

140
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Pink.

141
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,160
Yay, correct!

142
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,960
Who else got it right?

143
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,600
What kind of Chinese mix is Ling?

144
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,480
All done writing?

145
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,320
All done.

146
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,120
Answer please.

147
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,200
Shanghai Chinese.

148
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,840
Nice, what did you write?

149
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,880
Teochew Chinese.

150
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,440
And the last question

151
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,240
for Ling’s ultimate fans,

152
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,960
what was her stage name

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,880
before she became ‘Ling’?

154
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,040
This one’s easy.

155
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,400
June looks totally zoned out.

156
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,600
June's zoned out.

157
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,080
You just said it earlier!

158
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,720
You don't know?

159
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,400
Three.

160
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,360
Two.

161
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,800
One.

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,800
Monic.

163
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,000
Yay!

164
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,840
Almost got all of Dear's.

165
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,640
Got all three of Ling's.

166
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,720
The third person is Pailiu.

167
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,640
What’s the emoji that represents Pailiu?

168
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
So easy.

169
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,320
<iDear looks really focused</i

170
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,280
<ianswering Pailiu’s questions!</i

171
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,680
Time’s up.

172
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,520
what’s the answer?

173
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,320
Panda.

174
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,520
Who got that right?

175
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,160
Me!

176
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,320
Three people.

177
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,800
Next.

178
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,600
what does Pailiu need beside her

179
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,600
when she sleeps?

180
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,800
Without it, she can’t fall asleep.

181
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,760
The one who sleeps beside me must know.

182
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
This one’s easy.

183
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,840
Not sure. Just guessing.

184
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,960
Three. Two. One.

185
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,520
Time’s up. Answer please.

186
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
A bolster pillow.

187
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,200
Huh?

188
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,320
I wrote stuffed panda!

189
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,400
Yeah, me too.

190
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,280
I wrote seal.

191
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,800
Who wrote bolster pillow?

192
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,280
Ooh!

193
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,800
She really knows her!

194
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,320
A true fan!

195
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,200
I brought my own bolster!

196
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,960
People might think I can’t sleep

197
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,800
without my stuffed toys,

198
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,320
but actually it’s the bolster.

199
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,680
Final question for Pailiu.

200
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,320
What’s her favorite animal?

201
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,080
Everyone knows this one.

202
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,960
Answer please.

203
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,960
Cats.

204
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,000
Who got it right?

205
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,960
What, everyone?

206
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,640
How do you all know?

207
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,280
There it is!

208
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,600
Her sitting gesture.

209
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,160
Just like this.

210
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,080
Okay, next, Neuanaow.

211
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,400
Which province is she from?

212
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,880
Hmm!

213
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,000
I know this.

214
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,160
I remember the region.

215
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,120
Everyone remembers the region.

216
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,000
Answer please.

217
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,800
Which province?

218
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,800
Surat Thani.

219
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,160
Who got it right?

220
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,400
Neuanaow's favourite dessert.

221
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,920
Med Kanoon (mung bean balls)

222
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,360
or Foi Thong (golden threads)?

223
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,560
Always eat it together.

224
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,880
Share, share.

225
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,120
Answer please.

226
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,000
Foi Thong.

227
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,120
Last question.

228
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,680
What was Neuanaow’s original name?

229
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,960
Was it Neua or Naow?

230
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,800
These are all easy.

231
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,800
Everyone knows.

232
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,520
Ticked correct for myself.

233
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,080
Answer please.

234
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,000
Neua.

235
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:53,920
Correct?

236
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,800
Correct.

237
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,960
Okay, next person

238
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,200
is

239
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,960
Wafer.

240
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,720
First question.

241
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,200
What sport does Wafer like to play?

242
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,080
No helping.

243
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,000
Be quiet.

244
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,360
Taking a stroll.

245
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,640
Okay. Time’s up. Answer please.

246
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,520
Wakeboarding.

247
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,640
Ooh, correct!

248
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,520
Who got it right?

249
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,720
You know what I wrote?

250
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,560
Driving!

251
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,600
Sport?

252
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,920
How was that a sport?

253
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,320
This question is very basic.

254
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,960
What month was Wafer born?

255
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,200
Basic how?

256
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,000
Month?

257
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,200
Friend’s birth month.

258
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,240
It’s on the tip of my tongue.

259
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,160
Okay, time’s up.

260
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,040
June.

261
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,000
Who got that right?

262
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,800
Who got that right?

263
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,120
I yelled it before for everyone.

264
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,600
Last question.

265
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,000
What’s Wafer’s favorite fruit?

266
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,600
Answer.

267
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,680
Answer, please.

268
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,640
This one’s hard.

269
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,120
Everyone done writing?

270
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,240
Answer please.

271
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,800
Orange.

272
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,280
I got it wrong.

273
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,920
Lita knows everyone so well.

274
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,200
She’s so observant.

275
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,960
And finally

276
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,560
Nice!

277
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,480
First question, what kind of toy

278
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,840
does Nice love to buy?

279
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,640
What’s it called again?

280
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,600
No talking.

281
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,920
No talking.

282
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
- I don't know its name.
- I don't remember the name.

283
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,800
Draw it.

284
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,280
Drawing’s hard too.

285
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,360
Answer please.

286
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,520
Squishy toy.

287
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,240
I thought it was slime.

288
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,440
Is it the same?

289
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,760
- No, no.
- Different things.

290
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,360
Really?

291
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,800
Geez, Auntie!

292
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
I know what it is.

293
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,280
- Slime is gooey.
- I called it slime all the time.

294
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,200
Squishies are the ones you squeeze!

295
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,160
Who wrote squishy?

296
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,200
I wrote ‘that gooey thing’.

297
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,200
Wrong.

298
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,480
The answer’s squishy!

299
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,320
Let’s move on to the second question.

300
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,080
What animal is Nice most afraid of

301
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,920
between cockroaches and snails?

302
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,880
Answer please.

303
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,080
Snails.

304
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,520
And the final question about Nice.

305
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What’s her biggest dream?

306
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,560
Nice mentioned this earlier today.

307
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,600
She did.

308
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,400
During the meal.
She asked a question and answered it.

309
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,200
Answer please.

310
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,720
To have a house by the sea.

311
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,560
Who got that right?

312
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,400
Me.

313
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,480
Wow, okay!

314
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,520
I think it’s because

315
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,800
we have a lot of similar

316
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,640
tastes and preferences

317
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,480
we’re probably the same ‘type’ of girl.”

318
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,160
<iNow that everyone’s finished answering,</i

319
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,320
<iit’s time for Jeab to reveal the truth.</i

320
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,800
<iThe quiz wasn’t just for fun.</i

321
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,600
<iIt was today’s</i

322
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,040
<icouple-matching challenge!</i

323
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,960
So, this week,

324
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,440
the person who answered

325
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,520
the most questions correctly about

326
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,200
someone gets paired up with them.

327
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,600
The show is really creative.

328
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,800
Every single day,

329
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,520
the challenges are totally different.

330
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,360
The first person I’ll announce is Lita,

331
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,840
because she’s been so thoughtful

332
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,320
and attentive toward everyone.

333
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,120
- You could see she got so many answers right.
- She’s everyone’s mommy!

334
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,600
She’s that caring.

335
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,160
But there’s also someone who’s been
just as attentive to Lita.

336
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,880
And that person is…

337
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Neuanaow!

338
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,720
Congratulations to

339
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,560
Lita and Neuanaow, you’re a pair!

340
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,600
Finally!

341
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,200
We finally got paired up!

342
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,600
We fought so long for this.

343
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,200
On everyone else’s sheets,

344
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,760
I only got one point each.

345
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
except from Lita. I got three.

346
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,520
It’s pretty clear.

347
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,400
Next pair... Pailiu.

348
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,320
Ooh, who’s she paired with?

349
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,800
The person who paid the most attention

350
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,520
to Pailiu is Dear.

351
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,720
These two are a great match.

352
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,320
I can’t believe it.

353
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,920
Pailiu got

354
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,560
three of my answers right.

355
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,760
Alright, the third pair.

356
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,440
June. She was our very first contestant,

357
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,920
and the person who showed

358
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,880
the most care toward her is

359
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,160
Nice.

360
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,440
I think this matching challenge is

361
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,600
is great. Shows who actually
pays attention to us.

362
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,480
Yeah.

363
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Congratulations.

364
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,240
And that means the final pair,

365
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,160
the two who’ve been

366
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,640
paying attention to each other,

367
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,200
are Ling and Wafer.

368
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,920
She got every answer right.

369
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,040
Wow, she's actually pays attention.

370
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,680
<iIt seems like everyone got exactly</i

<iwho’d both wished to be paired together.</i

<iJune and Nice, whose relationship</i

<ihas been growing closer</i

376
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,480
<iand closer lately.</i

377
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,080
<iHerling and Wafer,</i

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,440

<iAnd Dear, who’s wanted to be</i

382
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,000
<iwith Pailiu for a long time,</i

383
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,760
<ifinally got her wish.</i

384
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,560
<iEven more surprising,</i

385
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,040
<iall the pairs who matched today</i

386
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,960
<iwere already sitting</i
<inext to each other from the start.</i

387
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,360
<iCould it be fate?</i

388
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,680
Hello, girls!

389
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,320
Hello.

390
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,000
How’s this week been?

391
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,800
Fun!

392
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,680
Ate a bit too much.

393
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,000
Ate a bit too much? Okay.

394
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,480
So, honestly, as your acting coach,

395
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,920
I feel that even though

396
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,200
it’s been a short time,

397
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,280
you’ve all improved so much.

398
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,200
I’m really proud of your progress.

399
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,760
Thank you.

400
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,840
Keep that momentum going.

401
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,080
Don’t step back,

402
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,640
keep moving forward.

403
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,760
Now, the next area to improve is

404
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,360
character interpretation.

405
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,320
I won’t explain much

406
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,200
I’ll test you directly

407
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,560
to see if you really understand

408
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,120
your character’s essence.

409
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,800
First pair.

410
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,600
Let me see.

411
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,160
Let’s start with Dear.

412
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,760
Why am I always first every episode?

413
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,960
Your prompt is

414
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,040
Dear likes playful teasing

415
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,520
while Pailiu is very serious.

416
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,600
You’re classmates working on

417
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,800
a school report together.

418
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,200
Okay. Dear, come here.

419
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,200
Okay?

420
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,280
Hey, have you started yet?

421
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,480
Yeah, shall we get started?

422
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,640
Already?

423
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,720
Let’s start then.

424
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,200
What are we waiting for?
Don't waste time.

425
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,200
But we haven’t eaten yet.

426
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,440
We can eat after we're done.

427
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,720
Come on, sit down.

428
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,040
Don’t waste time.

429
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,600
- Where is it?
- What’d you prepare?

430
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,920
Nothing yet.

431
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,600
Why didn’t prepare anything?

432
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,200
I thought you'd prepare.

433
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,800
You still have to prepare.

434
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,320
I prepared snacks.

435
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,480
The ones you like!

436
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
I do like them, but work first.

437
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,160
Fine, fine. Which part?

438
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,560
Here.

439
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,960
I think this should go

440
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,720
in the other section.

441
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,400
I’m hungry.

442
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,000
No time. Eat later.

443
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,720
We can eat while working!

444
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,600
Then just eat first.

445
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,960
Okay, freeze!

446
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,960
Can anyone guess

447
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,560
what direction I gave Dear?

448
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,200
- Be understanding?
- Understanding.

449
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,360
Almost!

450
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,160
The prompt was

451
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,840
trying to flirt.

452
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,760
Ah.

453
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,920
I was too slow to make a move!

454
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,440
Exactly.

455
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,360
<iDid you get nervous when you had to</i

456
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,680
<iplay a flirty role with Pai</i

457
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,160
<iand forget the teacher’s note, Dear?</i

458
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,760
Give them both a round of applause.

459
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,680
At first I was nervous, kinda awkward.

460
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,080
But since it was with Pailiu,

461
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,880
it felt easier.

462
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,320
We’re already close,

463
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,120
so it came naturally.

464
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,080
Next pair,

465
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,040
Ling as the fierce cat

466
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,320
and Wafer as the puppy.

467
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,120
We're humans, right?

468
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,200
Yes, just personalities.

469
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,480
Puppy tries to court her senior.

470
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,920
I'm eating.

471
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,200
Can I eat with you?

472
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,720
What, no money?

473
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,720
Go buy your own.

474
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,720
I don’t have any.

475
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,080
Feed me?

476
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,000
Are you crazy?

477
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,920
I don’t have money.

478
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,320
What is this?

479
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,160
Stop bothering me.

480
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,040
Now I’ve lost my appetite.

481
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,800
Wait for me?

482
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
I lost my appetite now

483
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,680
and it's getting cold.

484
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,920
Just go away already.

485
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,800
No, I’m not leaving.

486
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,320
Just go, I'm getting annoyed.

487
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,920
- I'm not going, Ling.
- Just go, I'm getting annoyed.

488
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,400
Then I’ll just sit here.

489
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,440
Fine, I’m not eating anymore.

490
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,760
Remember, fierce, not angry.

491
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,200
<iWafer’s puppy-like charm</i

492
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,880
<iwas so cute it completely threw</i

493
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
<iHerling off balance.</i

494
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,920
Or I can sit across from you instead.

495
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,480
What’s with you? Lacking affection?

496
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,800
A little. I just want

497
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,040
some warmth from you.

498
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,600
Can I?

499
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,760
Ouch!

500
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,160
Are you okay?

501
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,600
Are you hurt?

502
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,960
You’re bleeding!

503
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,600
Why are you acting like this?

504
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,360
You're already so clumsy.

505
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,240
What would you do

506
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,640
if I weren’t here to help?

507
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,880
Come on, we’re going to

508
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,280
the nurse’s office, no joking.

509
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,600
Let's have a meal together?

510
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,080
No.

511
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,720
To the nurse’s office, now.

512
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,360
- Let’s just grab a bite.
- No, get up, hurry!

513
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,320
- Let's eat.
- Hurry!

514
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,280
Walk by yourself.

515
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,480
Walk me please.

516
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,200
- I’m not that concerned. Just walk.
- But I’m hurt

517
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,840
- Follow me, quickly.
- Carry me, please.

518
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,800
Cut.

519
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,920
Wafer was so adorable as the puppy type.

520
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,080
I never imagined she could act so cute!

521
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,080
Lita and Nuea,

522
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,080
do you know what a <itsun</i type is?

523
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,320
No idea.

524
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,800
- A <itsun</i is...
- That’s why Lita was

525
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,000
confused this morning

526
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,320
when we said “she’s so <itsun-tsun.</i”

527
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,200
Like June.

528
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,760
Quiet and <itsun.</i

529
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,960
Yeah, June’s totally<i tsun!</i

530
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,720
What?

531
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,480
What does that even mean?

532
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,080
<iTsun-tsun.</i

533
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,800
I don't get it.

534
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,920
Alright, I’ll explain it

535
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,880
properly in a bit.

536
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,280
You're the talkative one.

537
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,480
This role really feels like me!

538
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,800
I don’t have to fake anything,

539
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,920
I can just be myself completely.

540
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,040
Just talk a lot.

541
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,360
And Lita is the <itsun</i one.

542
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,200
So yesterday I went to Central, right?

543
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,480
I saw so many yummy things,

544
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,680
but it was probably closed already.

545
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,320
You didn’t come with me!

546
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,600
You always come with me.

547
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,160
And I’ve seen who you’ve been

548
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,400
hanging out with lately.

549
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,000
What’s her name again?

550
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,680
The girl from the other section?

551
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,480
Ploy.

552
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,160
You never answer me when I ask.

553
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,920
You know what, I won’t ask anymore.

554
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,800
We used to talk about everything,

555
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,480
and now you’re always with Ploy.

556
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,200
Go bigger, Nuea! More dramatic!

557
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,200
And now I don’t have any friends left.

558
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,600
Hey, why are you crying?

559
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,280
I didn’t know, okay?

560
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,080
- You were my only friend!
- I didn’t know…

561
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,800
Character’s slipping!

562
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,560
I said I didn’t know.

563
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,360
<iAww, Lita totally broke character</i

564
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,600
<iwhen Nuea started crying!</i

565
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,800
<iSo sweet!</i

566
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm confused.

567
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,000
Comedy and drama are a breath apart.

568
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,640
What you just did

569
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,920
the emotion was real,

570
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,880
but if you exaggerate it

571
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,480
until it’s absurd,

572
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,040
it'll turn into a comedy,

573
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,720
that’s what makes a rom-com.

574
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,200
Guess what prompt I gave Lita?

575
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,720
Oh dear.

576
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,880
This one is challenging.

577
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,600
You like your best friend,

578
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,800
but she’s like that.

579
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,680
Ah.

580
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,640
Last pair, June and Nice!

581
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,360
Okay,

582
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,920
easy one.

583
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,000
A mysterious type and a friendly type.

584
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,200
June, come.

585
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,360
Pretty obvious who’s who, right?

586
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,320
So you’re worried about her.

587
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,120
Their mental and emotional health.

588
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,920
Five, four, three, two, action!

589
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,960
Hey, you hungry?

590
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,520
Not really.

591
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,600
Mm.

592
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,440
What do you wanna do?

593
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,200
We’re in the same section,

594
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,840
we should get to know each other.

595
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,160
Where do you live?

596
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,160
We’ll have to work on

597
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,600
group projects together,

598
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,600
so we might as well be close so

599
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,200
we can help each other work.

600
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,040
I’m aiming for an A,

601
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,720
you want one too?

602
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,440
You'll do it all by yourself?

603
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,320
Yeah.

604
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,720
Where do you usually hang out?

605
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,680
Why are you asking?

606
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,680
Maybe we can hang out together sometime.

607
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,000
Get to know each other.

608
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,800
But I like sleeping.

609
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,080
There’s a nap room at the sports club,

610
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,000
you know.

611
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,640
I’m actually good at astronomy

612
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,800
I can tell you which stars go with which,

613
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,040
like this one’s Orion, that one’s Leo.

614
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,000
You like stargazing?

615
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,680
Okay,

616
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,200
cut.

617
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,000
June's one’s tricky to guess.

618
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,920
Deep down, June wants friends but

619
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,960
doesn’t dare to reach out.

620
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,840
Would you say she seems that insecure?

621
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,520
Not really.

622
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,680
Well, think typical series plot.

623
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,520
They met as kids,

624
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,400
made a deep impression back then.

625
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,120
<iThis pair had a tough brief,</i

626
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,600
<ibut they acted it out naturally,</i

627
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,720
<ireally cute chemistry!</i

628
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,680
When there’s no set script,

629
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,040
improvising like this

630
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,960
actually feels easier.

631
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,800
Alright, I hope everyone does well

632
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,920
in this afternoon’s audition.

633
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,160
Thank you!

634
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,200
Hello, Ms. Prang.

635
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,080
Hello!

636
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,960
Today, I have someone special

637
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,520
to introduce to the girls.

638
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,680
Standing next to me

639
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,840
is a famous Girls’ Love novelist

640
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,760
known by the pen name Serenista,

641
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,920
or as we know her,

642
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,400
or Aor!

643
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,720
Welcome, Aor!

644
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,880
Hi everyone, I’m Serenista,

645
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,360
author of The Prestige,

646
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,960
Flower Above the Throne.

647
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,440
I’m really happy to be here

648
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,000
with all of you today.

649
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,560
<iWow! Today’s acting challenge is</i

650
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,040
<iadapted from The Prestige</i

651
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,960
<iFlower Above the Throne,</i

652
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,760
<iwritten by Aor herself,</i

653
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,240
<ior her pen name, Serenista.</i

654
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,920
<iA story that’s never been</i

655
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,920
<imade into a series before.</i

656
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,080
<iIt’s a love story between Evelyn,</i

657
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,440
<ia mafia heiress, and Irisa,</i

658
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,120
<ia rich young lady.</i

659
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,280
<iAnd today’s scene even includes</i

660
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,640
<ia bit of action!</i

661
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,240
<iDefinitely a big challenge for the girls!</i

662
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,600
<iHow interesting!</i

663
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,320
And as you all know,

664
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,760
the guests standing up here

665
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,560
will also serve as one of the judges

666
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,400
for who wins the role today.

667
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,000
Please come collect your scripts.

668
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,160
Thank you.

669
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,680
<iLet’s go check out each pair</i

670
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,320
<iand see how they do!</i

671
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,200
I was thinking...

672
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,200
Could work.

673
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,720
If I act it... If I act when...

674
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,680
Might get more emotion out of it.

675
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,400
Right.

676
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,600
Like if I do it when you...

677
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,640
Yeah but you might tense up.

678
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,320
When I come.

679
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,120
All tense.

680
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,200
Should I tense up before you got in?

681
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,680
When I start raising my hand.

682
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,000
Perhaps...

683
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,400
Confused.

684
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,120
When I reach for your chin.

685
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,880
What if I try pulling away a little?

686
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,400
Like this? How?

687
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,200
Suppose you touch me like this.

688
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,040
You touch me like this.

689
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
Then I'll be like...

690
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,160
I try pulling away.

691
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,560
Pull my chin away.

692
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,600
I'll try acting then.

693
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,960
No, no, maybe not.

694
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,040
Let's not.

695
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,720
Maybe just stay still but

696
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,000
act with your face instead.

697
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,880
I think.

698
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,960
Let’s try this, if someone
grabs you from behind.

699
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,360
In this situation,

700
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,080
the first thing you do is

701
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,720
elbow to open their arms,

702
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,600
then shift your hips away,

703
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,280
and roll out of the hold.

704
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,120
Now that I’ve tried it,

705
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,960
the action part isn’t too hard.

706
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,440
It’s understanding the situation

707
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,880
that’s tricky.

708
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,200
I’ve never been kidnapped by a mafia before.

709
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,120
Please, don’t kidnap me,

710
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,840
I don’t want that experience.

711
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,480
Wait a sec.

712
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,000
It’s fine, we’re just practicing lines.

713
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,120
You get it?

714
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,000
Yeah, kind of.

715
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,640
I actually saw this move on YouTube

716
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,640
you just do this.

717
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,080
She had to spread her arms out to

718
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,680
increase the enemy's space.

719
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,480
Then, spread your hips.

720
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,640
Escape through any opening.

721
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,880
And roll out of the hold.

722
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,000
Like this.

723
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,400
When I first read the scene,

724
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
I was like,

725
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,840
how do I act this without

726
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,000
looking ridiculous?

727
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,040
It’s really hard,

728
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,680
and it’s my first time trying to

729
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,040
interpret something like this.

730
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,520
<iDon’t overthink it, Pai and Dear.</i

731
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,760
<iFrom what we’ve seen,</i

732
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,480
<iyour flow’s looking good already!</i

733
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,240
<iThis pair looks nervous,</i

734
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,080
<ibut relax, girls!</i

735
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,880
<iYou can do it!</i

736
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
What did you try to bargain with my dad?

737
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,200
Does he even know where I am right now?

738
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,480
If that’s how you see me…

739
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,160
then maybe I should show you

740
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,640
exactly what you think I am.

741
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,560
Alright.

742
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,360
Raise the tone a little higher.

743
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,280
I want to go home.

744
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,120
Higher pitch, not louder.

745
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,000
- I want to go home.
- Still not high enough?

746
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,960
I want to go home!

747
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Too high, too high.

748
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,120
I’ll teach you how to defend yourself.

749
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,680
Spread your elbows to make space,

750
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,120
twist your hips,

751
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,560
then turn around quickly.

752
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,840
I was so nervous.

753
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,720
There’s a line where I have to say

754
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,200
“open your elbow,

755
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,880
create space from the enemy,”

756
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,520
I was fumbling a bit.

757
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,720
And my brain just froze.

758
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,720
It felt clumsy compared

759
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,480
to the other pairs.

760
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,160
Well, well,

761
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,320
look who I found here.

762
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,000
Hope you’re enjoying your time here.

763
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,680
Not enjoying it.

764
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,320
Not enjoying it?

765
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,360
Not at all.

766
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,080
Lita, you’re always in this room.

767
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,920
Sorry?

768
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,280
You like staying in this room.

769
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,000
Right.

770
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,920
You’re the mafia!

771
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,200
You’re the one doing all the evil things!

772
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,800
If that’s what you think,

773
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,400
then maybe I should be
what you think I am.

774
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,000
Follow me, rebellious lady.

775
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,960
Too aggressive?

776
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,800
Not aggressive but

777
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,480
just careful, or it’ll turn into a drama scene.

778
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,400
I just feel like when

779
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,440
I act with Neuanaow,

780
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,720
she gives me such strong energy,

781
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,560
but maybe I still don’t fully

782
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,400
understand my character.

783
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,520
So I might’ve played it a bit wrong.

784
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,560
<iMaybe Lita's trying too hard.</i

785
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,080
<iLita really wants to win</i

786
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,880
<ithat date with Neuanaow,</i

787
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,760
<ibut relaxing might actually help.</i

788
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,520
Stay calm. When something like
this happens, what do you do?

789
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,320
Stay calm. When something like
this happens, what do you do?

790
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,320
A matter like this,

791
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,000
there are many clips on YouTube.

792
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,280
Just headbutt them.

793
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,320
What you see online

794
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,200
doesn’t work in real life.

795
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,800
This time I think I balanced it better

796
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,040
not too fast or too slow.

797
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,120
You have to do it again, right?

798
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,240
You can teach me how you do it.

799
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,320
And then like this.

800
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,800
Then you...

801
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,400
<iLooks like this pair is worried</i

802
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,840
<iabout their action scene too.</i

803
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,400
Like this.

804
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,520
Spin, spin, spin, spin

805
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,400
and boom!

806
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,240
Like this.

807
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,640
<iWait,</i

808
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,400
<ihow did their fight scene</i

809
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,000
<iturn into a dance?</i

810
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,400
And then...

811
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,400
So what would you do

812
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,280
if this happened?

813
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,000
I saw this on YouTube.

814
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,560
You only need to headbutt them.

815
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,480
Why isn't it working?

816
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,280
Did you win?

817
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
You’re satisfied,

818
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,160
then change the beat and say

819
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
“Follow me.”

820
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,400
Follow me,

821
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,080
rebellious lady.

822
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,880
Finally!

823
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,560
That line took forever to come out.

824
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,000
You see, I was going to say,

825
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,560
“Follow me, seductress”

826
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,000
It scared me!

827
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,680
I panicked!

828
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,920
Maybe I haven’t fully connected

829
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,520
with the character yet.

830
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,360
Yeah.

831
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,320
But I like Evelyn.

832
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,520
She’s like this elegant mafia queen,

833
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,520
graceful and powerful.

834
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,280
<iToday’s scene is something new</i

835
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,560
<ifor the girls,</i

836
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,240
<iso it’s natural they feel a bit awkward.</i

837
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,600
<iBut with how close each pair is,</i

838
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,720
<ithey’ll surely do well.</i

839
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,320
<iBefore their auditions,</i

840
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,880
<ithey’re finding ways to</i
<iboost confidence first.</i

841
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,920
<iThe audition scene today is from</i

842
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,680
<ithe novel “Flower Above the Throne.”</i

843
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,160
<iIt’s about Irisa,</i

844
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,880
<ia student returning from abroad</i

845
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,520
<iwho gets kidnapped by Evelyn,</i

846
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,720
<ia mafia woman, to her mansion,</i
<ifor reasons unknown.</i

847
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,280
<iLeading to a heated argument,</i

848
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,120
<ibut Evelyn still insists on</i

849
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,880
<iteaching Iris self-defense.</i

850
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,760
Alright, big moment!

851
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,000
Let’s see which pair can portray

852
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,120
the story closest to Aor’s vision.

853
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,960
And who can like exactly like

854
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,120
the characters from the novel.

855
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,800
Aor, which pair do you want to see first?

856
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,280
The second pair from that side.

857
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,000
Okay, that’s Ling.

858
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,080
Ling and Wafer.

859
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,960
Okay.

860
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,440
Do your best!

861
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,320
You may begin.

862
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,800
If that's how you see me,

863
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,000
maybe I should show you

864
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,560
what I might be like.

865
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,360
Follow me, rebellious lady.

866
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,280
Where are you taking me?

867
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,240
To teach you self-defense.

868
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,320
If something like this happens,

869
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,360
remember to stay calm.

870
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,200
No, I saw on YouTube.

871
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,920
You just headbutt like this!

872
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,400
Listen!

873
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,560
Internet knowledge

874
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,000
doesn’t work in real life.

875
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Got it?

876
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,880
Try hugging me from behind.

877
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,000
Remember when situation like this arise,

878
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,200
open the attacker’s arms,

879
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,760
lean back,

880
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,280
and twist out. Got it?

881
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,320
Hmm, I think I get it.

882
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,560
If you freeze like that,

883
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,960
you’ll get kissed before you know it.

884
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,800
Remember, stay calm.

885
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,000
If you freeze like that,

886
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,320
you’ll get kissed before you know it.

887
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,600
Ow.

888
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,560
Lost again.

889
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,720
No,

890
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,560
you actually won this time.

891
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,400
Cut!

892
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,800
How was it?

893
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Much better than rehearsal.

894
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,080
There's more stubbornness.

895
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,360
Iris looked more stubborn,

896
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,640
More natural flow

897
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,200
between the characters.

898
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,320
Maybe just needs more presence,

899
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,200
but overall smooth.

900
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,360
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

901
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,640
I was nervous at first,

902
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,280
but once it started flowing,

903
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,280
I relaxed more and no longer felt tense.

904
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,280
I was amazed

905
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,280
working with her.

906
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,880
She made me feel comfortable right away.

907
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,720
The first pair.

908
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,320
Alright.

909
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,200
Next, Pailiu and Dear!

910
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,720
Why am I never

911
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,280
near the end of the lineup?

912
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,600
Hey, we got to go first earlier.

913
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,720
If you view me like this,

914
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,280
then I should show you something

915
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,880
and make you see

916
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,760
what you expected, how's that?

917
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,680
Follow me, rebellious lady.

918
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,040
Look.

919
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,320
You must stay calm.

920
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,160
If this happens, what do you do?

921
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,600
I saw this on YouTube.

922
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,200
Just do this!

923
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,880
Ouch!

924
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,000
Hey.

925
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,760
That’s just online clips.

926
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,080
They won’t help you in real life.

927
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,040
Try wrapping your arms around me.

928
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,520
First, spread your elbows

929
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,360
to increase the enemy's arm area

930
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,240
then shift your hips,

931
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,400
any direction is fine.

932
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,200
And spin out quickly.

933
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,160
Like this.

934
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,760
If you freeze like that,

935
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,240
you’ll get kissed before you know it.

936
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,440
I told you, stay calm.

937
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,320
If you freeze like that,

938
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,280
you’ll get kissed before you know it.

939
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,440
I lost.

940
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,360
Cut.

941
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,240
Earlier, you see,
I tell you, there was a child

942
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,840
who was still worrying

943
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,720
until the very last second.

944
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,800
- Really?
- Yes.

945
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,520
Really?

946
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,480
“I can’t do it, I can’t do it!"

947
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,240
"I'm so stressed!”

948
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,360
There was no need to be stressed.

949
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,840
You flowed naturally!

950
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,360
Dear finally found the right balance.

951
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,840
Not too heavy, not too tense,

952
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,440
not too loose. You got it.

953
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
Don't cry.

954
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,360
You also cry when you do well.

955
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,880
I’m just sensitive.

956
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,720
That was a nice balance.

957
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,480
You weren’t stiff from fear

958
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,320
but it was innate fear.

959
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,840
The timing was just right.

960
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,240
Pailiu, I was guiding you on dynamic.

961
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,480
There were many options

962
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,760
for this characters,

963
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,800
like being stern or lecturing.

964
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,320
The tones were different.

965
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,120
Pailiu explored tone so well.

966
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,880
Don’t cry,

967
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,040
you did amazing.

968
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,160
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

969
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,280
Good job.

970
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,360
Because of our characters' personalities,

971
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,120
and the fact that I was a mafia,

972
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,360
and she was a rich stubborn young miss.

973
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,720
I really feel she's also

974
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,400
very well-suited for the role.

975
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,040
I have to thank Pailiu for helping me.

976
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,920
Honestly, if Pailiu hadn't helped,

977
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,240
I probably still wouldn't be able to figure it out.

978
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,840
Yeah, like, I really have to thank her

979
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,320
because she's so experienced

980
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,720
and helped me a ton.

981
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,960
Without her, I probably

982
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,520
wouldn't have made it.

983
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,440
Which pair?

984
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,120
Third pair.

985
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,000
This pair then.

986
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,360
June and Nice.

987
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,160
Are you sure?

988
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,440
Then I’ll show you

989
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,560
I can do more than that.

990
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,080
Follow me.

991
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,000
Why did you bring me here?

992
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,120
To teach you self-defense.

993
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,480
See? I told you to stay calm.

994
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,200
This move?

995
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,160
I’ve seen it on YouTube.

996
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,720
It's so simple,

997
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,760
just move your head, right?

998
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,920
YouTube doesn’t work in real life.

999
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,760
Like this.

1000
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,480
Like this, you mean?

1001
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,600
No, like this.

1002
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,000
Don’t freeze, or you’ll get kissed.

1003
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,360
You’re the one...

1004
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,680
who shouldn’t freeze

1005
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,480
or you’ll get kissed.

1006
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,360
Okay, cut.

1007
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,760
There might still be
some parts acted with worries,

1008
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,120
but I feel like you did better

1009
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,280
than in the practice round,

1010
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,840
you were a bit hesitant.

1011
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,600
But overall, it was much smoother.

1012
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,080
Although, maybe you could use

1013
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,640
more vocal variety,

1014
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,120
add more flair and style to it.

1015
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,560
As for Iris,

1016
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,920
I felt that toward the end of the battle,

1017
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,480
she must let go of her fear.

1018
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,920
She was still held back

1019
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,320
by fear for a moment

1020
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,760
But I liked the very end,

1021
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,880
where it felt like they were smiling

1022
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,200
and playing off each other.

1023
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,280
It was really cute.

1024
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1025
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,960
So today,

1026
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,280
I focused on trying to sync up with June,

1027
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,520
to make sure we could

1028
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,800
really go together well.

1029
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,200
I really wanted to do it well.

1030
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,360
But when you try hard

1031
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,360
to make it good

1032
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,640
and it still doesn't work out,

1033
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,720
it's a bit disappointing, you know?

1034
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,680
Last pair, Lita and Neuanaow.

1035
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,800
No matter what I say,

1036
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,200
you won’t believe me.

1037
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,200
Fine, stay ignorant then.

1038
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,760
Don’t accuse my father!

1039
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,800
He's not that kind of person!

1040
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,400
You’re the mafia.

1041
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
The one doing evil things!

1042
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
If that’s what you think,

1043
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,600
maybe I should be what you think I am.

1044
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,880
Follow me,

1045
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,360
rebellious lady.

1046
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,400
Why did you take me here?

1047
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,920
To teach you self-defense.

1048
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,200
Stay calm.

1049
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,400
What would you do if this happened?

1050
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,080
YouTube’s full of stuff like this.

1051
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,520
Just headbutt!

1052
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,960
What you see online

1053
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,800
doesn’t work in real life.

1054
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,360
Come.

1055
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,240
Hug me from behind.

1056
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
Tighter.

1057
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,040
If that happens,

1058
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,200
what you have to do is

1059
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,880
spread your elbows,

1060
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,200
make space for the enemy.

1061
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,000
twist your hips in any direction,

1062
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,320
and spin out.

1063
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,280
If you freeze like this,

1064
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,520
you’d be kissed already.

1065
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,680
If you freeze like this,

1066
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,000
you’d be kissed already.

1067
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,280
No,

1068
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,960
this time you won.

1069
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,600
Cut.

1070
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,000
My mouth kept tripping over words!

1071
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,160
You were biting your words, yes?

1072
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,240
I think Neua really had that

1073
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,480
young miss energy that is hot tempered.

1074
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,400
It's interesting.

1075
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,640
Lita looked composed and mature,

1076
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,120
totally in control.

1077
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,720
And another thing is,

1078
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,040
it's a shame, some moments,

1079
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,160
I felt that if you perform it again,

1080
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,480
you could really crush it even more.

1081
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,080
Okay. Everyone did great!

1082
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,880
Lita was so stressed during practice,

1083
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,360
I was worried about her.

1084
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,600
But we did way better than expected.

1085
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,800
We can really see how much
every pair has grown,

1086
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,880
it’s such a big improvement from before.

1087
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,240
I’ve noticed that everyone’s acting

1088
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,680
and chemistry have developed so well.

1089
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,840
But now,

1090
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,600
we’ll go discuss among ourselves to

1091
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,880
decide which pair best fits Aor’s story.

1092
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,680
Alright, so how was it?

1093
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,120
Both from our coach and our writer.

1094
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,880
Let’s start with Aor.

1095
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,720
Which pair did you feel matched
the characters you envisioned most closely?

1096
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,400
Overall, I’d say Pailiu and Dear.

1097
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,920
When I watched Dear,

1098
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,040
I really felt her emotions

1099
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,000
she showed fear and courage

1100
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,920
mixed together. I can feel it.

1101
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,520
I also like that

1102
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,800
her eye contact felt sincere,

1103
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,640
like she was truly fighting.

1104
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,000
And as for Pailiu,

1105
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,720
I really, really liked her performance.

1106
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,600
Her pacing, her speech,

1107
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,520
she let everything flow naturally

1108
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,960
with the character.

1109
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,400
I liked that.

1110
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,080
It looked quite close to

1111
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,680
what you imagined, right?

1112
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,560
Yes, exactly.

1113
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,520
Their acting was very detailed and

1114
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,640
they had great chemistry.

1115
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,120
Pailiu in particular,

1116
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,720
she exuded this charisma,

1117
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,280
like a real mafia boss.

1118
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,320
It made me want to keep

1119
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,880
watching her more and more.

1120
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,520
Were there any other pairs you

1121
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,240
personally liked or found interesting,

1122
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,400
Aor?

1123
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,280
Yes, I liked some individual points

1124
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,520
from others too.

1125
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,880
For example,

1126
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,360
one performer showed a strong,

1127
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,240
another had a very natural style,

1128
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,200
though they might need to add
a little more intensity

1129
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,400
to elevate the scene.

1130
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,520
Like Ling.

1131
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,680
I actually really liked

1132
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,120
her natural delivery,

1133
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,520
but she could add more flair.

1134
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,920
Something like that. And...

1135
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,600
For Lita, I loved her cool vibe.

1136
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,040
Then again, it feels like a trade-off.

1137
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,760
She needs to add more style,

1138
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,840
so she can look more cheeky.

1139
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,840
What about this pair, June and Nice?

1140
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,000
From the outside,

1141
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,320
their visuals already look like...

1142
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,120
- Yes.
- Like a mafia and

1143
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,480
a feisty little girl who talks back

1144
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,520
to the intimidating mafia!

1145
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,120
I just feel that if June can

1146
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,840
adjust her speaking style a bit,

1147
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,440
use more vocal variety,

1148
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,520
and different tones,

1149
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,480
she’ll be able to go much further.

1150
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,760
Yes, yes.

1151
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,240
Alright then, I think we all
already have a pair in mind.

1152
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,080
So let’s call the girls back in

1153
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,600
and announce the results.

1154
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,480
Okay.

1155
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,800
And we have reached

1156
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,440
a decision on who is most

1157
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,160
deserving of the role today.

1158
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,680
It's the pair that best brought

1159
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,840
to life the characters that Aor wrote,

1160
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,160
perfectly matching her imagination.

1161
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,880
And that pair is...

1162
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,560
Pailiu and Dear!

1163
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,720
Seriously?

1164
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,760
Seriously?

1165
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,760
I think everything flowed

1166
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,960
so smoothly with Dear.

1167
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,760
Dear looked so much more
relaxed this time,

1168
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,600
which helped their communication feel

1169
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,000
more natural and emotionally connected.

1170
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,000
Pailiu played the mafia boss so gently,

1171
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,960
it blended perfectly

1172
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,040
with Dear’s energy.

1173
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,640
Dear really impressed me,

1174
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,760
she had just the right balance of fear,

1175
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,000
but it was soft,

1176
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,280
not panicked or aggressive.

1177
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,640
It suited the role so well.

1178
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,120
I admit she did amazingly.

1179
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,160
Well done!

1180
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,600
Congratulations for earning the role today.

1181
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,000
And enjoy your special date together!

1182
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,320
She’s crying again.

1183
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,520
No.

1184
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,520
Let her cry! It’s fine, don’t hold it in.

1185
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,600
Yeah, it’s just this feels like

1186
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,000
such an encouraging moment for me.

1187
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,240
It’s like proof,

1188
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,240
this is my first real acting role that

1189
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,920
will be filmed for a mini-series!

1190
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,880
I want to tell my parents

1191
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,400
to watch it on TV that day live

1192
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,760
no replays!

1193
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,960
Because “Your daughter did so well!”

1194
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,720
Maybe I’m not amazing yet,

1195
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,040
but I’ve improved.

1196
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,360
I want them to see how far I’ve come,

1197
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,680
from when I was in their belly till now.

1198
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,040
I've grown into a chubby girl.

1199
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,680
Thank you for raising me so well.

1200
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,640
I’m so proud of Dear.

1201
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,960
Because

1202
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,680
she was scared,

1203
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,400
but she still fought through it,
she's like me.

1204
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,080
And today, she really did it.

1205
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,040
I believe in the future

1206
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,440
she’ll go even further and

1207
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,600
keep getting better and better.

1208
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,480
Tutor me again!

1209
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,320
No. You’re already great.

1210
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,920
<iThere may be tears,</i

1211
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,880
<ibut they’re tears of joy.</i

1212
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,760
<iDear finally got to act alongside Pailiu</i

1213
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,360
<ithe partner she’d been waiting for.</i

1214
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,640
<iAnd together,</i

1215
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,080
<ithey performed beautifully,</i

1216
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,080
<iwinning over the judges’ hearts.</i

1217
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,800
<iNothing could be more perfect than this.</i

1218
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,800
<iCongratulations to the both of them!</i

1219
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,640
<iNow, let’s take a look at the atmosphere on set during</i

1220
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,680
<iDear and Pailiu’s very first shoot together!</i

1221
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,680
Follow me, rebellious lady.

1222
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,800
Cut.

1223
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,160
This time, I got to film on location
with Dear. It was also really fun.

1224
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,560
I got to experience something new,
and the location was so beautiful.

1225
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,760
Want a snap?

1226
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,120
Most recent photo is me too.

1227
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,280
My whole camera roll is full of you.

1228
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,040
Isn’t that kinda funny?

1229
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,000
Are there seeds?

1230
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:40,680
Nope.

1231
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,520
So good.

1232
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,160
No.

1233
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,560
It’s soft and smooth.

1234
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,320
You said it like something’s missing.

1235
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,800
No, I’m just trying to

1236
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,400
focus on one thing at a time.

1237
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,840
Nothing.

1238
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,720
It just feels comforting,
having her by my side.

1239
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,200
How to start filming?

1240
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,000
Hi!

1241
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,880
How are you feeling today?

1242
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,840
Feeling shy from the camerawoman.

1243
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,760
- She's too good.
- Are you really shy?

1244
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,000
The camerawoman’s just too good.

1245
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,720
Wait, is this shot just showing my head?

1246
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,160
You got my body too?

1247
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:31,960
I'm a bit confused.

1248
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,880
It’s tricky, it’s tricky.

1249
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,560
You look so pretty.

1250
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,480
The prettiest mafia ever.

1251
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,600
Did you get your nails done?

1252
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,720
Because I smelled something

1253
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,960
when you touched me.

1254
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,720
No! But it’s got that vibe like

1255
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,960
a kid trying nail polish for the first time.

1256
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,920
I have short nails

1257
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,440
but wanted red polish.

1258
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,560
Cute?

1259
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,280
- It makes you look more like a mafia.
- Mafia lady.

1260
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,000
It's not focusing anymore?

1261
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,320
Mmm, is it good?

1262
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,600
Yeah. Just a little spicy though.

1263
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,080
But if I eat it with rice, it’s fine.

1264
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,080
Dow do you think I did today?

1265
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,400
You looked gorgeous.

1266
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,520
You acted so well, this is your first time, right?

1267
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,080
I was actually nervous about it.

1268
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,160
You did well. Don’t worry too much.

1269
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,480
It’s your first time,

1270
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,880
just give it your best.

1271
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:43,880
Get it?

1272
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,560
It's your time time, I understand.

1273
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,800
You were like me last time, a bit down.

1274
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,640
Mm.

1275
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,480
No, really, you did so well. Seriously.

1276
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,760
Mm.

1277
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,960
I’ve been trying to cheer her up.

1278
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,600
How should I put it?

1279
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,080
I bought her snacks

1280
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,400
and for the staffs too.

1281
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,880
I want to remind her that she can do it.

1282
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,560
Everyone love you because you're cute.

1283
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,200
It's not related at all.

1284
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,640
Sharing delicious and fatty food.

1285
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,680
I'll teach you self-defense.

1286
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,160
Stay calm. What would you do if you
encountered something like this?

1287
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,000
I was so shocked at that moment,

1288
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,280
like, 'Whoa, are we kissing now?!'

1289
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,880
I was really taken aback.

1290
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,480
But I got shy, and it was fine

1291
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,360
I just ended up playing as myself.

1292
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:57,920
Thank you!

1293
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,960
<iFilming has wrapped up!</i

1294
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,320
<iNow, where will these two go on their date?</i

1295
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,400
If I made you tired today, I apologize!

1296
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,280
You know what we’re doing today, right?

1297
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,080
No idea.

1298
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:07,880
Really?

1299
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,160
We’re making rings today.

1300
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,760
They’re silver rings.

1301
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,880
Oh my gosh, that’s so cute!

1302
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,240
There are round and square ones. Let's go inside.

1303
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,480
<iOh my!</i

1304
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,320
<iWhat’s this? These two are making rings together?!</i

1305
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,200
<iThanks.</i

1306
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,600
<iDo Papa and Mama know about this yet?</i

1307
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,120
Does it fit?

1308
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,400
Aw, but it's so cute.

1309
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,160
But I like it like this.

1310
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:34,800
That one's pretty too.

1311
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,400
But it's pretty.

1312
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,600
Okay, all done.

1313
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,600
Oh, so cute!

1314
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,120
So cute! Obviously cute!

1315
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,200
Cute, cute, cute!

1316
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,720
Use your index and middle fingers.

1317
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:41,880
So pretty!

1318
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,800
This one’s Pailiu’s.

1319
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,120
- It has a moon design.
- Let me put it on for you first.

1320
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,080
Which finger?

1321
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,000
Index finger’s fine.

1322
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,320
It feels so you.

1323
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,920
It’s a little loose though.

1324
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,000
Which one should I wear mine on?

1325
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:57,920
Index finger.

1326
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,800
Okay.

1327
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,360
So pretty!

1328
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,120
Aww!

1329
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,600
Gorgeous!

1330
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,040
When I saw them, I thought they’re all so beautiful!

1331
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,960
I didn’t know we could make them!

1332
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,160
Let's go get something to eat.

1333
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,880
Are you hungry yet?

1334
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,000
- Very hungry!
- Really?

1335
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,200
- Really.
- Let's go get our bags.

1336
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,320
Cheers.

1337
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,320
Cheers.

1338
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,920
Excuse me.

1339
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,560
So satisfying!

1340
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,000
This is a great day.

1341
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,680
I want it to be like this every day.

1342
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,920
So today I got to eat.

1343
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,080
Thank you.

1344
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,760
Let's snap.

1345
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,720
We can see the rings too.

1346
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,720
This is me.

1347
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,200
This is another Pailiu.

1348
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,120
You know what I really like?

1349
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,800
The name of the shop, it’s so lovely.

1350
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,480
- Cute, right? Such a warm feeling.
- Flowers, doors, vases...

1351
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:32,880
- Everything here is so adorable.
- ...vintage.

1352
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,720
Right now, when I look at Dear,

1353
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,720
you're really beautiful.

1354
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:38,720
Seriously.

1355
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,400
Really?

1356
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,200
From this angle, you look so beautiful.

1357
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,360
This angle is really great.

1358
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,600
I really loved the feeling of sitting

1359
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,000
and having a picnic with her.

1360
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,120
When I looked at her

1361
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,560
and saw the sunset behind her,

1362
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,240
with the light shining through,

1363
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,120
wow, Dear looked so beautiful
that I had to take out my phone and capture it.

1364
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,080
Let's go look over there.

1365
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,000
Do you like ice cream?

1366
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,160
I really like it.

1367
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,400
What's your favorite dessert?

1368
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,400
Aside from French fries.

1369
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,000
Dessert? I like brownies.

1370
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,560
It's delicious.

1371
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,120
What's your dream?

1372
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,560
- My dream?
- No need to be too far-fetched.

1373
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,280
My dream is to get married.

1374
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,200
Hmm?

1375
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,120
Far or not?

1376
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,400
It's not far, is it?

1377
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,920
Really? Not far?

1378
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,720
Yeah, it's pretty close.

1379
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,920
Just kidding.

1380
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,000
When you decide to marry someone,

1381
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,920
it has to be a person you truly choose

1382
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,120
someone who really fits with you.

1383
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,520
It’s not just about one factor,

1384
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,320
it’s about everything coming together.

1385
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,760
So, that’s my dream.

1386
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,800
To have a family of my own,

1387
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,800
yeah.

1388
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,960
to have a life partner who’ll stay

1389
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,680
with me for the rest of my life.

1390
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,360
That’s my dream.

1391
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,400
But I think it’s really hard nowadays to

1392
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,720
find someone who truly matches with you.

1393
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,160
There are millions of people out there.

1394
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:06,960
Yeah.

1395
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,120
I also feel like it's difficult.

1396
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,480
But who knows?

1397
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,200
Yeah. Who knows, really?

1398
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,800
Even we met.

1399
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,400
Geez!

1400
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,440
Someone in my life just keeps

1401
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,720
meeting and meeting again.

1402
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,400
Is it good or bad to meet them?

1403
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,440
Good, of course.

1404
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,000
Really?

1405
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,960
First time in your life that

1406
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,360
you've had many sisters.

1407
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,000
Yeah.

1408
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:25,680
Right?

1409
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,200
Remember it as a good memory.

1410
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,800
But it's good, everything's good.

1411
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:30,880
Mm.

1412
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,200
<iI believe today is a truly wonderful day.</i

1413
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,160
<iThey are smiling non-stop.</i

1414
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,400
Do you want to wear that?

1415
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,880
Try putting it on.

1416
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,800
Since we brought it here.

1417
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,600
It is okay?

1418
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,760
Or should I not wear it?

1419
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,600
Let me see.

1420
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,320
It is okay?

1421
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,120
But it's cute.

1422
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,960
- We need hair strands.
- But it needs...

1423
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,520
Yeah, we need hair strands.

1424
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,800
If it hurts, tell me.

1425
00:57:59,160 --> 00:57:59,960
It doesn't hurt.

1426
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,000
Aww, so cute!

1427
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,680
Cute! Why didn't you tie it in the first place?

1428
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,400
I didn't know.

1429
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,560
Why didn't you tie it from the start?

1430
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,760
What a shame. Let's begin.

1431
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,480
It's dark now.

1432
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,360
But honestly, I’m a person with really high walls.

1433
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,280
Like that day during the workshop

1434
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,120
when the teacher paired me with Neuanaow,

1435
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,240
and we were supposed to talk about each other’s
strengths and weaknesses,

1436
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,400
I said my weakness is that
I have very high walls.

1437
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,080
I find it really hard to trust people.

1438
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,400
Do you trust me yet?

1439
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,800
Almost, almost.

1440
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,560
Almost? Wow,

1441
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,160
we've been together all day

1442
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,560
and it's only almost.

1443
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,800
After talking,

1444
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,080
we realized that both of us are

1445
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,880
the type of people who have walls up

1446
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,680
we don’t let anyone in easily when

1447
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,600
it comes to getting to know someone.

1448
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,080
<iI don’t know what anyone else would say,</i

1449
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,120
<ibut judging from Pailiu’s smile today,</i

1450
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,080
<iI’d say Dear has already</i

1451
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,960
<ibroken down her walls.</i

1452
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,800
She said she was really happy,

1453
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,720
like, she told me that ten times today.

1454
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,000
I was so glad to hear her say that.

1455
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,120
What are they doing?

1456
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,960
Oh, they're back!

1457
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,280
Hello!

1458
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,600
Hello!

1459
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,600
I have something for you guys!

1460
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,400
Dear, you look like a bride.

1461
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,520
How was your day? Are you tired?

1462
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,800
I'm not tired at all. Today was fun.

1463
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,000
Today, there's another gift.

1464
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,800
Couple rings.

1465
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,600
Yes, we made rings together.

1466
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,800
One wearing on ring finger and

1467
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,880
the other on the middle finger?

1468
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,360
Because this one's big.

1469
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,520
It's a little loose.

1470
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,760
So she had to wear it on middle finger.

1471
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,800
Was it fun making rings together?

1472
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:14,920
Fun.

1473
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,400
- What?
- Did you put it on each other?

1474
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,200
No.

1475
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,000
We'll have to wait and see.

1476
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:21,600
Wait and see.

1477
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,520
We have to wait and see?

1478
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,280
Just wait and see.

1479
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,080
Aw, so cute!

1480
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:25,800
Okay.

1481
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,360
Let's share half of it.

1482
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,600
I've eaten a lot.

1483
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,080
- Is it delicious?
- My belly hasn't deflated yet.

1484
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,000
<iLet's watch the series. We're ready, too.</i

1485
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:37,760
It's on air.

1486
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,680
Watch the series first?

1487
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,680
But I'm shy.

1488
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,560
I don't dare watch it.

1489
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,280
I want to watch it already.

1490
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:45,720
Young miss.

1491
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,520
I've never worn a backless dress.

1492
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,720
The most revealing outfit I've ever worn.

1493
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,240
They ashed what outfit I liked on Dear, I said this.

1494
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,120
This outfit?

1495
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:58,040
Wow, amazing!

1496
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,160
Wonderful!

1497
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,960
That's awesome! The mafia woman!

1498
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,600
Follow me, rebellious lady.

1499
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,320
So beautiful!

1500
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,000
"Rebellious lady."

1501
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,800
Do I look like Ngo Pa?

1502
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,360
I put the flower on for you,

1503
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,920
how can you say Ngo Pa?

1504
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,440
The mafia woman.

1505
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,120
That gaze.

1506
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,680
I learned it from Lita.

1507
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,680
When did I teach you?

1508
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,600
Going crazy.

1509
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,480
When I saw that scene...

1510
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,360
so cute! What a cute scene.

1511
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,480
Pailiu is so handsome.

1512
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:03,960
When she turns around, I'm like, "Wow!"

1513
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,440

1521
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,080
This was the garden set, wasn’t it?

1522
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,600
And after we finished filming,

1523
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,560
I wanted to take a walk in the garden.

1524
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,240
I asked then. But it turned out

1525
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,960
they had already cleared all the plants,

1526
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,520
so I ended up taking some back with me.

1527
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,400
- Huh?
- I brought back the iris flowers

1528
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,920
and a rose plant, and now they’re
growing in front of the house.

1529
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Aw, so cute!

1530
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,200
I want to water it every day.

1531
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,000
Awesome.

1532
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,480
Was it fun? Did you like it?

1533
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,400
Yes, but I still have a lot to learn.

1534
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,880
But you did well already.

1535
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:06,600
I still don't know what speed is
when we're filming.

1536
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,600
I don't know either.

1537
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:08,880
I don't know either.

1538
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,120
What speed?

1539
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,800
Before action. I'm already in acting.

1540
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,680
That's right. You did well.

1541
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,560
Good job.

1542
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,800
Do I want to pair with Dear again?

1543
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,680
Yes, I do.

1544
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,360
I feel at ease. Yeah.

1545
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,000
Pailiu.

1546
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,800
It has to be...

1547
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,400
Pailiu.

1548
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,600
I feel at ease with her.

1549
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,800
I feel like

1550
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,480
I don't have to tense up.

1551
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,120
And I feel familiar with her.

1552
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,000
Yeah.

1553
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,520
Who do you want to pair up with today?

1554
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,800
Today? Anyone's fine.

1555
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,600
This week,

1556
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,200
I asked to be paired up with Ling.

1557
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,400
Is that okay?
