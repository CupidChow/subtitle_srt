1
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,080
I don't want to expect too much
because I feel like when it comes to pairing,

2
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,720
I still feel that...

3
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,880
I'm not sure who it is yet.

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,640
Right?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,040
Yeah, I don't want to change every week.

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,040
Do you feel like wanting to
just be paired with someone?

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,640
Honestly, right now there
should be someone that we...

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,480
Try it with this person and that's all.
We shouldn't be trying it with everyone anymore.

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,000
It's now the fifth week that the eight girls have
been living together in the Love Moment house.

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,320
Many pairs have started to show chemistry to the
point that they're turning into one true pairings.

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,120
But some are still disappointed, not having
been chosen to be the leads in the miniseries.

12
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,960
Will their past disappointments
push them to try even harder?

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,720
Let's cheer them on together.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,520
What are the girls doing this morning, I wonder?

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,840
Until when, 4 am?

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,800
We gossiped and went to sleep.

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,360
Haven't worked out like this in ages.

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,680
That's three. That's three.

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,640
Oh, there's wind.

20
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,440
Great job.

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,720
Proud of you guys.

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,520
I don't have one, but I want one today.

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,840
- What you bought yesterday, right?
- Yeah, and I ate this.

24
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,000
Here she comes.

25
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

26
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,760
Hello, hello.

27
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,360
When you see me, you know it's pairing time.

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,240
I'm not your teacher, no need to show respect.

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,360
I'm here to explain the pairing rules.

30
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,200
But this week's miniseries
is about love that ends in heartbreak.

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,160
So this time, I'm giving a chance
to those who've been disappointed in every round.

32
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,720
Those who haven't gotten
a lead role in the miniseries.

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,040
And they are...

34
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,120
June.

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,680
Wafer.

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,080
Neuanaow.

37
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,920
I'll let you three choose the person
you want to pair up with.

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,640
You have to think carefully whether to choose

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,200
someone you're comfortable with
or someone who helps you perform better.

40
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,200
But I think choosing someone...

41
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,280
who gives you both would be the best.

42
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,040
All right, you understand the rules now.

43
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,360
I'll give you time to discuss among yourselves.
See you in a bit.

44
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,680
You got it.

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,840
I was surprised and thought, "Who should I pick?"

46
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,320
I kept thinking who I should choose,
but honestly I already had someone in mind.

47
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,720
It's really in my favor this time,
since I've never been chosen.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,280
And since I get to choose first,
of course I'm picking Lita.

49
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,840
Why did you choose me this time?

50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,040
Well, in previous weeks, since week three,
I've been choosing you.

51
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,360
- Mm.
- And we've done workshops together,

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,200
but we've never been in the miniseries together.

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,360
And if not me, who else would you choose?

54
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,480
No one else.

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,840
Really?

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,560
- I choose you.
- For real?

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,720
Yeah, I insist in every interview
that I'd pick you.

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,920
What about the others? Why not them?
Why do you want to be paired with me?

59
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,280
I only want to be paired with you.

60
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,600
No matter what, Neuanaow always sticks to Lita.

61
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,200
What? Are you blushing?

62
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,080
Am I blushing?

63
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,960
I don't know, I'm blushing.

64
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,600
You're the one who's blushing.

65
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm happy we got paired again.
Because I wanted to be with you too.

66
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,320
Yeah. Let's see what the roles are.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,360
Do your best, so we can go on a date.

68
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,760
Of course I will.

69
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,320
"No, I'm pairing with you."

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,320
"The only answer is you. That's it."

71
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,800
Well, okay then.

72
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,280
Why? "Because I feel comfortable."

73
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,000
She's straightforward with me.

74
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,560
Very sweet.

75
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,880
Meanwhile, in another corner of the house,
another pair is talking too.

76
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,600
You said you'd pick me last night.

77
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,920
- When we went down for dinner.
- Yeah.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,160
I just felt I wanted to try pairing with Pai

79
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,160
because I've never paired with her,
so I just wanted to see.

80
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
I understand.

81
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,040
Yeah, because we've paired up a lot.

82
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,200
Yeah, true.

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,120
Yeah, understandable.

84
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,600
But honestly, at first I planned to
pair with you and keep improving.

85
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,920
It's fine, I just got dumped.

86
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,760
I'm sad.

87
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,800
Like you that day when you acted with Lita.

88
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,080
You went to Lita.

89
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,560
She chose Pai, so she came to talk to me like,
"Are you okay with that?"

90
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:26,920
I said yes. "You get to try something new.
Maybe you'll discover something better."

91
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,480
Is that a cookie?

92
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
No, it's that sticky thing.

93
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
It looks like a cookie.

94
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,440
Right?

95
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
But mine's gone.

96
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,880
Yeah, it's gone.

97
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
But hey...

98
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,160
Nice, who do you want to pair with today?

99
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,720
Today?

100
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Anyone is fine.

101
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,320
You think anyone's fine?

102
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,360
Yeah.

103
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,560
Like, you can try something new, a new experience.

104
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,880
Are you okay with that?

105
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,200
So you're chill and open about it.

106
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,640
So maybe this week
I will ask to be paired with Hling.

107
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,720
Sure.

108
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,160
There could be a new chemistry, June.

109
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,200
Maybe you'll click.

110
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,760
Because you might want to try it too.

111
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,600
I'm like, "Let's try."
Because we should open to it.

112
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,160
Right, there's still time.
If we're back together, then we're back together.

113
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,000
- Right?
- Yeah.

114
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,800
Yeah. Because honestly,
I care about you, if you're...

115
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,400
It's okay, I'm chill.

116
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,840
If you're okay if I...

117
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,240
Honestly, I kind of want to try
pairing with someone new too.

118
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,240
Mm.

119
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Yeah, we've paired up a lot so far.

120
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,440
We can pair up again later,
or just move on. It's fine. I'm chill.

121
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,080
That's crazy. I'm not moving on.
Honestly, I don't plan on that. I just feel that

122
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,840
we should try someone new,
because we talked about trying someone new.

123
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,840
Actually, we talked last week
we shouldn't pair up, like, "Hey, don't."

124
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,960
- You're right.
- And then suddenly…

125
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,880
Yeah, so we finally get to try this week.

126
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,440
Yeah, we do. Who knows?

127
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Good luck.

128
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,600
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

129
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,680
Me too.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
"Me too"? Shouldn't you say, "You too"?

131
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,680
What "me too"?

132
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,360
Me too when?

133
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,920
Me too where? Me too how?

134
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Yeah.

135
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,840
Okay.

136
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,160
We still have time.

137
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,200
I'll be right back.

138
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,040
You got it.

139
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,840
Even though Nice said okay,

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,160
why does she seem a little sad?

141
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,920
Me being with June might not be able to help her.

142
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,880
I feel if it's June and Hling,
they could give it a try.

143
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,520
I really want June to try.

144
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,840
Hling, what are you doing? Playing a game?

145
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah, I am.

146
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,480
Let me drop Pailiu a picture real quick.

147
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,320
Wanna join in?

148
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
I wanna take you outside.

149
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,120
Sure thing, Pippy.

150
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,360
Pippy.

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,800
We have to...

152
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,640
Outside, right?

153
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,560
Yeah, I want to...

154
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Okay.

155
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,000
Can I ask you something?

156
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,960
What were you talking about with Nice just now?

157
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,240
I was telling her
I wanted to pair with you this week.

158
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,320
But it's like...

159
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,520
Nice had said something similar before,
that she wanted to try pairing with someone new.

160
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,280
I see.

161
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,040
So that's why this week
I want to try pairing with you.

162
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,000
But who knows, I'm still very confused.

163
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,880
How did Nice know?

164
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,280
She guessed correctly.

165
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,840
At first, I was worried she might
not be okay with it, but she seemed totally fine.

166
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,000
Mm.

167
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,560
It's something new
because I want to try pairing with you.

168
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah, I want to pair with you too because...

169
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,000
When I see you, I feel...

170
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,200
frustrated.

171
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,480
Frustrated like...

172
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,760
Today I'll let Teacher Hling teach me.

173
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,240
Honestly, I'm not good at teaching yet.
I just feel like...

174
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,000
I want to act with you, right?

175
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,960
But deep down I'm scared I won't be able to do it.

176
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,560
- Oh.
- Yeah.

177
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,440
- So like...
- But actually, honestly...

178
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,600
This is not just lip service.

179
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,760
I really believe in you that you can do it. Yeah.

180
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,360
Because I really feel you're genuinely talented.

181
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,280
You're too kind.

182
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,200
Too kind, teacher.

183
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,680
I don't know, I've grown fond of June. The longer
we live together, I start to feel something.

184
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,680
There's just something charming about her.

185
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,360
And I got caught in that too.
I don't know when it happened.

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,760
Yeah.

187
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,440
Yeah, this game's fun.

188
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,720
No, it's not. There's more.

189
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,560
Come here for a sec.

190
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,240
- Huh? Me?
- Yeah.

191
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,200
Keep playing. Dear, play with her.

192
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,080
What is it?

193
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,040
Let's get over there.

194
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,960
Now Wafer is asking to talk with Pailiu.

195
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,040
I chose Pailiu because I've never paired with her.

196
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,240
Not even in a workshop,
so I wanted to try and see how it goes.

197
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,680
Because I've paired with Dear in two episodes.

198
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,640
And I've done a workshop with Nice, but with
Pailiu, it's like she's been out of my orbit.

199
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
We've never crossed paths.

200
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,080
Wafer has said before she wanted to try
pairing with me, but we never got the chance.

201
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,400
Whoever you're picking, just say it.

202
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,520
I'm picking Lita.

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,080
Will the girls be able to settle this?

204
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,320
I'm picking Lita.

205
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,400
I'm picking Lita.

206
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,600
Pick whoever you want.
She won't pick you. She'll pick me.

207
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,560
So confident.

208
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,280
No drama, guys.

209
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,320
June, who do you pick? Have you asked her?

210
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,840
- Say it.
- Is it the person sitting next to you?

211
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,160
- Yes.
- Okay.

212
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,480
I think everyone can tell.

213
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,680
Yeah, it's pretty obvious.

214
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,400
But their chemistry is great. I can't argue.

215
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,160
I wanna see.

216
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,560
- Yeah.
- I wanna see it.

217
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Me too.

218
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,960
What does this closeness mean?

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,920
Hey.

220
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,880
- Right away, the next person...
- No!

221
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,440
- Hey, what's this?
- A love triangle.

222
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,280
Really?

223
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,840
This story has a love triangle.

224
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,280
Who do you pick?

225
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,920
Us three, let's stand together,
and let her come to us.

226
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,440
Because now only Wafer is left.

227
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,240
- Do I turn around?
- Yeah.

228
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,920
This kind of activity is stressful.

229
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,480
This is a thrilling scene.

230
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,120
Do I pick someone now?

231
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,160
Turn around. Turn around.

232
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,640
Okay.

233
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,840
Don't look at the monitor or we'll know.
Close your eyes.

234
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,120
- Done.
- Ooh.

235
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,040
I already consulted with her.

236
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,200
I'm chosen.

237
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,200
I've paired with those two.

238
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,800
And now they're together.
How would you feel? Be honest.

239
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,880
Have you been paired?

240
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,800
- No.
- No.

241
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,760
First time?

242
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,000
- Yeah.
- We haven't either. So it's like...

243
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,560
But both Dear and Nice are good.

244
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,120
- Because Nice's good scene partner.
- Really?

245
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,120
I really wanna you two.

246
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,040
Dear, let's try.

247
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,680
You got it.

248
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,720
See? Told you.

249
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,920
Who's top? Who's bottom?

250
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,920
I feel I can act with Dear.

251
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,360
I feel she's similar to me.

252
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,240
So have the pairs been decided?

253
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

254
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,520
Okay, let's start with June. Who's you with?

255
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,400
Hling.

256
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,920
- With Hling.
- Yes.

257
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,240
And Neuanaow must be paired with Lita, right?

258
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,800
- Only her.
- It's obvious.

259
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,600
- Only her.
- I'm with Pailiu.

260
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,400
Okay, so Nice's paired with Dear.

261
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,160
There was no fighting over someone, right?

262
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,600
- No.
- No.

263
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,280
Okay. Then get ready to do
the workshop with Teacher Prang.

264
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,720
- Yay.
- Yay.

265
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,840
Good luck, everyone.

266
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,520
Even though deep down
they feel a little frustrated,

267
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,120
everyone still has a strong friendship.

268
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,160
They want to give their regular partner a chance
to pair with someone new and get a lead role.

269
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,040
The girls really love each other.

270
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,720
Hello, girls.

271
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,560
- Hello.
- Hello.

272
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,840
Time really flies. We're already halfway through.

273
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,040
Super fast.

274
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,720
That means you've improved, right?

275
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,680
- Maybe not yet.
- Maybe, maybe.

276
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,080
Last week's challenge
was characterization, remember?

277
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,320
This week's challenge is emotions.

278
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,160
You'll be acting in pairs.

279
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,520
Previously, I'd tell you the story first.
But this time I'll throw you right into it.

280
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,400
I won't tell you the story yet.
Do the exercise first.

281
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,560
And afterward,
stay focused when I tell you the story.

282
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,600
Please go sit.

283
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,520
First pair.

284
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,440
Lita and Neuanaow.

285
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,640
No need to sit.

286
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,960
Didn't even get to sit.

287
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,800
Stand there, stand in the middle.

288
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,680
Close your eyes. Calm your breathing first.

289
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,000
Imagine someone you truly love in real life.

290
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,360
Anyone you love or who is important to you.

291
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,440
Once you've chosen that person,

292
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,280
hug the person in front of you.

293
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,960
As if you were hugging the person in mind.

294
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,960
Keep your eyes closed.

295
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,440
And think that this is the last hug in your life.

296
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,080
The line for Lita is "thank you."

297
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,960
Neuanaow will say "I'm sorry."

298
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Thank you.

299
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,080
I'm sorry.

300
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,520
The challenge is to keep that emotion.

301
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,240
You two are a couple
who love each other very much.

302
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,400
But you have to break up,
and tonight is the last night you'll be together.

303
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,160
You love each other deeply,
but for whatever reason, you have to break up.

304
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,880
And when morning comes, you must leave each other.

305
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
No.

306
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,600
Take care of yourself.

307
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,400
Can you not go?

308
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,400
Wow.

309
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,720
This pair is so emotional. I'm gonna cry too.

310
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,240
Take care of yourself.

311
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,680
Walk away from each other.

312
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,520
Cut, shake it off.

313
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,800
Shake it off, shake it off.

314
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,200
Shake it off.

315
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,320
Exhale too.

316
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,040
Exhale too, baby. Yeah.

317
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,360
Tears really came
because we really felt it, and...

318
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,120
I actually loved what Teacher Prang taught today.
I got so much out of it.

319
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,400
Thinking about it makes me wanna cry.

320
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,000
June and Hling.

321
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,040
Close your eyes.

322
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,000
Choose one important person in your life.

323
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,800
And go in for a hug.

324
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,240
Even if you don't usually hug them,
this time hug them with your shadow.

325
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,880
Hling's line is...

326
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,600
"I love you so much."

327
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,840
June's line is "Me too."

328
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,120
I love you so much.

329
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,000
I love you so much.

330
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
I love you so much.

331
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,240
You're a couple who love each other very much
but have to break up. Same challenge.

332
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,680
But you both want to make this moment a good one.

333
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,120
You're not going to cry.

334
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,880
You'll smile and talk about the old days.
You'll make tonight meaningful, the best memory.

335
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,080
Thank you for everything.

336
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,560
You know?

337
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,200
You're always joking around.

338
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,800
Yeah. I know.

339
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,240
What is this?

340
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,040
It's the last day.

341
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,800
This is the first time they're together,

342
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,200
but they're so in tuned with each other.

343
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,160
So good.

344
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,520
See you later.

345
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,400
Cut.

346
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,440
The way I felt in that moment
was I normally don't cry.

347
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,960
But when I hugged her,
suddenly my tears came and like...

348
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,440
Yeah, it was this feeling,
a real feeling from inside.

349
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,360
I don't know who June was thinking of.

350
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,840
It felt I accidentally sent her
some kind of emotion,

351
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,600
and I felt when we hugged, our chests touched.

352
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,080
Our breathing was like...
It made me realize I could really feel her.

353
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,600
Yeah, that's right.

354
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,440
Nice and Dear.

355
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,000
Think of one important person in your life.

356
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,600
Hug each other.

357
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,560
As if you were hugging that person.

358
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,480
Even if in real life
you might or might not hug them.

359
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,200
Nice knows that you're about to die,

360
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,240
so you're leaving your last words.

361
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,000
And Dear knows Nice's fought so hard
for her treatment.

362
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,320
Nice hasn't lived for herself at all.
She's lived only for you.

363
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,040
Can you not go?

364
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,960
I'm not going anywhere yet.
We still have so much time together.

365
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,000
No, I want you to stay with me
for the rest of my life.

366
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
That's impossible.

367
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,280
Keep that, look into each other's eyes.

368
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,200
Even now, Dear, can you see that
Nice is really crying inside?

369
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,040
But outside she's still smiling to comfort you.
Can you see that, Dear? If you can, nod.

370
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,640
Okay, Dear, you don't want it
to be like this anymore

371
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,960
Dear, listen. You don't want Nice to act anymore.

372
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,840
Don't worry. I'll really be okay.

373
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,320
Smile a lot. Take care of yourself.
Eat something delicious.

374
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,640
Three...

375
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,440
Don't worry.

376
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,760
- I'll be fine.
- Two...

377
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,520
One. Cut. Shake it off.

378
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,880
- Shake it off.
- Wow, how is it so good?

379
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,880
I really loved being hugged. I felt that...

380
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,960
Being hugged was really fulfilling.

381
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,000
I was happy.

382
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,440
So I just burst into tears.

383
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:09,480
It was really overwhelming. When I opened my eyes
and saw Nice's face, tears just came.

384
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,520
When I opened my eyes, Nice was already
in tears, so my tears slowly came.

385
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,040
Choose one important person
in your life who is still alive.

386
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,240
And hug them.

387
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,280
As if the person you're hugging
isn't just a friend,

388
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,320
but someone truly important in your life.

389
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
Even if in real life you don't it.

390
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,240
The challenge is Pailiu, you're dying,
and you're saying goodbye.

391
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,120
Slowly release the hug.

392
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,440
And improvise.

393
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,000
You have to live on, okay?

394
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,840
One day we'll meet again.

395
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,120
No.

396
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,600
Please, no.

397
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,200
I'll always by your side.

398
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,960
No.

399
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,760
No.

400
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,360
And act with your eyes open.

401
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,600
No, I can't live on.

402
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,320
You have to live on. Be strong.

403
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,840
Ten.

404
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,000
No.

405
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,120
I can't live on.

406
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
You can.

407
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,520
No.

408
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,760
Five...

409
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,520
No.

410
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,880
- Four...
- You can.

411
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,160
Please, no.

412
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,640
Two...

413
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,400
I can't.

414
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,320
One last hug.

415
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,560
Cut. Shake it off. Breathe.

416
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,880
Oh, why is today's workshop so sad?

417
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,560
But everyone expressed their emotions so well.

418
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,000
Everyone's improved a lot.

419
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,800
Yes, be careful with your neck.

420
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,760
I felt every word.
When I make myself feel every word,

421
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,720
every word I say truly resonated with me.

422
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,120
So it became this immense feeling. Yes.

423
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,120
We really dug deep today.

424
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,200
The emotion was deep sadness.

425
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,320
That's not all.

426
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,600
Oh.

427
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,040
Because I have a god-like example...

428
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,000
Oh, my God.

429
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,400
to show you.

430
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,120
Give a round of applause to this special guest.

431
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,520
Hello.

432
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,440
- Hi.
- Hi.

433
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,600
GOY ARACHAPORN, ACTRESS

434
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,160
- Hi.
- Hi.

435
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,320
They were just crying. You heard them cry, right?

436
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,120
- All the way up there.
- Wow.

437
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,440
The sad vibes shook all the way up there.

438
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,320
Exactly.

439
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Goy, we agreed that you will perform for us.

440
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,280
I feel so pressured if I'm being honest.

441
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,640
But I'll try.

442
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,280
Who will you perform with?

443
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,120
With you of course. You're a master.

444
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,600
We'll perform together.

445
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,960
Wow, not only do Goy will perform for them today,

446
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,120
but Teacher Prang will also join.
Can't wait to see it.

447
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,840
Goy is really charming,

448
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,440
so my heart was fluttering.
Seeing Goy made me happy.

449
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,240
I was so excited, right in front of us.

450
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,800
I wanted to take pictures with her,
but there was no time. Such a pity.

451
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,400
I don't want to see you hurt,
and I don't like myself hurting you.

452
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,480
I'll deal with this by myself.

453
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,800
I can handle it. How hard could it be?

454
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,520
I can easily handle it.

455
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,280
No, I don't want to see you do that.

456
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,720
Goy.

457
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,320
I'm serious.

458
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,160
Who will take care of you?

459
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,760
I can take care of myself.

460
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,400
You don't need to be strong.

461
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,200
Please.

462
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,640
You don't need to anymore.

463
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,280
No.

464
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,400
Don't cry.

465
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,720
It's not that hard. I know it's not.

466
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,680
Let's fight together.

467
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
I'm begging you.

468
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,640
Okay, cut.

469
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,600
Goy, what techniques
do you use for dramatic scenes?

470
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,280
Please share with the girls.

471
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,280
I don't really have techniques,

472
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,040
but I think we need to know
what exactly we want from the scene.

473
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,760
I don't go into a scene and think,
"I'm gonna cry. I'm gonna be sad."

474
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,120
But rather, "What do I want
from this scene, and did I get it?"

475
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
Something like that.

476
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:10,120
I hope you guys will take what Goy shared and
her performance in your auditions this afternoon.

477
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,120
- Do your best, girls.
- Thank you.

478
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,520
All done?

479
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,200
Yes.

480
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,880
Hey, who hurt you, Goy?

481
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,920
- The girls bullied her.
- Get them, Jeab.

482
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,840
Really?

483
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,440
Wow, acting tough.

484
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,120
Suddenly acting tough.

485
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,400
Anyway, today's script is in my hands.

486
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,640
So everyone, take the techniques and tips
from today's class in your rehearsal,

487
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,720
because today's script is quite challenging.
Come get the scripts.

488
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,360
Thank you.

489
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,680
Yeah. Here you go.

490
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,760
Today's script is quite a challenging drama.

491
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,920
The main character, Wan,
has to face the truth about her lover, Ran,

492
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,680
and experiences ultimate heartbreak.

493
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,680
Plus this is the first time
many pair with each other.

494
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,440
Let's peek at the
girls rehearsing to see how it goes.

495
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,360
One, two, three, four.

496
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,240
One, two, three, four.

497
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
- Looks like...
- It works.

498
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,920
- Yeah. Right?
- So cute.

499
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,920
But I'm worried about stepping on your toes.
Let's rehearse a bit more.

500
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,360
Like this?

501
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,920
Yeah, go with the feel.

502
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,600
Okay, then go slowly.

503
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
Okay.

504
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,360
When I was holding Nice's hand,
I did it normally, but I was actually...

505
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,640
holding her hand like this.

506
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,080
It felt like this person
was really sending me her energy.

507
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,440
Do we go to the side too? Or do we just...

508
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,840
- I never did this.
- Me neither.

509
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,400
- Just go with the feel.
- Okay. Go slowly like...

510
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,160
we love each other and dance together.

511
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,840
I feel I'm more emotionally invested
in Wan than Ran.

512
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,480
And luckily, Dear's emotionally invested
in Ran than Wan, so it works out. Let's go.

513
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Something like that.

514
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,520
Okay, got it.

515
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,400
- Keep this one.
- I will.

516
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,160
- Something like that.
- I was worried you'd cry.

517
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,440
Not yet, not yet.

518
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,520
It's different.
In real life, you might cover it naturally.

519
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,400
But in a movie or a TV drama,
the audience needs to understand what's happening.

520
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,200
Or the audience should feel something is off,
so we need to expand the moment.

521
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,200
For example, "Can we stay together forever?"

522
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,520
This character's inner monologue is
"It's impossible."

523
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,080
Yes, you know you're dying.

524
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,640
There's this moment of impossibility,
then you cover it.

525
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,840
Ran.

526
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,560
Please marry me.

527
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,920
Thank you for loving me.

528
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,920
But if one day I'm not here anymore,
you have to live on.

529
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,320
Hey, what the hell are you talking about?

530
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,560
She's a little shy.

531
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,520
She would hug for just a moment,
while I wanted it to be a bit longer.

532
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,480
But since I couldn't get it, it was fine.
I went with it.

533
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,400
Do you want to loosen the hug
or want it to be longer?

534
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,640
I think we loosened it at first.
Then we tried hugging longer.

535
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,320
But after that, I think loosening feels better.

536
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,200
Because it went too long.

537
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,720
And June, you need to go deeper.
That option is impossible now.

538
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,200
- Mm.
- It means you need to find that emotion.

539
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,960
Maybe think of something in life
you regret deeply.

540
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,600
Actually, some words can convey
different meanings, and she explains it well.

541
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,040
And then, you get it? It's like...

542
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,400
It's not true.

543
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,680
- That's it.
- Got it.

544
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,960
That's it. I'm praying, "It's not true."

545
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,440
Okay, got it.

546
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,080
Please marry me.

547
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,280
Thank you for loving me.

548
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,760
Thank you for loving me.

549
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:43,600
Anything that would trigger me the most.
The touch is the hug. The words are "I love you."

550
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,200
Okay, cut for now.

551
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,720
See? The more the character covers her emotions,

552
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,360
- the more it hurts.
- It triggers.

553
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:55,080
It does, and not just for the actors.
The audience will be triggered too,

554
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,320
because they root for characters
who try their best.

555
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,400
I realized that was what being a great actor was.
It taught me a lot.

556
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Whatever feels most natural for you, do it.

557
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,520
I'm the only who doesn't know what to do.

558
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,720
I don't know where to put my hands.

559
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,200
One does this while the other does this

560
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
Something like this?

561
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
- Like this?
- Mm.

562
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,000
Then what?

563
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,920
Walk around.

564
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,680
Oh, that's all?

565
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,480
But don't do that. Don't do that. You have to...

566
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,520
Keep it smooth.

567
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,960
And spin.

568
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,040
So it's... Not choppy.

569
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,320
No, not like this. This is like...

570
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,400
Jerky.

571
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,320
But since my character has no idea,

572
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,960
she can't react like...

573
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,800
- Yes.
- "You..."

574
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,280
You must have an inner monologue.

575
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,560
My character is like... She has no idea.

576
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,480
Wafer and I performed once,
but I still felt like we weren't 100% there.

577
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,280
For making me realize when we truly love someone,

578
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,160
we can fall in love with them every day.

579
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,720
Ran.

580
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,360
Let's get married.

581
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,720
Yeah, that's it.

582
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,760
Fix the face.

583
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,120
Fix Goy's face again.

584
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,080
- Yes, because I felt it.
- Good.

585
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,680
Right? When you use the correct method,

586
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,280
the emotions ran through your body,
you didn't even realize.

587
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,920
When you do it correctly, like...

588
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,040
"I'm grateful to have you in my life."

589
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,000
When we really connect with our characters,

590
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,320
they feel it even more.

591
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,920
After I finished, I saw Goy cry.

592
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,240
Her tears. I was surprised by that.

593
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:53,200
I really felt that Wafer was truly Wan,
expressing her love to Ran.

594
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,400
Since the scene is difficult
and challenging for the girls,

595
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,560
it made everyone focus extra hard today.

596
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,040
If you start out like that,
the energy is different.

597
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,040
Okay?

598
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,040
I understand that you feel it,

599
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,640
but it's my brain that understands
while my emotions aren't fully active.

600
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,840
- Okay?
- Understand?

601
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,560
- Thank you.
- Find the right vocal register.

602
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,120
Yes, yes. I think the key is not to rush.

603
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,120
Shall we?

604
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,320
Before the auditions, the girls need to
find something to boost their confidence.

605
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,280
I'm ready.

606
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,560
- Fight.
- Fight.

607
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,200
Let's go.

608
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,560
And the script for this week's auditions
is called "Flower of Memory."

609
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,640
It's about a woman
planning to propose to her girlfriend,

610
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,560
but discovers the truth, forcing them apart.

611
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:50,360
Both are so heartbroken
they can't express it in words.

612
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,960
Today we'll let Goy
choose which pair to see first.

613
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,680
Who is the oldest?

614
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,360
Okay, if you go for the oldest,
it has to be that pair.

615
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,560
Wafer and Pailiu, right?

616
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,720
No pressure at all.

617
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,640
The youngest is 18.

618
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,040
The oldest is 28.

619
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,680
Even after changing seats.

620
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,160
I initially told Pailiu we wouldn't sit
at the first, third, or last table

621
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,040
because every time we sat there, we got called.

622
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,520
So we decided to sit at the second table,
but we got called anyway.

623
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,760
Ran, why are you wearing this dress?

624
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,440
Surprise!

625
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,440
What do you think?

626
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,440
Wow, what a surprise. Why are you wearing this?

627
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,160
Wan.

628
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,840
I have to tell you something.

629
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,560
Please marry me.

630
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,320
Ran.

631
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,720
I want to spend every second with you.

632
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,400
Ran, actually...

633
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,680
thank you for making me realize

634
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:32,240
when we love someone,
we can love them more every single day.

635
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,280
Ran.

636
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,680
Let's get married.

637
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,880
Here you go.

638
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,600
Ran.

639
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,160
Stay with me forever, okay?

640
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,360
But if one day...

641
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,240
I'm not here anymore,

642
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,240
you have to live on.

643
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,320
No, you have to be with me.

644
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,960
Tell me.

645
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,640
Say you'll find a way to live on.

646
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
Ran.

647
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,000
Ran!

648
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,880
Cut.

649
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,760
I was stunned because I could really feel
she was really shocked. She was in shock.

650
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,120
I was stunned, not only by her performance,
but she actually made me feel what she felt.

651
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,840
I saw this pair rehearse, and during rehearsal,
the moment they were together was very magical.

652
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,600
But as the first pair, understandably, they were
nervous, but we could see their journey.

653
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,680
- Great.
- Great job, both of you.

654
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,960
I was trying with stay with my scene partner.
I trusted Pailiu to keep me going.

655
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,120
And I really believed it in the moment.

656
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,360
Goy, which pair do you want to see next?

657
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,400
The first pair we saw in rehearsal.

658
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,920
Nice and Dear.

659
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,680
What is this?

660
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,600
Surprise!

661
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,520
Why are you this beautiful?

662
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,880
Actually, I have something to tell you.

663
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,800
Please marry me.

664
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,960
Of course.

665
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,520
Of course I will.

666
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,960
I want to be with you every minute, every second.

667
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,720
I feel like the luckiest person in the world.

668
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,640
If one day I'm not here anymore,
you have to live on.

669
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,160
Is something wrong?

670
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,520
Promise me, if I'm not here anymore,
you have to find a way to live on. Understand?

671
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,120
Ran?

672
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,760
Ran.

673
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,680
Ran.

674
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,200
Okay, cut.

675
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,600
Great job.

676
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,920
Goy, what do you think?

677
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,680
Since they're first pair I saw rehearse,

678
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,880
I think compared to the rehearsal,
they felt more together now, for me.

679
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,760
Also when they chose to speak
their inner monologues...

680
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,240
But I'm not sure if it was cheating,
because a lot of it was not scripted.

681
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,080
But having that extra bit made it...

682
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,360
flow better.
I mean both of you looked more together.

683
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,040
- Great job.
- Thank you.

684
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,880
You did a good job.

685
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,080
I think Dear did really well today, and we talked

686
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,320
about how impressed I was with her, truly.

687
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,600
We were slowly getting in tuned and...

688
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:41,360
I think we talked more,
so we were gradually getting in sync.

689
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,920
Let's go in this order. Number three.

690
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,720
Okay, June and Hling, please.

691
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,800
The first pair did well.
The second pair did well. Now the third.

692
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
I was nervous.

693
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,520
In that moment we hugged before we started.

694
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,000
Hey.

695
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,480
- What is this?
- Surprise!

696
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,880
Why are you all dressed up today?

697
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,600
I have something to tell you.

698
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,640
Please marry me.

699
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:27,360
I want to be with you every minute, every second.

700
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,120
I'm so lucky...

701
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,160
to have met you.

702
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,080
You've made me realize...

703
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,200
we can fall in love with someone every single day.

704
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,880
Ran?

705
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,800
Please marry me.

706
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,680
Thank you for loving me.

707
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,600
I want to stay like this forever.

708
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,160
But if one day...

709
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,560
I'm not here anymore, you have to live on.

710
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,320
Why are you saying this?

711
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,280
I can't possibly live without you.

712
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,640
If I'm gone, you have to find a way to live on.

713
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,960
You have to do it, Wan.

714
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,200
Ran?

715
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,680
Ran!

716
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,080
Ran!

717
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,480
Ran.

718
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,520
Okay, cut.

719
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,960
I saw how the news affected you.

720
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,240
I saw your physical reaction clearly,
that it really happened.

721
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:47,920
But as a pair, I felt that the love
I got from you both was lacking.

722
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,080
Slightly.

723
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,040
But I could see that
you were trying to be together.

724
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,920
I was actually satisfied.

725
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,920
But I feel the script
challenged me and it was fun.

726
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,720
June and I...

727
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,440
needed time, both of us, to adjust, learn,

728
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,120
or add techniques so June feels it more.

729
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,760
So that we're on the same page
and we'll perform better.

730
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,880
Lita and Neuanaow.

731
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,240
I was nervous. My legs were shaking.

732
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,000
So before we started, I hugged Lita.

733
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,560
And I felt calmer.

734
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,200
What is this?

735
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,280
Surprise!

736
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,680
Why are you wearing this dress?

737
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,760
Wan.

738
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,960
I have something to tell you.

739
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,280
Please marry me.

740
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,440
I want to spend every minute with you.

741
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,400
I'm really lucky.

742
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,400
You've made you realize...

743
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,320
it's possible to fall in love
with someone every single day.

744
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,920
Please marry me.

745
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,120
Thank you for loving me.

746
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,960
Thank you for loving me too.

747
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,080
Can you stay with me like this forever?

748
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,400
But if I'm gone,

749
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,880
you have to live on.

750
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,080
Why are you saying that?

751
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,640
Promise me.

752
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,920
That you'll find a way to live on.

753
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,640
Ran.

754
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,920
Okay, cut.

755
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,440
I think both of you
were really focused throughout.

756
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,000
I mean you knew what you were trying to do.

757
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,080
Even though some parts dragged out, but I think...

758
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,320
it was...

759
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,000
okay to go slow.

760
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,240
Even if it wasn't there yet, it was developing.

761
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,240
I think that's a good foundation.

762
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,960
- Okay.
- Thank you.

763
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:29,040
I told her she dug deep. She did well.
I'm happy with the performance today.

764
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,560
What do you think the girls did, Teacher Prang?

765
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,080
I'm actually surprised that every pair could cry.

766
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,760
Considering the time they were given.

767
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,880
- Yes.
- The quality was very impressive.

768
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,160
They are very new.

769
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,240
Many of them never acted before.

770
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,000
But they are talented. And I think...

771
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,480
Including the rehearsals, some pairs are magical.

772
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,560
For example?

773
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,760
Pailiu and Wafer. Because they...

774
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,680
I've seen a lot of dramas, but seeing them
brought tears to my eyes. It felt magical.

775
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:09,160
But other pairs also performed well.
Like Lita and Neuanaow. Top-notch, but...

776
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,320
They're very detailed.

777
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,120
But when they're paired, it felt...

778
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,920
They performed well.

779
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,400
Maybe...

780
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,240
Their channels weren't perfectly in sync.
Just a little off.

781
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,440
Yes, just a little off,
but every pair has improved a lot.

782
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,880
Credit to their teacher.

783
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,240
And our special guest.

784
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:34,040
I think we've made out decision.
Let's call the girls to hear the results.

785
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,040
Okay.

786
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:41,720
Every pair performed excellently today,
but only one pair will be chosen.

787
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,880
I have to say all of you did really well.

788
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,280
This is a very difficult decision
because many of you

789
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,800
have improved a lot compared to previous weeks.

790
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,640
Some went leaps and bounds.

791
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,040
So judging by performance alone was very close.

792
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,760
So today we considered chemistry,
compatibility, and the couple vibe,

793
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,880
that made us three
believe you two truly love each other.

794
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,120
And the pair who gets the roles today is...

795
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,520
Pailiu and Wafer.

796
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,360
Really?

797
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,040
Thank you.

798
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,440
I'm disappointed because I didn't get that spot.

799
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,040
"I'll get the role for sure today."
I texted my parents.

800
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,160
"I cried a lot today.
I'll get the role for sure." No, I didn't.

801
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,200
I'm tired. Ah! I'm tired!

802
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,320
I'll evaluate based on the whole day.

803
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:51,120
The moments between you two
in rehearsal were quite impactful.

804
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,600
And I feel it's a memorable image for me.

805
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:01,400
You have the chemistry that feels natural
and convinces me you're genuinely in love.

806
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,360
Wafer, I'm very impressed with you today
for improving leaps and bounds.

807
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,080
Out of every time I've seen you perform,
this is the time I really believe you can act.

808
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,240
And you did very well today.

809
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,640
All of you did.

810
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:21,920
So do your best on set.
We'll support and cheer for you.

811
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,200
Well done, everyone.

812
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,280
I'm happy because I get to try,
but it was really hard. But I did it.

813
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,720
I was shocked.
I was really shocked. I turned to ask her.

814
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,600
I must have looked totally stunned.
I couldn't believe it.

815
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,880
Like, "Really?" "For real?" I couldn't hide
my reaction because I was so stunned.

816
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,040
But I'm happy.

817
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:51,400
I'm happy I get to work on set with Wafer
and show her around since she hasn't done it.

818
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,480
Scene 1, shot 1, take 1.

819
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,280
If you don't eat, I'll kiss you.

820
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,720
Then I'm not eating.

821
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,720
Oh, we had a kissing scene at the table.
Did I blush?

822
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,520
Of course I did.

823
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,120
But I've kissed so many people so far.

824
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,840
Do I have to kiss anyone else?

825
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,200
Pack up, pack up your stuff, and head back.

826
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,840
Don't die, okay?

827
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,120
What is this?

828
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,040
Pickled clam spicy salad.

829
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,720
Wafer, you can do it.

830
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,560
Look at me like I'm a dog.

831
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,880
What's its name again?

832
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,760
Thung Ngoen.

833
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,560
Then I'll be Thung Ngoen for you today.

834
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,560
No.

835
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,800
Then you will be sad.

836
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,640
It would be too much of a curse on her.

837
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,480
Oh, really?

838
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,480
It was fun, and the food was great.

839
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,440
I'm impressed.

840
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,600
Today I got to see Wafer in a different look.

841
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,400
Dressed more girly.

842
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,720
So pretty.

843
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,960
With flowers. Like someone bought them for me.
But no one did.

844
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,200
The ghost brought them.
I don’t want it to be just a dream.

845
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,040
Wow.

846
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,000
A ghost.

847
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,040
A lot of things impressed me.
During work, Pailiu is serious.

848
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:17,040
I feel really lucky to be paired with Pailiu.

849
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,920
And action.

850
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,080
Okay, cut.

851
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,160
Okay, you're done.

852
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,840
Looks like the work went smoothly with no issues.

853
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,080
So today where is Wafer taking Pailiu on a date?

854
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,840
Omakase. Omakase.

855
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,080
- Yay, it feels worth it.
- I'm happy.

856
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,040
Super happy.

857
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,280
I'm hungry now.

858
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,400
Our names, Pailiu and Wafer.

859
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,080
We'll be sitting here.

860
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,400
- Please.
- Thank you.

861
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,680
So sweet.

862
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,520
We'll scoot over a bit.

863
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,520
Thank you.

864
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:11,960
Sis.

865
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,280
Want some?

866
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,400
Gonna feed me?

867
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,280
- Let's clink.
- Oh

868
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,760
Thought you were feeding me.

869
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,920
- "Gonna feed me?"
- Let's clink.

870
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,920
Wait a second.

871
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,800
How do you hold chopsticks?

872
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,120
Like this.

873
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,200
Why do I hold them differently?

874
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,280
Any way you want, sis.

875
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,240
That's it. Yeah.

876
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,200
Ah, then grab it.

877
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,520
It's funny.

878
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,840
You're like a kid.

879
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,840
Slide it here and try again.

880
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,080
Stop. Yes. I feel like I'm teaching a kid.

881
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,480
- That's it.
- Yay!

882
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:47,840
Be careful.

883
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,560
- I got it.
- Eat it, sis. Eat first, no more clinking.

884
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,480
Good job. Agh! Good job. It's okay.

885
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,280
Why does Wafer
become like a little dog around Pailiu?

886
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,200
How was the shoot for you?

887
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,800
- Nervous.
- Right?

888
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,400
- I was nervous but…
- But you were so chill. You told me

889
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,320
- in the car.
- Yes.

890
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,760
No, I was chill because the scene wasn't hard.
For me, it wasn't hard. It was like…

891
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,600
Walking from the car into the house.

892
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,480
- Oh, shopping.
- Something like that.

893
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,800
So I didn't have to do much.

894
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,640
- What was hard was the scene where...
- You cried?

895
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,840
Yes, the crying was hard.

896
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,840
How was that scene?

897
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,520
I was watching the monitor.

898
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,680
And the atmosphere was so gloomy.

899
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,600
- Yes. Yes.
- Everything was so quiet.

900
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,760
And I heard Wafer crying.

901
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,320
I'm proud. I'm proud of you.

902
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,720
- Me too.
- Great job.

903
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,000
Thank you for taking me to omakase today.

904
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,680
- Wow.
- Wow.

905
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,240
Yes, this makes the filming
and the crying worth it.

906
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,320
It does.

907
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,440
Makes the dramatic scene worth it.

908
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,600
That day.

909
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,920
Wafer is a cheerful and talkative girl.
Spending time with her is never boring.

910
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,960
We talked a lot because Wafer talks a lot.

911
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,920
Let's go.

912
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,720
Wow, everything looks yummy.

913
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,680
So Japanese.

914
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,960
Wow, we got it. Looks so yummy, sis.

915
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,040
Should we sit there?

916
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,080
Okay. Let's.

917
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,320
Can I have this one?

918
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,160
This one's good.

919
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,960
It's milky. You have to try.

920
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,920
Here, here.

921
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,440
You have to try it.

922
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,080
Wafer!

923
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,880
Just kidding, go ahead.

924
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,280
Let me try it.

925
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,560
Go ahead.

926
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,720
- Is it good?
- Yes.

927
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,560
- It tastes like strawberry milk.
- Yes.

928
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:19,240
I used to have a cat called Gus-chan.

929
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,120
It's an orange Persian cat.

930
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,160
Fluffy. Proud. Walked like a queen.

931
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,120
I can imagine.

932
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,320
Yeah, that's the vibe.

933
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,320
And she was so proud.
If you called her, she wouldn't come.

934
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,480
It just strutted like a queen.

935
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,440
But one day she died.

936
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,760
I remember that feeling.
Like I was screaming in a dark room.

937
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,880
Screamed in heartbreak. Totally shattered.

938
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,880
And I blamed myself for a while for not
taking good care of her. You know what I mean?

939
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,960
How old were you?

940
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,120
In my teens. Back then. High school maybe.

941
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,200
Junior or senior high. I don't remember.

942
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,720
I was heartbroken. So…

943
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,120
I don't dare have cats again.
I mean buying one and take care of them myself.

944
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,960
- Being their owner.
- You were hurt.

945
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,520
Yeah, so I don't dare do it.

946
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,240
You reflected like, if only you had
taken better care of her that day. Right?

947
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,600
Like with Thung Ngoen. Look at her face.

948
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,720
- So cute.
- Look at her face.

949
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,360
She looks like a deer.

950
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,560
Right? A white deer.

951
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,680
Exactly.

952
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,520
- So both of them love animals.
- Looks more like a deer than a dog.

953
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,640
Wait a sec.

954
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,640
Wow, their legs are very long.

955
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,840
Wanna check them out?

956
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,560
They're the same breed as Thung Ngoen.

957
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:39,920
Hey.

958
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,240
Don't be scared.

959
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,760
Why are your legs so long?

960
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,080
They're so tall.

961
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,720
This one. Head it.

962
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,360
We're wrecking their shop.

963
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,640
It's called Monthong.

964
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,360
If they can stand, they'll be taller than you.

965
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,400
They were higher than me when they jumped.

966
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,560
If they can stand, they'll be taller than you.

967
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,880
Hello!

968
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,960
Hey, look at them wait.

969
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,520
- They're well-behaved.
- They know to wait.

970
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,120
Yeah, they're well-behaved.

971
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,480
I'll sent them to my mom.

972
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,680
One day I'll bring Thung Ngoen to you.

973
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,520
- Pailiu.
- So pretty.

974
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,960
Yes, bring her.

975
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,480
Sit down.

976
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,440
Sit down.

977
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,000
Good job, take it.

978
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,480
Stop, Monthong.

979
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,280
Two of them?

980
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,840
Pailiu once told me she was scared of big dogs.

981
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:31,640
So I said, "Okay, no problem.
I'll protect you since I like dogs anyway."

982
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,000
What's this one's called?

983
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,680
This is a puppy.

984
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,040
Monthong. Monthong.

985
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,000
Here. See?

986
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,960
- Monthong, come here.
- Sit down.

987
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,640
Give me your paw.

988
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,720
And then what?

989
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,960
Give it to him.

990
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,080
Okay, hello.

991
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,560
Put it in my hand.

992
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,640
Hello.

993
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:51,840
Hello.

994
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,840
- I see.
- Okay.

995
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,080
- Good boy.
- Cute.

996
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,120
Good boy.

997
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,560
Come here first.

998
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:07,920
It's a different vibe from other dates,
but I can't help smiling.

999
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,960
The more time we spent together,
the more I felt, like, "Oh, okay."

1000
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:20,360
I don't know how to explain it,
but I feel like I want to do it again.

1001
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,240
- Hello.
- Hi.

1002
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,280
Hi, friends.

1003
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,680
How was the date? Was it fun?

1004
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,760
We're back.

1005
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,800
What did you eat?

1006
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,000
- Omakase.
- Yes.

1007
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,960
We ate a lot.

1008
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,360
And Wafer said...

1009
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,440
"Will we get full?"

1010
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,200
Yes.

1011
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,640
- "Will we get full?"
- In the car.

1012
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,720
- Yes.
- Well?

1013
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,520
So full.

1014
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,880
- But it was so good.
- You have to try.

1015
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,760
Did you eat a lot?

1016
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,200
We did. We had green tea.

1017
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,640
Green tea, strawberry milk, desserts.

1018
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,680
There was no food at home.

1019
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,080
There's so much food here.

1020
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,840
When was that?

1021
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,800
- Okay, it's coming.
- Sit down

1022
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,400
Let's watch the series, girls.

1023
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,120
I want to watch too.

1024
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,720
Our first drama.

1025
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,240
Ooh, you're flight attendant.

1026
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,840
If you don't eat, I'll kiss you.

1027
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,400
Then I'm not eating.

1028
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,720
Like a dog getting abandoned.

1029
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,960
I don't want to go either.

1030
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,680
Wafer really surprised me because...

1031
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:12,840
her eyes showed the real love
she has for Pailiu in the story.

1032
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,120
It felt like they were really a couple.

1033
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,360
Wafer really wowed me.

1034
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,640
She's amazing.

1035
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,080
If you're a fan,

1036
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:30,800
you can watch episode five
of the Love Moment miniseries

1037
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,200
titled "Flower of Memory"

1038
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:38,520
only on Kantana Motion Pictures'
YouTube channel and WeTV.

1039
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,320
Don't forget to follow the show
and support our girls.

1040
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,400
I can't live without you.

1041
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,080
You both are amazing.

1042
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:58,080
I really want to know who wants to
fight for the date in the next episode.

1043
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,160
I want to because I haven't done it yet.

1044
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,440
Do you want to go?

1045
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,000
If it's you, of course I want to.

1046
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,080
I want to.

1047
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,320
Only these two are left?

1048
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,440
So next episode, you have to fight me.

1049
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,320
- Sure thing.
- Who are you talking to?

1050
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,680
She's talking to June.

1051
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,840
Neuanaow...

1052
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,880
already called dibs on me.

1053
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,800
She said clearly in front of the other six that

1054
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,800
"You can't take her." In her style.

1055
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,760
I feel like we speak the same language.

1056
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,320
Yes, and I don't have to
try to act mature with her.

1057
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:35,160
After five weeks, everyone has pairing up
and spent time together.

1058
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:39,200
All of them are probably
clearer about how they feel.

1059
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,400
But what does each girl think?

1060
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,640
June, who do you want to pair with?

1061
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,200
Like this.

1062
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,280
And you?

1063
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,120
One person.

1064
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,200
I want to know since
everyone wants to pair with you, Lita.

1065
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,440
Who do you have in mind? And how many?

1066
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,040
She's been clear.

1067
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,720
She's been clear from the start.

1068
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,720
What about you, Dear?

1069
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,560
Yeah.

1070
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,800
Dear's been quiet.

1071
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,240
This won't do.
You can't do this. Give us a number.

1072
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,200
One.

1073
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,240
Just one.

1074
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,720
Whisper her name right here.

1075
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,960
- You've asked everyone, right?
- Yeah.

1076
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:20,120
Then let me ask you, Pailiu.
Do you have someone in mind?

1077
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,720
- She's a player.
- She's popular.

1078
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,040
Yes, yes, yes.

1079
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,280
Really? How many?

1080
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:28,880
Don't know.

1081
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,040
How many?

1082
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,200
Not many.

1083
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,200
- Not many.
- Not many.

1084
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,720
- Not many.
- We're not many.

1085
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,480
Eight people isn't that many.

1086
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,400
Not even ten.

1087
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,880
Not eight. Not eight.

1088
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,960
Must be seven.

1089
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,120
Seven, not including her.

1090
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,320
Not that many.

1091
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,520
She's not committed.

1092
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,720
Next episode, I'll get you, Pailiu.

1093
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,800
What do I do? She's sulking.

1094
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,240
Oh, I'm stressed. I don't know what to do.

1095
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:55,080
June likes Hling, so I'm like,
"Hey, if you like her, keep going."

1096
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,360
Yes.

1097
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,560
Honestly, I want to try Pailiu.
I said I wanted to pair with Pailiu.

1098
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,880
I want to try. I like her.

1099
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,560
Hling? But I'm not sure.

1100
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:10,080
I want to keep pairing with June,
but I have to see if she feels the same.

1101
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:17,520
The challenge for pairing today is
to show dedication to the person you choose

1102
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,280
by making a gift for that person.

1103
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,400
Come out now.
