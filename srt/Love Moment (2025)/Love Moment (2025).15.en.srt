00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,720
Over the past seven weeks on "Love Moment,"
the eight girls have lived together.

2
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,400
Through challenges and obstacles,
they've learned about each other.

3
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,360
And today, we'll see
the conclusion of their stories in this house.

4
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,520
I feel like I didn't do that well.

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,800
Lita and Nice

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,480
Just ask her.

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,240
She's in the kitchen, go ask her.

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,080
She's really crying.

9
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,200
What's your favorite animal, Pailiu?

10
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,160
Beautiful. Amazing.

11
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,680
I want to try pairing with Pai
because I've never paired with her.

12
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,120
So I just want to try it.

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,400
Even with the missing part,

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
it's still beautiful.

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,200
But I'll remember who I went with.

16
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,360
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

17
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,360
Of course.

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,640
Don't stress, bro. Chill.

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,520
I'll try pairing with June first.

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,720
So Pailiu chose June.

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,400
Yes.

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,160
What's the difference?

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,520
Right now,
all eight girls are spending time at the beach.

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:02,800
We have no idea if being outside the house will
make them change the answers in their hearts.

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,120
But today, they'll have to decide whose hand
they want to take while leaving this house.

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,080
Get things ready for our friends.

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,840
Excuse me, Neua, may I walk?

28
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,680
Yes, go ahead.

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,400
Eight people.

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,440
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

31
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,680
And another one.

32
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,680
Gonna be a little lonely.

33
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,840
The left side, right?

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,920
Anywhere is fine.

35
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,640
Because the sea is on the right side.

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,480
Sure.

37
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,440
Okay.

38
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,560
Beautiful.

39
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,800
Beautiful. Great job.

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,360
Now we're waiting for the food.

41
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,000
This one is crab.

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,080
What's that?

43
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,880
Crab too.

44
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,880
Maybe stop for now.

45
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,680
Yeah.

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,280
Whoever wants squid, go ahead.

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,440
I get to eat squid.

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,920
Hey, hello!

49
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,520
Hello!

50
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,720
You got here fast.

51
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,240
A lot of your favorites.

52
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,840
Come eat.

53
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,200
Bought shrimp and crab for you.

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
I thought you'd like it.

55
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,720
There's mantis shrimp.

56
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,560
Let me see.

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,760
There's mantis shrimp.

58
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,040
Come, come.

59
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,400
There's squid too.

60
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,760
Pickled shrimp, horseshoe crab, squid.

61
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
Sit down.

62
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,880
Sit down.

63
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,800
Did you have fun?

64
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,040
We had a blast.

65
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,920
We had a blast today.

66
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,200
Neuanaow and Lita would love it
because it was very adventurous.

67
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,120
-You know how to deshell it?
-I want oyster.

68
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,280
You don't know how, right?

69
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,040
Deshelling it for me?

70
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,400
I can do that.

71
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,040
Because I already know how.

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,960
She's an expert.

73
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,160
She was bragging on our way here that,

74
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,640
"I'm an expert on..."

75
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,040
No, it's because when I was a kid…

76
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,320
Which is male, which is female?

77
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,440
Here, I'll show you how to tell the difference.

78
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,920
The round one, the female, has eggs.

79
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
But the male...

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,920
Not this one.

81
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,560
This one is male.
It's pointy and the meat is dense.

82
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,800
It depends if you want eggs or meat.

83
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,160
Let me join you.

84
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,200
Come eat.

85
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,320
Lita.

86
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,400
Wait a sec.

87
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,280
Let me arrange them.

88
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,560
I don't think so. I think it's just the shell.

89
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,800
Let me see.

90
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,160
Oh, break it in half.

91
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,160
I told you no need to deshell it.

92
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,160
You'll do it for me?

93
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,320
Oh, it has eggs.

94
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,440
How has it been staying here today?

95
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,400
Good.

96
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,360
-Really?
-Chilling.

97
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,520
Very, yeah.

98
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,320
-Has it?
-Eating and lying around.

99
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,440
Want mantis shrimp?

100
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,280
-We came to surprise you.
-Want shrimp?

101
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,800
I really had no idea you'd come.

102
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,240
-Really?
-Yes.

103
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,760
I had no idea. Suddenly your video call came.

104
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
We were shocked, like,

105
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,080
-oh, everyone came?
-You're here. You can't leave us at home.

106
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,040
-True.
-Yeah.

107
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,400
-For chaos.
-Which sauce is better?

108
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,200
Want some?

109
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,160
I have some.

110
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,960
I think the red one.

111
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,000
Want some squid?

112
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,120
Very spicy. Don't try if you can't.

113
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,120
Someone's deshelling shrimp for me.

114
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,600
Are you bragging?

115
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,200
Here. Open.

116
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,240
Eat.

117
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,240
Yes.

118
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,320
Wow, so sweet.

119
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,080
This pair's making everyone else jealous again.

120
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,320
Can I have a tissue? Give me a tissue.

121
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,720
It's amazing.

122
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,760
Like beard.

123
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,760
I wanna try that.

124
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,280
The price for treating me crab.

125
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,640
My finger hurts. I can't eat.

126
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,680
Jeez!

127
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
I'll feed you. Anyone wants some?

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,920
Here you go.

129
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,360
What about this part?
I don't wanna waste the meat.

130
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,800
-The laughter.
-It's loud.

131
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,000
-Not ladylike at all.
-Thanks.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,240
Dear is really taking care of Pai.

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,160
-Beautiful, right?
-Come.

134
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,720
Be careful.

135
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,680
Yay!

136
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,920
One, two, three.

137
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,520
Mine doesn't have sauce.

138
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,440
You don't eat sauce?

139
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,200
I don't eat veggies and spicy food.

140
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,200
You don't eat veggies and spicy food.

141
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,600
You don't eat veggies and spicy food,
but you eat clams.

142
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,080
It's like we're out at sea.

143
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,520
We are.

144
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,680
The atmosphere is amazing.

145
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,160
But since you only get one night here,
you all should make the most of it.

146
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Honestly,
it feels like a farewell trip for all eight of us.

147
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,840
Getting to go outside
and spend time together not in the house.

148
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,160
Spending time outside. So I'm happy and

149
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,400
I love that we get to spend time together.

150
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,360
Hling and Wafer sit outside and talk.

151
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,280
Are they opening up to each other?

152
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Yesterday when I said that,
I forgot to consider your feelings.

153
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,400
But it's the truth, because I tend to
say things very clearly, right?

154
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:06,040
I just realized that I might have
prioritized June's interests too much.

155
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,560
But when I paired with you,

156
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,720
when we hadn't gone out on a date,
I didn't really pay attention to you.

157
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,520
And you said, "It's up to you."

158
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,520
Did that hurt your feelings at all?

159
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,480
-When you didn't get that.
-No.

160
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,520
-Not at all?
-No.

161
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,960
And I'm sure of it.
I wasn't hurt or felt that it wasn't okay.

162
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,200
Honestly, at first I didn't feel anything.

163
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,080
I just felt that...

164
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,680
I wanted to fully support everyone.

165
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,480
I was fine.
And I wasn't upset we didn't go. I didn't feel...

166
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,240
I felt that you must have been tired that day.

167
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,520
So I feel if someone really expect to go,
maybe pairing with you would disappoint them.

168
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,920
So I didn't mind.

169
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,520
Because...

170
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,680
Yes.

171
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,960
At the time, I probably wasn't thinking much.

172
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,640
Until some time passed,

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,880
I thought back and realized I wanted to thank you

174
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,200
for always considering other people's feelings.

175
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,160
Yes, and today I called you out here
because I wanted to say

176
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:39,640
thank you for everything, for being there,
being a good friend and confidant, and...

177
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,160
every effort you made for me.

178
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,720
You might not mind doing it at all,
but I really value everything you did.

179
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,200
I wanted to know her true feelings

180
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,240
now that I've realized
what I really want in someone.

181
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:08,960
So I wanted to know what she felt
while I hadn't realized my own feelings.

182
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,640
I don't know if Wafer's answer
has confirmed Hling's feelings.

183
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,480
But opening up like this feels so good.
It's indescribably uplifting.

184
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,640
Ouch.

185
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,480
Sis, I hit my head on the pool edge.

186
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,520
Every meal, every day.

187
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,800
Shall we jump?

188
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,920
I'm ready.

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,360
While others are being emotional,

190
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,760
some are having fun and chilling

191
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,960
as if there were only two of them in the world.

192
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,160
I want to play on the slide.

193
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,800
Go ahead. I did. But you have to push hard.

194
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,720
Push what?

195
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,360
Push hard from up there or you won't slide down.

196
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,200
Why is it clanking?

197
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,800
What a smooth slide.

198
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,280
That was too scary.

199
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,520
I'll do it again.

200
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,240
This will be my third time.

201
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,200
Such a nice atmosphere, and it's a great memory.

202
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,680
Love it.

203
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,960
In the first impression round
when they made us choose a partner,

204
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,680
I felt I was following my feelings.

205
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,240
Because my first impression was
you had something that made me want to choose you.

206
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,400
So I wrote on the paper that I chose Neuanaow
because she looked cheerful.

207
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,880
And I felt this girl had something
I wanted to explore further.

208
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,040
Because you were being you. With others,
I felt they weren't being themselves fully yet.

209
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,280
But you were being you.

210
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,800
The more I got to know you,
the more I felt there was more to explore,

211
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,520
And I like that you're being yourself.

212
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,520
And that allows me to be myself.

213
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,720
Right?

214
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,640
Yes.

215
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,920
Of course.

216
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,000
Of course.

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,720
-Definitely.
-Why are you blushing?

218
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,720
I'm not talking to you.

219
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,000
I'll play instead.

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,640
I'll do that too.

221
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,720
I'll play instead.

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,520
You're so light in the water.

223
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,880
So light.

224
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,520
Like you weigh 200 grams.

225
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,480
Let's go.

226
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,760
I'm grateful that she chose me from the beginning.

227
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,920
I'm grateful that she's been
teaching me and keeping me level-headed.

228
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I've got someone to guide me
so I don't have to walk alone in the dark.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,600
At least I have someone to hold my hand.

230
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,440
Ooh,

231
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,800
someone has asked Nice for a chat on the swings.

232
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,920
More.

233
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,760
More than me?

234
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,040
Oh.

235
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,640
It's even.

236
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,160
-I'm kidding.
-Eh?

237
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,680
-Okay
-Because you're bamboo on a mountain.

238
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,800
Oh, okay.

239
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,000
No bamboo in the sea.

240
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,720
So you don't like it.

241
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,520
That's not why.

242
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,720
You don't like mountains

243
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
That's not why.

244
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,840
Goodness, I'll stop talking.

245
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,240
I sound bad.

246
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,040
During training.

247
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,240
It was hard for my mom to get pregnant.

248
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,000
So my parents prayed to Guanyin
overlooking the sea in Hong Kong, China.

249
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,240
-Really?
-Yes. Praying for a child.

250
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,760
She wanted a child. After a while she got pregnant

251
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,560
Yeah?

252
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,680
Yes, and Mom said
I've loved the sea since I was little.

253
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,040
I always cried when we had to leave.

254
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,120
Really?

255
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,760
And I just noticed.

256
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,720
I don't wanna act like this.
It's like I'm showing off.

257
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,840
-It looks cool but...
-Why?

258
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,240
Use it to cover your skirt.

259
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,840
I see.

260
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,120
Yeah, because it's...

261
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,320
But it's a…

262
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,400
I don't know. It could be revealing.

263
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,560
Wait, what should I do?

264
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,480
It's revealing.

265
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,440
Thank you.

266
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,280
So cool.

267
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,160
Maybe like this.

268
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,400
Yeah, a little bit here.

269
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,080
But I love faces like yours.

270
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,440
-Really?
-Yes, faces like yours.

271
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,680
I love them. I find them very attractive.

272
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,920
Really? But I feel I have a bland face.

273
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,280
No. How?

274
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,680
Not bland at all.

275
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,760
In the way that makeup disappears quickly.

276
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,800
With you, it stays. Why? With me, it's gone.

277
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,600
-You mean the makeup?
-Yes

278
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,480
Faded?

279
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,000
-Yes, I'm like a blank sheet of paper
-You don't know how.

280
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,680
Wow, alright. Then you have to teach me.

281
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm really like a blank sheet of paper.

282
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,800
I don't know if one day
we're together, if I choose you...

283
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,920
I'm afraid you'll change.

284
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,640
Why?

285
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Don't know. I don't know why either.

286
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,680
With someone else, are you afraid they'll change?

287
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,680
Or you feel that way about everyone?

288
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,280
Yeah, I'm really afraid, you know.

289
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,160
Don't know why.
Will you? Do you think you'll change?

290
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,680
No.

291
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,080
If I have a partner, I'll never leave them.

292
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,760
Why?

293
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,760
How could we? We chose each other.

294
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,320
What if one day you two get into a fight?

295
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,560
Then I'll try to make up.

296
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,160
What if it's you who's angry?

297
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,240
If that's the case...

298
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,280
If I'm angry or upset, I might sulk.
And if they don't make up, I'll do it myself.

299
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,800
Understand?

300
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,760
I'm someone who...

301
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,960
I sulk for a very short time.

302
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,000
-Really?
-Yes

303
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,720
But you can't stand awkwardness, right?

304
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,800
Yes

305
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,240
So tell me if you're upset.

306
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,800
Yes.

307
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,800
You seem very stubborn, do you know that?

308
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,560
Why?

309
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,160
You look like a stubborn kid.

310
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,800
-I'm not.
-Stubborn kid.

311
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,720
Don't know why,
but you have the stubborn kid vibe.

312
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,920
I'm not stubborn at all.

313
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,160
Can I join you?

314
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,640
-Yes.
-Come on, come on.

315
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,560
No straw. I'm bringing you this.

316
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,280
-Oh, thank you.
-Dear, sit with us.

317
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,800
There's no space.

318
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,640
Wanna find somewhere else to sit?

319
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,920
There, we'll sit by the pool.

320
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Wanted to ask you to check out the sea with me?

321
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,120
-I see.
-Are you free?

322
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,560
Just you two? I'll get out of the way.

323
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,800
-Okay.
-It's fine.

324
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,600
Wanna come with us?

325
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,240
Do you want me to come?

326
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,000
Seriously.

327
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,280
From the heart. Then I won't. I'll stay with June.

328
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,400
Okay, okay, okay.

329
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,080
-Let's go.
-I'm sorry.

330
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,840
Dear, sweetie, you even interrupted Nice
to ask Pai to talk privately.

331
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,640
She must have something important to say.

332
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,680
She has a lot to consider, like her criteria.

333
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,840
In that moment
I wanted her to feel most comfortable.

334
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,440
Inviting you to stargaze.

335
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,640
No stars tonight.

336
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,640
So bad.

337
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,840
I'm not subtle at all?

338
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,280
What the heck. Not subtle at all.

339
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Inviting me to watch the sea makes sense.
But not to stargaze.

340
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,400
So bad.

341
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,560
Are you tired?

342
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,560
No.

343
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,880
Is being hot tired?

344
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,040
I'm not hot.

345
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,880
You're not hot? You're cool?

346
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,160
The show is about to end.

347
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,720
So I want to turn our last moments

348
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,760
into the best memory.

349
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,440
Because I don't know we'll meet again
once we go back to real life.

350
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,120
So I want a nice moment before the show ends.

351
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,080
You're a lovely kid. Very lovely. You're nice.

352
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,160
I'm lovely, then what?

353
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,320
I'm lovely, so...

354
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
I mean lovely.

355
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,320
I see, okay, just lovely, nothing more.

356
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,720
I actually planned a firework surprise, but...

357
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,800
the budget ran out.

358
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,040
With no budget, the sky is clear.

359
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,720
I see.

360
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,000
No, I considered the pollution too.

361
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,120
I love our planet.

362
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,960
We can't just love our partner,
we need to love the earth too.

363
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,880
I see.

364
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,120
Yes. Do you see that?

365
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,280
-See what?
-It's a heart shape

366
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,360
Where?

367
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,840
-See?
-Oh, sure.

368
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,400
It's a heart.

369
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,240
Even the stars planned for this.

370
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,560
Oh, I see many now.

371
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,520
-See?
-Yes, you're right.

372
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,040
Yeah. That's a star. You're a star too.

373
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,040
What star?

374
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,360
No, you have to be
the one stopping me from flirting.

375
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,280
Because you're like this.

376
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,320
It's okay. Only we know about
this side of me. It can't be aired.

377
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,240
-It can.
-It can?

378
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,840
But let them interpret it.

379
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,280
Like this star is beautiful too.

380
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,600
You're too sweet.

381
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,520
I mean it. I'm not joking.

382
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,040
Our conversation is so silly.

383
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,560
I knew you were silly since I first saw you.

384
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,360
Hey!

385
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,640
Oh, it's raining. Be careful.

386
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,360
Oh, no, things are going well,
but the rain starts coming down.

387
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,920
No need, I'll cover myself

388
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,320
No, I don't get sick.

389
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,040
We're different people.

390
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,440
Where should we go that's not wet?

391
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,240
I'll remind you when we put on shoes.

392
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,320
Are other people talking
about serious stuff? I need to do that.

393
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,640
I don't see you wear that ring.

394
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,280
Huh?

395
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,800
You're not wearing that ring.

396
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
What? You are?

397
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,440
You're not either.

398
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,920
Then why did you mention it? Jeez.

399
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,120
You tried to act cool.

400
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,320
I noticed you didn't wear it.

401
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,360
Tried to act cool.

402
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,800
It hurts my feelings.

403
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,560
-I threw it in the sea.
-It does?

404
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,880
Kidding. I still have it.

405
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,600
You don't wear it.

406
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,400
-Now you're complaining.
-You don't either.

407
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,320
-Or people will know.
-I'm wearing a ring.

408
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,400
Huh?

409
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,520
Or people will know.

410
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,720
Who?

411
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,880
People...

412
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,160
Maybe you don't want people
to know we have matching rings.

413
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,040
I see.

414
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,440
Everyone knows that.

415
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
They know that.

416
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,520
So you stopped wearing it.

417
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,760
No. Well...

418
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,800
Do you still have it? Just one question.

419
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,960
It's still in my bag.

420
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,200
I see.

421
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,000
Honestly, mine's super loose.

422
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,800
Yeah, you were crazy to tell them 53.

423
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,360
No, I'll get fat so it...

424
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,480
So it fits, right?

425
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,240
Totally the right way to solve this.

426
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,360
This is the right method.

427
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,400
So if you don't choose me, would you be upset?

428
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,960
Yes.

429
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,760
Would you cry?

430
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,000
Not anymore.

431
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,360
-Kidding.
-I don't believe you.

432
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,080
-I don't believe you.
-I'll try not to cry.

433
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,960
Really? You can if you want to. It's fine.

434
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,520
I mean I don't want you to cry.

435
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,880
Then choose me.

436
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,680
You'll cry either way.

437
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,640
It's different—tears of joy vs. tears of sadness.

438
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,760
I see.

439
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,280
Yeah, you're right.

440
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,960
I'll... uh...

441
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,320
I'll probably use this last chance
to spend time with her as much as possible.

442
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,040
Like...

443
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,680
make it a good memory.

444
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,600
After everyone has had their deep talks
about what they wanted to say,

445
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,400
now they can just enjoy themselves.

446
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,600
Because this is probably the first and last time

447
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,840
they get to go on a trip together like this.

448
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,280
The morning before leaving is the same.
They have to make the most of their time.

449
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,280
Let's take some pictures.

450
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,400
Let's take some selfies.

451
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,880
Then we'll get them developed.

452
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,520
Not sure how they'll turn out.

453
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,360
Careful, it's slippery.

454
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,440
Our shoes are not appropriate for this.

455
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,440
Come, follow my steps.

456
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,240
And this is the sea.

457
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,400
The sea is...

458
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,720
Now we're wet.

459
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,600
One dip is enough. Mission accomplished.

460
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,880
Are you running away?

461
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,440
-You can.
-Go over there!

462
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,600
Of course you can.

463
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,480
Whoa, you're strong.

464
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,440
???

465
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,880
No, it's chill here.

466
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,880
Yeah.

467
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,760
Didn't realized we walked this far.

468
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,040
After spending time with her,

469
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,880
I see her as someone
I want to be with and always stand by.

470
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,040
Watch your step.

471
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,520
We can do it.

472
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,160
Oh, tomorrow's the last day, I can't handle it

473
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,960
Right?

474
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,120
So I think afterward
we'll go our separate ways and grow.

475
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,040
Yeah.

476
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,800
We'll arrange meetings anyway.

477
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,640
Yeah

478
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,760
But we won't be together like this.

479
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,440
Have you packed yet?

480
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,080
No.

481
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,160
So I have to go back.

482
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,320
I can help you pack.

483
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,720
You don't need to. It's nothing.

484
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,520
I packed.

485
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,720
-Really?
-Yes

486
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,680
-Let's take some pictures.
-Let's go.

487
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,120
Be careful.

488
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,920
Are you okay?

489
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,840
Eh...

490
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,200
Now everyone has paired off.

491
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,680
There is something big going on here.

492
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,400
But while some are happy,

493
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,560
some are feeling down.

494
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,640
Don't be sad yet, girls.

495
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,560
There's one more night left.

496
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,560
Settling all thoughts, recapping everything.

497
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,280
Truly being with myself, really thinking.

498
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,040
Hello.

499
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,240
Oh, hello.

500
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,720
-Hello.
-Hello.

501
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,960
Let's leave them here.

502
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,640
I have something to discuss.

503
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,360
How was the trip to the beach?

504
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,040
-So fun.
-So fun.

505
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,480
Still mentally there.

506
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,160
-What?
-Still mentally there.

507
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,960
"Still mentally there."

508
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,320
The food was amazing.

509
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,240
Maybe with someone, huh?

510
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,240
Hey.

511
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Enjoyed the water.

512
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,360
I'm glad to see you guys had fun.

513
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,920
I hope spending time outside
the Love Moment house created a good vibe

514
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,640
or maybe gave you guys
new perspectives or new feelings.

515
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,720
I don't know either, because some of you
opened up for the first time during this trip.

516
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,400
Like Hling and Wafer, right?

517
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,120
Just suddenly you two...

518
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,200
-Didn't see it coming.
-paired up at the end.

519
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,000
So I wasn't sure if
this trip would give the answer.

520
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,320
But time flies, right?

521
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,280
This is already the last week.

522
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,680
Yeah.

523
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,640
Eight weeks.

524
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,920
It's the last week

525
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,880
and in the end,

526
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,720
you'll have to choose
who we'll leave the house with hand in hand.

527
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,400
Normally, every week when I meet you guys,

528
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,000
I would give you a challenge.

529
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,280
Who pairs with whom,
every week has different rules.

530
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:08,360
This week is the last time I'll have you pair up.

531
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,320
But this time I won't give you any rules.

532
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,320
Like before,
I'll let you choose your partner yourself.

533
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,840
Pick who you want to pair with.

534
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,080
Doesn't matter in what way.

535
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,880
Because last week there was a problem
whether to follow your brain or your heart.

536
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,800
This time it's totally up to you.
Just make the best decision.

537
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,280
Because tonight will be the last night
you guys get to spend time together.

538
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,560
In this house.

539
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,960
-Are you crying?
-No, I'm not.

540
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,760
I'm strong now. This is EP 8.

541
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,760
And tomorrow morning,

542
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,360
I hope all of you have a partner
to leave this house with.

543
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,240
I'm glad to have met all of you.

544
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,280
Thank you.

545
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,040
Let's hug.

546
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,280
No, you're leaving already?

547
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,560
Of course, I'm done, my job is over.

548
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,080
Girls, keep it up and good luck. I really mean it.

549
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,920
Because I know you now and you're like my sisters.

550
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,040
I wish you great opportunities in showbiz
and get good friendships from this show.

551
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,240
Think it over.

552
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,920
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

553
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,960
She's really leaving.

554
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,840
Bye-bye.

555
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,160
This is their last night in the Love Moment house.

556
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
No matter what they decide,

557
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,960
I feel the same as Jeab.

558
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,080
I feel very attached to these girls.

559
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,560
No matter what happens tomorrow,

560
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,440
I'll still be cheering for the girls

561
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,480
I hope you're lucky in the game and lucky in love.

562
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,280
I wanna see the last person's gift.

563
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,280
Me too.

564
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,560
-Is there one?
-Me too.

565
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,400
She's tucking her hair, waiting.

566
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,320
All pretty.

567
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,600
Look at her face. Looks like a stingray.

568
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,520
It's...

569
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,920
It's this.

570
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,720
She went all out.

571
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,400
Wanna opening it? Here, you do it.

572
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,960
Gonna put it on her here?
I don't know what it is though.

573
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,760
Show us. Show us.

574
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,360
So cute.

575
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,680
Make a wish.

576
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,560
I'll put it on now.

577
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,600
You have to add a sweet background music here.

578
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,680
Show it.

579
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,120
I love it.

580
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,600
She smiles so big we can't see her eyes.

581
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,040
Can't stop smiling.

582
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,320
Now she's crying.

583
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,680
There, there, there.

584
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:02,960
And if I did anything that upset you
or you found unacceptable, I apologize.

585
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,760
Same here.

586
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,880
-Same.
-Same.

587
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,680
Me too.

588
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,080
Same here.

589
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,800
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

590
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,400
It's a meme.

591
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,760
That's gonna be a meme.

592
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,360
So bad.

593
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,360
Okay.

594
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,320
Thanks to the show, thanks to...

595
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,480
all the other girls and all my friends
for always offering friendship in this house.

596
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,360
I feel like I've gained seven new friends.

597
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
What are you doing?

598
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,000
Oh, nothing.

599
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,600
You're not? My eyes fooled me?

600
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,880
Why are you out here?

601
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,960
Saw you sitting alone,
so I came to watch the plants.

602
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,880
Oh, I came out to stargaze.

603
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,320
Really? There's no stars again.

604
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,720
Yeah. I didn't get my fill at the sea,
so I'm doing it here too.

605
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,240
So you're doing it here too.

606
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,960
Yes.

607
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,480
So, how are you after the trip? Tired?

608
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,960
Not tired per se.

609
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,200
A little tired. I'm lucky if I can
keep it together long enough to talk properly.

610
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,360
What about you?

611
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,600
Chill, totally relaxed.

612
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,880
-Really?
-Yes.

613
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,280
Are you really?

614
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,520
Yes.

615
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,200
You were intense on the trip.

616
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,720
-No, I left it...
-Better now?

617
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,880
Okay, I left it all with the sea.

618
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,080
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

619
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,200
Are you okay?

620
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,920
Yes.

621
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,920
I've known you for a long time

622
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,160
and I'm pretty sure that...

623
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,000
you have someone else in mind.

624
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,640
So I'll wait here. Remember this?

625
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,280
-This iris.
-The day we saw a snake.

626
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,240
Oh, the iris.

627
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,880
A snake might come out.

628
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,920
Do you remember bringing it
from the set back then?

629
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,000
Hey, there was a rose too, right? Where did it go?

630
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,280
-We didn't take the rose.
-Did you give it to someone?

631
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,320
No, I didn't.

632
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,680
I've never given anyone flowers, unlike you.

633
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,760
Just kidding.

634
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,600
Wow.

635
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,400
Wow.

636
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,120
I'm just kidding.

637
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,400
So I'll wait by this iris tomorrow.

638
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,480
That one?

639
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,240
Yes.

640
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
Can I have a hug?

641
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,840
You can have many.

642
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,760
Wow.

643
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,720
Even now, Dear remains steadfast
in her feelings for Pailiu.

644
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,920
So she told Pailiu she would choose her

645
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,760
and that if Pailiu chooses her back tomorrow,

646
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,640
she will wait outside by the iris,

647
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,640
which is the most important memory for them.

648
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,200
Will there ever be a day she chooses me?

649
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,600
Do you like it?

650
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,880
I love it.

651
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
I took pictures of it.

652
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
I'm glad you like it.

653
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,600
I'm glad you bought it for me.

654
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,960
Thank you.

655
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,160
I'm happy.

656
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,400
This is the last night.

657
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,000
You gotta wear it all the time.

658
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,840
Of course I will.

659
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,960
Its meaning is very beautiful
and I chose it with care.

660
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,360
Of course I'll wear it all the time
because it's from someone important.

661
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,680
I don't want tonight to end.

662
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,120
Same.

663
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,320
It's fine. We'll see each other again.

664
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,360
Someone was crying earlier.

665
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,920
Tomorrow...

666
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,160
I want you to wait for me on this sofa.

667
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,720
Right here where we're sitting because...

668
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:12,600
I want you to wait here because
this is where I first felt in the heart that

669
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,600
I wanted to know this girl,
wanted to know you, wanted to know Neua.

670
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,320
So I sat here, talked to you and got to know you.

671
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,840
When I asked you about
your favorite color, hobby, etc.

672
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,240
I want you to wait here.

673
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Will you come?

674
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,840
I'm not telling.

675
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,320
See? You're crying again.

676
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,960
Not telling.

677
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,760
Don't cry or I'll cry too.

678
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,800
Thinking back to the first days, I'm...

679
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,160
I'm glad that things turned out this way.

680
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,440
Everything clicks, right?

681
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,480
You have to wait and see where I'll be tomorrow.
Maybe I'll be in the kitchen

682
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,480
No, we have to plan this.
You must wait for me around here.

683
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,160
Okay?

684
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,120
Will you come find me?

685
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,800
Do you think I will?

686
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,600
I think you will.

687
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
I hope so.

688
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,120
Wait and see tomorrow.

689
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,760
In the morning.

690
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,360
Okay, got it.

691
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,160
Very good.

692
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:27,360
Lita told me to wait on the sofa
and she would come down.

693
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,360
Ah-ha! There you are.

694
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,280
What are you doing, washing dishes again?

695
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,320
I'm washing glasses.

696
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,800
Hey, I'll help.

697
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,320
Rinse them for me.

698
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,840
So what's the plan for tomorrow?

699
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,480
We'll leave together, right?

700
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
I don't know.

701
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,000
I know, but I'm just asking to be sure.

702
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,400
Will we leave together?

703
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,160
We must. I'm forcing you.

704
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,600
So what's the plan for tomorrow?

705
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,040
Where will you wait?

706
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,280
Tomorrow...

707
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,480
I will wait in front of the house.

708
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,120
In front of the house.

709
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,160
There are many doors to the front.

710
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,800
So I have to find you myself.

711
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,440
It's the door we entered on the first day.

712
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,800
Around there.

713
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,040
We'll exit the same way.

714
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,840
But with this hair clip, you look cute.

715
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,840
Yes, a gift from Lita.

716
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,400
And by nature, Lita's someone who can tell...

717
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,560
She can tell who suits whom.

718
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,440
This won't do. Next time I need to get
something for you, or else lose to Lita.

719
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,560
You'll never lose.

720
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,280
All set then.

721
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,640
Got it.

722
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,800
I'll find you tomorrow.

723
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,040
Okay.

724
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,320
Then give me a hug.

725
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,240
I'm so happy to have met you.

726
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,920
I let myself dream.
Like, "All set then. We understand each other."

727
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,880
So whatever happens, happens.

728
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,200
If you choose me, I'll be around there.

729
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,320
Okay.

730
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,360
So you choose me?

731
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,840
-Yes.
-Really?

732
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,440
Yes.

733
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,320
Yes.

734
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,800
I just want to hear it clearly.

735
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,320
I choose you, Pailiu.

736
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,520
Oh, okay, got it.

737
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,960
Want me to say it again?

738
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,040
It's fine, once is enough. I heard clearly.

739
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,400
Cute PJ.

740
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
You want it?

741
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,120
-Huh?
-Change into long pants.

742
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,920
Okay, at the art corner, right?

743
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,040
Yes, I have only one spot in the house.

744
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,800
Okay.

745
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,200
Yes, ma'am.

746
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,200
We'll see tomorrow.

747
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:57,880
Sure.

748
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,280
Not worried, right?

749
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,080
No.

750
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,480
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

751
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,280
Okay

752
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,920
I have to check if
anything needs fixing with this painting.

753
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,000
Oh, okay.

754
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,240
Okay, okay.

755
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,960
-Rest up, go to sleep.
-Tonight...

756
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,000
Really? Okay, I'll go.

757
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,640
Tonight what? Tell me.

758
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,560
Tonight what?

759
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,800
I was gonna said... Don't remember now.

760
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,440
Eh?

761
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,000
I don't know. It's like a hunch.

762
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,680
Yeah?

763
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,720
-Yeah.
-Okay.

764
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,560
Bye-bye.

765
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,560
Rest up.

766
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,840
I'm going to bed. I'm sleepy.

767
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,080
Okay.

768
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,600
She's so lovely. I mean...

769
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:42,880
I feel getting to be with her makes me
see her as someone I always want to stand by.

770
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,640
So I feel she's really the one for me.

771
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,080
Pailiu, what are you doing?

772
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,040
On my phone.

773
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,920
-I caught you.
-You caught what?

774
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,600
I snuck up here and saw it.

775
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,800
Saw what?

776
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,440
Oh, me talking to Nice just now?

777
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,680
How was it?

778
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,720
You mean the talk with Nice?

779
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,480
Don't tell me she arranged to meet you.

780
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,120
-Yeah.
-Really?

781
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,000
Yes.

782
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,600
I wanted to tell you that
I'm here to arrange to meet you as well.

783
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,640
Really?

784
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,920
Whoa.

785
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,480
But...

786
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,360
I wanted to say that
our date made me realize that...

787
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,840
It broke the ice and got us closer.

788
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,840
And you're the first person I paired with and...

789
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,960
Before that you may have seen me
as a stranger, right?

790
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,560
-Yes, you were that the whole time.
-No, no, no, no.

791
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:02,000
But I wanted to say I realized now
why I always hesitated. It's because I was afraid.

792
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
-Of what?
-I was just scared.

793
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,680
You didn't look scared.

794
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,640
I was scared.

795
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,960
You were so sure about choosing Hling.

796
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,320
I was just scared. That's it. That's it

797
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,600
But I don't wanna say too much.

798
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,080
And I don't wanna
make you feel uncomfortable. That's all.

799
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,440
I wanted to tell you to sleep early and...

800
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,920
whatever happens tomorrow, I accept your decision.

801
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,720
Really?

802
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,040
-Really. Really.
-Okay?

803
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:32,960
At some point, we should tell her,
for our own peace of mind.

804
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:40,280
Now that she knows, I'm actually okay with it
if she doesn't choose me.

805
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,680
I was just afraid.

806
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,480
If you choose me,

807
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,560
Your hands are so cold.

808
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,360
I'm nervous.

809
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,560
-Really?
-Yes.

810
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,640
If you choose me,
I'll wait at the exit by the stairs.

811
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,680
-Okay.
-Alright?

812
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,800
-Okay.
-By the front door.

813
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,880
Okay, got it.

814
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,440
-You can do it.
-Okay, rest up, go to bed.

815
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,840
I will, bye-bye.

816
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,160
Bye-bye.

817
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,200
Hug first.

818
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,000
-Bye-bye.
-Good night.

819
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,680
This is the last pairing.

820
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,000
The pressure's back on Pailiu again.

821
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,360
Because this decision can't be tested.

822
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,600
And no one knows what Pailiu is thinking.

823
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,840
Help me.

824
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,440
Help me. No one is helping me.

825
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,560
I hope tomorrow will be a good day for all of you.

826
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,560
And now it's time to reach the final conclusion.

827
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,200
Which ship will sail to the finish line?
Let's watch together.

828
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,640
Whoa.

829
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,240
Ah, you're here.

830
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,000
Thought you wouldn't come.

831
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:23,880
Really?

832
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,040
Sorry, I'm late because...

833
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,400
I'm nervous.

834
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,880
Ah, thought you wouldn't come.

835
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,640
Did you wait long?

836
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,760
Not long, but I never expected it to be you.
I thought I'd leave the house by myself.

837
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,680
Your first impression?

838
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,880
Since EP 1,
I thought I'd leave the house alone for sure.

839
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:56,080
Then suddenly you became the person I feel
most comfortable with, someone who gets me.

840
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:03,320
I feel grateful for that day
when we had free time while Pailiu worked.

841
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,760
It allowed me to settle things
and realize that actually...

842
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,160
the person I didn't notice... I mean we'd been
together all along but didn't notice each other.

843
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,680
So close but out of sight.

844
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,320
Yeah, both of us. Yeah, something like that.

845
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,840
Thank you for giving us time to think
and really see each other.

846
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,280
Thank you too for...

847
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,800
being by my side
without making me feel uncomfortable.

848
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:37,880
I'm glad you didn't give up
or change your mind, like,

849
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,880
"Okay, I'm leaving,"
or "I don't care. That's enough."

850
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:46,440
Yeah, so I made me realize,
though it took me a long time. Sorry about that.

851
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,200
It's okay.

852
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,840
I felt so many emotions:
shy, happy, impressed by so many things

853
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,200
Many feelings rushed up
and I was so glad it was Hling.

854
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,040
Looking back at everyone in the house, I realized

855
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,200
the right person might not be
the one who first attracted me,

856
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,960
but it's someone
I'm comfortable with and click with,

857
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,120
so my final choice is Wafer.

858
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,200
Come on, let's go.

859
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,120
Let's go.

860
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,560
Let's go.

861
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,200
-Need help carrying anything?
-No.

862
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,440
That's all I have.

863
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,040
The first day I came alone.

864
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,840
The last day...

865
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,280
-We leave together.
-True.

866
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,000
I'm blushing.

867
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,240
Never thought someone would leave with me.

868
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,560
Despite late realization,
their mutual understanding

869
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:47,800
has lead Hling and Wafer to decide
to leave the house hand in hand.

870
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,080
I kept waiting but she didn't show.

871
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,000
Or maybe she wouldn't come down?

872
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:45,680
I thought maybe she wouldn't come,
so I dragged my luggage out by myself.

873
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:47,960
Neua.

874
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:50,920
Neua.

875
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,120
Neua.

876
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,440
Did you wait long?

877
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:17,400
Actually, I planned to surprise her
with the flowers I prepared without her knowing.

878
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,200
I thought you wouldn't come down.

879
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,440
There, there, there.

880
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,880
???

881
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,080
Thank you.

882
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,080
Aww, don't cry, or I'll cry too.

883
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,760
Thought you wouldn't come down.

884
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,240
I wanted to give you these flowers.

885
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,880
I looked up the meaning. Pink tulips mean

886
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,280
the good feelings you have for someone,

887
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,840
so I wanted to give you pink tulips as a gift
to celebrate us leaving the house together.

888
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,560
Let's walk together.

889
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,520
There, there.

890
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,640
Thank you.

891
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,760
You're welcome.

892
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,760
Stop crying.

893
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,040
Let's go.

894
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,520
Ready?

895
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,680
Stop crying or you'll look ugly.
Your lashes will fall off.

896
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,040
I'll get this for you.

897
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,440
Thank you.

898
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,320
Come. Do you like the flowers?

899
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,720
Yes.

900
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,960
I want our pair, me and Lita,

901
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,040
have success in this industry and be very happy.

902
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,680
From the first time, when I wrote
in my letter that I choose Neuanaow,

903
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:51,920
I had a feeling that I had to write it down to
tell myself to choose this person, Neuanaow.

904
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,560
I trusted my instincts and I chose her.

905
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,840
I never thought it'd turn out to be her
when I wrote that

906
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,400
in the first impression round
based on my instincts.

907
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,920
On the last day when we left together,

908
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:11,440
my body and feelings told me it had to be Neua.

909
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,400
Bye-bye.

910
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,040
Bye-bye what?

911
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:34,760
Oh.

912
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,800
Bye-bye what?

913
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,080
What did you just say?

914
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,920
Hi-hi.

915
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,760
Oh.

916
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,600
I heard bye-bye.

917
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,200
Hi-hi.

918
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,080
At first I wasn't sure if I should say it,

919
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,880
but I thought it was better to say it
or I wouldn't have a chance.

920
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,960
You weren't on my mind at all
in the first impression round.

921
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,200
Yes, I know that.

922
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:00,120
But the reason I like you is...

923
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,200
you're lovely.
You're lovely and really care about everyone.

924
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,640
And I heard everything you said
and I thought, "This person is sincere. She's..."

925
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:18,080
so lovely, very caring toward everyone,
and charming.

926
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,840
Now you're brave.

927
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,720
You've been brave lately.

928
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,920
Well, once we leave,
we won't see each other again,

929
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,120
so I wanted to say it now. There.

930
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,880
Well...

931
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,800
today I have to make a really hard decision.

932
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,720
-I understand.
-I think you know.

933
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,880
I think you understand.

934
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,960
I believe everyone will see you the way I do.

935
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,280
You're actually charming.

936
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:44,840
Beautiful.

937
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,840
Not just on the outside.

938
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,240
And today...

939
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,920
even though we don't get to...

940
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,760
Yeah, even though
we don't get to go forward together,

941
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,600
I will always be your sister.

942
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,840
I'll always be your confidant.

943
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,720
I'll always be there for you.

944
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,840
This is not a goodbye, okay?

945
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,600
It's not a goodbye.

946
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,120
We'll just keep being sisters.

947
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,760
Okay?

948
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,560
Okay.

949
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,160
Good luck.

950
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,200
Very good, keep it up.

951
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:27,880
Bye-bye.

952
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,960
Bye-bye, see you outside.

953
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,880
Good luck.

954
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,840
Yeah, same.

955
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,200
Go eat something.

956
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,120
Get home safely.

957
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:45,600
Love doesn't always have to be romantic.
We don't have to love as a couple.

958
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:50,880
We can love each other as sisters.
Because I want to see her happy.

959
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,080
What are you doing?

960
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,720
Still painting.

961
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,040
-Not leaving yet?
-Adding.

962
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,240
Not yet.

963
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,880
I'm seeing each one first.

964
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,200
What are you doing?

965
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,240
I added a bit here, see?

966
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,480
Oh, looks like it's flying.

967
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,960
Yes, and notice there are eight flowers.

968
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,040
Why?

969
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,440
Eight flowers
growing slowly in different directions.

970
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,640
Wow.

971
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,280
Just finishing. I wanted to say goodbye to it.

972
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:09,640
The wait was getting long
and I felt something was off

973
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,320
because last night
we were still hugging each other,

974
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,800
giving each other support.

975
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:22,280
I thought maybe she would choose me,
but why did it take so long? I waited for so long.

976
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:10,920
The feeling is indescribable.
It's like heartbreak.

977
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:18,400
Then I realized she didn't choose me,
so I thought it was better to leave.

978
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,000
I left the house.

979
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,480
Let's talk.

980
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,000
Talk about what?

981
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,120
About what?

982
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,440
Well...

983
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,480
Yeah, I think you're really talented.

984
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,680
Yeah, you're really gifted.

985
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,640
And you look cute, like a bunny.

986
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,520
And I feel you can go very far on this path.

987
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,400
Like really far.

988
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,920
I don't know how you see yourself, but I see...

989
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,360
I see that you can go really far.

990
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,640
Really?

991
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,880
-Really.
-Thank you.

992
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,840
I mean it.

993
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,560
You too.

994
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:11,080
When I'm in the house,
we mostly talk in the bedroom.

995
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,280
-Yes.
-Sitting and chatting.

996
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,440
We did that sometimes, not a lot, but I noticed...

997
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,440
you were alone so many times.

998
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,200
Not sure if it's because you...

999
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,640
How you do say it? Like doing things alone.

1000
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,280
Yes, I like doing things alone.

1001
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,520
Like when you molded clay in the room.

1002
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,880
I thought it was cute. So I went in and helped.

1003
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,320
And I feel that you're also...

1004
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,520
How should I say it?

1005
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:42,840
Never mind.
I just hope from now on, whatever path you take,

1006
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,320
I hope you grow and succeed.

1007
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:49,040
And I believe everyone will love and adore you.

1008
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,280
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

1009
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,280
Everyone will definitely adore you. And...

1010
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,080
Whatever path you choose,
I will always support you.

1011
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,440
And I hope you find someone who...

1012
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,520
stand by your side wherever you are,
wherever you go.

1013
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,680
Even when you do things alone.

1014
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,560
Deep down you might want
someone to do it with, I don't know.

1015
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,000
But no matter what, if you feel the world...

1016
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,520
isn't kind to you,

1017
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:25,120
I hope you've found someone who supports you,
who's a second home for you.

1018
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,240
That's it.

1019
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,120
I wish you luck too. Really.

1020
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,360
Don't worry. Okay.

1021
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,600
No, I mean it. I hope you
find that special someone.

1022
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,480
That's my blessing for you.

1023
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,200
Thank you.

1024
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,000
Yes.

1025
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,360
That's it.

1026
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,440
I'll keep you as a good memory too.

1027
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,480
Yes.

1028
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,960
And this bag too.

1029
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,960
It's your flower.

1030
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,760
Yeah?

1031
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:00,920
A keepsake to remind me I once chose you.
But it's okay, I'll find my own person someday.

1032
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,560
-Thank you.
-Okay.

1033
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,720
It's not me. That's okay.

1034
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,160
I let her go on her way.

1035
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,520
I didn't want to push her to choose me.

1036
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,400
At least I did my best here,

1037
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,600
and walking out of this house alone means...

1038
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,800
at least I stayed true to myself.

1039
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,840
I wasn't okay then, but at least I...

1040
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,680
at least I had to smile and leave.

1041
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:24,320
I chose to leave alone
because I felt really uncomfortable.

1042
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,240
I didn't want to see anyone upset.

1043
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:32,800
I believed that if I left alone,
the others would be upset, and so would I.

1044
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,000
Because I didn't come here to leave alone.

1045
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,560
But at least it wouldn't be as painful,
I believed that.

1046
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,760
Yeah, if it hurts, let's be hurt together.

1047
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,560
I'm hurt too.

1048
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,040
I didn't want to be selfish.

1049
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,200
I felt really conflicted, I couldn't choose.

1050
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,320
I think everyone
will understand my decision today.

1051
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,880
Yes, but who knows,
maybe someday we'll meet again.

1052
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,360
We may cross paths again.

1053
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,960
Today decisions today may have brought
fulfillment, disappointment,

1054
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,280
happiness, sadness, or mixed emotions.

1055
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:17,240
But I believe
when the eight girls think back to this house,

1056
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,520
it will always make them smile.

1057
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:25,040
With friendship and love
found on the Love Moment journey,

1058
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,080
no matter what path lies ahead,

1059
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,600
let's keep these good memories

1060
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:35,280
and remember that
we once spent this wonderful time together.
