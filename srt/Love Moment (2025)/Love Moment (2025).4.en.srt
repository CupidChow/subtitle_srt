1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,040
How would you know

2
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,520
if you're the one

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,840
for the person you're with?

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,240
EP.2 THE ONE

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
Stop the music.

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,640
Nam, take a break.

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,400
Kwan, come on.

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,320
Coach, can I do it one more time?

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,560
If I really did something wrong, you can tell me.

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,280
Nam.

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,880
This is an audition.
Everyone gets the same chance.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,600
Kwan, come on.

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,600
Coach,

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,600
then can I dance with Nam?

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,000
Gonna dance with her for the rest of your life?

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,720
Cue music.

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,840
Stop.

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,400
Belle, go dance with Kwan.

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,680
Coach...

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,760
Go dance with Kwan.

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,640
Okay, cue music.

22
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,720
Oh?

23
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,720
Kwan, why are you still here?

24
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
You're not leaving?

25
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,760
Not yet.

26
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,840
Why not?

27
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,280
Happy birthday.

28
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,040
Hm.

29
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,000
I told you, no need for gifts.
It's a waste of money.

30
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,520
Well...

31
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,040
I do this every year.

32
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
Thanks.

33
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,680
Peekaboo.

34
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,120
There you are.

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,120
Been looking for you everywhere.

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,680
See you around.

37
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,320
- Okay.
- I'm off.

38
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,520
Bye-bye.

39
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,560
A gift?

40
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,760
Yeah.

41
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,600
Kwan gave it to me for my birthday.

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,600
But I don't know what's inside.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,320
I really wanna open it.

44
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

45
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,200
Hold on. Just a sec.

46
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,040
Kwan.

47
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,480
Don't tense up. Don't pressure yourself. Okay?

48
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,720
Relax. You're hunching your shoulders right now.

49
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,600
And don't hug yourself. Don't tense up.

50
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,240
Okay?

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,160
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,960
Hey, why are you apologizing?

53
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,160
Huh?

54
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,400
Inhale and exhale.

55
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,920
I'll put the music back on.

56
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,040
Okay?

57
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
Okay.

58
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,120
Give me a sec.

59
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,720
Mm.

60
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,240
Come on.

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,560
Come on.

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,360
What the hell are you doing?

63
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,400
Belle.

64
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,040
Do you still love me at all?

65
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,480
Like before?

66
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,600
Nam.

67
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,560
Kwan really does like you.

68
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,080
What about you? Do you like her?

69
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,000
Why are you asking me that?

70
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,280
Because before you met me,

71
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,880
you knew Kwan, didn't you?

72
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,200
You even used to dance together.

73
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,960
- And you two seemed close...
- You used to date too.

74
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,000
But there's nothing between us.

75
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,280
It was a long time ago.

76
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,560
Nam.

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,560
We're together now, okay?

78
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,840
Please don't let the past

79
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,200
ruin the future we still have.

80
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,600
Can I ask you one thing?

81
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,920
Do you still love Kwan?

82
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,480
I don't love her anymore.

83
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,880
And I love you very much.

84
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,200
I want to dance with you for the rest of my life.

85
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,680
I want to get tired with you.

86
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,280
I want to keep dancing, living,
and practicing with you every day like this.

87
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,160
It's their actions

88
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,160
that will tell you everything.
