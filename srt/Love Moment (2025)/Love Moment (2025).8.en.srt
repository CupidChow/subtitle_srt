1
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,760
Would it be possible

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,680
to fall in love with someone who lives

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,000
in a completely different world from ours?

4
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,800
Then handle it tomorrow.

5
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,000
We can’t just leave it like this.

6
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,400
Don't let them dare go any further.

7
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,800
If we can’t negotiate,

8
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,200
we’ll have to use force.

9
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,320
Well, look who I found here.

10
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,960
I hope you’re enjoying your time here.

11
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,560
I’m not.

12
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,840
Then I guess I’ll have to find something

13
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
more fun for you to do.

14
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,640
Do you even have time to do

15
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,920
anything else besides doing bad stuff

16
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,240
and using your power to hurt people?

17
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,480
Ah…

18
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,960
so you overheard what I said

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,400
to my subordinates earlier.

20
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,480
But is that all you’re curious about?

21
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,120
I still have a lot of things to do.

22
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,960
I mean…

23
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,200
good things.

24
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,080
Good things?

25
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,800
Like what?

26
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,800
Shall we do it together?

27
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,600
Then you’ll see...

28
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,360
what I’m actually good at.

29
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,240
What exactly are you doing here?

30
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,720
What did you negotiate with my father?

31
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,560
Your father is doing something risky.

32
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,280
But even if I told you,

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,760
you wouldn’t believe me.

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,920
Don’t accuse my father.

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,480
He hasn’t done anything.

36
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,560
You’re the one who’s a mafia.

37
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,360
If that’s how you see me…

38
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,080
Then maybe I should do something

39
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,040
that proves your impression right?

40
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,600
Follow me, rebellious lady.

41
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,320
Why did you bring me here?

42
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,800
I told you before that you’re in danger.

43
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,360
And I brought you here

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,080
to do something good for you.

45
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,840
Something?

46
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,960
I’m going to teach you how to defend yourself.

47
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,040
Hey, focus.

48
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,920
If this happens to you,

49
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,080
what would you do?

50
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,880
I saw it on YouTube before.

51
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,200
You just headbutt them.

52
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,240
Hey!

53
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,400
Let me tell you something.

54
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,920
What you see in online videos

55
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
doesn’t always work in real life.

56
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,600
Watch closely.

57
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,120
Like this.

58
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,720
Once you get free, run.

59
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,240
Avoid confrontation.

60
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,000
I’ll show you again.

61
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,040
If you’re in this kind of situation,

62
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,760
the first thing you do is

63
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,360
use your elbows to open space

64
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,720
from your attacker’s arms

65
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,920
then twist your hips away from them
in any directions,

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,440
and roll out as fast as you can.

67
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,520
Got it?

68
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
I think so.

69
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,880
Try it.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,400
And remember

71
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,880
the first thing you must do

72
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,360
is stay calm.

73
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,000
Try again.

74
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,680
Thank you, Sydney.

75
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,160
You can go rest now.

76
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,720
Yes, ma'am.

77
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,000
Thank you.

78
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,400
But today's lesson isn’t over yet.

79
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,720
If you freeze up like that

80
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,200
you’d already be kissed by now.

81
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,400
And what did I just say?

82
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,680
The first thing you have to do

83
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,080
is stay calm.

84
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,880
Now,

85
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
try controlling one of my arms

86
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,600
and lift your hips.

87
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,480
To throw me off balance.

88
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,000
Try it.

89
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,880
If you freeze up like that,

90
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,000
you’d already be kissed by now.

91
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,080
I lost again.

92
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,920
No.

93
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,360
You actually won earlier.

94
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,480
ONE MONTH LATER

95
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,840
This mansion

96
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
it’s never had iris flowers before.

97
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,080
Until one day…

98
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,800
the irises…

99
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,160
appeared, decorating the mansion.

100
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,840
So,

101
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,080
do you like irises?

102
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,800
I like irises.

103
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,920
They never existed in my world before.

104
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,000
But now, they’re blooming in my heart.

105
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,080
If we had time to understand each other,

106
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,120
then love wouldn’t be impossible anymore.
