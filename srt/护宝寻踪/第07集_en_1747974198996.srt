1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
TRUE

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The End

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 1

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You stay at the fishing village.

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What are you doing there?

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We are less important people in Changcheng.

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And Changcheng is the main place in the fishing village.

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Changcheng's long-term direction, structure,

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
time and land, and in the assessment data,

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
there are still a lot of blanks.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I decided to stay at the fishing village

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and do the research of Changcheng.

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But this is a school class.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Who says that you can't go to school?

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Teacher, how was your life in the years

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
you stayed at the fishing village?

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
At that time, the fish was rarely eaten.

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The emperor hung you to death.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
His mouth was dry and tongue was sharp.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But every time I saw a miracle,

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I got some income.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You will forget all the bitter things you ate.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But it's a pity that the fishing village

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
is too short.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The long-term research report I wrote

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
was not finished when he left.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I wonder if we will have another chance to go.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I heard you say that you want to go.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You are young.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You have a chance.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's go.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I have to get better first.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't know what you want to do

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
when you are so lucky.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Say it if you have something.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Teacher.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This is my liver.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I heard you say it.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Say it.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Say it.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Did you bring your phone?

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let go.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Say it.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Tian'er, go find someone.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I will go to the bathroom.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I will go.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Go find someone.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hurry.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Go.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't move.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Go.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't move.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Go.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Go.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Hurry.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Go.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Go.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Go.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You have to go.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Tian'er.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Tian'er.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Tian'er.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's broken.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's broken.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's broken.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's broken.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hurry.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Call the doctor.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Call the doctor.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What's going on?

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Doctor.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Go.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Go.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hurry.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Little village.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
No.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,900

Quick.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,700
Where are you going & get out quickly

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't go to get out.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I told you, go & get out!

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,300
Tony.

116
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,280

117
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,660
It got me.

118
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,740
tightly1.

119
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,240
We were fusted together,

120
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,000
we await you.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,240
We need Tony.

122
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,280
My big DNA will cover your Chew 크게.

123
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,140
Put it away.

124
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,620
Prof. Right,

125
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,820
you know we don't need to feed the cat.

126
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
We are in the dead body.

127
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
The police are looking for you.

128
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,320
I give you my blessing.

129
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,820
If you meet the thief, you can't touch you.

130
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,320
Your life is safe.

131
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,820
You can't hear me.

132
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,820
I'm not a thief.

133
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
I'm a coward.

134
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
If he comes again, you'll see.

135
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,820
He'll kill me.

136
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
If he comes again, you'll see.

137
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
You can't do that, Yan Xiao.

138
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
Xiao, I'm not a thief.

139
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,820
I'll kill him.

140
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
What is this place?

141
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,820
Let's see.

142
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Take the road.

143
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
Let's go.

144
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,820
Let's go.

145
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Go.

146
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,820
Don't be afraid.

147
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
Xiao, don't follow me.

148
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,820
We'll go.

149
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,820
Let's go.

150
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,820
Open the door.

151
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,820
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,820
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,820
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
You said you have to go.

155
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
You can't get them back.

156
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,820
Captain Qi,

157
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
we have to go now.

158
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
I've found a few people.

159
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
They are not here yet.

160
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,820
I see.

161
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
You found a few people.

162
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
I've found two people.

163
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,820
There's one more.

164
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,820
Three of them.

165
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,820
What do you mean?

166
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
It's too dark.

167
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
I can't see anything.

168
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,820
I'm fine.

169
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,820
You're fine.

170
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
I'm fine.

171
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,820
Captain Yang,

172
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
come to see first.

173
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
I want to see you.

174
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm fine.

175
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
I'll show you.

176
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
You'll be fine.

177
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
You'll go back to rest.

178
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,820
I'm fine.

179
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,820
I'm fine.

180
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
Shengzi.

181
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
We're all back.

182
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,820
We're back.

183
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,820
We're back.

184
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,820
We're back.

185
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,820
You're back.

186
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,820
Hurry.

187
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,820
Come on.

188
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Hurry.

189
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
You're not even a little bit thinner.

190
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,820
Hurry.

191
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Come on.

192
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,820
Shengzi,

193
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,820
I'm not here anymore.

194
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,820
I'm here.

195
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,820
You can go back.

196
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820
I'm not here anymore.

197
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,820
You're so mean.

198
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,820
You can't eat again.

199
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,820
You can't eat again.

200
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,820
You can't eat again.

201
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,820
I'm here.

202
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,820
You're so mean.

203
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,820
No need.

204
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,820
Teacher.

205
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,820
Teacher.

206
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,820
Teacher Zhang.

207
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,820
Come on.

208
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
Teacher Zhang.

209
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,820
Call the phone.

210
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,820
Call the phone.

211
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Hurry.

212
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,820
Call the phone.

213
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,820
Call the phone.

214
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,820
Call the phone.

215
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,820
Call the phone.

216
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,820
Call the phone.

217
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,820
Call the phone.

218
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Who's the family of the director?

219
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,820
Here.

220
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
The director of the business department.

221
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
He's too late.

222
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
We've already established him.

223
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Zhang.

224
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
Zhang.

225
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
What's wrong?

226
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
What's wrong?

227
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
What's wrong?

228
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
Zhang.

229
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
Zhang.

230
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
Zhang Zhang?

231
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,820
Where are you?

232
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
Zhang.

233
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Asking you for my laughing?

234
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,020
Are you way over there!

235
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,140
Go and tell the doctor it's nothing

236
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
I will avenge you.

237
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
Sit and move.

238
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,820
We'll stay here for a while.

239
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,820
Do you hear me?

240
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,820
What are you doing?

241
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,440
The

242
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,820
The

243
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,820
The

244
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,820
The

245
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,820
The

246
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,820
The

247
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
What's going on down there?

248
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
You just go down there.

249
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,820
Go back and check it out.

250
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,820
You're going to do something else?

251
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Go down there again.

252
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,820
Am I going to get a headache?

253
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,820
Am I going to clear it up?

254
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
If you can do it, you can't.

255
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,820
You just dig the soil,

256
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
be responsible for the safety,

257
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,820
and listen to everyone.

258
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,820
Especially you.

259
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,820
I'm not going in.

260
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,820
Can't you find the teacher?

261
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,820
You broke the code.

262
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
What's the difference between the code and the code?

263
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,820
Positive.

264
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,820
We all do this for you.

265
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
It's hard to tell if she doesn't like you.

266
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
We can all see the gift,

267
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,820
most important is that she checked her意.

268
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
Because sheETH�w flies high,

269
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
that's why she's so strict on you.

270
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
You made such a big mistake last time.

271
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
If she didn't pay for it,

272
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,820
then you would all be expelled.

273
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,320
Professor sew рly,

274
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,820
become more proud of you.

275
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
Fang Kun is really too much.

276
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,220
He's been fighting for 86.

277
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,820
He's been so high-ranking.

278
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,220
He won't get out.

279
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,820
What's the point of telling him?

280
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
What's the point? It's your own business.

281
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,620
Fang Kun is a bad student.

282
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,420
If you can't get out,

283
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,220
I'll get you out.

284
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,020
Fang Kun said that Black-Cow-Dung

285
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,620
has experienced disaster.

286
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,620
You're not even aware of it.

287
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,220
What did you say?

288
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,220
I said he was right.

289
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,420
He's not afraid of losing.

290
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
Fang Kun is a good boy.

291
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,020
He loves to fight.

292
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,620
I'm a good boy.

293
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,420
Black-Cow-Dung

294
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,020
Pick it up.

295
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
Deputy Chief Wang, please say something.

296
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
Seeing this label,

297
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
I believe everyone will be very sad.

298
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,820
I don't know how many cultural relics are out there.

299
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,820
But,

300
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,820
Black-Cow-Dung's return is a good start.

301
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
For them,

302
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
we've been fighting for four days

303
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
for history for a year and four months.

304
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
This represents the determination

305
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
of our country's government to fight against illegal movements.

306
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
The result is obvious.

307
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,820
But, the cultural relics and the走-through phenomenon

308
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
still have a social problem.

309
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
We, the security forces,

310
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
will not be able to protect the cultural relics

311
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
no matter how hard it is.

312
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
It's not like everyone is on fire.

313
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
Only the people can make the path

314
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,820
and the走-through cultural relics disappear completely.

315
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
The six Han Dynasty black-cow-dung

316
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
sold by the Wonsoku

317
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
has been lost for more than a year.

318
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,820
After a lot of efforts,

319
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,820
they finally returned to their ancestral home.

320
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
This is the first batch of cultural relics

321
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
that has been sold by the Wonsoku

322
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
for the first time in my country.

323
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
Come on, let's go and have a look.

324
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
The experts in the cultural relics

325
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,820
have returned to their ancestral home

326
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,820
to fight against illegal movements.

327
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Let's go.

328
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
Two cooks from the ancestral home

329
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
Yan Xiaowu and Wang Taiping

330
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,820
were sent to the court

331
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
for ten years and six years.

332
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
The public video is now available.

333
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,820
The original video will be continued.

334
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,820
Why did you bring a toy?

335
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
I thought I would bring it here.

336
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,820
I didn't know anyone.

337
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,820
Come.

338
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,820
Xiao Guang.

339
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
This is a waste of money that you have to pay.

340
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,820
You can stay here.

341
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,820
You can also wipe the conditions.

342
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,820
You can go to the toilet.

343
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
I'm going to make a blind-cook.

344
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,820
You can live in three conditions.

345
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
You can just eat enough.

346
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,820
Guohu.

347
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,820
Let's meet here.

348
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,820
Don't let outsiders know.

349
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,820
I got it.

350
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,820
Be careful.

351
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,820
Come in.

352
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,820
Come in.

353
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,820
Come in.

354
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,820
Xiaoyang.

355
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,820
Xiao Guang.

356
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,820
Do you know that this house

357
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,820
is used for cleaning?

358
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,820
I'm going to clean it.

359
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,820
I have to clean it, brother.

360
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,820
Come.

361
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,820
Sit.

362
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,820
Come.

363
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,820
Xiaoyang.

364
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,820
Take it.

365
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,820
Xiao Guang.

366
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,820
The house is used for cleaning.

367
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,820
The dead are scattered.

368
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,820
The goods that are used in the future

369
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,820
will be here.

370
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,820
He is coming.

371
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,820
Xiao Guang.

372
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,820
romance.

373
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,820
humbled by our reputation.

374
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,820
We have the offering.

375
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,820
Opportunity.

376
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,820
Congratulations.

377
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,820
Thank you.

378
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,820
الق willing.

379
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
The wax is customary bizi.

380
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,820
I can't have a hard time.

381
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,820
No, thanks.

382
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,820
Thank you.

383
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,820
Let's vary the catch.

384
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,820
Although we are filming.

385
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,820
I'm so sorry.

386
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,100
Tian'er, didn't you meet up at the club tomorrow?

387
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
Mom bought you some clothes.

388
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,100
Come and try them on.

389
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,740
No, no, no, no, no. This one is not good.

390
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,740
Come and try this one.

391
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Okay, that's it.

392
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,980
Qing'er, why are you back from the youth club?

393
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,380
You look like you lost your soul.

394
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,580
What's wrong?

395
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,700
Is it because of Professor Zan?

396
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,740
I have something to tell you and my dad.

397
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,900
Don't look at it. Hurry up.

398
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,340
I've already thought it through.

399
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,180
I don't want to go to the club.

400
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,260
I want to go back to the youth club.

401
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,940
Girl, why?

402
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,420
For us, as a student,

403
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,220
the youth club is really a piece of dirt.

404
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,940
If I don't go to the youth club in this life,

405
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,940
I will definitely leave a regret.

406
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,780
And there is another one there.

407
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,780
The one I can't rest assured of.

408
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,140
Come on.

409
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,660
Let's go.

410
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,660
Come on, let's go.

411
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,660
Okay.

412
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
Okay.

413
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,660
You are really good today.

414
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,660
Have you ordered anything?

415
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,660
I have.

416
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,660
I will give the players the power to do the physical exercise.

417
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,660
Only the players will be able to do it.

418
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,140
Okay.

419
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,140
You are really good.

420
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,140
I have seen a lot of people doing physical exercise.

421
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,140
I am really good.

422
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,140
You are a teacher.

423
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,140
You are a good teacher.

424
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,140
You are really good.

425
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,140
I told you.

426
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,140
You are not good.

427
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,140
You are good at the physical exercise.

428
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,140
You are really good.

429
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,860
浪漓.

430
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,780
You do not wanna be a scripts理智.

431
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,340
I have seen most of you that time.

432
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,340
You should tube your feet.

433
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,340
Will you change the schedule?

434
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,340
Will it work?

435
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,340
What to do?

436
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,340
You are on a business trip too.

437
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,300
Maybe I will catch the situation.

438
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,940
Fish mourn.

439
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,340
Fish mourn?

440
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,900
What do you mean by that?

441
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,980
I want to practice with tears often.

442
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,300
You have to let me know when you have eyes for real.

443
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,180
I can't tell him now as long as I practice with his tears often.

444
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,860
Anyway I don't want to watch himahahaha like that.

445
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,980
Son, I want to stay overnight.

446
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,220
Yeah, why went with his tears?

447
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,620
I would like toku acta

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,280

He must be sick

451
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,080
Come, sit

452
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,460
Like that

453
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,860
You eat by yourself

454
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,680
You're taking care of me

455
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,320
This one

456
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,500
As the day passes

457
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,680
Beef and beef and beef and beef

458
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,320
why are you asking me

459
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,880
Yes

460
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:46,880
Music

461
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Coach Luo

462
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
Coach Luo

463
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Mr. Luo.

464
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
Mr. Luo.

465
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Mr. Luo is here.

466
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,760
How are you?

467
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
Hello, Mr. Luo.

468
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
Mr. Luo.

469
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Mr. Luo, can you show me

470
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
what time is it?

471
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
It's good.

472
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
It's spring and autumn.

473
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

474
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
Mr. Luo, look.

475
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
What kind of temperament am I?

476
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
This is a pot.

477
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
The pattern on it is less sharp.

478
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
But what animal is it?

479
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
I can't judge it yet.

480
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Let's ask the teacher of the provincial institute

481
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
to teach us.

482
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Do you have any

483
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
uncertainly-confirmed

484
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
role model?

485
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
Look at me.

486
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
I'm a pig.

487
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
I hate you.

488
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,760
Are you four enough?

489
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
Why?

490
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,760
I'm sure it's a pig.

491
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,760
You're four enough.

492
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
I just named it.

493
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Look, the nose is round.

494
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
It's called a dog.

495
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
It's hard to hear.

496
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,760
Three and four are perfect.

497
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
How about we

498
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
make it a little bit more clear?

499
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
You think

500
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
my dog is four.

501
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
Yes.

502
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
It must be a pig.

503
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Right?

504
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
It's round.

505
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
Whether it's a dog or a pig,

506
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
you can make it a standard.

507
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
Take pictures, pictures,

508
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
and put on the card.

509
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Okay.

510
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
Don't forget that

511
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
all the standard

512
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
is divided

513
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
by different units.

514
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
Then you can

515
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
do it again.

516
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
Mr. Luo.

517
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
You've done it

518
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
twice.

519
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Yes.

520
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,760
Yes.

521
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,760
Let me ask you.

522
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,760
Do you think

523
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
this peach pig

524
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
is useful?

525
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,760
I think it's a toy.

526
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,760
I think it's a blessing.

527
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
It's a blessing.

528
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,760
It's a blessing.

529
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
It's a blessing.

530
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
It's a blessing.

531
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
It's a blessing.

532
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Maybe you're right.

533
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
I have to admit

534
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
that this peach pig

535
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
has already removed

536
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
the needs of production and life,

537
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
and transferred to the spirit of

538
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
the service.

539
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
We've learned

540
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
how to play the game

541
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
twice.

542
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
And we've learned

543
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
how to study

544
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
the archaeological materials

545
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
and the social structure

546
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
and its development and destruction.

547
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
But this time,

548
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
I hope you can open your eyes

549
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
and study the problem

550
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
of the spiritual field.

551
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
The archaeological materials

552
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
need to be built,

553
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
and also people.

554
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
People need to be built.

555
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
People need to be built.

556
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
You need to learn

557
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
to use these

558
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
708-year-old

559
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
gold-plated pebbles

560
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
to restore

561
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
the spiritual world

562
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
of the ancient ancestors.

563
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
Luo Jia.

564
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
Come here.

565
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
Mr. Yao.

566
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Zi Zhen.

567
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,760
We're responsible for

568
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
the archaeological materials

569
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,760
and the money.

570
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,520
We're here to

571
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,760
test you.

572
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
The archaeological materials?

573
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,760
The people in the garden

574
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760
are responsible for the treatment.

575
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
This is a very famous place.

576
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Where did you come from?

577
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
It must be from Yusai.

578
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,760
Welcome.

579
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Welcome.

588
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,760
Thank you.

589
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Hello.

590
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760

592
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
Thank you.

593
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,760
Hello.

594
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,760
Thank you.

595
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
We can go in now.

596
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Hello.

597
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
I'm Luo Qing,

598
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
a professor

599
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
at Yusai's Changshu Cultural and Science Center.

600
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
Hello.

601
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Hello.

602
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Hello, Xiaobai.

603
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Hello, Xiaobai.

604
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Hello.

605
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
This is the place.

606
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
It's okay.

607
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,760
Please take a look.

608
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
This is our yard.

609
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
This is the art gallery.

610
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
It's very beautiful.

611
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Yes.

612
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,760
This is the art gallery.

613
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Good.

614
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
Our art gallery is inside.

615
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
Okay.

616
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
This is the art gallery.

617
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
This is the art gallery.

618
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
Okay.

619
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
This is where

620
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
we repair the cultural relics

621
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
and repair the ruins.

622
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
It looks like

623
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,760
there are many things here.

624
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
I think

625
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,760
there are some things here.

626
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
What do you mean?

627
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
There are so many things.

628
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,760
Just leave it there.

629
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
All dit杀

630
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
is shown here.

631
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
I'm going to show you something.

632
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Thank you.

633
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
Thank you.

634
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
I don't know

635
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
if kids

636
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
fear this

637
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
by nature.

638
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Delicious.

639
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,700
I didn't think

640
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,560
civilians will

641
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
fear theirinf.

642
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,760
No.

643
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,760
Don't touch my feet.

644
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,760
Don't touch me.

645
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
Good.

646
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,760
This is for you.

647
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Take it.

648
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
Thank you.

649
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
It's okay.

650
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
It's okay.

651
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,760
This is a strange taste.

652
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
It's so soft.

653
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
It's so soft.

654
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
We've been in the desert.

655
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
We've been eating delicious food.

656
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Even if

657
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,760
you're a little bit lazy,

658
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,760
you can't eat this kind of food.

659
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,760
Mr. Fang,

660
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
you're doing well.

661
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
You're a good person.

662
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
You know him?

663
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,760
We've been friends

664
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
since we were in the internship.

665
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
He's a good guy

666
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
when he's a trainee.

667
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
I can do something

668
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
unexpected.

669
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
I don't know if I've changed.

670
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,760
I'm not.

671
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,760
You're not.

672
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
Just say it with your own words.

673
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,760
That's a joke.

674
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,760
It's a pity that he didn't come this time.

675
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,760
Otherwise, I'll definitely go with him.

676
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
You know what?

677
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,760
He's a good guy.

678
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Before he left,

679
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
he was so stubborn.

680
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
He was so stubborn.

681
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,760
He was dead.

682
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
He was so stubborn.

683
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
He was so stubborn.

684
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
He was so stubborn.

685
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Mr. Fang,

686
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
I'll go get a massage.

687
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
I'll go get a massage.

688
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,760
Wait here.

689
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,760
I'll go get a massage.

690
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,760
It's a bad weather.

691
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,760
I don't want to go there.

692
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,760
What if there's a problem?

693
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
Let's go.

694
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,760
Fang Kun.

695
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Fang Kun is back.

696
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
I'm sorry.

697
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
I'll go there.

698
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,180
You're not there, right?

699
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,260
I can't do that.

700
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,760
Hello, Xiaoman?

701
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,500
Hello, sis.

702
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
What's up with Vice Health Department?

703
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,260
Crushed you.

704
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,260
You weren't sleeping well in the night.

705
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,260
Sis.

706
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,260
I only know that the local mangoes are free to use.

707
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,260
It's okay.

708
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,260
I've grown up with a single eye.

709
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,260
It's almost 100 days.

710
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,260
It's almost 100 days.

711
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,260
Sister, I'm going to give you a hand-to-hand treatment.

712
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,260
I'm going to do a skin care for you.

713
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,260
You can come.

714
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,260
I have to go.

715
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,260
Okay, okay.

716
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,260
Bring the other one.

717
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,260
I'll bring you the other one in a few days.

718
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,260
Sister will bring it to you.

719
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,260
I'm going to give you a hand-to-hand treatment.

720
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,260
Timetable

721
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,260
Captain we have to go.

722
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,260
Auntie has got work to do, you may choose the Pilgrbits.

723
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,980
screws.

724
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,100
Good?

725
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,740
credible?

726
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,060
If we don't give you our strange monkey sounded this please we will die.

727
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,060
I should have come here.

728
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060
Guang,

729
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,060
this time you are doing well.

730
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,060
I want to thank you.

731
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,060
No, thanks.

732
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,060
I have to go.

733
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,060
Wait a minute.

734
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,060
Your name is written on the card.

735
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
A group of 50,000.

736
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,060
Write a name for me.

737
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,060
Let them write the name of the recent incident.

738
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
Cao,

739
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,060
this season,

740
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,060
a group of oscars are fighting.

741
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,060
They don't even eat or drink on the news.

742
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,060
They must be angry.

743
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,060
Let those oscars go back.

744
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,060
When they are defeated,

745
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,060
we will take revenge.

746
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,060
Okay.

747
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,060
Someone is here.

748
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,060
What's going on?

749
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,060
The door is locked.

750
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,060
Hello.

751
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,060
Who are you?

752
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,060
Guang.

753
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,060
Who are you?

754
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,060
I'm Wenwen.

755
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,060
I'm Wenwen.

756
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,060
Wenwen?

757
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,060
I'm Wenwen.

758
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,060
I'm Wenwen.

759
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
Wenwen?

760
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,060
Why are you here?

761
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,060
You are a student of Tuwasi.

762
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,060
Why are you here?

763
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,060
I'm here to tell you.

764
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,060
How many times have you been here?

765
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,060
I've been here for two days.

766
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,060
But I've been here for a long time.

767
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,060
I don't know how to find a job.

768
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,060
I can only find you.

769
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,060
Guang,

770
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
can you do something here?

771
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,060
You can make a face and say it.

772
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,060
It's too late.

773
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,060
I'll tell you where to live.

774
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,060
I'll tell you tomorrow.

775
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,060
Wenwen,

776
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,060
I'm here to talk to you.

777
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,060
My head is a little bit funny.

778
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,060
But it's a little bit safe.

779
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,060
I'll tell you where to live.

780
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,060
I'll tell you what I need.

781
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,060
You can tell me what you need.

782
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,060
Okay.

783
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,060
You stay here for a while.

784
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,060
Remember,

785
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,060
I'm here to tell you.

786
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,060
I want to see you.

787
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,060
You're getting on your ass.

788
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,060
It looks familiar.

789
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,060
I need to order some of their food.

790
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,800
Brother.

791
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,740
mostra

792
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,660
Think

793
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,560
to

794
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,440
quickly

795
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,160
bowl

796
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,480
and

797
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,780
to

798
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,780
We can't go here.

799
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,780
Okay.

800
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,780
I'm going to the background today.

801
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,780
I'll call you when I'm done.

802
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
The background?

803
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,780
If you want to sell something,

804
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,780
you can only sell one.

805
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,780
Keep it.

806
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,780
Okay.

807
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,780
What's wrong?

808
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,780
Get out of here!

809
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,780
Get out of here!

810
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,780
Move!

811
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,780
Move!

812
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,780
Hello?

813
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,780
Hello?

814
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,780
Hello?

815
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,780
Hello?

816
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,780
I'm Yan Shoucun.

817
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,780
What's up?

818
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,780
I'm asking for your help.

819
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,780
Hurry up and bring someone here.

820
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,780
Hurry up!

821
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,780
Don't be so reckless.

822
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,780
Wait for them first.

823
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,780
I'll be right there.

824
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,780
Okay, hurry up.

825
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,780
Sit down and have a look.

826
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,780
Where's the thief?

827
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,780
Where is he?

828
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,780
Where is he?

829
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,780
This guy.

830
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,780
You're a thief.

831
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,780
You've been looking for me.

832
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,780
You think I'm not worth it?

833
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,780
You've found someone, haven't you?

834
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,780
You were just talking to the thief.

835
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,780
There must be a situation.

836
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,780
Yan Shoucun,

837
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,780
you're a thief.

838
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,780
He's not a thief.

839
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,780
You were just talking to the thief.

840
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,780
You're a thief.

841
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,780
You're a thief.

842
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,780
I'm sure there's a way to get you out of here.

843
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,780
I'm going to get you out of here.

844
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,780
Yan Shoucun,

845
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,780
you're a liar.

846
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,780
You're a source of news.

847
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,780
Don't look at me.

848
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,780
Get in.

849
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,780
You can't think of anything.

850
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,780
Get out of here.

851
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,780
You...

852
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,780
Why aren't you coming?

853
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,780
I'm coming.

854
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,780
I'm going to kill you.

855
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,780
I'm going to kill you.

856
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,780
Captain Yang,

857
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,780
the woman from the gate just came.

858
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,780
She's coming back.

859
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,780
There's a situation here.

860
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,780
Go.

861
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,780
Captain Yang,

862
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,780
