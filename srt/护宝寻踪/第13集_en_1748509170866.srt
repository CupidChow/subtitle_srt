1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,440
Stadiums of Desert

2
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,560
In this place

3
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,640
A soldier with an iron pole

4
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,200
than that

5
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:59,060
Now is reallyeras

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:21,000
uh

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I've been here for a few days.

8
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
After I got here today, I came to thank you.

9
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I heard you had a fight a few days ago.

10
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What?

11
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What happened?

12
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't talk about it in my mind.

13
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's not a big deal.

14
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I just want to fight a few big guys.

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't worry.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This time, it's not going to be easy.

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm Kun Ge.

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The leader of the Cultural and Cultural Bureau is here.

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Have you been here before?

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes, I have.

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
When did you come here?

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's been a while.

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hello, sir.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm Zhang Suo.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm Luo Xin.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Long time no see.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
These are some of the rubble walls we've cleared.

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We've measured the area and height.

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We've also measured the cultural and social level.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We've made a note.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Take a look.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You can see that the soil is clearly divided.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The first layer is the soil.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The second layer is the pile.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And then there's the cultural and cultural layer.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The soil is hard and gray.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's covered with a lot of Chinese-style tiles.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So we think it's part of the original plan.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The original plan?

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes, it could be the rubble walls or the door frames.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But because the tiles are too hard,

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
we can't tell what exactly it is.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is indeed a combination of the original plan.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's not the door frame.

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Could it be the soul of the Queen of Dou?

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The soul of the Queen of Dou is over there.

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Through this location, we can confirm that

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
it's definitely not the original plan of Dou Lin.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's not Dou Lin.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's the soul of Dou Lin.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Who is it?

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We're in a rush to have a meeting today.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So we have a rare situation.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
A group of immortals

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
left a batch of demon-like words on the black market.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
A batch?

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
There are a lot of people who have been reported.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But there are no photos of immortals and immortals.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We can only use the smoke to judge.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
There are so many words collected.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Could it be the demon-like words?

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We should contact the brothers in the garden

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
to see if they have demon-like words.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Captain Yang, do you think this batch of goods

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
will die from the smoke?

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If it's from the smoke,

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
it could be the smell of the wood.

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But it's hard to judge now.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No matter what the situation is,

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
we can only choose to sell it on the market.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We can only find the clues.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes, that's what I mean.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But we have to be quick.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We have to be quick.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We can't let this batch of words

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
leak out.

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're so smart.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The Wenliang family

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
is all here to die.

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But we're all empty-handed.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The highest price is only 1 million.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
1 million?

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't be so suspicious.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Qiliang can't compare to the old Ha Song of the Mujian Hui.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you're hungry,

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
you can't bear the fire.

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You can't bear the smoke.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You can't bear the smoke.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How about

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
we sell it to the Mujian Hui?

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Qingsa,

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
he's the one who's got the upper hand.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Don't think about the money every day.

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You can only catch big fish if you have a long line.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If we sell this batch of goods a hundred times,

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
we won't have to make any money in the next life.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm not sure about that.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're talking nonsense.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Listen,

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
tonight,

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
a big boss is coming to see the goods.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Tomorrow, two more people will be waiting for you.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Since you're so generous,

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
we can't sell the goods.

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Put the letter in your stomach.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't worry.

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Wait for me to send you the money.

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
These three geese have been guarding the river for days.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They have to draw a map.

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Basically,

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
the whole park is a place where the green family hides people.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
How do you know that?

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Look,

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
this is the route you drew.

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The cultural park's patrol route

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
is basically surrounded by this circle.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What's in this circle?

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There's a big dog.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
A very big dog.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Do you know what it's for?

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's for protecting the park.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It can protect the park and tax it.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I asked a villager.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
When you drew the map,

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
you also dug a water lily.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What's wrong with me?

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Brother,

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I went to the park

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and checked the cultural park.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The rules are as follows.

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Early morning, 6 to 8 o'clock.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Late afternoon, 2 to 4 o'clock.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Midnight, 11 to 1 o'clock.

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
These three hours are short.

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That means

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
you can work from 1 to 6 o'clock.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Half an hour before and after the break.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Four hours.

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Enough.

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll prepare the park tomorrow.

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What do you want to do tomorrow night?

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We can go to the beach tomorrow.

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll wash the wet clothes first.

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Hello, uncle.

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Please look after the park.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay.

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What are you looking at?

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Hello, uncle.

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I see that

157
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
there are famous people in this store.

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
There is no Song Ci.

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You see Song Ci?

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Now, there are many famous people

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and many sellers.

162
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Song Ci is a little old.

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You don't go in if you don't see many people.

166
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I go in and use it.

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You want to see Song Ci?

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I want to see Song Ci.

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What do you think about this?

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I like this one.

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll share it with you.

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This is very beautiful.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
How much is this?

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I like it.

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I like it.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I won't make money for the first time.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Come often.

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Take it away.

179
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What do you mean?

180
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I can't live without it.

181
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You can't live without this.

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's very beautiful.

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But I can't see

184
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
if this is real or fake.

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Is it real?

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's fake.

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't think about it.

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You can't say it's real.

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You can.

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's real.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Brother,

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
have you been here for two years?

193
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Two years.

194
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
How long have you been here?

195
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's been six and a half years.

196
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why haven't you been here?

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Give me a call.

198
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll send you a call.

199
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
There's another one that can't be sold.

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a little bit of a right-hand man.

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Brother, the police are here.

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What are you doing?

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm talking to the police.

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm calling Song Ci.

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
How do you know that?

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I don't know.

207
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't know what to do.

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The boss asked Song Ci.

209
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Should I tell him to buy it?

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's a little dark.

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Didn't the man just let Song Ci go?

212
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Why are you here again?

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm fine.

214
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I can't get the wind.

215
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay.

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The police didn't let me down.

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He's going to die soon.

218
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Are you going to dig?

219
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Of course.

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You're going to die if you don't have money.

221
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Have you packed your things?

222
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I've packed them. I'll go get them at midnight.

223
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Brother,

224
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
why haven't you been here?

225
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Give me a call.

226
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll send you a call.

227
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What's wrong with the phone?

228
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's so dark.

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What are you talking about?

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Brother!

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Brother!

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Hello, Xiao Guo.

233
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Drink some water.

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm not feeling well.

235
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm afraid I won't be able to drink it.

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I can't get up.

237
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Put the letter in your stomach.

238
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll make a call.

239
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Who?

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Please say hello.

241
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Hello?

242
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Didn't you say ten days?

243
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You have to go to Nanci

244
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and ask around for the money.

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Why do you care about my questions?

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't sell my goods to you.

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I just want to remind you

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
that the police are going to

249
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
my store today.

250
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm going to ask you about the money.

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What's the question?

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Don't panic.

253
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll tell you the details.

254
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But I want to remind you

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
that you'd better not go to Nanci

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
these days.

257
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You'd better be careful.

258
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'll hang up now.

259
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Wait.

260
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
How's the 5 million?

261
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Brother, we haven't got the money yet.

262
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Can you wait for a few more days?

263
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I knew you wouldn't go.

264
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm not going to wait.

265
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm waiting for someone.

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'll sell my goods.

267
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If someone is a monk, you buy yours.

268
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I won't take your money.

269
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You're so stubborn.

270
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
No wonder I'm so lazy.

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Dongsheng.

272
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What's up, Brother Fugui?

273
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Come here.

274
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What's up? Have you finished packing?

275
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's almost done.

276
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll be back tonight.

277
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I heard from the police

278
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
that the thief

279
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
is coming to send us away.

280
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
They want us to look for the place

281
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
where we can find the thief.

282
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll tell Hongfu to call his wife.

283
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
She has to be there in the day.

284
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We'll spend two hours at night.

285
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's the second half of the day.

286
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't have much time.

287
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay, that's it.

288
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You get back to work.

289
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Brother Fugui, take care.

290
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Okay.

291
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
A few days ago, we received some reports

292
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
that a group of demons

293
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
were here.

294
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We have three judgments.

295
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
First, they want to set fire.

296
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Second, they want to set fire on the high-tech products.

297
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Third, they want to set fire on the high-tech products.

298
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Shang Yifang, report the situation.

299
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Okay.

300
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The production of high-tech products

301
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
is very high.

302
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's impossible to

303
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
leave a large amount of it in the market.

304
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Then, another man

305
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
gave us a key clue

306
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
to find the goods.

307
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Captain Yang, Captain Qi.

308
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I've been working

309
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
as a research researcher.

310
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm a specialist.

311
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
This is a very high quality product.

312
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's very difficult

313
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
to make a product with this quality.

314
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Captain Yang,

315
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
we haven't found anything like this

316
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
in our cultural relics yet.

317
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's not a high quality product.

318
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The worst case

319
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
is that it's from an old tomb.

320
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I agree.

321
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So, you mean

322
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I should cooperate with you?

323
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Brother Ding, please be patient.

324
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'll cooperate with our cultural relics

325
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
to conduct a joint patrol

326
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
to find the knife and the sword.

327
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Okay.

328
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You and Ding Yan

329
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
go to the water and see what's going on.

330
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'll take someone

331
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
to the moon.

332
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What's going on?

333
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Brother, are you okay?

334
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm fine.

335
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Look at your face.

336
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The environment of this tomb

337
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
is very precious.

338
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's very clear.

339
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Even the sword

340
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
in the cultural relics

341
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
is very strong.

342
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Even the position of the sword in the grave is very good.

343
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Brother, you've already got the sword.

344
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I just started to look for it.

345
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I haven't found the position of the sword yet.

346
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Wu Nianhui,

347
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
we've been teaching each other for many years.

348
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I've been teaching you for many years.

349
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
How can I trust you?

350
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I really don't believe in your words.

351
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Why?

352
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Just for a sword.

353
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Then tell me,

354
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
what's on your head?

355
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm just a student.

356
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's just a

357
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
simple thing.

358
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's convenient for me to write a note.

359
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Wu Nianhui,

360
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm

361
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
a man of the sword.

362
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You've been

363
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
trying to get this position

364
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
from me.

365
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You don't believe me either.

366
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's not a good idea to take it back now.

367
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You've been trying to get this position from me.

368
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You've been trying to get this position from me.

369
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You didn't get it.

370
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I can't trust you with the place where you live.

371
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's go.

372
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Since you've got it,

373
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I won't be with you.

374
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I haven't found you yet.

375
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You're just wasting your time.

376
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This lawyer

377
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
is very ruthless.

378
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The more we look, the more we find.

379
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You can't finish it alone.

380
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
How about

381
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
we work together?

382
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
How about

383
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
we do it together?

384
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
We work together?

385
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You're just wasting your time.

386
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What do you want?

387
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We work together.

388
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Brother,

389
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
wait a minute.

390
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Tell our expert

391
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
if it's useful.

392
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Come on, listen.

393
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Old man, thank you.

394
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You hit the wrong person.

395
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You're lucky.

396
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
The expert is lucky.

397
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You can continue.

398
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Brother.

399
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Come on.

400
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll keep an eye on you tonight.

401
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Okay.

402
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Open the door.

403
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What's going on?

404
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What's going on?

405
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
No.

406
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Sister Man, call her.

407
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You're so stubborn.

408
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's right.

409
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
There's a car here.

410
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's right.

411
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The car looks familiar.

412
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
This is the car of

413
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
the rich in our village.

414
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I bought a car today.

415
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's a three-seater.

416
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Go to the side.

417
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Go.

418
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Go.

419
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Go.

420
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Go.

421
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Go.

422
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Go.

423
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Go.

424
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What are you doing?

425
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Go.

426
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Go.

427
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Stop.

428
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Stop.

429
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Where are you going?

430
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
There's one more.

431
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Go.

432
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Call her.

433
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Call her.

434
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Come on.

435
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm going to find her.

436
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
They are waiting for you.

437
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Go back and die.

438
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I don't want to go to the house.

439
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't want to go to the park.

440
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm going to find her.

441
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I can't go.

442
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What if...

443
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm afraid of her.

444
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Go away.

445
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Wait.

446
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Don't move.

447
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Stop.

448
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Stop.

449
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Listen to me.

450
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I know you are a man of the house.

451
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
If you send me 500 yuan,

452
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'll give you money.

453
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Okay?

454
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I have 500 yuan.

455
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
If you send me 500 yuan, I'll give you money.

456
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No.

457
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Stop.

458
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Stop.

459
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Stop.

460
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Stop.

461
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Don't move.

462
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Don't move.

463
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Stop.

464
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Stop.

465
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I said I'm going to find her.

466
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
She's your woman.

467
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
She's your woman.

468
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I was wrong.

469
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm going to find her.

470
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I don't want to go.

471
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm not going to find her.

472
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Hold on.

473
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm going to make sure she's dead.

474
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,160
I'm going to make sure she's dead!

475
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
You're the old man who's been protecting me.

476
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,360
If I'm tired, I'll stay here.

477
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,160
At least, I can do it myself.

478
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,000
If I have to do it alone,

479
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,880
I'll wear a pair of pants,

480
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,120
get the fire out,

481
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,800
and run away with the fire.

482
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,160
Save your own life.

483
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,120
Sorry, the number you have dialed

484
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,560
is currently unavailable.

485
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,120
Please redial later.

486
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,920
What?

487
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,040
I really have to do it alone.

488
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,600
Sorry, the number you have dialed

489
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,320
is currently unavailable.

490
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,080
There must be a problem.

491
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,280
You just have to trust me.

492
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,720
Shut up, will you?

493
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,400
Don't mess with me.

494
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,360
Keep talking.

495
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,560
Don't ask me what's going on.

496
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,520
Brother, it's me.

497
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,880
You're back so late.

498
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,320
Brother, it's 14 o'clock.

499
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,640
What happened?

500
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,280
I have a cold.

501
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,320
Cold?

502
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,000
You ate the fire?

503
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,200
I'm not doing anything.

504
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,720
I have a problem.

505
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,160
What's wrong?

506
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,720
The contract man took the contract man away.

507
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,400
Is he crazy?

508
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,200
Why did he take you away?

509
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,600
Brother, the contract man took the contract man away.

510
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,280
Then why did you come here?

511
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,920
I was afraid you'd get a fever.

512
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,120
So I came back to report it to you.

513
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,520
What are you reporting?

514
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,320
Run!

515
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,520
I'll kill you

516
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,600
if you dare to say a word.

517
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,160
What about that?

518
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,240
Did I saves the money?

519
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,200
It'll change its personality, right?

520
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,200
힣

521
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,000
What...

522
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,080
All right.

523
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,040
I know.

524
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,920
Okay.

525
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,680
Brother Yongfu,

526
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,080
I'm leaving for Mingxian.

527
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,120
What for?

528
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,840
Mingxian informed me that

529
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,320
two people from Lvya Village

530
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,240
are in the Wenbao Garden.

531
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,320
They found a thief.

532
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:32,920
Let's go.

533
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,440
Brother,

534
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,320
I've been waiting here since last night.

535
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
Don't rush.

536
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
Let's go to dinner.

537
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,840
It's too hot out here now,

538
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,080
the Complex is setting up an angels' star at night.

539
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,500
imeters'

540
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,900
Is house porcelain craft

541
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,580
an immortal?

542
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
Of course.

543
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,440
I waslane

544
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,400
my world before.

545
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,440
It sheets

546
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
You're so annoying.

547
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
You've been making us feel so upset for so long.

548
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
You're making us so nervous.

549
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
You're wrong.

550
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
You shouldn't have done that.

551
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,440
You should have thanked him.

552
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Why?

553
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
He did it for us.

554
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
If he hadn't come in,

555
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
we would have been the ones who would have been in the mood.

556
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,440
I'm so tired.

557
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Here, Guo.

558
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,440
Cheers.

559
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
This is a cup.

560
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
I'm so thirsty.

561
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Please help us.

562
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
We're so thirsty.

563
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
We've been through so many things.

564
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,440
God won't let us go down this road.

565
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,440
Let's go down another road.

566
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
You still want to get into Zhao Youlin's house.

567
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,440
You have to find a way to get in.

568
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,440
Yes.

569
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
No one can do his job now.

570
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
Let's go to his house.

571
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,440
What house?

572
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Have you seen the animal world?

573
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
I've seen the first episode.

574
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,440
It's about how Baozi doesn't like sheep.

575
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,440
My Baozi has been staring at sheep.

576
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,440
He didn't eat for a long time.

577
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
Until the third day,

578
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,440
he suddenly wanted to die.

579
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
He wanted to die.

580
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,440
There are three things that can't be done.

581
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
First,

582
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,440
if you want to do the best,

583
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
you need to be patient.

584
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
I understand.

585
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
Xingzhou Lake is a place for sheep.

586
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
That's right.

587
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
We can't let him go.

588
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
If he goes,

589
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
we'll find a place to sell him.

590
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,440
We're the Baozi.

591
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
Hello.

592
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,440
This is our sheep farm.

593
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,320
We're the chief of the

594
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
Qida factory in the cultural security department.

595
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
This is the group of cultural reporters

596
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
in our Lvja village.

597
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
Lv Fu Kun.

598
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
Hello.

599
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
Lidong.

600
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
Hello.

601
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
They caught him.

602
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
When I was searching,

603
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,440
I saw a piece of bread.

604
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
They must have opened it.

605
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,440
I've copied the plate number.

606
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
Take a look.

607
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
He's there.

608
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
He's in the next room.

609
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
I'll be watching you.

610
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
I think

611
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,440
this is a local

612
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
and a foreign collusion.

613
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
I'll give you two tasks.

614
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
First,

615
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,440
take the people back to the village.

616
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
Make sure they don't commit crimes.

617
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
Second,

618
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
make sure the people around them

619
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
are inspected.

620
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
Check if they're innocent

621
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
and if they have money.

622
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
Take the people back to the village

623
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,440
where the fire was put out.

624
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,440
Second,

625
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,440
check the car seats.

626
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
I'll do it now.

627
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Captain Qi,

628
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
where are the people?

629
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,440
I'll be in your care.

630
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
I'll be watching the people.

631
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
Here.

632
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
You look familiar.

633
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
You look familiar.

634
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,440
I met him before.

635
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,440
I think so.

636
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,440
Come here.

637
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
Cur 운동 Je ne peux même plus one.

638
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
Excellent.

639
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
How do you feel?

640
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,440
Good.

641
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
I'm half over the moon right now.

642
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
No.

643
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
No.

644
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
I told them

645
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,440
there's an dehydration聲音声音

646
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,440
and their mood is different.

647
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:04,600
It sometimes

648
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
It's a common one in Beijing.

649
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,600
But this tomb has no relics or bones.

650
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
It's actually...

651
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
What dynasty is it from?

652
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
It's from the Song Dynasty.

653
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Let's take a look around.

654
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,600
See if there are any new clues.

655
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Hey!

656
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Who's there?

657
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
Who's there?

658
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
What?

659
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
What?

660
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
Another thief?

661
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
He's a thief.

662
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
I'm going to kill him.

663
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
It's not like he's been here for a long time.

664
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
It's not a new one.

665
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
It's probably not from yesterday.

666
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
You've been searching all day.

667
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Why haven't you been here?

668
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
I saw the thief.

669
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Don't worry.

670
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
This is the only place we can go.

671
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
We can't get caught.

672
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Who's there?

673
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
This way.

674
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
This way?

675
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Bring the clip and rope.

676
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Let's go down and have a look.

677
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Okay.

678
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Let's go.

679
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
Put it down here.

680
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Come on.

681
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Come on.

682
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Go.

683
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Okay.

684
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
It's okay.

685
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
Okay.

686
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Okay.

687
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
Let's go.

688
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Come on.

689
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
Come on.

690
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
Let's go.

691
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Old Dong.

692
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Old Dong.

693
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Old Dong.

694
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
Look at this.

695
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
This is a new one.

696
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
It's new.

697
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Let's go.

698
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Okay.

699
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Look.

700
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Look at this.

701
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
It's the same one.

702
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Look.

703
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,600
It's the same one.

704
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
It's the same one.

705
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
It's the same one.

706
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
Let's go and have a look.

707
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
Okay.

708
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Come on.

709
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Get up.

710
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
Captain.

711
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
Captain.

712
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
We're sorry.

713
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
It's okay.

714
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
We're just pretending.

715
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
We just came to apologize.

716
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,600
We know that it's not the one we're talking about.

717
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,600
How's the contract?

718
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
The other contracts are going up.

719
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
It shouldn't be that fast.

720
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Oh, right.

721
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
I just got the clip.

722
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
The clip is a family.

723
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
It's not a car.

724
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
I'm sorry.

725
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
Captain.

726
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
Captain Yang, sit down.

727
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
I'm not sitting.

728
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
I...

729
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
No, I'm not.

730
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
What?

731
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Are you the one?

732
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
What?

733
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
It's been more than ten years.

734
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
You're still the same.

735
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
You've changed.

736
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Right?

737
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
You're still the same.

738
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Right?

739
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,600
Right.

740
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
I'm going to the contract office.

741
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,600
I'll ask your mother and your wife to come over.

742
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
I'll ask them to talk to you personally.

743
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
Maybe you'll be better off than before.

744
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
I'll go up after I finish eating.

745
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
Is that right?

746
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Yes.

747
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
You're really good at this.

748
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
You still remember it after so long?

749
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
I do.

750
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,600
It's been more than ten years.

751
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
You're still the same.

752
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
No, I've changed.

753
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
You've changed?

754
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
You're not going to tell her?

755
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,600
No.

756
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
You're going to tell her?

757
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
All right, Captain Qi.

758
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
I'll go up.

759
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
I'll be done eating.

760
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
You guys talk.

761
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
Okay, Captain Yang.

762
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Okay, okay.

763
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
I'm going.

764
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
Okay.

765
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Captain Qi.

766
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,600
What are you doing here?

767
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
The court has decided to put you in jail.

768
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
What do you mean?

769
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
Right.

770
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
I'm innocent.

771
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
This is a crime.

772
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
We didn't do anything wrong.

773
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,600
You're not pretending.

774
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
I'm just a fool.

775
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
It has nothing to do with me.

776
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,600
We didn't do anything wrong.

777
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
This is not a crime.

778
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
What are you talking about?

779
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
This is not a crime.

780
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
Are you a fool?

781
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
Do you recognize this?

782
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
This is the garden that was built yesterday.

783
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Did you dig it?

784
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,600
No, this is definitely not.

785
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
This is the first time we've been there.

786
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
Uncle Feng, I'm telling you.

787
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
Every word you say now is against my law.

788
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
You don't understand?

789
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
I know the law.

790
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
I've been there several times.

791
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
What?

792
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
I'm just being honest.

793
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
I don't dare to lie.

794
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
This is definitely not my painting.

795
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,600
We came to your Qingchuan and did this.

796
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
And we made you wait.

797
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Hurry up and tell me who you are.

798
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
Who is the contract?

799
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Who is the local people of Qingchuan?

800
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,600
There are four of us in the contract.

801
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
The three of them are brothers of the Mula family.

802
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
I only know the old three.

803
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600
The nickname is Sanma.

804
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
There is only one Qingchuan local.

805
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
He found us.

806
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
I don't know the name.

807
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
I don't know how to speak.

808
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Where do you know?

809
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
The Xianglong hotel in Nankang New Village

810
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
was arranged by two Qingchuan people.

811
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
And others.

812
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Qingchuan people came before.

813
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Jinglitun Hongyun Hotel.

814
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,600
If the Qingchuan people don't come, we'll leave.

815
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Where to go?

816
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
They are brothers.

817
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,600
They are all behind me.

818
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Sanma is drunk again.

819
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
Chief, he said he had a brother-in-law

820
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
who was buying flowers in Qingyuan County.

821
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
He also did this.

822
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
He might go to find him.

823
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Where is the location?

824
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
Why are you telling me?

825
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
I just heard that they got drunk.

826
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,600
What kind of family is it?

827
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
In short,

828
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Feng Sibao's client is very reliable.

829
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,600
It is possible that he only knows one thing.

830
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Before and after.

831
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,600
If it is said that it was stolen by Chang Yilang's mother,

832
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,600
someone heard the sound and wanted to get it.

833
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
They organized the He Dong people.

834
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
In the end, they dug the empty tomb.

835
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
You have a point.

836
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,600
The Cultural Affairs Bureau just called.

837
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
The word you sent to Jian

838
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,600
is the evidence.

839
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
But

840
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,600
whether it was Chang Yilang's tomb

841
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
is not yet known.

842
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,600
Because there is no concrete evidence.

843
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
The other three He Dong people

844
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,600
might have gone to Qingyuan County.

845
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,600
How about we go there?

846
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Let's go.

847
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
You two follow me.

848
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Okay.

849
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
Well,

850
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,600
why don't you say hello to them?

851
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,600
Isn't Wu Zhengchuan, the deputy director of the Qingyuan County Public Security Bureau,

852
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
your classmate?

853
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Why do you want me to say hello?

854
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,600
He is promoted.

855
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
You should be more careful.

856
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,600
It will be easier for your apprentice to go there.

857
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,600
You are a thief.

858
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Thank you.

859
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Thank you.

860
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Thank you for your hard work.

861
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,600
Wu Xu.

862
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,600
What are you doing?

863
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
We didn't do anything.

864
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
You are so stubborn.

865
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
You are so annoying.

866
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,600
This is your assistant, Xiao Zhu.

867
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,600
Welcome the other colleagues to be your instructor.

868
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Welcome.

869
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,600
You know what?

870
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
I have no way to ask you for help.

871
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
Nonsense.

872
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
I don't need your help.

873
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
I don't exist.

874
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Don't worry.

875
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
I will accompany you.

876
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
If you want to join the office,

877
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
I will give you a number.

878
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
Don't be so stubborn.

879
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Old man.

880
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,600
You are so stubborn.

881
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,600
This old man has not seen me for so many years.

882
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Come on, sit down.

883
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
Come on, I'll help you.

884
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Help me.

885
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
Help me.

886
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,600
You are so strong.

887
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,600
You haven't changed in so many years.

888
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,600
I am not talking about you.

889
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
I am talking about Zhang Zi.

890
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Did you see the message I sent you?

891
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Yes.

892
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Did you see the action?

893
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,600
Why are you so anxious?

894
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,600
I was so anxious when I was in the office.

895
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,600
I was so worried.

896
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
I was so worried.

897
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
Let's talk about Zhang Zi.

898
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,600
I have already sent the message to Hua Fei Lian.

899
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,600
I will tell you when I have the result.

900
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Did you find any villages?

901
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
Well,

902
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
there are so many villages.

903
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
There are Zhou family,

904
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,600
Li family,

905
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Zhang family,

906
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,600
Wang family,

907
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
Liu family,

908
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,600
Qiao family.

909
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,600
There are so many villages.

910
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,600
There are many villages in the back of the Jihe.

911
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,600
You need to check them one by one.

912
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,600
It takes four days.

913
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
Zi Jun,

914
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,600
you must be tired from running around in the old house.

915
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Find some villages to warm up.

916
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,600
Have a good rest.

917
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,600
Don't worry.

918
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
I have a clue.

919
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,600
I will tell you the first time.

920
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
He really loves you.

921
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,600
What a girl.

922
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
You are so rich.

923
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,600
The sky above us

924
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,600
The moon under our feet

925
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,600
We are still standing here

926
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,600
In the dark

927
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,600
The darkness that burned the earth

928
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,600
The deep of the warm and the hot

929
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,600
The abyss under the wild leaves

930
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,600
The abyss

931
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,600
The wind

932
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,600
The moon under our feet

933
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
The dark

934
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,100
Boris

935
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,600
The abyss

936
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,600
The people

937
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,600
We have to Mikhal

938
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,600
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

939
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,600
Who will guard the time

940
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,600
and sing the song of fate

941
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,600
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

942
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,600
Who will guard the time

943
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,600
and sing the song of fate

944
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,600
and sing the song of fate

945
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,600
The pain of the heaven has gone to the ashes

946
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,600
The yellow river is still flowing in the haze

947
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,600
The wine of the cup is still a false one

948
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,600
The wind blows against the south wall

949
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:59,600
I walk through the city walls and the road is clear

950
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,600
I pass my words through the heart

951
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,600
and sing the song of fate

952
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,600
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

953
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,600
The world is quiet and the years are short

954
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,600
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

955
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,600
Who will guard the time

956
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,600
and sing the song of fate
