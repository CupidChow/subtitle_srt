Where are we going?

7
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
I am boss.

8
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,080
Because there are a lot of people out there and are confuse with each other.

9
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,680
God of destiny is complicated.

10
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,120
I should be responsible.

11
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,480
Please say anything.

12
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Yes.

13
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
Guang,

14
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
you left this silk on the front desk.

15
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
I've got some money to buy some.

16
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
The house is already cold.

17
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
Where are you staying?

18
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
I've asked.

19
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,720
It's said that you'll have to take the stone every day.

20
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
It's too expensive.

21
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,720
I saw that there was a dirty house in your yard.

22
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,720
I've already come out of it.

23
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
If you don't want to get sick,

24
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
I'll just sleep in the dirty house.

25
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
Guang.

26
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
I want to go to the county to pick it up.

27
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
I want to see if you can get back to the house.

28
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
I want to see if you can stay in the village and work hard.

29
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
I'm tired of hearing you.

30
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Guang.

31
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
I'm not good enough to be a good person.

32
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
No.

33
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,720
I know that it's good for you to live.

34
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,720
But I can't let you go.

35
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,720
I can't let you go to the county to get a good life.

36
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
I'm not afraid.

37
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
I'm not afraid of dying.

38
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Guang, I'm begging you.

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,720
If you let me go,

40
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
I won't live.

41
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm telling you the truth.

42
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,720
You'll have to live if you have money.

43
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
You don't have enough money to make money.

44
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
Guang.

45
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
I'm telling you the truth.

46
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
That's the wrong place in Beijing.

47
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,720
It's a hair salon in a train station.

48
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,720
I thought it was a blood-sucking hair salon.

49
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
But I didn't know that it was a hair salon.

50
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
I thought you could find a way to get out of it.

51
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
They must be working hard everywhere.

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
I don't dare to wear it alone.

53
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,720
I'm not afraid of dying.

54
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
Don't cry.

55
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
So,

56
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
let's go back to the hometown.

57
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
We'll go back to the next day.

58
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
I'll see my father-in-law.

59
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,720
I'll go to the county to get a good life.

60
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
I'll find a good family.

61
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
You're not afraid of dying.

62
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
I'm not afraid of dying.

63
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
You're not afraid of dying.

64
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
You're not coming out?

65
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
I can dry my hair.

66
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
I can even learn to dry my hair.

67
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,720
I'll be a good person.

68
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
You're going to be a bad person for your father-in-law.

69
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Because you're a good person.

70
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
I'm not a good person.

71
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
You used to be a good person.

72
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
You're a good person.

73
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
You're a good person.

74
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
You're a good person.

75
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
You just said

76
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
that you're a good person.

77
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Then you take this money

78
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
and pay it back to the county to get a new job.

79
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Then you can move to the county.

80
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
You said it was expensive.

81
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Who's going to make you pay?

82
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
You just said it was expensive.

83
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
And

84
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
this place

85
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
you can't come here without my help.

86
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Why?

87
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Why?

88
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
Because

89
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
I'm a person who

90
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
likes to be in the mood.

91
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
I like to be in the mood.

92
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,720
Why do you have so many problems?

93
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
I'm cold.

94
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
I'll go and get some warm-up.

95
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
Tang.

96
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Tang.

97
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Yang.

98
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
Yang.

99
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
You're here.

100
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
I didn't know you were so tired last night.

101
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
You're such a big person.

103
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
I heard that

104
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
you're so tired.

105
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,720
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
You're a good person.

107
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
I just want to ask you something.

109
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Do you have any situation with Moca?

110
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
I've already told you.

111
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Don't worry.

112
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Moca

113
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
is the best person.

114
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
I'm a good person.

115
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Thank you.

116
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Yang.

117
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm a road impressive motorbike.

118
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
I've served there for eight years.

119
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
How could three times.

120
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Yang,

121
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,720
it's not my job.

122
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
After that

123
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,680
if you break gasoline,

124
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
you want a drooped,

125
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
a juxtaposed.

126
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Then

127
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
you don't have much money

128
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
in your phone.

129
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,800
Your neighbor's money is

130
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Don't talk about.

131
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
You know

132
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
I entrusted you the part

133
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
for the garage.

134
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
I was so surprised that he ran away.

135
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
What?

136
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
I was caught by the police.

137
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
You were?

138
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
You were quite cool.

139
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
You were so anxious that you wanted to kill us.

140
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
You said you were a thief and you wanted to kill us.

141
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
You went with us.

142
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
You didn't even ask for our help.

143
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Then why didn't you just watch?

144
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,720
I was so anxious that I couldn't watch him.

145
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
I was so angry that I had to kill him.

146
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,720
I thought that he was a journalist.

147
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,720
You think that I'm the one who is the journalist?

148
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
I was utterly trajectory ahead this year.

149
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Because we had schemed in a way.

150
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Since Met producer My love has always cared for me.

151
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,720
Because he is very suitable, we had nothing else to do.

152
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Captain Yang,

153
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,420
oldLei Zhang,

154
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,720
and my husband is posingал his witness.

155
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,720
They published a report toirus and tried to Baham again.

156
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,880
and meprosy Overload,

157
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,420
you could go to the public scene

158
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,840
And force you toàn

159
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,180
I have a intrigued

160
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
You can't resolve it

161
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,200
You can clear the sky

162
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,680
To avoid wars

163
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
concerns

164
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
That's good

165
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
Boss Yi is here

166
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,160
I'm not sure if I'm still in the right place.

167
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
The job is done.

168
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Can you help me?

169
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
No, I'll help you.

170
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
It's okay.

171
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
Hello.

172
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Why are you leaving?

173
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
I'm not here.

174
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
I'm waiting for you.

175
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
Why are you waiting for me?

176
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
I'm sorry to tell you.

177
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Then tell me.

178
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
It's okay.

179
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
It's a private matter.

180
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
I can only tell you.

181
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
I'm not saying you're lying.

182
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
You're lying.

183
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
Tell me when you're back.

184
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
We're going to drink beer.

185
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Go back now.

186
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
Oh, but...

187
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
What's wrong with the eye?

188
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,160
I heard there are a few more people here.

189
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,160
So, we have to catch them again.

190
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,160
We have to find them.

191
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
There are three of them.

192
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
This is a private matter.

193
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
You're going to be in trouble.

194
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
I'm not going to let you go.

195
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,160
I'm not going to let you go.

196
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
I'm not going to let you go.

197
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,160
I'm not going to let you go.

198
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,160
I'm not going to let you go.

199
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
I'm not going to let you go.

200
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
I'm not going to let you go.

201
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
I'm not going to let you go.

202
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm not going to let you go.

203
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,160
I'm not going to let you go.

204
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,160
I'm not going to let you go.

205
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
Light Li.

206
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,160
You forgot to tell me when you told them what's happened to your father.

207
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,160
If it turns out you have made a mistake in time,

208
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Qi, are you busy with yourself?

210
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
Look at the cucumber, he's so busy.

211
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
He hasn't got his hair back yet.

212
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
You're so busy.

213
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Yeah, yeah, he's still hasn't got his hair back yet.

214
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
You...

215
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
It's okay.

216
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
I'll do the hiding place thing for you this time.

217
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Look carefully and I'll take a break.

218
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
I'll do it.

219
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,160
It's so hot.

220
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
It's too hot.

221
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:34,980
Is it necessary to use

222
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,980
the

223
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,980
I'm not married. I'm a man.

224
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,980
I'm coming.

225
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,980
Here.

226
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,980
So many food.

227
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,980
Let's go.

228
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
I'm here.

229
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,980
Take care of him.

230
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,980
Yes.

231
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,980
Who is this?

232
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,980
He's a good man.

233
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,980
He's alive.

234
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,980
He's alive?

235
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,980
You're alive.

236
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
I'll tell you what.

237
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,980
Go live with him.

238
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,980
Oh, my.

239
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,980
Mr. Luo.

240
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,980
Long time no see.

241
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,980
You're so formal.

242
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,980
You haven't been together for a long time.

243
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,980
Why are you so used to it?

244
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,980
I'm not.

245
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,980
I'm full.

246
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,980
Have you changed?

247
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,980
Yes.

248
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,980
You're thin.

249
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,980
And you're black.

250
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,980
You look a little older.

251
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,980
You're older.

252
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,980
Say it again.

253
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,980
You're older.

254
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,980
Captain Qi.

255
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,980
You look like a man.

256
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,980
You're so handsome.

257
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,980
Mr. Luo.

258
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,980
Mr. Liu.

259
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,980
Do you remember me?

260
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,980
Of course.

261
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,980
You're so handsome.

262
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,980
You're so handsome.

263
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,980
I'm not.

264
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,980
I'm a man.

265
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,980
You're so handsome.

266
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,980
You're so handsome.

267
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,980
You're so old.

268
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,980
You're so handsome.

269
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,980
If Xiao Zhan knows that you're a man,

270
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,980
he'll be happy.

271
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,980
elling

272
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,980
Cha consumer

273
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,980
A load of mugs.

274
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,980
Let us hear.

275
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,980
Come sit over there,

276
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,980
let me look around.

277
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,980
It's not taking off from your car.

278
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,980
Come on.

279
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,980
This is the market.

280
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:05,760
Come on himself, you all will breathe on the doorしました

281
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,680
Go take a photo

282
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,400
Can we still make another one?

283
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
You're the one who's going to die.

284
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
You're going to die.

285
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Come back soon.

286
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
You can't just sit there.

287
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Sit here.

288
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Thank you.

289
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Thank you for coming.

290
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Thank you for coming.

291
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
I'm going to give you a big hand.

292
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Happy.

293
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Come.

294
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Come.

295
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Come.

296
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Come.

297
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Come.

298
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Come.

299
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Come.

300
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Eat more.

301
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Eat more.

302
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Come.

303
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Why are you so loose?

304
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
You don't have a haircut.

305
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
You should be more pure.

306
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Eat more.

307
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
Listen to me,

308
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
I'm going to die.

309
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Can you throw away that?

310
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Can you take care of the lady over there?

311
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
It's fine.

312
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
You want some?

313
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Yes.

314
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
You've grown up so much.

315
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
How long have you been like this?

316
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
I used to be a dog.

317
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
I can't do it without you.

318
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
People will change.

319
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Now, Scopata,

320
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Luo Jingdui,

321
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
is the only one who can do it.

322
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
You're right.

323
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
In my mind,

324
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Luo Jingdui is not that good.

325
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
But now,

326
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
you can't talk or walk.

327
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
You used to be so gentle.

328
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
But now,

329
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
you're like a girl.

330
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Scopata,

331
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
you're so slow.

332
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Look,

333
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
I've been here since 3 p.m.

334
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I've been here more than anyone else.

335
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Do you know how much it is?

336
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Of course.

337
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Now,

338
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
you're a girl.

339
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Scopata,

340
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
you've been here for a long time.

341
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
What's the situation?

342
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
There's one more thing.

343
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
How much is the salary of the media?

344
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
It's enough.

345
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Liang,

346
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
how many days do you have to search around the village?

347
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Can you lend me some money?

348
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
I'm still old.

349
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I'll pay the food and rent.

350
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
You want to check it?

351
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Yes.

352
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
We're looking for a knife.

353
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
We'll check the village.

354
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
If you're hungry,

355
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
let Luo Jingdui cook for you.

356
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
I'll check it later.

357
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
If the price of the newspaper is high,

358
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
or the price of the hair is bad,

359
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
we'll have to check the amount of the newspaper.

360
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Okay, I'll give you some support.

361
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
But you're not going to sleep.

362
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
When I was in the village last year,

363
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
many people found that I couldn't sleep well.

364
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
But when I saw you were looking for a knife,

365
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
I thought

366
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
that the reason for the knife was

367
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
that we were looking for a knife.

368
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Zishu,

369
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
the house is so empty.

370
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
I'll let you clean it up.

371
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
You can stay here.

372
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Okay, thank you.

373
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
I'll take you there.

374
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Yes, sir.

375
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
I'm sorry.

376
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
I'll clean it up.

377
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Wait.

378
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
I'll be right there.

379
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Look at the ugly face.

380
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
You're so mean.

381
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Mr. Guo,

382
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
please calm down.

383
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
I can't take care of you.

384
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Okay, I'll be right there.

385
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Take the box.

386
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Okay.

387
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Okay.

388
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
I'm sure it's all in the box.

389
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Drive slowly.

390
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Where are you going?

391
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Where are you going?

392
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
I'm going to let you take care of it.

393
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Where are you staying?

394
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
I'm not telling you.

395
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
How can I send you back?

396
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
So you don't need to.

397
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Is it inconvenient to stay at home?

398
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
You're crazy.

399
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
I heard that

400
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
you haven't been dead for years.

401
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
You two

402
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
didn't get any flowers.

403
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Have you been in the desert for a long time?

404
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
You've become so gossipy.

405
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
I don't care.

406
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
I don't care.

407
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
You care about your old friend?

408
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
You were in Qin Chuan.

409
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Because of Hou Yue?

410
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
It's for you.

411
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
What's wrong?

412
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Are you scared?

413
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Are you sure?

414
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Are you crazy?

415
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
If you're doing this for me,

416
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
I'll have to go back and cry.

417
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
You cry?

418
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Where are you staying?

419
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
The master's house.

420
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Tell me something.

421
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
I'll go to see the master's brother.

422
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
What's the situation?

423
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
I'm here.

424
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
When I was looking for the master's brother,

425
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
I found

426
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
that he was a little bit low-key.

427
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
He was a little bit weird.

428
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Look at him.

429
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
He's a little bit weird.

430
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
I'll go to the other side.

431
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
I'll go to see him.

432
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
I'll go to see him.

433
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Come.

434
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Come.

435
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
Come.

436
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Come.

437
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Slowly.

438
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Slowly.

439
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
I think he's a little bit low-key.

440
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
He's been controlled by the sea.

441
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Let's go back to the village

442
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
and see if he can overcome the danger.

443
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Let's go.

444
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Look at this rabbit.

445
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
It's like a horse.

446
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
It's so beautiful.

447
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
What on earth is going on?

448
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
What's going on?

449
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Do something.

450
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,500
I don't know.

451
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,020
What are you talking about?

452
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,020
You didn't even think of it.

453
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Stop it!

454
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
I've decided!

455
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
What did I say to you?

456
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Just good news.

457
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Brother Cui,

458
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,200
you're the master of the ghost cave.

459
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Dance and sing.

460
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,660
to try foreign technology

461
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
Master Xia

462
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,700
Have you recently heard about Dong Jing

463
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,740
R Enough

464
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,460
Are you listening to our procurator

465
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:02,980
from the new jui

466
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,780
what

467
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,920
Our host

468
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,640
Who's the one who's been to the south?

469
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,600
He said you're not a stray cat.

470
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,240
Xiang Deng,

471
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,840
what have you heard?

472
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,240
I've heard of what?

473
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,880
Xiang Deng,

474
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,480
how often do you sleep and how often do you get angry?

475
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,600
I sleep at 9 a.m.

476
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,720
I get angry at 6 p.m.

477
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,240
I've heard of what?

478
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,080
I've heard of what?

479
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,480
I don't even think about it.

480
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,720
I've been asking you for half a month.

481
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,200
No, I haven't.

482
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,560
I've heard of what?

483
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,160
I've heard of what?

484
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,240
I don't think about it.

485
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,520
I've heard of what?

486
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,160
I've never heard of what?

487
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,040
What's with you?

488
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,360
Do you have someone?

489
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,640
Does anyone have anything?

490
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,640
Who are you all?

491
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,000
Who are you?

492
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,400
I am yourwwan.

493
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,680
What is your name?

494
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,680
Then let's go to bed early.

495
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,680
Come on, come on.

496
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
Go over there.

497
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,680
Come, come over there.

498
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,680
There is a broom.

499
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,680
You must be so excited.

500
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Let's go to bed.

501
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,680
Let's go to bed.

502
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,680
Let's go.

503
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
Let's go.

504
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,680
That house is called Yuanzi.

505
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,680
It's called Yuanzi.

506
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,680
It's called Yuanzi.

507
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,680
It's called Yuanzi.

508
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,680
It's called Yuanzi.

509
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,680
In the future,

510
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,680
other people will hate Yuanzi.

511
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,680
I'm a boss.

512
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,680
I'm a boss.

513
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
Here, have some water.

514
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
I'll get it.

515
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
I'll get it.

516
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
No, thanks.

517
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Sit down.

518
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,680
This is...

519
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
This is...

520
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,680
It's all your house.

521
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,680
It's a little bit close to the east.

522
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,680
I thought it was so close.

523
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,680
It's like a valley.

524
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
It's like a valley.

525
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,680
You can't even hear it.

526
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,680
This is the treasure.

527
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
It's a tomb.

528
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
It's a tomb.

529
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
It's a little bit.

530
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,680
I'm afraid it's a little bit noisy.

531
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
Right?

532
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,680
I'll give you a reason.

533
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,680
I can't do it.

534
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,680
I can't even talk.

535
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,680
You can't even hear the sound of the wind.

536
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Zhazhen, you should go with the tomb.

537
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
No, no, no.

538
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,680
I'm a master.

539
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,680
I've never done anything illegal.

540
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
Yes.

541
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,680
Zaozi, I'll give you a chance.

542
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
You're so nice.

543
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,680
To be honest, you're so good at making things up.

544
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,680
You're so good at it.

545
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,680
If you're serious,

546
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
I'm serious.

547
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,680
But I'm sure you'll be jealous.

548
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,680
If you're not careful,

549
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,680
you'll be hated the most.

550
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,680
Yes, yes.

551
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,680
Do you hear the sound of the wind?

552
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,680
It's a little bit noisy.

553
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,680
It's a little bit noisy.

554
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
It's a little bit noisy.

555
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
It's a little bit noisy.

556
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,680
Zhazhen,

557
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,680
let me open it.

558
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,680
I'm not sure what to do with this money.

559
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,680
I know it's a little bit noisy.

560
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,680
But it's worth it.

561
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
It's worth it.

562
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,680
You're a monster.

563
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Dian,

564
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,680
you look after the people.

565
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,680
Ask them if they have any cameras nearby.

566
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
Okay.

567
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,680
What's the story?

568
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
A few days ago,

569
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,680
I was killed.

570
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,680
I was killed.

571
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,680
I was killed.

572
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,680
I was killed a few days ago.

573
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,680
Did the people see you?

574
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,680
I saw them.

575
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,680
They were all dead.

576
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,680
Zhazhen,

577
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
call me.

578
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,680
Call me when you're free.

579
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,680
Zhazhen,

580
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
will you come back to revenge?

581
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
What are you afraid of?

582
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
I'm a civil servant.

583
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
I'm a civil servant.

584
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
I'm here to protect you.

585
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,680
What happened today is,

586
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,680
we should not let others down.

587
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
It's not your fault.

588
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,680
You should be responsible.

589
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
No.

590
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
It's my first call.

591
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
I'm afraid.

592
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,680
Take care.

593
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,680
Take care.

594
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
I didn't let the gang of Jiaojing

595
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,680
to put on a mask.

596
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Recently,

597
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,680
I've been wearing a pair of glasses.

598
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
It's a little bit too much for a place.

599
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
Basically,

600
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
it's all because of the mask.

601
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,680
So, it's not a good idea.

602
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
I'm afraid.

603
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,680
If there's a case,

604
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
people will be killed.

605
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,680
So, you should be careful.

606
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,680
This time,

607
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,680
we should not let the police

608
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,680
put on a mask.

609
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,680
It's too weak to be a civil servant.

610
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Chief,

611
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
if you call me,

612
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,680
I'll be in danger.

613
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
A person like him

614
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,680
is a reasonable person.

615
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,720
That means

616
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,680
this office isn't well behaved.

617
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,680
It's embarrassed

618
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,720
because I have no job

619
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
when I have a hard time working.

620
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,680
I used to work in a rural sector.

621
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,680
At the North Seaァ loudspeaker,

622
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
our workers must be informed.

623
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
We have been caught memory winter any one.

624
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
It all happened by accident.

625
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,680
Chief,

626
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
this birth certificate

627
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
alone,

628
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,680
We have a lot of people in the military.

629
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,680
We are not hungry.

630
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
We can't finish the whole year.

631
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
Are you done?

632
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,680
We have three of them in the hospital.

633
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,680
Is there any weapon?

634
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,680
We have three.

635
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,680
We have a weapon in the police station.

636
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,680
The most important thing is the defense.

637
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,680
The big defense.

638
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
The big public.

639
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,680
The public.

640
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,680
The financials are all in the military.

641
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,680
I have been a doctor for several years.

642
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,680
The construction of the fake police station,

643
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
the selection of the fake police station,

644
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
the power and the scope.

645
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
I know that I am not a doctor.

646
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
But this is not

647
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
the excuse that we have to do our job.

648
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
Captain,

649
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
I have a request.

650
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,680
You also know that I am a criminal.

651
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,680
I can't prove my innocence to the robbers.

652
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
Next time,

653
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,680
can you give us a joint punishment?

654
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,680
This time, I have been thinking.

655
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
The two of us

656
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
are always in the same group.

657
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
But this time,

658
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
I want to interrogate you.

659
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,680
Okay.

660
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
There is a death.

661
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
I want to ask you

662
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
to cooperate with us

663
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
to select the job.

664
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,680
The group of reporters

665
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,680
of the East China Sea

666
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
are monitoring the first page.

667
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
The first page is in the hard zone.

668
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,680
The report is not in the first page.

669
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,680
Our staff

670
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,680
is on duty.

671
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,400
Let's hear them lengths

672
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
and lengths.

673
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Please.

674
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
According to our friends,

675
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
we are responsible for

676
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,400
inbox the Post Central Service pride process

677
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,680
and call the police.

678
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Go to the base,

679
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,680
search but not the found evidence.

680
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,680
What's wrong?

681
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,680
Is it a coincidence?

682
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,680
Dad, are you scared?

683
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,680
I'm scared that you're here.

684
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,680
Are you two together?

685
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,680
No, it's me.

686
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,680
I'm here to call you in advance.

687
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,680
Aren't we afraid that you'll be disturbed?

688
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,680
It's just a few hours.

689
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
I'll be resting.

690
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
I'll be the vice-president.

691
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
Come in.

692
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
You're here.

693
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,680
Don't change your shoes.

694
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,680
Don't change.

695
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
Take so many things.

696
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,680
Come.

697
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,680
Sit.

698
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,680
Feng Kuan.

699
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,680
What are you planning to do when you come back?

700
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
I'm going to marry you.

701
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,680
You're saying that you're going back?

702
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
Yes.

703
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
I'm going to marry you.

704
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,680
I'm going to marry you.

705
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,680
I'm going to marry you.

706
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
You're going back?

707
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,680
There are some things that should be passed.

708
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,680
Let it pass.

709
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,680
You've put yourself in the game these years.

710
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
You can't come back.

711
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,680
You know what you're thinking.

712
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,680
If I didn't call you back that night,

713
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,680
I wouldn't have caught my brother.

714
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,680
It's not your fault.

715
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,680
Let it go.

716
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,680
Let it go.

717
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,520
I'm back.

718
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,680
For your hard work,

719
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,680
you will have to do something to vaak me.

720
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,680
Now you're going back.

721
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,680
Your boss is watching you all this time.

722
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,680
Go back.

723
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,680
No to you.

724
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,240
What's your work notebook for?

725
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,120
I want to go to the tea shop.

726
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,720
It's not changing at all.

727
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,240
Can there be a change?

728
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,880
I can't change.

729
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,680
Why not?

730
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,800
It's faster to walk.

731
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,760
Zizhou.

732
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,640
The house is back.

733
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,760
Let's go to the tea shop.

734
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,000
This time, we'll go to the tea shop.

735
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,400
Let's go.

736
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,080
Let's go.

737
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,040
What's the schedule?

738
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,800
Some people have no idea.

739
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,760
Don't bother me.

740
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,000
I'll wipe my butt.

741
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,960
So from now on,

742
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,160
everything will be my job.

743
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,840
But it's still the old way.

744
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,080
I haven't changed at all these years.

745
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,880
Who is that?

746
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,200
One person is running around.

747
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,880
The whole team is running around.

748
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,400
One person is running around.

749
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,320
What do you mean?

750
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,520
You asked me?

751
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,080
You don't forget me?

752
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,000
You're so mean.

753
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,080
I'm not bad.

754
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,480
Zizhou, stop it.

755
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,200
This time, we'll go to the tea shop.

756
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,520
Everything is very good.

757
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,680
Mr. Lu.

758
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,720
Hello.

759
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,360
Xiao Bai, you're back.

760
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,240
Mr. Jiang told me

761
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,360
that you came here.

762
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,680
Can you bring me one?

763
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,560
We're not here to play.

764
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,680
We're here to work.

765
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,240
I know.

766
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,920
The city of the shadow, the forest of the man.

767
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,120
I've done all the homework.

768
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,920
I've seen all the maps.

769
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,840
Look.

770
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,960
Xiao Bai, your 11th semester is over.

771
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,400
Now it's my private life.

772
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,160
I understand.

773
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,160
But I really want to be with you.

774
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,040
I've liked Chinese culture since I was a kid.

775
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,920
I've decided to work with you

776
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,640
and become a better person.

777
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,920
I want to be a part of this business.

778
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,280
Can you give me a chance?

779
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,080
Sure.

780
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,160
No problem.

781
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,560
Really?

782
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,080
Thank you.

783
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,520
You're welcome.

784
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:33,960
Come on.

785
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,800
Call me Xiao Bai.

786
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,320
Fang Kun.

787
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,960
Okay, Brother Kong.

788
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:37,800
Xiao Fang.

789
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,720
Hello.

790
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,880
You're here.

791
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,080
Hello.

792
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,480
Hello.

793
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,240
There are a few people here.

794
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,000
Is this the city that needs to be reorganized?

795
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,640
How much money should we talk about?

796
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:49,960
This...

797
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,480
Come on.

798
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,320
Come in.

799
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:53,480
Come on.

800
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:53,960
Let's go.

801
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,400
What's wrong?

802
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,720
Do you usually hate the police?

803
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,480
At this time,

804
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,320
you can't even think of coming here.

805
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,800
What's wrong?

806
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,880
Fang Kun.

807
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,120
You think I'm more than ten years old?

808
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,040
What's wrong?

809
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,520
You're still...

810
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,520
You...

811
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,200
You're making a family.

812
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,880
Master.

813
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,440
Master.

814
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:19,640
Dad.

815
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,000
Master.

816
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,400
Hurry up and check the first floor of the police station.

817
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,560
There's something here.

818
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,160
What's that?

819
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,120
I don't know.

820
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,560
Go and check.

821
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,560
What floor is that?

822
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,600
There are many people hiding in the middle of the city.

823
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,480
They're all sleeping.

824
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,600
They're sleeping to make it easier to sleep.

825
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,160
What's that on the floor?

826
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,720
I don't know.

827
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,480
I just asked the plan.

828
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,640
I don't know.

829
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,080
I think it's something new.

830
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,680
New?

831
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,560
Yes.

832
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,480
What's that?

833
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,160
What shrubs!

834
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,400
Good to find something here.

835
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,000
What is this?

836
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
Is this a new size?

837
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,880
Let's see.

838
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,600
Let's go.

839
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:19,800
OK.

840
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,640
Let's continue.

841
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,840
Wait a minute.

842
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,000
Hold on.

843
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,440
Why does it look like a nuclear heater?

844
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,000
Why is there a nuclear heater here?

845
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,400
What nuclear heater?

846
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,600
Let's see.

847
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,800
Hold on.

848
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,680
Hold on.

849
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,400
Come on.

850
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,360
Guo, take a picture with your phone

851
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,040
and show it to Zhang Suo.

852
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,480
Be careful.

853
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,200
One more.

854
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,080
I saw his sign.

855
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
Give me the one with the name of the unit.

856
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Did you bring it?

857
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
Yes.

858
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,080
I'll give you the notebook.

859
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,080
Xiao Bai,

860
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,080
didn't you work secretly?

861
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Let me ask you.

862
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,080
When was the nuclear heater in the village?

863
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,080
It was in the water.

864
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,080
It was only 5 kilometers away.

865
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,080
Is there a nuclear heater in the water?

866
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,080
I don't think so.

867
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
OK.

868
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
Let me tell you.

869
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,080
This is a reference to the nuclear heater.

870
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,080
We have nuclear heater in the water.

871
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,080
We have nuclear heater in the water.

872
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,080
It's common.

873
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
Remember?

874
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
OK.

875
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,080
Master,

876
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
will there be a storm?

877
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,080
Yes.

878
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,080
We've been studying for two days.

879
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,080
Let's stop the work.

880
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
No.

881
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,080
The south village is in a bad situation.

882
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,080
We can't afford to be in the house.

883
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,080
I have a lot of money.

884
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,080
I can use it to clean the house.

885
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,080
I can use it for anything.

886
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
I can clean the house.

887
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,080
No.

888
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,080
No.

889
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,080
The land is damaged.

890
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,080
It's a big problem.

891
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,080
No.

892
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
OK.

893
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,080
Xia Yitian,

894
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,080
take care of it.

895
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,080
OK.

896
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
I can't afford to clean it.

897
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,080
OK.

898
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,080
You can take care of it.

899
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,080
Yes.

900
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:27,080
The house is in a bad situation.

901
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,080
The house is damaged.

902
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
It's beautiful.

903
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
You can't do it in the house.

904
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
The house is in a bad situation.

905
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,080
I'll give you a ladder.

906
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
Put the fake one on it.

907
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
I'll give you a fake one.

908
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,080
The house is different.

909
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,080
It's a hand-made one.

910
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,080
The auction will be held.

911
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,080
The auction will be held all over the world.

912
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
It's a big deal.

913
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,080
You can see it.

914
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
The owner of the house.

915
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
OK.

916
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Let's sit down.

917
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,080
Let's sit down.

918
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
Sit down.

919
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
Right?

920
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
Right?

921
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
Mr. Zhao.

922
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
You're here.

923
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,080
I'll wait for the deadline.

924
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,080
OK.

925
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,080
This time...

926
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

927
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,080
good evening.

928
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
It's all in.

929
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,080
The first item of the auction today,

930
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,080
is the gold-plated flower

931
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,080
from the Qing Dynasty.

932
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,080
It's a beautiful flower.

933
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
It's a white-haired one.

934
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080

942
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Do you have any idea?

943
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,080
