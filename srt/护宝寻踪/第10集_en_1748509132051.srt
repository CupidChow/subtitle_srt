Episode 1

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,760
Brother, look.

19
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,760
Hello, I'm your son.

20
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,760
What's wrong?

21
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,760
I'm broken.

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,760
Listen, Mo Tian.

23
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,760
You should have known that I bought the Song慈i.

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
You bought it?

25
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,760
You sold it?

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,760
Didn't you say it was a wooden stick?

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,760
You're a scoundrel.

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,760
I bought it from the wood.

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
You know it's a wooden stick.

30
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,760
It's not a wooden stick.

31
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,760
But it doesn't mean it's useless.

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,760
Have you ever played the game?

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,760
Do you know that there is a Song慈i in the wood?

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,760
You taught the Qing and Northern Dariang

35
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,760
to the teachers.

36
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,760
They didn't know that I could play the game.

37
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,760
You can't tell.

38
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,760
I've seen a few real ones.

39
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,760
But they have a fairy.

40
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,760
Have you ever sold a house?

41
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,760
It's a dead end.

42
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,760
I don't know.

43
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Let me see the joke.

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,760
What's wrong?

45
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,760
You're standing here.

46
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,760
What do you think?

47
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,760
It's a bad move.

48
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,760
I'm not good at it.

49
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,760
Here.

50
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,760
I've seen a lot of pictures.

51
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,760
What?

52
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,760
A lot of pictures?

53
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,760
It's impossible.

54
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,760
You can't eat anything.

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,760
You can't buy pictures.

56
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,760
You can't buy it.

57
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,760
It's a wooden stick.

58
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,760
It's a bad move.

59
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,760
I've seen a lot of pictures.

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Is my move still there?

61
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Of course.

62
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,760
I've left it for you.

63
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,760
You can give me the address.

64
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,760
I'll go over there.

65
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,760
My posture and angle are wrong.

66
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,760
It's internal work.

67
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,760
It's not a matter of one or two days.

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Why?

69
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Because you're happy.

70
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,760
I'm telling you.

71
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
You should learn your tongue.

72
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,760
You can't use your back.

73
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Mr. Fang, you're thinking about your father.

74
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,760
I really want to learn.

75
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,760
Who knows who?

76
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Mr. Fang.

77
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,760
Miss.

78
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
What's up?

79
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,760
I'm not good at it.

80
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,760
I'm not good at it.

81
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Really?

82
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,760
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,760
I'm not good at it.

84
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,760
I'm not good at it.

85
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,760
I'm not good at it.

86
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,760
I'm not good at it.

87
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
I'm not good at it.

88
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
You're not good at it.

89
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,760
You're not good at it.

90
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,760
You'll get a lot of money.

91
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,760
What money?

92
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
It's not a lot of money.

93
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,760
You're from another country.

94
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,760
And you're still living here.

95
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Please let me go.

96
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
I don't know.

97
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,760
This is a vocational school.

98
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,760
It first appeared in West Han.

99
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,760
And the word is very late.

100
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
If it's a vocational school,

101
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,760
it's not a lot of money.

102
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,320
Thank you for lying.

103
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,920
I can't stop you.

104
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,200
I can't stop you.

105
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,320
Xiaofang, you can stop us.

106
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,760
I won't force you to do this.

107
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,600
OK.

108
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,240
Shizhi.

109
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,400
Xiaoxiao.

110
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,680
I'll take the stone.

111
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,040
Is it Tangtai's red-eyelid?

112
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,240
There's one more thing.

113
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,920
Don't tell others.

114
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,400
I want He Luan Shi.

115
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,200
If you come to me,

116
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,440
I'll be a poor bastard.

117
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,320
Right?

118
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,880
I'll beat you to death.

119
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,400
I'll do it.

120
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,680
Mr. Fang, you have so much money.

121
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,720
Why do you take this?

122
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,920
I've studied a lot.

123
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,800
No.

124
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,160
I'm from Shandong.

125
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,360
I'm a teacher in history.

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,960
I read some books.

127
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,360
I'm from the 10th century.

128
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,040
I'm a common person in Qi Fan.

129
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,680
You're Jiang Xiao Bai?

130
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,560
Yes.

131
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,760
You told me that

132
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,320
there are both the origin and the origin of the incense.

133
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,400
You're floating on the ground.

134
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,120
You won't break it.

135
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,960
So you're floating on the ground

136
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,760
for Mr. Luo?

137
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,760
No.

138
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,120
I...

139
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,680
We're old friends.

140
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,960
We don't talk much.

141
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,320
What?

142
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,080
Do you like Mr. Luo?

143
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,720
Yes.

144
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,400
I like him.

145
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,960
You're weird.

146
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Don't you like him?

147
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,640
I...

148
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,640
Mr. Fang.

149
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,680
Mr. Luo.

150
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,440
Why are you here?

151
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
I'm here to accompany him.

152
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,600
What's wrong with you?

153
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Is there anything to be afraid of?

154
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,360
I'm digging a little bit.

155
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,280
Take a look.

156
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,680
Be careful.

157
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,160
The outside is the God's grace.

158
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,880
The inside is the ministry's grace.

159
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,480
It should be the Han Dynasty.

160
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,920
I checked online.

161
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,800
I saw that

162
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,680
the stone is lined up like this.

163
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,400
It's called the water.

164
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,360
I've thought about it.

165
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,240
The riverbed of the water

166
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,000
is basically five or six centimeters.

167
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,720
For these,

168
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,880
the average is about 25 centimeters.

169
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,400
I see.

170
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,320
You see?

171
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,560
So the water of Mr. Zhang

172
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,360
is more than 20 centimeters.

173
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,680
Is it also from the Han Dynasty?

174
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,400
It seems that Mr. Zhang

175
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,120
is keeping a secret for us.

176
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,280
He has an answer.

177
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
Chush.

178
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,400
Do you think

179
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,760
we can de allí Chush Outside the City?

180
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,920
Yes.

181
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,160
Let's rush into our houses.

182
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,640
Put the things aside.

183
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,280
Inside the city,

184
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,520
filial piety comes.

185
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,360
I don't want to.

186
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,800
What do you want?

187
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,800
I don't know Guang.

188
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
You don't know how to smash the gold, right?

189
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,840
I know. I know.

190
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,360
Very good.

191
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,240
Guang is a good friend.

192
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,000
No wonder Guang doesn't teach me.

193
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,440
I thought

194
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,880
he has so many treasures.

195
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,640
I am...

196
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,720
Guang is so good at holding things.

197
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,600
Guang is not only good at flying,

198
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,080
but also good at holding things.

199
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
You mean?

200
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Guang doesn't teach me.

201
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,120
I am a master.

202
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,840
Then I will buy some food for you.

203
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,280
Then I will cook for you.

204
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,200
Wanwan.

205
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,240
Come on.

206
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,440
Since you are here, come in and have a look.

207
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,000
I can.

208
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,720
I will let you in.

209
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,440
Thank you.

210
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,000
MIN Cuando

211
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,400
Guan Zhong's view.

212
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,120
Wen Wen.

213
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
I'm not here.

214
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
I didn't care about it.

215
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
I came in.

216
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
I thought it was a thief.

217
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Get out.

218
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
I want you out.

219
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
What are you looking at?

220
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
My mom is blind.

221
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
If you come to the restaurant again,

222
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
you can't leave someone to eat.

223
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
I just bought some food.

224
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
I'll cook for you.

225
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,680
I'll cook.

226
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Okay.

227
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Brother.

228
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
I'm sorry.

229
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
I let you off last time.

230
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
I have a way to get rid of him.

231
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Brother.

232
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
No.

233
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
I'm here alone.

234
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,680
I'm being cheated.

235
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,680
I just got out.

236
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
I'll stay with you in the place next to the starry sky.

237
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Can you give me some more time?

238
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,680
I don't want to.

239
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
I'll see what?

240
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
I'll tell him to be away forever.

241
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
I'm sorry.

242
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
Since you're afraid,

243
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,680
you should think about the consequences.

244
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
He doesn't know that he's been cheated.

245
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
He doesn't know that now.

246
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
He'll never know that you can guarantee him.

247
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
Brother.

248
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Brother.

249
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Brother.

250
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Brother.

251
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
Luo Qian.

252
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,680
I'm here to hear your opinion.

253
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
That's a good idea.

254
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
I'm a little bit nervous.

255
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Brother.

256
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
You're from a different family.

257
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,680
We don't have a lot of money.

258
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
How about 220 yuan?

259
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
That's enough.

260
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
150.

261
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Okay.

262
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
200.

263
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
150.

264
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Brother.

265
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
If you can't help us,

266
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,680
let's end it here.

267
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Boss Mu.

268
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
You're the one who's making this up.

269
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
I'm the one who's making this up.

270
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
I can't help you.

271
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
Er Bei.

272
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
You can't even do anything.

273
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
You're the one who's making this up.

274
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,680
You're the one who's been cheating.

275
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
You're the one who's been cheating.

276
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Xiao.

277
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
You can't do anything.

278
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Boss.

279
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Maybe we'll have more chances to come here.

280
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
For 50 yuan, we'll have to pay the customer.

281
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
We have to pay the long-term.

282
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
The customer cares about the 30,000 yuan.

283
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,680
Here.

284
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
You're welcome.

285
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,680
Let's make a deal.

286
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,680
Let's make a deal with the customer.

287
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,680
I'll pay you.

288
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,680
I'll pay you.

289
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,680
I'll pay you.

290
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
I'll pay you the first year of your childhood.

291
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
The food is good.

292
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
Let's go.

293
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
If you want to eat, come here often.

294
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
I'll make it for you.

295
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
Hello.

296
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
Do you work in the office?

297
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Do you have a job?

298
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
No.

299
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,680
They're so good at it.

300
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
100 yuan.

301
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,680
14, 3.

302
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
I don't have a job.

303
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,680
You're a good girl.

304
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Sige.

305
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,680
You're a good girl.

306
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
You're a good girl.

307
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
You're pregnant.

308
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
You're not in good health.

309
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
You don't have to worry about her.

310
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Do you want to come here?

311
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,680
I'll take care of it.

312
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,680
You're willing to pay me?

313
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
You're willing to pay me?

314
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
I'm not sure.

315
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
I'm a good girl.

316
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
I'll pay you.

317
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,680
I'm willing to pay you.

318
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
Thank you.

319
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
You're a good girl.

320
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
You're a good girl.

321
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
You're a good girl.

322
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
I'll pay you.

323
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Thank you.

324
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,680
Thank you.

325
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Thank you.

326
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Thank you.

327
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Is it too small?

328
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
It's not worth it.

329
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
Xiao Bai.

330
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,680
You've been sleeping so early.

331
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,680
I was already in the bathroom.

332
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,680
I see.

333
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
Is it done?

334
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
Yes.

335
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
Do you want to eat?

336
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
you are quite good at playing,

337
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
I even bought you a new one.

338
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
You are a good person.

339
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
I also think that people are good at playing.

340
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
When they are coming in these days,

341
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
they are diligent and good at learning.

342
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
But,

343
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
compared to you,

344
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
you are a little younger.

345
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
What do you mean?

346
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,680
People are mean.

347
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,680
They are self-sufficient.

348
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
He is six years younger than you.

349
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,680
First, I am not old.

350
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
I am five years older than him.

351
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,680
Second,

352
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
women cannot be younger than them.

353
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
Third,

354
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
I am a good person.

355
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
I am used to it.

356
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
I am used to it.

357
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
Can't you care about it?

358
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,680
You are a murderer.

359
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
Boss,

360
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,680
why are you still awake?

361
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,680
What is it?

362
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
I am a good person.

363
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,680
What about you?

364
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,680
How is Xiao Xue?

365
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,680
What?

366
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,680
She has changed her appetite.

367
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Is that so?

368
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,680
You can take the phone to Xiao Xue.

369
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,680
I will talk to her.

370
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,680
I can't sleep at night.

371
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
Open the mask.

372
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,680
What's wrong?

373
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,680
I didn't ask you.

374
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
My colleague is here.

375
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Okay, I will do it.

376
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,680
I will tell you.

377
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
Have a rest.

378
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,680
Okay.

379
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,680
What's wrong?

380
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,680
I am a little tired.

381
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
I am a little tired.

382
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
I am a little tired.

383
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
I am a little tired.

384
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
I am a little tired.

385
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
You are going back in two days?

386
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,680
No.

387
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,680
I have been waiting for half a month.

388
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,680
I am sorry for being a good person.

389
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,680
I am sorry for being a good person.

390
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,680
I bought you a gift.

391
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
I bought you a gift.

392
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,680
I played?

393
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,680
Where did I play?

394
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,680
I heard your phone call.

395
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
I thought about it.

396
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Why did you turn your back?

397
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
How did Xiao Xue look at you?

398
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Xiao Xue?

399
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
Your wife.

400
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,680
What are you laughing at?

401
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,680
Wang Kun.

402
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,680
You are a father.

403
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Can you be more serious?

404
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,680
You are still laughing.

405
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,680
You are a father.

406
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,680
Don't leave me.

407
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,680
Xiao Xue.

408
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
I have a camel.

409
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
When I left, I saw Xiao Zai.

410
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,680
I saw Xiao Zai.

411
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
I am with Xiao Xue.

412
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,680
I haven't called yet.

413
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
How about he give me a name?

414
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Shen Jingming.

415
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
It's a gift.

416
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
It's a gift.

417
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Are you a father?

418
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
No.

419
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,680
I am a father.

420
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,680
You are a father.

421
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
I am a father.

422
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
It's a boy.

423
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
I'm bored.

424
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,680
I just got a name for you.

425
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,680
It's called Dog-Dog.

426
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
It's hard to hear.

427
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
It's called Luo Wu.

428
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,680
Pig-3 and Dog-4.

429
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
How many pairs?

430
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,680
How about we give them a pair of rings?

431
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
You want to give me a pair of rings,

432
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
but my dog-4 doesn't want to.

433
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
Right?

434
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
Whether they want to or not,

435
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
they don't care.

436
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
They both

437
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,680
bought the Yang-Ling with the police.

438
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
Maybe they already have it.

439
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
When they bought the Yang-Ling,

440
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,680
they might have already died.

441
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
Why do you know

442
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
that they died?

443
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
Every broken object

444
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
is a letter

445
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,680
written by history

446
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
and a secret letter

447
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
to the future.

448
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
Have some.

449
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
Yes.

450
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
I'm not eating. I have to go.

451
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,680
Wait.

452
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
I can't eat.

453
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
I'll get two.

454
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,680
Okay.

455
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,680
I'm going to eat today.

456
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,680
I've found a few villages.

457
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
They don't have any clues.

458
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
I heard that there's a emergency today.

459
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
What if they're going to kill us?

460
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Maybe they can ask for something.

461
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
What are you talking about?

462
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
I'm not a snake.

463
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,680
I'm a stone.

464
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
I'm not a real snake.

465
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
I'm a snake.

466
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
I'm a snake.

467
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
You see,

468
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
you're in the hospital.

469
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
You're not going back to the hospital.

470
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,680
You're here for this stone.

471
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
I heard that you're here.

472
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
I don't know if you're going to kill me.

473
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
I'm going to go.

474
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
You go.

475
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
You go.

476
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
You go.

477
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:28,900

00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,580

00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:45,220

How much is this?

486
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,180
This is 1000 yuan

487
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,180
Can you sell it for 80 yuan?

488
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,180
No, I don't sell it

489
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,180
Boss, do you have such a market?

490
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,180
This is a mess of food

491
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,180
I have never seen it

492
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,180
Have you seen it?

493
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,180
My friend sold it here

494
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,180
What is this?

495
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,180

00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,180
What are you doing?

499
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,180
I'm looking at the road

500
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,180
Boss, I'm looking at the road

501
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,180

504
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,180
The weather is so cold

505
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,180
We are here

506
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,180

I'm not a delivery man

545
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,180
I've been picking the leaves

00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,180
I've been picking them

547
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,180
I've been picking them

548
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,180

It's 50,000 yuan, right?

574
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,180
50,000 yuan.

575
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,180
Thank you.

576
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
50,000 yuan.

577
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,180
You're a big deal.

578
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,180
No way.

579
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
I've said it before.

580
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
The question of the fire is the brand.

581
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,180
The size represents one point.

582
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,180
The rest of the fingers represent two points.

583
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
The weight is the head.

584
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,180
The lightness is the tail.

585
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,180
The one push is the tail.

586
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,180
That's it.

587
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,180
50,000 yuan.

588
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,180
Don't say anything else.

589
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,180
It's a little bit more than that.

590
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,180
Wait a minute.

591
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,180
I think we should stop here.

592
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,180
Give me the money.

593
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,180
Uncle.

594
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,180
This is mine.

595
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,180
I'll take it.

596
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,180
There's something else.

597
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,180
There's a bowl of milk in the fire.

598
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,180
It's not easy to make money.

599
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,180
Don't be anxious.

600
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,180
Okay?

601
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,180
Stop here.

602
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,180
Sit.

603
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,180
I'm so nervous.

604
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,180
No, I'll take it.

605
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,180
Then you can take it back.

606
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,180
I'll take it.

607
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,180
Take it back.

608
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,180
Brother, don't forget it.

609
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,180
I don't know how to take it.

610
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,180
I don't have money.

611
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,180
I'll take it.

612
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,180
You're not taking the table.

613
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,180
How can you take money?

614
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,180
Okay.

615
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,180
If you have money,

616
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,180
you can't even buy a cool car.

617
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,180
You can't even go to the house.

618
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,180
I'm hungry.

619
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,180
I'll give you five yuan.

620
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,180
Give me some money.

621
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,180
Give me money to take the money.

622
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,180
You're a good person.

623
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,180
You can earn a lot by your hands.

624
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,180
It's been three years.

625
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
I'm not hungry.

626
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,180
But you don't know.

627
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,180
Forget it.

628
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,180
Take it.

629
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,180
What do you mean?

630
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,180
Take it.

631
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,180
I'll sell some food for the family.

632
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,180
You're so polite.

633
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,180
Just go and get it.

634
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,180
They're all angry.

635
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,180
You're so annoying.

636
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,180
You're so popular.

637
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,180
We used to play the game.

638
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,180
I played the game.

639
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,180
After that,

640
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,180
the people on the table

641
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,180
didn't even care.

642
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,180
I had no choice.

643
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,180
I just looked at it.

644
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,180
After a while,

645
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,180
I found out that guy was playing the game.

646
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,180
I found out that guy was playing the game.

647
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,180
The people on the table

648
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,180
didn't even care about the game.

649
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,180
You're still playing the game.

650
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,180
You haven't even seen it for half a day.

651
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,180
You just want to earn money.

652
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,180
What can you see?

653
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,180
Right.

654
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,180
Brother, four cars.

655
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,180
You have to pay ten dollars.

656
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,180
We don't have enough money.

657
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,180
We don't have enough money.

658
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,180
I'll go.

659
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,180
You're so good.

660
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,180
You're so good.

661
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,180
You're so good.

662
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,180
I'm so good.

663
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,180
I'm looking at you.

664
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,180
I'm looking at you.

665
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,180
I'm looking at you.

666
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,180
What are you doing?

667
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,180
Taiping,

668
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,180
you're back.

669
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,180
Uncle Sa,

670
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,180
have a good day.

671
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,180
I know.

672
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,180
I'm going to say good-bye to you.

673
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,180
Uncle Sa,

674
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,180
I'm so happy to see you.

675
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,180
You're not going to die.

676
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,180
I'll cut your hair.

677
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,180
I'm back.

678
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,180
I'm a good person.

679
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,180
Good person?

680
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,180
I'm a good person.

681
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,180
I'll cut your hair.

682
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,180
I'm not going to die.

683
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,180
I'm done with the business.

684
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,180
You said

685
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,180
you can't do it.

686
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,180
I can't do it.

687
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,180
I'm not done with the business.

688
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,180
Okay, okay.

689
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,180
I won't say it.

690
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,180
Go ahead.

691
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,180
This is your sister-in-law.

692
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,180
Hello, sister-in-law.

693
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,180
Hello, hello.

694
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,180
I'm sorry to bother you.

695
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,180
I'm sorry.

696
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,180
I'm sorry.

697
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,180
Come on.

698
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,180
Sit down.

699
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,180
I'm so happy.

700
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,180
Sister-in-law,

701
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,180
let me tell you something.

702
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,180
When your brother goes out,

703
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,180
he'll make a person

704
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,180
and you'll be happy.

705
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,180
You'll have a brother with you.

706
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,180
Okay.

707
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,180
Here,

708
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,180
have some water.

709
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,180
Thank you, sister-in-law.

710
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,180
You're welcome.

711
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,180
I'm busy.

712
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,180
Sit down.

713
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,180
You've been in your studies for two years.

714
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,180
Don't worry, sister-in-law.

715
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,180
I can do everything in my life.

716
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,180
I have two sisters.

717
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,180
I'm a big brother.

718
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,180
I'll take you to the province.

719
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,180
Okay.

720
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,180
I'll take you to the south.

721
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,180
Don't you know?

722
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,180
It's not suitable for the government.

723
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,180
You love to eat sourdough.

724
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,180
It must be a south-eastern province.

725
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,180
He wants a south-eastern province.

726
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,180
What?

727
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,180
I'm hungry.

728
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,180
We're not eating at home today.

729
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,180
I'm not ready to cook.

730
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,180
No need.

731
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,180
Brother-in-law,

732
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,180
let's go to eat instant noodles today.

733
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,180
We're not eating at home.

734
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,180
No need.

735
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,180
No need.

736
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,180
I don't dare to go out.

737
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,180
I'll go out to sell you a fish.

738
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,180
You'll have to eat more.

739
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,180
You're so funny.

740
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,180
Okay, I'll go now.

741
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,180
Okay.

742
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,180
Give me some money.

743
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,180
Yes, take it.

744
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,180
No need.

745
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,180
I have money.

746
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,180
You're so mean.

747
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,180
I'll sell it to you.

748
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,180
Okay.

749
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,180
Okay.

750
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,180
Go ahead.

751
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,180
Okay.

752
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,180
Brother-in-law,

753
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,180
where did you find the stone?

754
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,180
Where did you find it?

755
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,180
In the peasant's house.

756
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,180
From the point of view,

757
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,180
it looks like the police.

758
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,180
But I don't know where it's from.

759
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,180
What are you talking about?

760
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,180
I'm looking for it.

761
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,180
Brother-in-law,

762
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,180
I'm busy.

763
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,180
Brother-in-law,

764
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,180
I'm looking for it.

765
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,180
What do you think?

766
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,180
I'm looking for it.

767
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,180
Let's go.

768
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,180
What's the matter?

769
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,180
I've been looking for it for ten years.

770
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,180
What else?

771
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,180
I'm looking for it.

772
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,180
I'm looking for it.

773
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,180
Okay,

774
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,180
I'll go now.

775
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,180
Okay.

776
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,180
Okay.

777
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,180
Okay.

778
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,180
I'm a man.

779
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,180
I'm a man.

780
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,180
Come here.

781
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,180
I'm smarter than you.

782
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,180
I want it.

783
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,180
If I didn't catch a line,

784
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,180
you would have been dead.

785
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,180
Brother-in-law,

786
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,180
why are you so stubborn?

787
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,180
You're all the stone you want.

788
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,180
Right?

789
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,180
Come on.

790
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,180
According to our search,

791
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,180
the three groups of the front-line are in the village.

792
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,180
Be careful with this.

793
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,180
Did you get the black-haired one?

794
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,180
You can do it.

795
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,180
Sure.

796
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,180
But when I checked it,

797
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,180
I said that the black-haired ones

798
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,180
were in the town.

799
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,180
Someone said that he was a foreign customer.

800
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,180
Someone said that he was a high-ranking person.

801
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,180
What do you think?

802
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,180
I don't know.

803
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,180
I don't dare to say anything.

804
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,180
I didn't say it clearly.

805
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,180
I didn't say it clearly to the front-line.

806
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,180
What are you laughing at?

807
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,180
I laugh at someone who was bold and

808
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,180
had a thick face.

809
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,180
I thought that if he had a big discovery,

810
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,180
he would be able to do a lot of things in the village.

811
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,180
Sounds like Kun.

812
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,180
That means he can do this.

813
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,180
But that was him.

814
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,180
He has changed now.

815
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,180
Which one was better,

816
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,180
the one that he was with now?

817
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,180
I think each one is better.

818
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,180
He's changing.

819
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,180
I'm changing too.

820
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,180
Shen's eyes are also changing.

821
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,180
What are you doing?

822
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,180
What are you doing?

823
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,180
Don't move.

824
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,180
Don't move.

825
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,180
What are you doing?

826
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,180
What are you doing?

827
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,180
What are you doing?

828
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,180
I'm a customer.

829
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,180
What are you doing?

830
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,180
Look.

831
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,180
This is our customer service equipment.

832
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,180
Which one will bring these to the city?

833
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,180
The city is in the city.

834
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,180
You can't even get on the street.

835
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,180
I don't want to get in the street.

836
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,180
Get up.

837
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,180
Don't move.

838
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,180
I'm the researcher Luo Qing.

839
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,180
Can you call me?

840
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,180
Come on.

841
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,180
Come on.

842
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,180
Come on.

843
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,180
Excuse me.

844
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,180
Come on.

845
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,180
Sit down.

846
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,180
Okay.

847
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,180
Thank you.

848
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,180
Let's have some water.

849
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,180
Today,

850
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,180
this lion is a big misunderstanding.

851
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,180
I'm sorry.

852
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,180
This lion is a good dog.

853
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,180
It's a good beast.

854
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,180
It's okay.

855
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,180
We've known each other for years.

856
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,180
He's been living here.

857
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,180
And that dog is called Heizui.

858
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,180
He's very sensitive.

859
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,180
This beast is a good dog.

860
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,180
He's a good dog.

861
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,180
Moreover,

862
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,180
when Sh Row is busy with romance,

863
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,180
this lion is very sensitive.

864
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,180
he's pretend to be a leader.

865
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,180
This sl citizens Racing has always been you.

866
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:58,180
I might burn the整

867
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,540
My wiferous wife, quickly

868
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,820
Right now

869
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,820
Chief Wu, this person is a good teacher.

870
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,820
Yes, Professor Zan, he is a good friend.

871
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,820
Our teacher taught me, he is my teacher.

872
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,820
Sit down, sit down.

873
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,820
Let me show you.

874
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,820
What a coincidence.

875
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,820
Let me tell you.

876
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,820
This, Professor Zan is a good friend.

877
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,820
When I remember their reliable team,

878
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,820
when they came to the park,

879
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,820
I found a East and West valley.

880
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,820
I was sweating, I saw four things.

881
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,820
I see.

882
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,820
You are a good teacher.

883
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,820
Our teacher taught us this.

884
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,820
I remember, he was a good teacher.

885
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,820
He was a good teacher.

886
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,820
He was a good teacher.

887
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,820
Because of him,

888
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,820
he is a reliable person.

889
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,820
He is a good friend.

890
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,820
He is a good friend.

891
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,820
I think he is a good friend.

892
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,820
He is a good friend.

893
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,820
Yes, I have a picture here.

894
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,820
I will show you.

895
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,820
Here, here.

896
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,820
Come on.

897
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,820
I didn't expect to see a young teacher like this.

898
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,820
Eat.

899
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,820
Come on, have a look.

900
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,820
Look.

901
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,820
This is my bone marrow.

902
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,820
These are my bone marrow.

903
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,820
This is their ancestor's bone marrow.

904
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,820
Wait a minute.

905
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,820
Teacher, look at this.

906
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,820
It looks like the manager.

907
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,820
What do you mean?

908
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,820
Sir, I have something urgent.

909
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,820
I have to go now.

910
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,820
I am not late for dinner.

911
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,820
I will have Xiao Bai drink with you.

912
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,820
It's too late.

913
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,820
It's okay.

914
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,820
It's really urgent.

915
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,820
Don't worry.

916
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,820
Fang Kun,

917
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,820
I know our teacher.

918
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,820
Why are you interested in the hot water?

919
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,820
Aunt,

920
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,660
If you wanna go together

921
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,820
after this season will be over,

922
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,820
Don't get mad.

923
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,760
First, Lagranny Shannel

924
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,720
First,ла N2

925
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,360
Now let's raise the high-speed propulsion system

926
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,620
Should we meinen to go even higher?

927
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,320
If you will.

928
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,160
Even Group S1,

929
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,780
isn'tadora better

930
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,140
than Voxer

931
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,620
But what about Group S1?

932
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,340
Why don't we try some those

933
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,220
Guards and forces left

934
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,220
Let's go.

935
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,220
Where are we going?

936
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,220
I know where the river pond is coming from.

937
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:19,220
You mean the river pond is coming from here?

938
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,220
How did you know?

939
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,220
Are you still in love?

940
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,220
I was so upset because of the stone.

941
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,220
I couldn't sleep at night.

942
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,220
I was the only one who slept.

943
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,220
Then, Mr. Zan came to get me a dream.

944
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,220
He told me that he had a dream last night.

945
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,220
He said,

946
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,220
Fang, go to your Shenzi's house and look around.

947
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,220
You need to find a wall.

948
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,220
He said that the river pond is inside the wall.

949
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,220
I came here with you this morning.

950
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,220
You're not going to get up.

951
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,220
What?

952
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,220
The stone is inside the wall.

953
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,220
Then, Mr. Zan,

954
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,220
I'll leave it to you.

955
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,220
It's still inside the wall.

956
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,220
No?

957
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,220
Why?

958
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,220
I'll go find it for you.

959
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,220
If you don't,

960
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,220
I'll make the stone to be crushed.

961
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:28,220
The stone was crushed in the ground.

962
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,220
I came back and dug the river pond.

963
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,220
I asked you to come here.

964
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,220
You were still living here.

965
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,220
You still remember?

966
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,220
One day, I saw this stone in Professor Zan's house.

967
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,220
He asked me where I saw it.

968
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,220
I remember it was at the corner of the cave.

969
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,220
Which cave?

970
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,220
The one that I laughed at.

971
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,220
The cave in the black robe?

972
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,220
Yes.

973
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:55,220
Professor Zan had to sell the stone to me.

974
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,220
Then, Professor Zan was in the private house.

975
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,220
He had to throw the stone into the house.

976
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,220
He had to kill someone.

977
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,220
Then, he was forced to go to the wall.

978
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,220
I threw the stone into the wall.

979
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,220
I had stopped the army.

980
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,220
I was so angry.

981
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,220
I asked my mother to help me.

982
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,220
She had to do it.

983
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,220
She had to do it.

984
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,220
She had to do it.

985
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:25,220
I didn't know you were so passionate.

986
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,220
Did you give me the chance?

987
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,220
I wanted to give it to you.

988
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,220
But you were so stubborn.

989
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,220
Then, give me the chance.

990
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:46,220
The river pond was in the back of the cave.

991
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,220
And the black robe was in the back of the cave.

992
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:54,220
Did you find any connection between the two?

993
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,220
What do you think?

994
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,220
I think the black robe was getting more and more confused.

995
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:05,220
I have to figure out what the bottom is.

996
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,220
The sky is on the top.

997
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,220
The moon is under the bridge.

998
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,220
The person is standing here.

999
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:31,220
The one and only.

1000
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,220
The black robe was burning.

1001
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,220
The warm and hot ring.

1002
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,220
Under the night, the water was boiling.

1003
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,220
The song of the sky.

1004
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,220
I heard it.

1005
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,220
I went through the night.

1006
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:57,220
The heart is like the sky.

1007
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:01,220
The heart is like the sky.

1008
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:05,220
The moon is under the bridge.

1009
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,220
The warm and hot ring.

1010
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,220
Under the night, the moon is under the bridge.

1011
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,220
The person is standing here.

1012
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,220
The moon is under the bridge.

1013
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,220
The moon is under the bridge.

1014
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,220
The heart is like the sky.

1015
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,220
The pain is gone.

1016
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,220
The cold water was in the cave.

1017
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:52,220
The life is not worth living.

1018
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,220
The wind is blowing.

1019
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:01,220
I went through the night.

1020
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:05,220
The heart is like the sky.

1021
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,220
The moon is under the bridge.

1022
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,220
The moon is under the bridge.

1023
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:20,220
The world is a thousand years.

1024
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:28,220
Who will not follow the moon?

1025
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,220
Long and long.
