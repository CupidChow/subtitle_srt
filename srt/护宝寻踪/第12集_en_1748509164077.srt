1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
Maybe the fox has a aura of mystery.

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,080
Ah…

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,680
We eventually found a

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,200
new Ruins of which we once acquired.

5
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,760
ords of war

6
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,040
Episode 11

7
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,600
It's been 50,000 years.

8
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,400
We finally got to the castle.

9
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,540
It took 10 days for us to build this house,

10
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,780
equivalent to 5 million ltcommerce.

11
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,340
If you can make a new house

12
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,540
out of this 10 days,

13
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,020
you can emphasise the Umiliter Point.

14
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,380
We will have to FINALY pay it.

15
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,200
The problem is

16
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,320
I taken my terms.

17
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,540
You don't have to take a step back.

18
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,480
No need to.

19
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,760
There is a saying again,

20
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,960
if it can be helped.

21
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,620
I have menTech instead of money.

22
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,520
Then,

23
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,260
go back in the Ai-Like accident

24
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,060
and take your judge and Пока take care of his body.

25
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,520
But then

26
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,480
can the men get a Repeat S Computer or not?

27
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Then you'll have to do something.

28
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Brother.

29
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Brother, it's not worth it.

30
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
We can't go back to our mother's house.

31
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
We can't go back to our mother's house.

32
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Brother, you two are so coward.

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
You two are so quiet.

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
We are three people now.

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
We have to be independent.

36
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,200
No one can avoid the political audience.

37
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
He's done nothing.

38
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,200
That means we are at least worth the money.

39
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Plus, we don't have any money to buy a car.

40
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Well, the emperor's daughter is not a good daughter.

41
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,200
We are not going to sell the house to the poor.

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
We are going to sell it to the poor.

43
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Brother.

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Brother,

45
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,200
do you want to buy a car?

46
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
I'm so happy.

47
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,200
I want to buy this car.

48
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
I don't want to say that it's a family.

49
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
You are so stupid.

50
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
You are so stupid.

51
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
You are a man.

52
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
You are so stupid.

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
I don't think you can be a good daughter.

54
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Yes.

55
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Brother, we usually sell the house to the poor.

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,200
If we sell the house to the poor,

57
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,200
we can't afford to sell the house to the poor.

58
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
What?

59
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,200
We can't afford to sell the house to the poor.

60
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
We can't afford to sell the house to the poor.

61
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,200
We can't afford to sell the house to the poor.

62
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
I don't understand.

63
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Why did you have to go through all this?

64
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
You are so stupid.

65
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
You are so stupid.

66
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
You are so stupid.

67
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Brother,

68
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
you have been a man for so many years.

69
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Why did you come out of the house?

70
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,200
I was so stupid that I came out of the house.

71
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
I was so stupid.

72
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
I know what you are thinking.

73
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Do you have the money to buy the house to the poor?

74
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Yes.

75
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
If you have the money to buy the house,

76
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
you need to pay for the house,

77
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
and you need to pay for the electricity.

78
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,200
It's very difficult to get the money.

79
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,200
You don't know how to buy the house.

80
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
You are so stupid.

81
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
You will sell the house to the poor.

82
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
You can't afford to sell the house to the poor.

83
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
We can't afford to sell the house to the poor.

84
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
I have to try to sell it to the poor.

85
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,200
The family in Qin is so weak.

86
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,840
It's useless to look down on the land,

87
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,440
and not to get the land.

88
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,360
Even if they sell it,

89
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,880
where will we get the 5 million?

90
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,960
Who doesn't know how to read the blanks?

91
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,640
It's not like that when it's time.

92
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Brother, you think it's cool,

93
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,920
but it's not moving.

94
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,760
If they sell the 5 million,

95
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,680
what else can they sell it to?

96
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,840
Xiao Guang,

97
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,840
maybe you don't know the Xingzhao Lake,

98
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,800
but you know the people.

99
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,320
Do you think

100
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
this life is worth 5 million?

101
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,960
If you think it's worth 5 million,

102
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,040
then it's not worth it.

103
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,360
I'm right.

104
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,160
Xingzhao Lake is also like that.

105
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,440
Xingzhao Lake is not moving.

106
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,360
If Mr. Hong gives it to us,

107
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,760
we'll just run away from the land.

108
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
You're right.

109
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,040
Xingzhao Lake is not moving.

110
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,760
It's been so many years since it was broken.

111
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,600
I guess even 5 million has never seen it.

112
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,160
It's like a house of evil.

113
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,400
The ancient books have all been scattered all over the world.

114
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,560
I can't tell you that

115
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
I can't tell you that

116
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,360
I'm in a hurry to find the seller.

117
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,240
This man will be scattered to the sea soon.

118
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,040
The Giza team is in the top of the Songzi.

119
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,480
They'll be in the cave in a few days.

120
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,600
Once the Giza team is in the top,

121
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,760
they'll be scattered in the top.

122
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
No one will dare to guard.

123
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,000
Besides the Jiang family,

124
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,760
is there any other way?

125
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,200
No one dares to guard.

126
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
We're afraid that they won't guard either.

127
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,760
Others will guard others.

128
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,160
Zhao Youlin will guard Zhao Youlin.

129
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
Others won't guard.

130
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,960
He won't guard Zhao Youlin.

131
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,960
It's a bit difficult to find.

132
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,160
But I think it's a bit risky.

133
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
What if

134
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,160
someone comes in after the goods are delivered?

135
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,760
So we have to make a plan.

136
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,560
Xiaobao.

137
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,040
You need to contact the brother.

138
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
The backup is in the area.

139
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
We're preparing to fight in a few days.

140
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,760
Fight?

141
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,160
If we take care of the fight,

142
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,560
we'll fight.

143
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,160
He won't be able to tell us.

144
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Right, right.

145
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
He won't give in.

146
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,360
But someone will.

147
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,760
Song Lan.

148
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Brother-in-law is here.

149
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,160
All three of them are helping me.

150
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,760
I'm not afraid that you'll be in trouble.

151
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,960
Brother-in-law, you're a good man.

152
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
You're not even a good man.

153
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,760
I must have misunderstood you

154
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,960
before I left.

155
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,360
Is there a time when you're thinking?

156
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,760
I think I'll think about it.

157
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,960
Until you lose a lot of money,

158
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
it's not easy to be with your sister.

159
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,560
No.

160
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,360
There's a thing about earning money.

161
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,760
I want to work with you.

162
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
I'll give you some money.

163
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,760
The sun is coming out from the west.

164
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,560
You can feel the moon in the sky.

165
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
You can't feel it.

166
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,960
You must protect it.

167
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,760
Take care.

168
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,960
Take care of it.

169
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,960
Come on.

170
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,760
Let's go.

171
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,560
Come on.

172
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,360
Be careful.

173
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
The house is like a yard.

174
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,560
If you want to make a lot of money,

175
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,360
I'm going to have to keep the chip.

176
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,160
Let me see.

177
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,960
Okay.

178
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,160
I cherish the work flows of money.

179
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,560
Besides, I was running away.

180
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,960
Don't be too choking.

181
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
That's enough.

182
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,360
His father meets his brother today.

183
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,320
I also admire your famous family.

184
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,320
But we can't bear to keep the money.

185
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,060
sucking together

186
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,620
from our bond

187
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,700
weino always can resist

188
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,980
My Lord

189
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,780
You have been nice to a few hundred year ago

190
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,220
you brought up like a Claudine

191
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,660
You have stomach ache

192
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,360
and you also want to make some little sums

193
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:32,160
Not to yell in front of a slice of later

194
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,280
Is that legal

195
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,800
Then you let me want to avoid you

196
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,100
I don't know, they are so important

197
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:54,620
You can find Xiaoxia andDalin whoYY is he

198
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:02,100
I האI right,Dalin

199
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,100
You can only know Lv Dalin

200
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,100
You don't know that Song Wuli can't even get along with Song Ci

201
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,100
You are so blind and blind

202
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,100
You are like Luo Jing Xia Shi, you are so blind

203
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,100
Fine

204
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Since you don't believe me

205
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
I don't have any other way

206
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
I will eat this skin

207
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,100
You eat it

208
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Eat it

209
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
It's full of layers

210
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Brother-in-law

211
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Take care

212
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
You are still so stupid

213
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Song Wuli

214
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
You said he is still here

215
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Why did you keep us here?

216
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Did you change your mind?

217
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
You are still alive, right?

218
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
No way

219
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
You are so blind

220
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
You are blind

221
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
You are blind

222
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,100
You don't know human nature

223
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
You are so blind

224
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
You are so stupid

225
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Do you know

226
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
He is so blind

227
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
He can't even use his body to get back

228
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,100
If he is blind

229
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,100
We will be in trouble

230
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,100
If he is blind

231
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,100
I will kill him

232
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
Come

233
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
He is here

234
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Brother

235
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
We are here

236
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,100
I know, it's a shame

237
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
We are not dead

238
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Xiaobai

239
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,100
I feel like you are

240
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,100
getting on your teacher Luo's waist

241
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Where is he?

242
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
I will definitely follow him

243
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Are you lonely, Brother Kun?

244
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
You are so blind

245
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
Go to the north

246
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
and help me get the land

247
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Hey Zui

248
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Hey Zui

249
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
You are so lazy

250
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,100
Hey Zui

251
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
What's wrong?

252
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
I am tired

253
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,100
Hello, do you eat the sausage?

254
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
No

255
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
No, I lie to him

256
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Hey Zui

257
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
What's wrong with him?

258
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
He is eating

259
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,100
No

260
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,100
We have to go to the police station

261
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Hurry up

262
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Hold it

263
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Okay

264
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Be careful

265
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
It's okay

266
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Go

267
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
Go

268
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,100
Go

269
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,100
What's wrong with you?

270
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Hello, Yixing

271
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,100
Is there anyone?

272
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,100
Who?

273
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Hello, Yixing

274
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,100
Hello

275
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,100
Come on

276
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Hurry up

277
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Thank you

278
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
Thank you

279
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Come on, Yixing

280
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Let me see

281
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,100
I am getting old

282
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,100
Is there any other way?

283
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,100
Let's go

284
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Let's go

285
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Come on

286
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
What's the matter?

287
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
You are getting old

288
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
You don't understand

289
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
You are so stupid

290
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,100
Yes, yes

291
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100
Let's go

292
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,100
Let's go

293
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
Don't be so serious

294
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,100
Come on

295
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,100
What's the meaning of this?

296
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,100
What's the meaning of this?

297
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,100
Hurry up

298
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,100
Hurry up

299
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Hurry up

300
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Hurry up

301
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
You don't understand me, right?

302
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,100
You are so stupid

303
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,100
You are so stupid

304
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,100
You are so stupid

305
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,100
Who is stupid?

306
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,100
You are so stupid

307
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Okay, thank you

308
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Okay

309
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Come on

310
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,100
Yixing said he didn't kill me

311
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,100
He has been playing with you for several days

312
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,100
He has been playing with you for several days

313
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Look

314
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,100
He is more gentle than before

315
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,100
Fortunately, he found out earlier

316
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,100
He is very gentle

317
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,100
Did he contact you?

318
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,100
No one answered the phone

319
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
I told him

320
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
There is news that he told us the first time

321
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
I am so sorry

322
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Where can I go so late?

323
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,100
You go back first

324
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Isn't it a train tomorrow morning?

325
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
I and Xiao Bai are here

326
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
The rest is not done

327
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
Go back to rest early

328
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
You can't sleep for several hours

329
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
What's wrong?

330
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
Why are you so anxious to drive me away?

331
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:05,100
This time, I don't know when I will see you again

332
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
Don't you have any shame?

333
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,100
Hello, teacher

334
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
I have no shame

335
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
It's up to you whether you see me again

336
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,100
Besides, I was the one who was in the train

337
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,100
for the final list

338
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,100
for the past ten years

339
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,100
and you are not me

340
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
You didn't contact me either

341
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Why should I contact you if you say so?

342
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Mo Qing

343
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,100
You were in the group

344
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Are you really thinking of me?

345
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Yes

346
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
What do you mean?

347
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Is there any point in talking about that time?

348
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
It was a mistake

349
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Mistake

350
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,100
Mistake caused by the wind and rain

351
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
The one that was thrown away every day

352
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
and the one that was thrown away

353
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
Was it a mistake?

354
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,100
When I left the year before

355
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
I told Guo Shilin

356
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,100
I wanted to go fishing

357
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
and walk the path that teacher Zan had taken

358
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
But actually, I know better than anyone

359
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
I was just running away from there.

360
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,100
I was afraid to see you.

361
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
I was afraid to see these environment.

362
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,100
I was afraid to remember how good Mr. Zan was to me.

363
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
I've been persuading myself these years.

364
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
I hope I can face these with courage.

365
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,100
What do you want to say?

366
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,100
I like you.

367
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
You used to like me more.

368
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
Can you give me a chance?

369
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,100
No.

370
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,100
Fang Kun.

371
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,100
We're not kids.

372
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
We're almost 30.

373
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
Let's be realistic.

374
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
One is in the fishing game.

375
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
One is in the fishing boat.

376
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,100
Since I can ask you this,

377
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,100
I've thought it through.

378
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,100
You just need to ask him

379
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
if he can give me a chance.

380
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
I'll think of a way to get away from this.

381
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
There's only one person who can sacrifice the distance.

382
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
I can't let the fishing boat go to the fishing boat to find you.

383
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
I'm not selfish.

384
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,100
I don't want you to give up fishing to find me.

385
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
To be honest,

386
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
I should have fallen in love with you

387
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,100
at this age.

388
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,100
I should have gotten married.

389
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,100
Why should I choose loneliness?

390
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,100
Isn't this our choice and our life?

391
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,100
I think it's good now.

392
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,100
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,100
Let's be friends.

394
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,100
Let's go back.

395
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,100
Let's go back.

396
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,100
Let's go back.

397
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
Let's go back.

398
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,100
I'm sorry.

400
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,100
Wait.

401
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Wait.

402
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
I'll go back.

403
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
I'll go back.

404
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,100
Wait.

405
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Uncle Shou.

406
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,100
Uncle Shou.

407
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Why is the fire here?

408
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,100
It's not a big fire.

409
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Uncle Shou.

410
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
Let's go back.

411
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Let's go back.

412
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
Let's go back.

413
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
Let's go back.

414
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,100
Let's go back.

415
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,100
Let's go back.

416
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,100
Don't go.

417
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,100
Let's go back.

418
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,100
Let's go back.

419
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
Let's go back.

420
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
Let's go back.

421
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
This way.

422
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,100
Let's go back.

423
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,100
Let's go back.

424
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,100
Slowly.

425
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
Uncle Shou.

426
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,100
I still have to find Luo.

427
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
Uncle Shou.

428
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,100
I'll go up there.

429
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
I'll go up there.

430
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
I'll go up there.

431
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,100
What if we want to go down there?

432
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,100
I'll ask you to die.

433
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,100
You go first.

434
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
You go first.

435
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
I'll go up there.

436
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
I'll go up there.

437
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,100
I'll go up there.

438
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
You go first.

439
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,100
Hurry up.

440
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
Uncle.

441
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Let's go.

442
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,100
Let's go.

443
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,100
I'm going to eat some food.

444
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Let's go.

445
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
Captain Qi, Fang Kun.

446
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,100
What's up?

447
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,100
Can you come to the original?

448
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,100
Uncle Shou is here.

449
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,100
It's not what it looks like.

450
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,100
I think it's the door that's hidden here.

451
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
Okay?

452
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,100
Mr. Luo!

453
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
Mr. Luo!

454
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
Mr. Luo!

455
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Mr. Luo!

456
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,100
What's up?

457
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,100
Kun, Mr. Luo is missing.

458
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,100
What's the matter?

459
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,100
I was sleeping at the Shui Zhao last night.

460
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
He came to call me in the morning.

461
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
I thought we'd take a look at the cage.

462
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,100
I thought we'd put the black mouth here.

463
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
I was talking to Mr. Han.

464
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,100
No, Mr. Luo.

465
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,100
Let's have a look.

466
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,100
I was walking around and he suddenly disappeared.

467
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,100
It's all flat.

468
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,100
You disappeared all the way.

469
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,100
Yeah, I was just saying.

470
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,100
There are so many ancient tombs here.

471
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
I can't eat anything.

472
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,100
Where is he?

473
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,100
I just walked past him and he disappeared.

474
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
I called him.

475
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,100
He disappeared.

476
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,100
I didn't bring my camera.

477
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,100
Here.

478
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
There's a signal.

479
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
Call him.

480
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,100
Let's go inside.

481
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,100
Luo Qing!

482
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,100
Luo Qing!

483
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
Luo Qing!

484
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,100
Luo Qing!

485
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,100
Fan Kun!

486
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,100
Fan Kun!

487
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,100
Why are you here?

488
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,100
He's not leaving.

489
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,100
If it weren't for you, I'd be in the park now.

490
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
You can stay here.

491
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
I'll be here.

492
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
I'll be back.

493
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
I'll be back.

494
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
I'll be back.

495
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
I'll be back.

496
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
I'm in the park. What are you doing here?

497
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Xiao Bai said you disappeared.

498
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
Why didn't you take the camera?

499
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,100
You just said something else.

500
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
What if something happens?

501
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
Who told you to leave?

502
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,100
Get in the car.

503
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,100
It's like a new cave.

504
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,100
Let me see.

505
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,100
What are you doing?

506
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
Look.

507
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
Here, I've got a stick.

508
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
I suspect that these people

509
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,100
took the medicine and put it in the cave.

510
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,100
They dug it.

511
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
Look at the cave.

512
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
Is it like a cave?

513
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,100
It's a cave.

514
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
It's definitely a cave.

515
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,100
Really?

516
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,100
The highest level of this cave is so close to the ground.

517
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
It means that the cave that appeared on the surface

518
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,100
is probably the same level as the forest.

519
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,100
The same level as the forest?

520
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,100
You're too great.

521
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,100
Look.

522
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
Look.

523
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,100
Look.

524
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,100
What are you doing?

525
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,100
I'm looking for someone to talk to.

526
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,100
I...

527
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
You're still playing with your hand?

528
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
Hurry up.

529
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
Be careful.

530
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,100
Okay.

531
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,100
Be careful.

532
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,100
Be careful.

533
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,100
We're selling so many boxes in the alley.

534
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,100
We'll eat them ourselves.

535
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,100
We have to stop making trouble.

536
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,100
Stop making trouble?

537
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,100
We're going to Gan Sa tomorrow.

538
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,100
We'll go to the Li family to sell the boxes.

539
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,100
We have to sell the boxes.

540
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,100
Sell the boxes?

541
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,100
You have to take the responsibility

542
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,100
to sell the boxes.

543
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,100
I have to sell the clothes.

544
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,100
I'm dead.

545
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Is there anyone in the house?

546
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
Where are you from?

547
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,100
I'm from the village.

548
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
I came to collect the boxes.

549
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,100
How much is the house?

550
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
180 yuan.

551
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,100
I have a brother.

552
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
How much is the house worth?

553
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,100
200 jin of cash, 2.8 yuan.

554
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,100
It's more than 100 jin.

555
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,100
It's 13 yuan.

556
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,100
I'm not sure.

557
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,100
I don't know how much it is.

558
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
It's 200 jin of cash.

559
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
It's more than 100 jin of cash.

560
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,100
It's cheaper.

561
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,100
No, no, no.

562
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,100
If the box is in the right place,

563
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,100
it's water-based.

564
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,100
I think the box is definitely worth it.

565
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,100
It's not necessary to sell the boxes.

566
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
Let's go to the base.

567
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,100

Hello.

766
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,820

767
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,820
Hello.

Hello.

769
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,820
Hello.

770
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,820
Hello.

771
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,820
Hello.

772
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,820
Hello.

773
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,820
Hello.

774
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,820
Hello.

775
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,820
I know something.

776
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,820
Who gave you the food these years?

777
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,820
Brother,

778
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,820
can you give me the phone number?

779
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,820
I don't know. You have to.

780
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,820
He's still looking for you.

781
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,820
Here.

782
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,820
Tell him.

783
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,820
You know what?

784
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,820
I know where Tahu is.

785
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,820
Does he want to marry me?

786
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,820
I'll call him when he's done with the housework.

787
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,820
This...

788
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,820
Brother,

789
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,820
that's Tahu.

790
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,820
I don't know.

791
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,820
I just want to say thank you.

792
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,820
I'm sorry.

793
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,820
Brother,

794
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,820
you're so cute.

795
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,820
You're so cool.

796
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,820
You don't even answer my calls.

797
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,820
Brother,

798
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,820
you're making fun of me.

799
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,820
You're so smart.

800
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,820
You can't answer your phone.

801
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,820
You're so mean.

802
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,820
You're so mean.

803
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,820
You're so mean.

804
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,820
You're so mean.

805
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,820
You're so mean.

806
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,820
You can't answer your phone.

807
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,820
You're so mean.

808
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,820
Send your brother over.

809
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,820
I'll leave right now.

810
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,820
I'll tell you.

811
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,820
I'm not going to let you marry me.

812
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,820
But we're talking nonsense.

813
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,820
I'll tell you.

814
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,820
He's a barbeque.

815
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,820
We're brothers.

816
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,820
If you can marry a barbeque,

817
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,820
I'll send you over.

818
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,820
Do you think I'm a barbeque?

819
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,820
If you take the money,

820
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,820
we're brothers.

821
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,820
If you don't,

822
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,820
I'll send you over.

823
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,820
I'm not going to marry you.

824
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,820
I'm not going to marry you.

825
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,820
I'm not going to marry you.

826
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,820
I'll tell you.

827
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,820
I'll tell you.

828
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,820
I'll tell you.

829
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,820
One day,

830
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,460
you'll date your reformed girl,

831
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,180
and now,

832
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:34,340
you can't understand

833
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,780
and tell her to keep her punch.

834
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,820
If you're going to keep herike,

835
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,820
you're going to earn her another daughter.

836
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,820
Baochuan.

837
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,820
Hey!

838
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,820
Stay out of the c меня.

839
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,020
You can't do anything.

840
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,020
You're a man.

841
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,020
Shut up.

842
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,020
This...

843
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,020
Brother,

844
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,020
I'll kick you out of the toilet.

845
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,820
Are you here to save your life?

846
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,020
Can he do it?

847
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,020
Can he do it?

848
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,820
He did it to touch you.

849
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,620
How could he do it?

850
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,820
I don't know.

851
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,620
Lawyer's touch.

852
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,820
You're a criminal.

853
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,820
Lawyer's touch.

854
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,820
I have to make a law firm for a law firm.

855
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,020
You're a fool.

856
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,220
I'll let the lawyer break his record.

857
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,820
Big Head.

858
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,820
You need to find some people.

859
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,020
Other criminals.

860
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,820
At least the lawyer will find them.

861
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,820
Then...

862
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,820
Then he's a criminal?

863
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,420
How could he do it?

864
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,220
He's a little more suspicious than a criminal.

865
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,420
But he's not lying.

866
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,620
He's just talking to you.

867
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,420
You're a criminal.

868
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,820
He's lying here.

869
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,820
He's lying.

870
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,020
And he's going to kick me out.

871
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,020
I'm a criminal.

872
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,620
I'll kick you out of the toilet.

873
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,820
