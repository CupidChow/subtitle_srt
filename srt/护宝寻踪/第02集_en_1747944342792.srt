00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000

little bit of a

little bit of a

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
little bit

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
of a

lit

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What? Sanmiao Village?

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
They are marked as Sanmiao Village from the Western suburb.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Western suburb?

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Western suburb of Wulingyuan?

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's not that far.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What are the characteristics of these Taoyong that you caught up this time?

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
They are the same as those six pieces.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The blackness of these Taoyong is different.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Some are darker in color,

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
some are lighter in color.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Why isn't he answering the phone?

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Who's talking?

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's 4 o'clock in the morning.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Captain, when did you come?

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's been a long time.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm going to the suburb near Sanmiao Village.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I haven't hidden the tools for a long time.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What's new?

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Captain Yang is very experienced.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I went to the suburb to look for something.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
There was a villager who was caught by someone.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But he was caught by a small group.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Captain Yang is strange.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He came to see.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You know what?

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He was caught by someone.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We quickly dug this place up.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We dug it up and put it in the woodworking bureau.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The new one?

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There are two possibilities.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Either we don't dig it up this time,

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
or we dig it up.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
There are not many people around.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This place is a little big.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But Captain Yang, the tools are here.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
These people didn't get it.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They should be back soon.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Sir, please restore the original position.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
There are people around.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If you don't dare to clean up, I'll be right back.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Captain Yang, please restore the original position.

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's here.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Good job.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You did a good job.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Looks like you're going to get married.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If you're going to marry me,

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
you have to turn around.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hold it. Hold it.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hold it. Hold it.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What happened to this man?

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What do you mean?

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What are you doing?

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, my God.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Hurry up. Hurry up.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What's going on?

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think I'm going crazy.

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Hurry up. Hurry up.

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You didn't tell me.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why didn't you come to the wedding?

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If they get married again,

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
they'll run away.

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
They're three people, we're two people.

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We don't know how to chase them.

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're not afraid of them?

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What?

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I have a gun.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm afraid of you.

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's go to the second team.

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We'll shoot them and throw them into the ice.

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The other two will talk later.

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Can you shoot?

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're not afraid of me?

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Shoot.

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I just walked through a fire.

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I think I can shoot them all.

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I can shoot.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Shoot.

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Stop.

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Stop.

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Captain, watch the hole.

146
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay.

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Stop.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Stop.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Stop.

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't move.

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Run.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Stop.

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Stop.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why did you come so late?

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Where's Captain Yang?

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There.

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Captain Yang.

158
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Are you okay?

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm fine.

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let's go.

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No need.

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Did you bring the hammer?

163
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes.

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Guys.

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Let's go.

166
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Let's go.

167
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's go.

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Are you sure about them?

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes.

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Did you see them?

171
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think they heard something.

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They didn't come out.

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Guys.

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm done.

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm done.

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You stay here.

177
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Come up.

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll give you a hand.

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's go.

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Sir.

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
They don't have a machine.

182
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The oxygen is not enough.

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You contact the nearby village.

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
They have a machine.

185
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The phone is too loud.

186
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's too loud.

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Guys.

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Are you all Hangs?

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You know.

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Their oxygen can't last too long.

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If you kill them,

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
they will be killed.

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Right?

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Si Zheng.

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Come up.

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll let you die.

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll let you go.

198
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't die.

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't care about you.

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Let them know you're safe.

201
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We are soldiers.

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We have to fight.

203
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Do you want to translate?

204
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll answer the phone.

205
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Hello.

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Hello.

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Hangs.

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Hangs.

209
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Hangs.

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hangs.

211
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You have to fly.

212
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You have to fly to the airfield.

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Captain Qi.

214
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The village and the police station

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
don't have a machine.

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's too late.

217
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We can't wait.

218
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What are you doing?

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What are you doing?

220
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What are you doing?

221
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Stop.

222
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You treat me like a man.

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You're a man.

224
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We are not children.

225
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We are not children.

226
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We are not children.

227
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We are not children.

228
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Captain Qi.

229
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Put it down.

230
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Go.

231
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Go.

232
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You two come.

233
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You have to drag me down.

234
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The cat is not in the village.

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It will scold us when we come back.

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The cat is not in the village.

237
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It will scold us when we come back.

238
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You're not afraid of the god of the sea.

239
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He will make the sky cry.

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Sir.

241
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Is the village in this area?

242
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes.

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Is there a tomb in our village?

244
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What are you doing?

245
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We are the archaeologists.

246
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes.

247
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The archaeologists just found a tomb.

248
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I think there must be a tomb.

249
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Otherwise, the tomb will be in the mountain.

250
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Do you know where it is?

251
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Where?

252
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's in front of the light.

253
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But now it's surrounded by police.

254
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Thank you.

255
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Thank you.

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's a good place.

257
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We also found a tomb.

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Is it the sea?

259
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
No.

260
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's so windy.

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Move.

262
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Mr. Liu.

263
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Why are you here?

264
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We heard that Black Taoyong came here.

265
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We want to see it.

266
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The day Black Taoyong took the photo,

267
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
the archaeologists answered the questions.

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You are so young.

269
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You are so young.

270
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You are also here to see Black Taoyong?

271
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yes.

272
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We will wait for you.

273
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
See you later.

274
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
OK.

275
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The archaeologists are here.

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Sit.

277
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Xing.

278
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
My officer Qi.

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You have been a police officer for years.

280
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Xing.

281
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You are still fighting.

282
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You are like a stranger.

283
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Do you know that?

284
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You almost died.

285
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I have a headache.

286
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I need to be quiet.

287
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Can you not?

288
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Thanks to the hole,

289
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
there is a high lack of oxygen.

290
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The tomb raiders have no power.

291
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Otherwise, you would be dead.

292
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Captain Yang can't stop you.

293
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I can.

294
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You are so shameless.

295
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Captain.

296
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You finally woke up.

297
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You scared me.

298
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Chief Zhao.

299
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Mr. You brought Zhang Suo here.

300
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes.

301
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Take your time.

302
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Take care.

303
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Mr. You.

304
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Thank you.

305
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You have been working hard.

306
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
No.

307
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I didn't expect it to be so efficient.

308
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Who is down there?

309
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Zhang Suo.

310
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
He was very excited when he came.

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I think the Black Taoyong has nothing to do with the Three-Dimension Village.

312
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Why?

313
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What is the main craft of Black Taoyong?

314
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The molding.

315
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The molding.

316
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Right.

317
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The shape is different.

318
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The body is smaller than Qin Yong's.

319
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The face is full.

320
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The shape is different.

321
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
These features are similar to the Taoyong's.

322
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
They are basically the same.

323
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But you can see the Three-Dimension Village.

324
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It is close to the Wuling Garden.

325
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But it is far from the West Han's.

326
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So I think the possibility of the Three-Dimension Village is almost none.

327
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It makes sense.

328
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
There is something.

329
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You are professional.

330
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Where are you from?

331
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Who are you?

332
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I am Qin Chuan.

333
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I am the leader of the police team.

334
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
My name is Qi Daxi.

335
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Qi Daxi. We are students from the University of Qinbei.

336
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
We are studying in the Department of Arts.

337
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I am Fang Kun. I am from the State Department.

338
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I am Luo Qing.

339
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You are students. Who brought you here?

340
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Teacher You.

341
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Teacher You.

342
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We are the teachers of our school.

343
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Have you been to the school?

344
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No. But we are the ones who

345
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
taught the Taoyong's school.

346
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You are students.

347
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You are experts

348
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
in the school.

349
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I am from the outside.

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But why

351
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
do you still have

352
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
this thing?

353
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Look at this.

354
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Do you know the King of Qin's

355
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Binh Ma Yong?

356
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I have seen it.

357
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The face is different.

358
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Why?

359
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The size of the doctor's face is bigger than the doctor's.

360
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's all gray.

361
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It shows that the country is strong.

362
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But the Han Dynasty

363
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
is not that useful.

364
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Slow down.

365
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Slow down.

366
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Harder.

367
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Slow down.

368
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
One, two, three.

369
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Go.

370
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Come on.

371
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What is that?

372
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's so heavy.

373
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Come on.

374
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Turn it off.

375
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Come on.

376
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What's going on?

377
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's just an ordinary

378
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
King of Qin's tomb.

379
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
If this hole is removed,

380
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
is the San Miao Village

381
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
the place where the Black Taoyong came from?

382
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's hard to say.

383
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
In terms of the shape, I am also more inclined

384
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
to say that the Taoyong that appeared in the Western Han Empire

385
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
is basically the same.

386
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But archaeology

387
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
needs evidence.

388
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
After all, we have not found

389
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
the same Black Taoyong in any of the King's tombs.

390
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If this is our subjective opinion,

391
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and we are wrong

392
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
in one night,

393
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
it will be further and further away from the truth.

394
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We are leaving.

395
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
See you later.

396
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Take care.

397
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You are too angry to be patient.

398
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You are too much of a mess.

399
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
There are so many experts.

400
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
None of them have a good idea.

401
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I am not the same as you.

402
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But it's right.

403
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
They are experts. They need to be careful.

404
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Be careful.

405
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You think

406
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I am as cold as you?

407
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You are just a stone

408
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
that has grown up

409
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and is not moving.

410
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Take care, Director Zhao.

411
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You are still angry.

412
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I am angry.

413
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Da San,

414
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
what kind of master are you?

415
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What are you doing?

416
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I am too weak

417
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
to fight.

418
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I was going to shoot you,

419
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
but after two days,

420
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
my master was so angry

421
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
that he gave me a punishment

422
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and a test.

423
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
We have to wear this

424
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and train ourselves.

425
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That's right. We can only start from the South.

426
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Si Cheng, I am going back now.

427
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I need to do a quick check.

428
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Okay.

429
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I am going back too.

430
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Captain Qi.

431
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Captain Qi.

432
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What's going on?

433
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
We have something

434
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
to discuss with you.

435
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Look.

436
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The sea is full of sea lions.

437
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
How about we

438
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
go down from the top?

439
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What do you mean?

440
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We want to see the Black Island.

441
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The Black Island?

442
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's really

443
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
different from the Black Island.

444
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Zhezhe,

445
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
it's almost

446
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
half an hour.

447
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I took the risk

448
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
to make a mistake.

449
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
This is the conclusion.

450
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The Black Island is different.

451
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I think it's better

452
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
to go to the Black Island.

453
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I suggest we start from the South.

454
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The South?

455
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Do you know how big it is?

456
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I only have one month.

457
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I have to go back

458
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
to the school.

459
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I will go back to study.

460
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Captain Qi, wait a minute.

461
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I will tell you my opinion.

462
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I have seen it.

463
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
From the image,

464
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
material and

465
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
technology of this island,

466
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
it's the Black Island.

467
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
As for why it's black,

468
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I haven't found the answer yet.

469
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You guys

470
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
have been talking about me

471
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
for so many years.

472
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
There may be a mistake.

473
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But from the current technology,

474
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
the heat and light test can make

475
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
the mistake the smallest.

476
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Come on, come on.

477
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What's going on?

478
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I don't know.

479
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
We are going to the South.

480
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
We have brought many people.

481
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Who?

482
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The bandits.

483
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Why did you bring the bandits

484
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
to the South?

485
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't know.

486
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It seems that it's not a good thing.

487
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The water in the South is not clean.

488
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What do you want from us?

489
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Come on.

490
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Boss Wu.

491
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Boss Wu.

492
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Why are you here?

493
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I didn't

494
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
ask you to come.

495
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Why did you come?

496
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I can't come.

497
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Are you afraid that the police

498
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
will come to you?

499
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm just kidding.

500
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
We are

501
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
a good business.

502
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Shen Zheng is not afraid of being out.

503
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You are almost out of the line.

504
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Shen Zheng,

505
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
how much do you want?

506
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
350,000.

507
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Can you do it?

508
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You want to do it?

509
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I can't afford it.

510
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'll ask a relative.

511
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's okay.

512
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
We are neighbors.

513
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You introduced me to you.

514
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'll do it.

515
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Thank you.

516
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Boss Wu,

517
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I asked you to report to the court.

518
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Do you know why the police

519
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
are so difficult to deal with?

520
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
If business is really difficult,

521
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
the police will

522
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
be the most difficult.

523
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
The police

524
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
will find someone

525
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
called...

526
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
the king of Hua.

527
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
He is a friend of mine.

528
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
He will help me.

529
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Okay.

530
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'll go back tonight and ask my relative.

531
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Okay.

532
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Let's go.

533
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Hey!

534
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Wow!

535
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Let's go.

536
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You just came out?

537
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yes.

538
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
This time,

539
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm going to ask my relative to come to the court.

540
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You just came out?

541
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yes.

542
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm going to ask my relative to come to the court.

543
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Okay.

544
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'll go back tonight.

545
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Okay.

546
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'll go back tonight.

547
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Okay.

548
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'll go back tonight.

549
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Okay.

550
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I'll go back tonight.

551
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Okay.

552
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'll go back tonight.

553
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Okay.

554
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Right?

555
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'll add another zero.

556
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Let's go.

557
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Who will be the king of Hua?

558
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Who will be the king of Hua?

559
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Why are you

560
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
interested in Chu?

561
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
What do you think?

562
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
What do I think?

563
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Don't listen to him.

564
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Nan Si has caught a lot of people.

565
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
What do you mean?

566
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You don't know anything about it?

567
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Should I ask?

568
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
My company is busy all day.

569
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I don't have time to worry about this.

570
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What do you think?

571
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I heard that the police are busy in Xinhua.

572
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I heard that the police are busy in Xinhua.

573
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Do you know this?

574
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I...

575
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I just want to know

576
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
what's going on.

577
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I think

578
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
you'd better

579
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
wait for the storm to come

580
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
before you go abroad.

581
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
As long as we don't let the storm come,

582
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
it won't come to us.

583
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Am I right?

584
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yes.

585
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Okay.

586
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'll go first.

587
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Hu,

588
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
you should go back to work.

589
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Go back to your home.

590
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yes.

591
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I'll go back.

592
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
What?

593
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
If my brother-in-law is killed,

594
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
you'll be in trouble.

595
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Go and make some noodles.

596
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
It's a little busy.

597
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I don't believe it.

598
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You're a jerk.

599
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You're a jerk.

600
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You're a jerk.

601
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You're a jerk.

602
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Come on, come on, come on.

603
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Give me the money.

604
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Give me the money.

605
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Give me the money.

606
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You don't want to give me the money.

607
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You're a jerk.

608
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Give me the money.

609
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
What do you mean?

610
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Give me the money.

611
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Give me the money.

612
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Wu,

613
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm your daughter-in-law.

614
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm not going to give you the money.

615
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Honey, honey,

616
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
what are you doing?

617
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I have nothing to do with you.

618
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You're my daughter-in-law.

619
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
How can you have nothing to do with me?

620
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I gave you 5,000 yuan a month.

621
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yan Xiaolu,

622
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
how can you be so gambling every day?

623
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Think about me and my life.

624
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I want to make more money.

625
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm going to divorce you if I can't afford it.

626
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Honey, honey,

627
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm begging you.

628
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm begging you.

629
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Look at the way you dig.

630
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Get up.

631
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm a little bit embarrassed.

632
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
What's wrong?

633
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Nothing.

634
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
By the way,

635
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I've checked all the houses here.

636
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I asked them.

637
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
They said they could divorce.

638
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
They didn't mention the past.

639
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm a little bit embarrassed.

640
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Do you have any friends?

641
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
No.

642
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
They don't know that I'm a thief.

643
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
They don't even recognize me.

644
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You're in danger.

645
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
You should check it.

646
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I have a good friend.

647
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
He's a good guy.

648
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
He's a good guy.

649
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I'll leave it to you.

650
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Okay.

651
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm too busy

652
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
to work.

653
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I have to work overtime.

654
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm sorry.

655
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Don't you have any friends?

656
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
No.

657
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
What about your father?

658
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Captain Qi,

659
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I didn't mean to.

660
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
What do you mean?

661
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
What do you mean?

662
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
This is my office.

663
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm just working.

664
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You're not the only one.

665
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Hurry up.

666
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You go to the warehouse.

667
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Did you hear that?

668
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
A group of black peach gardeners

669
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
were taken down when they were auctioned abroad.

670
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
What black peach gardeners?

671
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You don't know?

672
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
We're not interested in black peach gardeners.

673
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You don't know?

674
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
There's a group of black peach gardeners.

675
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
There's another one in our car.

676
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Do you want to see it?

677
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Okay.

678
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Let's go.

679
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Who told you to do it?

680
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
You dare to come to the south?

681
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
People are more evil.

682
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
If the people of Xingliu saw it, we wouldn't survive.

683
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Brother,

684
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I don't think so.

685
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm a black-faced man.

686
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
If it weren't for the magic of the world,

687
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I wouldn't come.

688
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
What's wrong?

689
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
My wife is going to divorce me.

690
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Especially you?

691
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Brother,

692
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
you're so annoying.

693
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
You're so annoying.

694
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Annoying?

695
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm going to kill you.

696
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
What?

697
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
What are you going to kill me?

698
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm going to sell you to a man called the king of the south.

699
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm going to kill him.

700
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
What's the use of killing him?

701
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
If we kill him, we can still be here.

702
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'll show you.

703
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
The people of Xingliu are starting to suspect us.

704
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
He just went to the south.

705
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I think he's going to kill the king of the south.

706
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
If they see it,

707
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
the king of the south will definitely kill him.

708
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
No, he can kill him.

709
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You're his brother-in-law. How can he kill you?

710
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Brother-in-law?

711
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
His uncle used to be a thug.

712
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
He was asked to cut off his uncle's hand.

713
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
What?

714
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So cruel?

715
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Brother,

716
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
we want to kill the king of the south first.

717
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It's easy.

718
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
This person is very cruel.

719
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
A phone number is used once.

720
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It's not easy to contact.

721
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Then we'll just

722
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
think about it.

723
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
What can we do with that 10,000 yuan?

724
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Little Hu,

725
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
we've arranged it with a cup.

726
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
This time, we'll split the money.

727
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's not a matter of life and death.

728
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
From the last round,

729
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
we can't see the winner.

730
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
We're divided.

731
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
We'll go to Xingliu.

732
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'll find a way to kill the king of the south.

733
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
We can't let them see it.

734
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'll go.

735
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'll go.

736
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
The king of the south

737
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
you know

738
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
is Gu Yue.

739
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
How do you know Gu Yue?

740
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Gu Yue is usually a man of the life.

741
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
The king of the south is very cruel.

742
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
What's the name of that person?

743
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
What's the name of that person?

744
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
What's the name of that person?

745
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
The name is Tu Sanhu.

746
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
The name is Tu Sanhu.

747
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
The culture is different.

748
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I heard about a live broadcast.

749
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
They said that those people

750
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
who came to invite the prisoners,

751
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
they were all lawyers.

752
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
They often change places.

753
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yes.

754
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
In such places,

755
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
they are called

756
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
the fish and the fish's bones.

757
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
They are called Tang.

758
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
They are all people of the same kind.

759
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
They don't hide.

760
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
They can escape easily.

761
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
If you have a photo of them,

762
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
you can find them.

763
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
They are all people of the same kind.

764
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Hao,

765

You must walk the right path.

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
If you want to eat meat,

769
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
go to the cemetery.

You are a fool.

824
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I don't care who you are with.

825
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I hate to see you

826
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
in the cemetery.

827
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I can ask someone to give you the name.

828

I will give you a sign.

836
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You go to ask who is the

837
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
