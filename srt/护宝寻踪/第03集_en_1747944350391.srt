What did Mr. Zai say to you?

246
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
He didn't even say a word.

247
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
He even held your unrealistic fantasies

248
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and didn't even let go.

249
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
He's really mad at you.

250
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You're just being smart.

251
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You're doing your best.

252
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Kun, Luo Qing is right.

253
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You have to reflect on yourself now.

254
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You have to know what you can do and what you can't do.

255
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I know.

256
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I just want to prove that Black Taoyong

257
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
is not in the forest or in the forest.

258
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Let go.

259
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Get up.

260
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Get up.

261
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
There's no wine.

262
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
We have to read the spell.

263
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
You've been on the road less than once.

264
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
What will happen to our city?

265
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Your wish?

266
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
At least you can keep your promise for three days.

267
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
My brother,

268
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
you've been on the road several times.

269
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Don't you know what I'm going through?

270
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Look.

271
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
There are signs hanging outside.

272
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Two classes in one office.

273
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It looks very lively.

274
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
In fact, except for my school,

275
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
there are only three people left.

276
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
The traffic is three hours per circle.

277
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
The Ziling Garden is 40 miles away.

278
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I've been driving from here to Ziling

279
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
for two hours.

280
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Besides,

281
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm not a zero in Ziling.

282
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's a big circle.

283
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's six hours out.

284
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I know what you're saying.

285
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You can't just know, Captain Yang.

286
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You have to help us solve the problem.

287
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm not talking about people.

288
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm talking about bicycles.

289
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Bicycles are in good condition this year.

290
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
No need to solve it.

291
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
They can't afford to buy their own bicycles.

292
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Because this time,

293
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
it's a little more than five miles away.

294
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It's not difficult.

295
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I've been listening for a long time.

296
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You're the new boss of Ziling.

297
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm in the position.

298
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Now,

299
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
there's a possibility that Nanling and Douling

300
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
will be illegal.

301
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Nanling and Douling are close to the village.

302
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
If there's a storm,

303
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
the people will definitely find out.

304
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You're talking about the people.

305
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
The people are busy.

306
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's not like they're looking at you.

307
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Besides, this is your job.

308
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Who wants us to just talk about the people?

309
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
The people around us

310
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
are training the people's garden.

311
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You're very careful.

312
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm from the village.

313
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Which one?

314
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You're from the village?

315
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
There's a broad in your village.

316
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's called Yan Shou Village.

317
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
What?

318
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I told him to open the door.

319
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I put him out.

320
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Can he find out it's a question mark?

321
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Right.

322
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It's good that you can fall in love now.

323
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yan Shou Village.

324
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yan Shou Village.

325
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You're a thief!

326
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You're a thief!

327
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
What are you doing?

328
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You're a thief!

329
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You're a thief!

330
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'll show you what's wrong with you.

331
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Why are you here today?

332
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm so pissed.

333
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Stop drinking!

334
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
If you keep drinking, I'll kill you!

335
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Come on, help me.

336
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Stop drinking.

337
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Get out of the way.

338
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I won't.

339
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I won't.

340
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Get out of the way.

341
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Get up!

342
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Get up!

343
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Get up!

344
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Get up!

345
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
What's wrong with the staff?

346
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I and the people of the Yang team

347
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
have been working on the results.

348
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Why are they all so impolite?

349
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
We're all the same.

350
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
We can't just listen to what we hear.

351
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
We have to see it with our own eyes.

352
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
See it?

353
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You don't know how many times I've seen it these two days.

354
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
They all think we're going to be punished.

355
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
If it weren't for the Yang team,

356
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
no one would have been looking for us.

357
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's all the same.

358
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm also a man now.

359
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Captain Xu,

360
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Zhao Junhai is here.

361
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Go!

362
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Go! Do you hear me?

363
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Hurry up!

364
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Come on!

365
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Go! Go!

366
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Go!

367
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Come on!

368
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I caught the thief!

369
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The thief!

370
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Look!

371
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
What thief?

372
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm alone.

373
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
How can I be a thief in his tool?

374
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
This... this...

375
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Master!

376
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Master, I'm here to help you.

377
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Today, in the garden,

378
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I saw a car in the garden.

379
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It was moving in the east.

380
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It was moving.

381
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You want to take my hat and let me talk?

382
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
No!

383
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
What do you want?

384
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You want to steal my work?

385
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You call the other team.

386
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Tell them to come.

387
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I won't come!

388
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I won't go!

389
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You fool.

390
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You ran into the civil service office

391
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and sent a message to the commander.

392
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
What?

393
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
That Tang Suo is in trouble?

394
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
He's not serious.

395
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
He's so fast.

396
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
You're a stubborn man.

397
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
He sent you to the civil service office to investigate and visit.

398
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
He didn't send you to teach people.

399
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Men are different.

400
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You can't find him once a week.

401
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It's weird that you can prevent thieves from coming.

402
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Are you annoying?

403
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Tang Suo told you that he has his difficulties.

404
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
What about him?

405
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
The most difficult thing now is to call the police.

406
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I looked around.

407
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Count his holes.

408
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
He's so brave.

409
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
He's strong.

410
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Strong?

411
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You can count his holes.

412
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'll go and check it myself.

413
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'll show him how to do it.

414
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
What do you think we're doing?

415
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Can't you see?

416
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Do you think I'm stupid?

417
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm a magician.

418
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I can turn you into a few people.

419
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
You're so smart.

420
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Stop it.

421
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm a cow.

422
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You can't catch me.

423
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Besides,

424
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
you don't know how big the White Deer Garden is.

425
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
It's a matter of how many people.

426
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Okay.

427
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'll be right there.

428
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Catch the thief.

429
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Go.

430
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I just made a new tea.

431
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Good tea.

432
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Leave some for me.

433
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Don't touch the flower.

434
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
What are you doing?

435
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You're so...

436
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Why are you running away?

437
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
What are you doing?

438
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I've been washing my towel for a long time.

439
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You're so dirty.

440
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
If I come here, it's a big deal.

441
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I don't want to go with you.

442
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm here to help you.

443
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You go with me.

444
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You can't go.

445
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'll take you as a man.

446
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'll take you as a man.

447
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You are in the wrong.

448
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You have to be a man.

449
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'll help you.

450
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
What's going on?

451
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
What's going on?

452
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Wait.

453
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I'll go get the stuff.

454
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You can't do that.

455
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You're so stupid.

456
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
They're college students from the Qingbei University.

457
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
They're studying archaeology.

458
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You see, you see, you see.

459
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
They're college students from the Qingbei University.

460
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
They're studying archaeology.

461
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
They're archaeologists.

462
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
What the hell are you doing?

463
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It doesn't matter if he's Tang Shi or something.

464
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
What the hell are you doing?

465
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm sorry.

466
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Little man, don't say anything.

467
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm sorry.

468
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Wait.

469
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Da Cao, are you serious?

470
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'll beat you up.

471
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Why are you suddenly so far away?

472
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm helping you find the cave.

473
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That's his business.

474
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You're a student.

475
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
What's the occasion for?

476
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I just want to prove that my guess is right.

477
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You've been a Taoist for seven years.

478
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
What's the matter with him?

479
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
This is called academic struggle, you know?

480
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
If I can't find the spirit,

481
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I'll go to the forest to find it next.

482
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Right, right.

483
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You're in the car.

484
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Let's go.

485
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Today I told you that if it weren't for the priest from the factory,

486
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
we wouldn't know how to deal with this.

487
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I want you to make me a bowl of noodles.

488
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
This is an apology for you.

489
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Let's go.

490
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
You?

491
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I want to check a Taoist.

492
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I want to ask you something.

493
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I just want to ask.

494
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Because I heard that there is a Taoist here.

495
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You can ask the Taoist at the Phoenix Mountain.

496
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's two or three miles from the Phoenix Mountain.

497
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
How can I know about the Taoist?

498
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
No, I'm talking about the Taoist.

499
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Not only the Han Taizong.

500
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
What?

501
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
The Taoist is not the Han Taizong's spirit?

502
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Then what is it?

503
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
The Taoist we usually talk about is actually a big concept.

504
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It includes the spirit of the Han Taizong.

505
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And the spirit of the South Spirit of the Queen of Bocai and the Dou Emperor.

506
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
The Dou Emperor.

507
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
The Dou Emperor is here?

508
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I haven't heard about the Dou Emperor.

509
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'll find someone to help him bring the spirit back.

510
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Okay, I'll go.

511
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'll go.

512
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The blue one.

513
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
The blue one.

514
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Thank you.

515
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Come on.

516
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Brother Fang.

517
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
What are you looking at?

518
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm looking at this picture.

519
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm looking at the whole picture.

520
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It doesn't look like it.

521
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Why not?

522
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It smells good.

523
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Brother, have some water.

524
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Okay, thank you.

525
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You go ahead.

526
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
No, thank you.

527
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
What are you doing?

528
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm lost.

529
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Brother, you should be ashamed to ask.

530
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I was lost that day.

531
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Didn't I tell you?

532
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's none of your business.

533
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I haven't been back for so long.

534
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
What do you mean?

535
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I haven't been back for so long.

536
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I can tell you about this woman.

537
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Maybe she's lost.

538
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Impossible.

539
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm very smart.

540
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
That day, I heard her voice in the ground.

541
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I met two people who were not like good people.

542
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I must have been stolen by them.

543
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Brother, eat enough meat.

544
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Brother Fang, come back.

545
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Don't come back.

546
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Brother.

547
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You're awake.

548
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Thank you.

549
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Look at me.

550
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm not well.

551
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
The car is broken.

552
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I can't fix it.

553
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Here.

554
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'll send you back tonight.

555
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I have to find a hole in the garden tomorrow.

556
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I don't plan to go back tonight.

557
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Where do you live?

558
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I live in Anshun.

559
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
The house is big.

560
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I live alone.

561
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Tomorrow, I'll take you to the forest.

562
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You go first.

563
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You're right.

564
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I can't help you if I can't forget about it.

565
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Is the cultural property important?

566
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Of course it is.

567
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What about the cultural property?

568
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Can it be used as food?

569
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's the owner.

570
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It can't be so low.

571
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I don't think so.

572
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Do you know how much I've paid in the last few years?

573
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I let everyone eat and drink.

574
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I don't think so.

575
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
What does it have to do with the pay?

576
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Half of the money.

577
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I don't want to talk to you.

578
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I don't want to talk to you.

579
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Captain Qi, it's okay.

580
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'll finish it later.

581
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I'll stop.

582
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I invited all the teachers here today

583
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
to talk about the black peach swimming.

584
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It's a month's time.

585
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
The pressure is huge.

586
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I hope you can overcome the difficulty

587
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and bring out a solid evidence.

588
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You must make sure that the other party has nothing to say.

589
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Now that we know the results of the hot-water swimming are controversial,

590
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I suggest we conduct more experiments.

591
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Before the final result is out,

592
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
we'll go and look for some documents

593
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
to see if there's any record of black peach.

594
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Captain,

595
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
you're here to do an experiment?

596
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
What's wrong?

597
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
What are you here for?

598
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
To make a move.

599
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Make a move?

600
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I've been doing cultural relics in my village for years.

601
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I've never heard of a move in my village.

602
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
You get in the car, I'll take you to make a move.

603
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
If you make a move, I'll help you.

604
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'll help you.

605
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'll help you.

606
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I'll help you.

607
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
If you make a move, I'll help you.

608
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'll help you.

609
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I'll help you.

610
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Get in the car, I'll take you to make a move.

611
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Get in the car.

612
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Uncle,

613
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I heard that you're the only one

614
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
in this generation who's a member of the cultural relics.

615
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
They all say that you're a person who came from the wind

616
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
and the rain,

617
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
but you're a person who's always in the mood.

618
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It's not easy.

619
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You're a good speaker.

620
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm not just bragging.

621
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
From now on,

622
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
we'll be called the wind and rain generation.

623
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
The men will come and go.

624
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
They'll come and go.

625
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's the grandchildren of the Han people.

626
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
They'll be like this.

627
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So,

628
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'll take his wife to the village.

629
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Let her get married to me.

630
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Let me go to see the village.

631
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I'll see it myself.

632
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's not easy to get married to someone

633
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
who's always in the mood.

634
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Right?

635
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yes, yes.

636
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I feel that you're more mature than your father.

637
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm asking you,

638
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
what does the cultural relics know?

639
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
They know that the Han people are the wind,

640
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
that the wind is the rain,

641
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
and that the wind is the rain.

642
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Uncle,

643
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
do you know anything else?

644
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Tell me what else you know.

645
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I want to hear it.

646
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
If I lie to you,

647
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
you won't believe me, right?

648
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Captain Qi,

649
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
we've already won this game, right?

650
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
We've won it.

651
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Now,

652
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
we can win it like we did before.

653
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
We've got the whole line of the original.

654
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
We know a lot of details,

655
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
including its location.

656
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It's different

657
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
if we win it again.

658
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Do you really believe

659
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
what that student said?

660
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
What did the professor say?

661
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I don't know.

662
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
He's not that smart.

663
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
He needs to be more careful.

664
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You're saying that too?

665
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Don't forget to put the iron on your face.

666
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Who said that?

667
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Do you know him?

668
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
But I admit

669
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
that you're a capable person.

670
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Who?

671
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Little bell,

672
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
keep the hall clean.

673
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Tell me,

674
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
what's going on in the garden recently?

675
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I've been to the countryside.

676
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
But my surname is Cheng.

677
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
My surname is Cheng Siqiang.

678
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Cheng Siqiang?

679
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Cheng Siqiang.

680
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Cheng Siqiang

681
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
was caught by me ten years ago.

682
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
He's been out for a while now.

683
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
You're so lucky to have a good friend.

684
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You're so funny.

685
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I'm sorry.

686
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm sorry.

687
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'm sorry.

688
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You're sorry too.

689
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Sir,

690
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
as long as it's about the Daoist Church,

691
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
you can just

692
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
talk to me for a few days.

693
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's okay.

694
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
If you talk to me

695
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
nonsense,

696
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I won't let you

697
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
eat the food of the West.

698
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Look.

699
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Look at me.

700
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Do you remember the Phoenix Mountain?

701
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
This is the Phoenix Mountain.

702
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
The northeast direction is connected to the water.

703
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
The southwest is connected to the park.

704
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You know,

705
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
you can't sleep in the park.

706
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:09,480
The park is full of

707
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
the wood.

708
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You know,

709
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
the Han Tai Zong's wood

710
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
is on this position.

711
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
There's another way to call it.

712
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
What is it called?

713
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
It's called the toothed wood.

714
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
That's the tooth of the cliff.

715
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
That is to say,

716
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
make a hole in the middle of the mountain

717
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
to make this path and the tomb.

718
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
You mean like urine?

719
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Fly into the air

720
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and make a hole

721
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
and put the coffin in.

722
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I want to ask you

723
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
why Nanling and Dongling

724
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
know how to do this?

725
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
This is an emperor.

726
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
He is so pitiful.

727
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Because Han Tai Zong is a good emperor.

728
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
When he was in power,

729
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
the economy was in a bad shape

730
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
and the people were in need.

731
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So he didn't want the people

732
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
to suffer from the people's money.

733
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
He said that after he died,

734
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
he shouldn't spend too much money on him.

735
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
But he was a filial son.

736
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So his mother's Nanling

737
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
was very well-maintained.

738
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Including his wife, Dou Yi Fang.

739
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Because she died late,

740
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
at that time,

741
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Xi Han was already rich

742
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
and could not afford it.

743
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So he had money

744
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
to get her

745
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
this good tomb.

746
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Han Tai Zong

747
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
had a good relationship

748
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
with his wife.

749
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Why is he so distant

750
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
from his wife?

751
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Uncle, are you still so sharp?

752
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
This question is good.

753
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Look,

754
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
in the 11th Emperor of Xi Han,

755
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
indeed,

756
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
their souls are the farthest.

757
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
For example,

758
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
his father, Gao Zu,

759
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
and his daughter,

760
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
are all in the same grave.

761
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
His son, Yang Ling,

762
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
who is in the capital,

763
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
is not to mention,

764
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
he is in the same grave

765
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
with his wife.

766
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Same?

767
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
What do you mean?

768
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Same grave?

769
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Same grave.

770
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It means that

771
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
he and his wife

772
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
are not buried in the same pit.

773
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But,

774
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
their souls

775
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
are surrounded by

776
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
a big bell wall.

777
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
In professional terms,

778
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
this is called the same grave.

779
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And the wall.

780
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Where is the wall?

781
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I've never seen it.

782
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I've seen it

783
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
for so many years.

784
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Let's continue.

785
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I don't know

786
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
where the wall is.

787
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Let's go.

788
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Let's continue.

789
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Let's go.

790
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
You know,

791
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
it's really a big grave.

792
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
The journey is long.

793
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
A bright moon.

794
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I ask the world

795
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
for a thousand years.

796
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Who does not know

797
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
the long and long life?

798
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
The long and long life.

799
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
The long and long life.

800
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
The long and long life.

801
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
The pain of the heaven

802
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
is gone.

803
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
The yellow river

804
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
is still flowing.

805
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
A cup of wine

806
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
is for the sake of the people.

807
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
The wall is full of the ashes.

808
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I walk through the dark.

809
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
The road is dark.

810
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I travel a hundred miles.

811
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
A bright moon.

812
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I ask the world

813
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
for a thousand years.

814
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Who does not know

815
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:28,000
the long and long life?
