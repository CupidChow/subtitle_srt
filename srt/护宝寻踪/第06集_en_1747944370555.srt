Let's go.

261
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Take it.

262
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Take it!

263
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Brother, I just found something.

264
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It's a rumor.

265
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's a rumor.

266
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Have you heard of it?

267
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
No.

268
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Read it.

269
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
This...

270
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Finally found a poem about this village.

271
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
This is the first village?

272
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That must be the map of the village.

273
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Open it and have a look.

274
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Have a look at the south of the village.

275
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Is there a mountain?

276
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
A river?

277
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
A cliff?

278
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What do you think?

279
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Is it Li Yu Gou?

280
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Li Yu Gou?

281
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Have a look.

282
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Li Yu Gou, south.

283
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Is there?

284
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It's there.

285
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's south.

286
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You know a lot.

287
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Let's check the news.

288
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Have you been to the village?

289
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I've been to many places.

290
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I've seen a book in the newspaper.

291
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And we can find it there.

292
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
The village.

293
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm done.

294
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm done.

295
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Brother.

296
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'll pay you 300,000.

297
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I promise you.

298
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Why should I pay you?

299
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You don't have to.

300
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I thought I was buying a nursing insurance.

301
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I told you.

302
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You don't have to pay me.

303
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Okay.

304
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I believe you.

305
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'll ask you one more thing.

306
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
What is it?

307
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Get up.

308
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'll be in this business for the rest of my life.

309
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You can let your brothers

310
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
get the news to the stomach.

311
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And leave a good path for them.

312
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
What happened today?

313
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Do you remember?

314
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I don't know.

315
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Dazi.

316
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Get up.

317
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
We haven't seen anything except this forest.

318
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I won't do anything that will ruin the road.

319
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Especially for the scholars.

320
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You're a bandit.

321
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You're very smart.

322
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
If you don't mind,

323
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'll teach you to read books in my name.

324
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I've learned everything I need to learn.

325
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
If you really want to teach me,

326
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
just give me a few books.

327
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I'll give you all the books.

328
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Two days ago,

329
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
you turned the village committee upside down.

330
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Why are you here again?

331
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
The village committee can't find the neighbors.

332
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
The village committee is not a library.

333
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What do you want this for?

334
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
We're doing an important class.

335
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
It's about the village of Du Ling.

336
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
This village

337
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
can be seen from east to west

338
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and from east to west.

339
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It's a small village.

340
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
What's there to study?

341
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Bai, you don't know.

342
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Although our village is small,

343
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
it has a long history.

344
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We're not called the village of Du Ling.

345
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Du Ling is the mother of the Han Xuan Empire.

346
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
But from the map,

347
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
our village is

348
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
the wife of Han Taizong,

349
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
the Empress Dowager.

350
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's more than 20 kilometers from Du Ling.

351
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
If we can figure out the connection between the two,

352
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
we can change the history.

353
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
We need to figure out

354
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
the relationship between the two villages.

355
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
There's no relationship between the two villages.

356
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
There's no blood relationship.

357
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I just said to you,

358
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
our village is called the Du Huanghu Ridge.

359
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It used to be called the Du Ling Village.

360
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It's a place of no importance.

361
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's not divided.

362
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Listen to me.

363
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The Du is not white.

364
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
People think it's the Du is not white.

365
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But it's not.

366
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The name of the village is Du Ling.

367
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Du...

368
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
What are you doing?

369
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We're going to eat.

370
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Go and eat.

371
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You're back.

372
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Come on, let's eat.

373
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
The food here is delicious.

374
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Sit down.

375
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Take it.

376
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Coming.

377
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You've been sleeping well these days.

378
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You'll eat well.

379
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
We don't have any appetite.

380
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
We can't sleep.

381
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I didn't ask you to come.

382
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
What?

383
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Did you find the answer?

384
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yes.

385
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
The Du Ling Village has nothing to do with the Du.

386
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It used to be called the Du Ling Village.

387
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The locals only know the Du from the Du.

388
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Okay.

389
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
If you're late, some people will call the Du for nothing.

390
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So you already know the answer, right?

391
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Is there a problem with the first-time people knowing the answer?

392
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Mr. Chan.

393
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Because of a written agreement,

394
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
we've checked so many useless books.

395
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
We spent so much time.

396
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Why don't we use this time to investigate the Jilin?

397
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I just asked you to find the answer.

398
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Did I ask you to turn over the books?

399
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's all your fault.

400
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It's the first time I've heard that

401
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
it's a waste of time to be a commoner.

402
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Mr. Chan.

403
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
What are we doing here?

404
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's so far from the Black Robe and the Eastern Sword.

405
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Is this the place you discovered 30 years ago?

406
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Yes.

407
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I heard that you found 20 burial pits

408
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
in the West of the Bo Tai Lake.

409
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
There are many animal bones in the burial pit.

410
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
There are also the bones of the bull and the big panda.

411
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We're in the lowland of Qin Chuan.

412
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
There are both panda and bull.

413
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
How can there be a bull?

414
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I remember that

415
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Liu Qingzhu and Mr. Li Yufang

416
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
mentioned in the West Han Shiyi Ling.

417
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
They said that the bull in the South Ling Shunzhang

418
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
belonged to the Zhaowa Bujiao family.

419
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It should be the ruler of Vietnam

420
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
who gave it to the emperor of Han Dynasty.

421
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Oh, yes.

422
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I heard that it was the first time

423
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
that you found the bull and the panda

424
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
as a burial pit.

425
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Yes.

426
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
But you definitely don't know

427
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
that it was because of me

428
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
that I almost changed the history

429
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
and made a big mistake.

430
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I was over 20 years old that year.

431
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm about the same age as you now.

432
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It was also the first time that I participated in

433
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
such a major project.

434
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I'm just like you.

435
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm full of spirit and confident.

436
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Master He, did you find anything?

437
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
No.

438
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Xiao Zan, come here.

439
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Look at this.

440
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm afraid it's not a bull.

441
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You go back to the town

442
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and call the school.

443
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
This is the student of the local department,

444
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Mr. Yang.

445
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Who is this?

446
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's not Mr. Yang.

447
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Mr. Yang took this student

448
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
to the State Department for investigation.

449
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I didn't find him.

450
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I found a life teacher

451
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
in the middle school in the town.

452
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I thought it was a bull.

453
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
The life teacher must recognize him.

454
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Xiao Zan,

455
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
come here.

456
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
The bones are not fully preserved.

457
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
But from the bones' structure,

458
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
it should be a bull called Dali.

459
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I recorded it as Mr. Wu said

460
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
and wrote it in the archaeological report.

461
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Mr. Yang was particularly interested

462
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
after hearing it.

463
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
He came back from the ancient period to identify it.

464
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
We found out that it was a bull.

465
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Although the archaeological team

466
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
didn't criticize me,

467
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I felt very sad.

468
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I cried in the garden.

469
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I wanted to kill myself.

470
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It was because I wanted to be a man.

471
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I almost ruined a history.

472
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I almost ruined the West Niu Valley.

473
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I almost became a sinner of history.

474
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
But how could I tell the bull's bones

475
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
that I was a man?

476
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
The bones were not fully preserved.

477
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I thought it was a bull.

478
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
After we found out that it was a West Niu Valley,

479
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
we searched in the pit again

480
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and found the West Niu Valley.

481
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I want to tell you

482
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
the story of the time.

483
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Once the chief judge has decided,

484
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
no matter how much evidence there is,

485
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
it will be lost.

486
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Now I understand

487
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
why Mr. Zan asked us to find the relationship

488
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
between Du Ling and Du Ling Village.

489
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
When we first received this topic,

490
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
we thought that there must be a history.

491
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
We started to look for places to consult and click.

492
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It was because we were the main ones.

493
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
If it wasn't because we were the main ones,

494
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
it wouldn't be hard to find the reason for the speech.

495
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Even if we asked Xiaoman and the locals,

496
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
we could find the answer.

497
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
If we were too much,

498
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
we would be caught in the act

499
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
and ignore the truth.

500
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Many people think

501
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
archaeology is useless.

502
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But I think

503
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
archaeology can make the history of a nation

504
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
clearer and clearer.

505
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Archaeology can help us

506
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
to find the missing records

507
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
in the historical records.

508
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
We can restore the history of every footprint.

509
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
We can show the whole of Chinese civilization

510
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
to everyone and to the world.

511
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The so-called archaeological evidence

512
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
is the one stroke of our archaeology.

513
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Every word of the archaeologists

514
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
and every judgment

515
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
may be related to

516
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
a historical and civilized

517
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
process.

518
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So we must be careful.

519
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Never think of the person

520
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
and never make decisions in person.

521
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Huang Kun,

522
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
guess who's tomb

523
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
this is.

524
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Is there no solid evidence?

525
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I have no evidence.

526
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I can't prove it.

527
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Okay.

528
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
We don't have to come to the park.

529
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Did you hear that?

530
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The tomb was dug by Song Yun.

531
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Song Yun is so lucky.

532
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
He is a man of great fortune.

533
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
He is not a man of evil.

534
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
He is a man of great fortune.

535
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
He is a man of great fortune.

536
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
He is a man of great fortune.

537
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I think it's not right to be angry.

538
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You think I'm a fool?

539
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I sold it and got paid.

540
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
A big tomb

541
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
and a tomb.

542
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The tomb was dug by me.

543
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
If I knew I could dig it,

544
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I would have kicked it off.

545
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I don't know what I thought.

546
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I have a new life with this.

547
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
This is the family of the man.

548
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
The tomb is so big.

549
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
We are here.

550
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
The top is broken, the bottom is broken.

551
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
We are in a dilemma.

552
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
What should we do?

553
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
We can't even sell the tomb.

554
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
We can't catch fish in the mountains.

555
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
We can't even build a house.

556
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
We are in a dilemma.

557
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Get in.

558
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Brother, the wind and water are heavy.

559
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Aren't we near the cave?

560
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
We have to climb up the mountain

561
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
to get to the cave.

562
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Brother, you get up and I get up.

563
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I get up when I'm sick.

564
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
What's wrong?

565
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
What's wrong?

566
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
What are you doing?

567
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm writing a test.

568
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
What test?

569
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Look at me.

570
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm so confused.

571
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
How can I fall asleep?

572
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm reading a book.

573
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Keep pretending.

574
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Keep pretending.

575
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
What we always do is

576
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
for you.

577
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You always think he doesn't like you.

578
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
We can see that he values you the most.

579
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Because he has high hopes,

580
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
he is strict with you.

581
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
If he didn't go to the temple,

582
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
you would have been fired.

583
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
What book are you still reading?

584
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Think about it.

585
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm going to sleep.

586
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
What's wrong?

587
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
What's wrong?

588
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
You're still awake?

589
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I can't sleep.

590
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I need to exercise.

591
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
What's wrong?

592
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Nothing.

593
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
You're still awake?

594
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I can't sleep.

595
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm going out for a walk.

596
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Can we go together?

597
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Yes.

598
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
What do you think is the most important thing

599
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
when we do field work?

600
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
The water in the stomach.

601
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
No matter how much water there is,

602
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
if you don't have a good body,

603
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
you can't come to the site.

604
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So when I was young,

605
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I started to exercise.

606
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I told myself,

607
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
if I can't compare to others in academic achievement,

608
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I will compare with them who lives longer.

609
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I will use time to overcome the challenge.

610
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
After you made a mistake,

611
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
you...

612
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
After I went back to Yuan Shang,

613
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I couldn't get up.

614
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I felt like I was on a wooden plate.

615
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I couldn't breathe for years.

616
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I have a classmate

617
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
who has a project in the fish market.

618
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
He asked me to put Qin Han's fish in the stock.

619
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I went to his place to relax.

620
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
The fish market?

621
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yes.

622
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's a beautiful place.

623
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
There are mountains and rivers everywhere.

624
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
There are also the next door.

625
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It's very lonely.

626
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
But when I got there,

627
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I felt relaxed for the first time.

628
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Why?

629
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Because the sky is high and the earth is far.

630
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
No one recognizes us.

631
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
No one knows what we have done wrong.

632
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
So when I got there,

633
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I stayed.

634
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The sky above my head

635
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
is stepping on the moon below my feet.

636
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I am still standing here

637
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
in the dark.

638
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
The darkness that burned the earth

639
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
is still in the middle of the night.

640
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Under the wild leaves,

641
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
the abyss is sleeping.

642
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Don't stop.

643
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I am still in the dark.

644
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
The darkness that burned the earth

645
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
is still in the middle of the night.

646
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
The abyss is sleeping.

647
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I have been asking the world for thousands of years.

648
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

649
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Who is not following the fate of time?

650
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I am still in the dark.

651
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
The darkness that burned the earth

652
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
is still in the middle of the night.

653
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The abyss is sleeping.

654
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
The abyss is sleeping.

655
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
The abyss is sleeping.

656
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
The abyss is sleeping.

657
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I am still in the dark.

658
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
The darkness that burned the earth

659
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
is still in the middle of the night.

660
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

661
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I have been asking the world for thousands of years.

662
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

663
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Who is not following the fate of time?
