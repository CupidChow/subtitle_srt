00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,540
The price is 100,000 yuan.

8
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,540
Do you have a price?

9
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,540
Yes, 100,000 yuan, 900,000.

I'm so happy to see you.

30
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,540
The next one is 4 million yuan.

31
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,540
Look.

32
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,540
This is the big deal.

33
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,540
It's almost a big deal.

34
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,540
It's a big deal.

35
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,540
4 million yuan.

36
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,540
The first time.

37
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,540
4 million yuan.

38
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,540
The second time.

39
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,540
4 million yuan.

40
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,540
The last time.

41
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,540
Chen Jiang.

42
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,540
Congratulations to Mr. 888.

43
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,540
You're the winner.

44
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,540
The next one is

45
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,540
a very important one.

46
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,540
It's a famous brand.

47
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,540
It's a rare brand.

48
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,540
It's a rare brand.

49
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,540
It's a rare brand.

50
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,540
5 million yuan.

51
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,540
Is it possible?

52
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,540
It's so expensive.

53
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,540
It's a rare brand.

54
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,540
It's a rare brand.

55
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,540
It's a rare brand.

56
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,540
It's a rare brand.

57
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,540
It's a rare brand.

58
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,540
It's a rare brand.

59
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,540
8 million yuan.

60
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,540
8 million yuan.

61
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,540
The highest price is 8.

62
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,540
Is it 9 million yuan?

63
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,540
The first one is 9 million yuan.

64
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,540
9 million yuan.

65
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,540
Is it more expensive?

66
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,540
Is there any other idea?

67
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,540
9 million yuan.

68
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,540
The first time.

69
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,540
Ok.

70
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,540
It's 9.

71
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,540
Ok.

72
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,540
It's the first price of Mr. 888.

73
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,540
Is there any other idea?

74
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,540
Ok.

75
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,540
10 million yuan.

76
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,540
The first time.

77
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,540
10 million yuan.

78
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,540
The second time.

79
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,540
The last time.

80
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,540
Chen Jiang.

81
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,540
Zhou.

82
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,540
Congratulations.

83
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,540
You're so rich.

84
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,540
Look.

85
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,540
The most expensive one in this whole city is your life.

86
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,540
You're so funny.

87
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,540
Look.

88
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,540
I'm so rich.

89
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,540
I'm so small.

90
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,540
I don't have money.

91
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,540
I'm so rich.

92
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,540
Right?

93
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,540
If you have money, you can do it here.

94
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,540
I'm just doing business here.

95
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,540
Ok.

96
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,540
I'm so happy.

97
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,540
I'm so happy.

98
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,540
You're so good at reading.

99
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,540
Playing love songs.

100
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,540
Playing dragons.

101
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,540
Playing extraordinary.

102
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,540
Playing the法 has a strong sense of magic.

103
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,540
What I said in the case of adjustment.

104
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,540
is different from other ones.

105
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:09,540
But even the other ones are.</i Xiaohui,

106
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,540
Mr. Yan has an idea.

107
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,540
I will wonder about it.

108
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,540
I can't be considered a同行.

109
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,540
I'm a very lonely man.

110
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,540
Mr. Zhao, you've been training for a long time.

111
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,540
You're really a lonely man.

112
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,540
You're not used to it.

113
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,540
You've been so busy.

114
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,540
You've been so busy.

115
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,540
Mr. Zhao, you're really

116
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,540
a very good person.

117
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,540
Are you sure?

118
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,540
I'm sure.

119
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,540
I'm glad you're here.

120
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,540
You still have a lot to do.

121
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,540
I'm not going.

122
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,540
Okay.

123
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,540
Okay.

124
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,540
Goodbye.

125
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,540
Goodbye.

126
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,540
Goodbye.

127
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,540
Goodbye.

128
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,540
Mr. Zhao,

129
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,540
you've been so busy.

130
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,540
You're really a lonely man.

131
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,540
You're really a lonely man.

132
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,540
The higher the number,

133
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,540
the more I started to buy and sell.

134
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,540
You're so good at it.

135
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,540
You're not even a good guy.

136
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,540
I've been in the car of the guy.

137
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,540
I'm just here to see him.

138
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,540
Mr. Wang doesn't even have to send me to see him.

139
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,540
He's the only one who can buy and sell.

140
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,540
He's the only one who can't get us

141
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,540
to the bottom of the list.

142
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,540
Mr. Wang,

143
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,540
he's a good person.

144
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,540
Let's have the middle-aged man do the housework.

145
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,540
Ding Ma,

146
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,540
are you interested in

147
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,540
making some delivery from the wood?

148
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,540
Let's make some money together.

149
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,540
I'm also afraid of being sold.

150
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,540
But this money is really a good thing.

151
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,540
Yu Xin,

152
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,540
look.

153
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,540
When Song Ci was in the Song Dynasty,

154
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,540
he was very kind.

155
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,540
He didn't have a lot of value.

156
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,540
He would always be with him.

157
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,540
That is to say,

158
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,540
he couldn't get along with the wood.

159
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,540
He didn't have much money.

160
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,540
He was just going to buy and sell.

161
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,540
He was going to buy and sell.

162
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,540
Now,

163
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,540
Song Ci Feng is in the big business.

164
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,540
He doesn't have so many tools to buy.

165
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,540
He's the most important.

166
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,540
I'll keep it up for a few years.

167
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,540
We don't want to be like this.

168
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,540
We should bring the things.

169
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Look.

170
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,540
How much is it?

171
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,540
Old rule.

172
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,540
How much is the insurance?

173
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,540
200 yuan.

174
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,540
That's a lot.

175
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,540
At most, it's 100 yuan.

176
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,540
These things are sold by the bank.

177
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,540
You only have a price of 0.

178
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,540
You've seen a lot of things.

179
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,540
I'm sure you know it.

180
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,540
These years,

181
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,540
I've been with that boss as a friend.

182
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,540
I've always been unwilling to sell.

183
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,540
But my brothers are always making trouble.

184
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,540
They even got a document.

185
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,540
That's to give them a lot of money.

186
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,540
Everyone is a man of the word.

187
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,540
Okay.

188
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,540
I'll go to the bank.

189
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,540
I'll give you 20 yuan.

190
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,540
Okay?

191
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,540
What are you looking for?

192
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,540
200 yuan.

193
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,540
I've already given you the money.

194
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,540
What are you reading?

195
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
Bullshit.

196
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,840
God Da прибara ti communication

197
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,540
has been proven to be unsynthesized.

198
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,540
It's rare yet very dangerous.

199
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,540
They're so...

200
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,540
They've never held back.

201
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,420
With the possibility of having some

202
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,540
on zoned army,

203
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,540
SHORTOVAC MD

204
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,540
wouldn't have energy anywhere.

205
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,540
I've never heard of...

206
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,760
They are totally shameless toaces

207
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,620
Thanks for your reminder

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,780
But

209
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,320
Say itメ

210
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,720
To be honestI hated to see you

211
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,220
Walk

212
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,820
Why do i just see them?

213
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,100
In this 보� toca ring

214
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:19,380
Words in the

215
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,520
Hai

216
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
I think it's okay.

217
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
What?

218
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Did you find anything?

219
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,520
Not yet.

220
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
You didn't find anything new either.

221
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,520
Why waste your time on those stones?

222
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,520
You didn't study anything well.

223
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,520
Do you know which generation those stones are?

224
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
I don't know either.

225
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,520
We don't know about these.

226
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,520
How can we stop it from studying value?

227
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,520
I'm reminding you.

228
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
Don't be useless.

229
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
I know you're reminding me.

230
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,520
I'll show you my point of view.

231
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,520
These high-quality and uniformed boxes

232
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,520
are in a place that shouldn't be there.

233
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,520
You don't think it's weird, do you?

234
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,520
We haven't checked the water temperature on the sides.

235
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,520
We haven't checked all the things that are in the mess.

236
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
We'll tell them now that they're not okay.

237
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,520
No need to check.

238
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Do you think it's appropriate?

239
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Okay.

240
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,520
Then you can close the closed scene

241
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,520
and give me the work notes of Mr. Zan.

242
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
We'll go to the investigation tomorrow.

243
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
I haven't finished yet.

244
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
You're not going to investigate?

245
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,520
You're still standing there, not thinking?

246
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Mr. Luo, look.

247
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
You've been working at the field all these years.

248
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,520
Why are you so wild when you talk and take the floor?

249
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
You're a useless person.

250
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
I can't give you that.

251
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
Okay.

252
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
I don't care if you're at home

253
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
and you're just messing around.

254
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
Fine.

255
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
You're a piece of cake.

256
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
I have to show you this.

257
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Let me give you the work report.

258
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
Alright.

259
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,520
I'll be right back and help you with it.

260
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
We'll talk about this.

261
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Okay.

262
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
Please.

263
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Please.

264
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
Take care.

265
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Okay.

266
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
Thank you, sir.

267
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
See you tomorrow.

268
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
You've been so gone.

269
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Welcome.

270
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Thank you.

271
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Hmm,

272
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,020
What?

273
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,320
What are you asking?

274
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,020
You choose.

275
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,820
The stone in the well.

276
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,420
Have you seen it somewhere else?

277
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,220
Stone?

278
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,820
Yes.

279
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,320
No need.

280
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Then, when our teacher was living in your house,

281
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,020
did he ever take a stone?

282
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
What?

283
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,720
It's a long stone.

284
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,920
I can't imagine it.

285
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,520
It's okay. I'll just ask.

286
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,220
One, two, three.

287
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,820
Mom,

288
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,620
how about we wake up there?

289
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,020
I don't know.

290
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,220
Give it to me.

291
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,420
When our teacher was living in our house,

292
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,420
did he ever take a stone?

293
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,720
I don't remember.

294
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,220
You look like him.

295
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,620
It's been so long.

296
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,620
Who can remember me?

297
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,620
What's the relationship between the stone and our teacher?

298
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,420
Our teacher mentioned a stone in the notebook.

299
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,820
But it only says stone size.

300
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,020
Where did you get the stone?

301
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,220
No wonder you keep digging the notebook.

302
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,420
It's not a big deal.

303
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,220
When I got back to the garden,

304
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,020
your mouth was like a firewood.

305
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,620
It was like I was shooting.

306
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,020
I dare to heat you up.

307
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,220
Sorry.

308
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,220
Okay, okay.

309
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,620
I forgive you.

310
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,220
What should we do next?

311
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,420
I think

312
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,420
our teacher won't be so serious about a stone,

313
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,420
right?

314
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,420
I want to go to the police first.

315
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,420
Then, we can find another place.

316
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,420
We can find a similar stone.

317
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,220
It's best to check

318
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,620
where the stone in our teacher's hand is.

319
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,620
Fang Kun.

320
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,620
If you need any help, remember to call me.

321
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,220
I...

322
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,220
Teacher Luo.

323
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,220
I'm ready.

324
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,220
And this is for you.

325
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,220
What are you doing?

326
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Brother Kun, that's not for you.

327
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,220
What are you doing?

328
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,220
I'm giving him a gift.

329
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,820
What is he doing?

330
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,820
Give him a gift.

331
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,820
He's afraid of the sun.

332
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,220
But he's already sunken.

333
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,220
I've selected the route for this trip.

334
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,620
It's a village-wide unit.

335
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,220
How should we go?

336
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,220
We can go to the city of Ban Shi or Vizi.

337
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,220
If the building is big, we should go to Zhizi.

338
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,220
We should also live in a natural area

339
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,220
and go to the pit of the modern artificial area.

340
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,220
If we encounter a season or a fog,

341
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,220
we should measure the exact location of the fog.

342
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,220
Then, we should mark the location on the map.

343
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
Then, we should record the text.

344
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,220
Xiao Bai,

345
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,220
you should make a few more steps.

346
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,220
Then, you should be precise in the next step.

347
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,220
Your feet should be steady.

348
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,220
Your eyes should be sharp.

349
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,220
Keep an eye on them.

350
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,220
Okay, I got it.

351
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,220
Just like the question of the central area.

352
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,220
Look,

353
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,220
does this look like a map?

354
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,220
No, it doesn't.

355
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,220
There are no wooden and wooden

356
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,220
and wooden patterns.

357
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,220
It looks like a map.

358
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,220
Then, this kind of map

359
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,220
is not a map.

360
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,220
It's a map.

361
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,220
It looks like a map.

362
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,220
Then, what should we do?

363
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,220
I'm going to do it again.

364
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,220
You can't do it?

365
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,220
Little boy,

366
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
I've seen you before.

367
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,220
You've been here for years.

368
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,220
You're a good student.

369
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,220
You're very smart.

370
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,220
I've been doing this for so long.

371
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,220
You still remember me.

372
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,220
Why are you so close to this stone?

373
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,220
I'm going to kill you.

374
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,220
It's okay.

375
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,220
You're really close to this stone.

376
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,220
You've been here for so long.

377
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,220
You're going to kill me.

378
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,220
You're a big man.

379
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
You're a good student.

380
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
Then,

381
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
write something and draw something.

382
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,220
Go, go, go.

383
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,220
What are you going to do?

384
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,220
You're not going to do it.

385
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,220
Come.

386
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,220
You're a college student.

387
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,220
You're a researcher.

388
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,220
A researcher?

389
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,220
Then, you're a researcher.

390
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,220
You're a researcher.

391
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,220
You're a good student.

392
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,220
You're working as a state guard.

393
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,220
How much money do you earn a month?

394
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,220
That's it.

395
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,220
No matter how much money I earn,

396
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,220
if you find this stone somewhere else,

397
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,220
tell me.

398
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,220
I'll pay you.

399
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,220
Okay?

400
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
You're a good student.

401
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
How much money do you earn?

402
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,220
How much money do you earn?

403
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,220
I won't let you eat and drink.

404
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,220
Okay?

405
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,220
You're a good student.

406
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,220
You're a good student.

407
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,220
Right?

408
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,220
You're a good student.

409
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,220
Can you tell me

410
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,220
if the existence of the earth is

411
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,220
a sign of your destiny?

412
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,220
No, it's not.

413
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,220
It depends on the object.

414
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,220
The life is

415
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,220
or the second half of the life.

416
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,220
This is the final result.

417
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,220
Half of it.

418
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,220
Because sometimes

419
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,220
you can't get the accurate answer

420
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,220
by just finding it through the test.

421
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,220
Okay.

422
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,220
What's the difference between

423
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,220
traditional test investigation

424
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,220
and system investigation?

425
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,220
Traditional is...

426
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,220
Take a copy of the document

427
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,220
from the Han Taizong's database

428
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,220
to the old empress's database.

429
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,220
All the details are in the document.

430
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,220
You can use them

431
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,220
to get the results.

432
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,220
Okay.

433
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,220
I understand.

434
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,220
Professor Luo.

435
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,220
I'm sorry.

436
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,220
Did you take class?

437
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,220
What are you doing?

438
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,220
You're playing.

439
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,220
You've been doing well

440
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,220
when you came here.

441
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,220
You're so polite.

442
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,220
You're so naughty.

443
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,220
Can you be a little bit smaller?

444
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
Can you be a little bit smaller?

445
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,220
The study of science

446
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,220
must be studied in Tianye.

447
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,220
No matter the recovery

448
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,220
on the previous foundation

449
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,220
or the new investigation,

450
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,220
it must be done.

451
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,220
You sit here and let people play.

452
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,220
What do you look like?

453
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,220
Come.

454
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,220
No.

455
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,220
Let me sit here.

456
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Let me ask you something.

457
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,220
Tell us about the construction of the Han Taizong.

458
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,220
The Han family has been in a mess

459
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,220
and the economy is not well-off.

460
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,220
The Taizong family is old and well-off.

461
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,220
They have been living in Qingyang for a long time.

462
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,220
The economy and culture are recovering soon.

463
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
Later, the capital

464
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,220
has been re-established.

465
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,220
The economy and culture

466
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,220
have been developing rapidly.

467
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,220
This period is considered

468
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,220
a period

469
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,220
in which the economy and culture

470
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,220
are developing rapidly in China.

471
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,220
It's a mess.

472
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,220
Look at the people playing.

473
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,220
This is the foundation.

474
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,220
Culture is common sense.

475
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,220
Let me ask you.

476
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,220
Why is the Han Dynasty

477
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,220
in the 50s?

478
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,220
Why is the Taizong

479
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
buried in the White House?

480
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
The ancient people

481
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,220
said that the rule of law

482
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,220
was to re-establish the system of the desert.

483
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
They couldn't build it.

484
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,220
The Taizong family

485
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,220
is the younger brother of the emperor.

486
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,220
He was the first to become the emperor

487
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,220
in the past.

488
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,220
If he was buried in the Wulin Garden

489
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,220
with his brothers and father,

490
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,220
he would be in a mess.

491
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,220
Excellent.

492
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,220
You are so excellent.

493
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,220
If he had only one point,

494
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,220
he would have only one point.

495
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220
Hurry up and read it.

496
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,220
Don't let him affect you.

497
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,220
You are so slow.

498
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,220
Really slow.

499
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
Okay, teacher Luo, take care.

500
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,220
Sit.

501
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,220
Sit.

502
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,220
Sit.

503
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,220
You can sit here.

504
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,220
Teacher Luo is this person.

505
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,220
Look at him.

506
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,220
He is like this every day.

507
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,220
He is like this to me too.

508
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,220
He is very difficult to find.

509
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,220
Let me tell you.

510
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,220
He is very normal.

511
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,220
He can't communicate without permission.

512
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,220
He has no voice.

513
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,220
How long has he been with him?

514
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,220
There is no way.

515
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,220
I can't walk.

516
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,220
You are right.

517
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,220
I want to be like you.

518
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,220
I can walk.

519
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,220
Where are you going?

520
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,220
I mean, Teacher Luo is right.

521
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,220
I am just a part of it.

522
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,220
Fengjia's house is in the middle of the road.

523
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,220
Let's talk.

524
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,220
Recently,

525
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,220
a big skin has appeared in the clothing store.

526
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,220
Song Ci is in a very bad condition.

527
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,220
The market in the house

528
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,220
is not so good

529
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,220
as Song Ci's.

530
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
The whole house

531
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,220
has been sent by the police.

532
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,220
Next,

533
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,220
the mission of the MGM team

534
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,220
is to check the market

535
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,220
and cooperate with the tea.

536
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,220
The salt house has a head-to-head

537
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,220
and a place to go to eat.

538
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,220
The tail of the tail is sent by Song Ci.

539
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,220
Dad,

540
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,220
is this the place

541
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,220
where you live next?

542
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,220
Yes.

543
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,220
Can we go back?

544
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,220
We can't go back.

545
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,220
Dad,

546
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,220
can we go back?

547
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,220
Yes.

548
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,220
Come with me.

549
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,220
Okay.

550
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,220
The next day

551
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,220
The next stage.

552
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,220
Okay.

553
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,220
Please scan it.

554
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
Okay. Thank you.

555
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,220
Boss Shen.

556
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,220
Brother Si.

557
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,220
I'm the assistant of the director,

558
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,220
Wen Yuheng.

559
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,220
Mr. Wen,

560
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,220
please.

561
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,220
Please.

562
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,220
Okay.

563
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220
Today,

564
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,220
the director is not free for now.

565
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,220
What's the matter?

566
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,220
Si,

567
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,220
we've been

568
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,220
collecting some items recently.

569
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,220
We've got a lot of stuff

570
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
to store in the house.

571
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,220
I wonder

572
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,220
if we can wait

573
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,220
for the director to open the shop.

574
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,220
Look at what you said.

575
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,220
Boss Mu is very generous.

576
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,220
It must be a good thing.

577
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,220
If you don't mind,

578
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,220
can I have a look?

579
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,220
Sure.

580
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,220
My question.

581
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,220
Wei Mingxuan.

582
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,220
Mr. Meng.

583
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,220
Your joke is a bit too much.

584
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,220
You are not

585
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,220
an antique,

586
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
but a cultural item.

587
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,220
You saw it.

588
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,220
Every product in our

589
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,220
Mingde Museum

590
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,220
has its identity and its origin.

591
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,220
You are not familiar with

592
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,220
these things.

593
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,220
I don't dare to say.

594
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,220
I'm sorry.

595
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,220
I'm sorry.

596
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,220
I'm sorry.

597
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,220
I'm sorry.

598
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,220
I see.

599
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,220
I won't bother you.

600
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,220
I'll give you a ride.

601
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,220
No need to be polite.

602
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,220
Our Mingde Museum used to be a wooden house.

603
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
Have you heard of

604
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,220
the wooden house in Qin Chuan?

605
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,220
Not much.

606
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,220
The name of this museum

607
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,220
is written on the back of

608
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,220
the Mingde Museum.

609
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,220
It's written with

610
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,220
ancient history.

611
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,220
The cultural item is clear

612
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,220
when you go out.

613
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,220
I don't accept these things.

614
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,220
Qin Chuan people

615
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,220
have heard of it.

616
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,220
They have

617
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,220
built a business house

618
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,220
over the years.

619
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,220
They even built a four-story house.

620
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,220
It's a rich country.

621
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,220
The wooden house people

622
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,220
like antique too.

623
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,220
So they have

624
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,220
many kinds of items.

625
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,220
When we were in the building

626
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,220
and the house was built,

627
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,220
we were lucky to have some.

628
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,220
I don't want

629
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,220
to lose my family.

630
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,220
Mr. Mu, this way, please.

631
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,220
That way.

632
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,220
That way.

633
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,220
This way.

634
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,220
Okay.

635
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,220
Come and take a look.

636
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,220
This is

637
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,220
the most beautiful

638
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,220
in the world.

639
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,220
Brother,

640
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,220
this is the 8th floor.

641
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,220
Song Daddy,

642
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,220
and Ruyao.

643
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,220
They are very close to here.

644
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,220
You can look at it.

645
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,220
It's not just a real painting.

646
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,220
You don't need to do that.

647
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,220
This is the real Song Ci.

648
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,220
I'll give you a discount.

649
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,220
I'm from the Wenwu Group.

650
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,220
You just built a painting.

651
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,220
It's all in the box.

652
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,220
You made this

653
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,220
in the warehouse.

654
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,220
Brother,

655
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,220
Brother,

656
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,220
are you kidding me?

657
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,220
Who is kidding you?

658
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,220
I made it in the warehouse.

659
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,220
I'll show you the real painting.

660
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,220
This is a piece of art.

661
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,220
Look.

662
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,220
It's the same as the first one.

663
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,220
Really?

664
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,220
I'll show you the real painting.

665
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,220
Brother,

666
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,220
look.

667
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,220
Look.

668
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,220
This is the real painting.

669
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,220
Look.

670
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,220
It's the same as the first one.

671
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,220
Okay.

672
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,220
Let's do it again.

673
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,220
Okay.

674
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,220
Brother, come back.

675
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,220
Come back.

676
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
The people in the police team

677
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,220
are looking at you.

678
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,220
I heard

679
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,220
that it's Song Ci.

680
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,220
Song Ci is a big fan.

681
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,220
I'm going to the police team

682
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,220
to see if he's here.

683
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,220
Brother,

684
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,220
we need to do something.

685
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,220
The more we think about it,

686
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,220
the more we can't ignore it.

687
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,220
Even Song Ci doesn't want to be a fan.

688
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,220
Okay.

689
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,220
Who is it?

690
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,220
You're still working here at night?

691
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,220
Isn't this Mr. Luo?

692
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,220
What's wrong?

693
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,220
What's the matter?

694
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,220
Nothing.

695
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,220
I'm here to see you.

696
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,220
This is a rare painting.

697
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,220
What are you looking at?

698
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,220
I'm here to see the data.

699
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,220
I haven't seen anything.

700
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,220
That's your painting.

701
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,220
Show me.

702
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,220
Okay.

703
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,220
Let's see what Mr. Luo does.

704
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,220
Let's make a deal.

705
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,220
Come.

706
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,220
Okay.

707
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
It's more than two points for Xiao Bai.

708
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,220
It's more than one.

709
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,220
Okay.

710
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,220
Two points is also a point.

711
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,220
It's not easy to get Mr. Luo's approval.

712
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,220
Thank you.

713
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,220
The one you want to thank is not me.

714
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,220
It's Mr. Zhan.

715
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,220
If it wasn't for him,

716
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,220
your painting skills

717
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,220
might not even be as good as Xiao Bai's.

718
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,220
I admit it.

719
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,220
Don't sit on the ground.

720
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,220
It's cold on the ground.

721
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,220
Here.

722
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,220
What?

723
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,220
Any progress?

724
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,220
No progress yet.

725
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,220
No progress yet.

726
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,220
You said Mr. Zhan

727
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,220
has been gone for so many years.

728
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,220
You left a message for us.

729
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,220
You remember that

730
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,220
why Du Ling Village is called Du Ling?

731
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,220
Because of a contract,

732
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,220
you made us suffer a lot.

733
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,220
I don't know what these stones mean.

734
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,220
What do you mean?

735
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,220
Why are you

736
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,220
so strict now?

737
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,220
You're getting older.

738
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,220
I'm not that strict.

739
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,220
You said I'm against Xiao Bai.

740
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,220
You're wasting your time.

741
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,220
What do you want him to learn?

742
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,220
I just want him to know

743
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,220
that this is a job.

744
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,220
It's a job that's hard to do.

745
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,220
It's even boring.

746
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,220
There's no such thing as a snowy moon.

747
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,220
It's not beautiful.

748
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,220
It's not romantic.

749
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,220
It's just that

750
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,220
he has to think about

751
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,220
the most difficult and most unpleasant aspect.

752
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
If he can accept it,

753
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,220
he'll stay and do it.

754
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,220
If he can't,

755
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,220
he'll just make it up.

756
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,220
I'm not that strict.

757
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,220
I don't think

758
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,220
you're right.

759
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,220
I think this thing

760
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,220
is still a bit of a nuisance.

761
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,220
You want to go to the school

762
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,220
and sing songs every day

763
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,220
to go to the playground?

764
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,220
It's so romantic.

765
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,220
There's a farm over there.

766
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,220
You still remember

767
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,220
Guo Shilin, the farm of the old man.

768
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,220
The wishful side.

769
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,220
We're all people.

770
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,220
We ride a car

771
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,220
and chase the sunset

772
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,220
on the wishful side.

773
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,220
We're all people.

774
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,220
We're all people.

775
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,220
It's not romantic.

776
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,220
You're still a

777
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,220
idealist for all these years.

778
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,220
You think like that.

779
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,220
It doesn't mean that others think like that.

780
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,220
I can't represent

781
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,220
the mainstream of this industry.

782
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,220
Then I've already

783
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,220
transferred to the outside world.

784
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,220
When I was just graduating,

785
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,220
I could rely on my idealism

786
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,220
and romance.

787
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,220
Isn't it romantic?

788
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,220
When I'm back from the festival,

789
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,220
I'll have to be re-elected by reality.

790
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,220
What about you?

791
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,220
You're the only one

792
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,220
who stays in the youth.

793
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,220
What's your intention?

794
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,220
Guo Shilin asked me this question.

795
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,220
I told him

796
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,220
because of my idealism.

797
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,220
It's not the whole story.

798
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,220
Because I didn't know

799
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,220
how to answer that question.

800
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,220
But I have an answer now.

801
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,220
A few years ago,

802
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,220
I came to the capital

803
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,220
in the west of the country.

804
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,220
I couldn't leave

805
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
just because I was walking.

806
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,220
I couldn't leave.

807
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,220
I couldn't leave.

808
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,220
I couldn't leave.

809
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,220
I really think

810
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,220
I'm a little bit shy.

811
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,220
Because I can say

812
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,220
in a word

813
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
that I've left

814
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,220
the name of the country

815
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,220
on the World Cultural Heritage.

816
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,220
I've worked.

817
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,220
I've been worth it.

818
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,220
I'll cry if you say more.

819
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,220
Okay.

820
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,220
I have to go.

821
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,220
Mo Shilin.

822
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,220
Luo.

823
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,220
Mo Shilin.

824
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,220
Luo.

825
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,220
What's that?

826
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,220
It's Xiumiao.

827
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,220
I saw it.

828
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,220
Mo Shilin.

829
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,220
Look.

830
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
Yes.

831
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,220
Look at you.

832
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,220
You're so yellow.

833
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,220
You're so yellow.

834
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,220
I can't stand this.

835
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,220
Are you sure this is

836
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,220
a real world?

837
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,220
North Song,

838
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,220
Khaiguo,

839
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,220
Dajiang,

840
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,220
Miao Guangyi,

841
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,220
and Laojia.

842
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,220
I've been watching them

843
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,220
all day.

844
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,220
It's all related to Xiumiao.

845
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,220
I've been looking for this place

846
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,220
for a long time.

847
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,220
If I hadn't been his mother,

848
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,220
I wouldn't have been here.

849
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,220
Don't make a fuss about it.

850
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,220
Let's just let it go.

851
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,220
What?

852
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,220
Nothing.

853
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,220
Take your time.

854
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,220
You're holding something.

855
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,220
What's your motivation?

856
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,220
It's just a little.

857
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,220
It's all about the drug.

858
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,220
You know the drug.

859
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,220
The market is so poor.

860
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,220
What's the use of drug?

861
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,220
Look at the color.

862
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,220
It's like a bullet.

863
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,220
It's all about the motivation.

864
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,220
The drug is the anti-aging agent.

865
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,220
It's so good.

866
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,220
There's a word.

867
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,220
Look at the word.

868
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,220
Miao Xun Zi Guangyi.

869
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,220
He's a famous Chinese.

870
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,220
He's a famous Chinese.

871
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,220
Chen...

872
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,220
Chen Qiao Bingbian.

873
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,220
He's a famous Chinese.

874
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,220
He's a famous Chinese.

875
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,220
He's a famous Chinese.

876
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,220
He's a famous Chinese.

877
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,220
He's a famous Chinese.

878
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,220
He can be called the emperor of Chao dynasty.

879
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,220
boss.

880
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
Miao Xun Wei.

881
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,220
He's a famous Chinese.

882
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,220
He's a famous Chinese.

883
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,220
年...

884
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,220
Jae.

885
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,220
Doesn't he know Jae?

886
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,220
He's a famous Chinese.

887
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,220
Chloe of 다음에 Oet泰,

888
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,220
That is about the 12th capital impact.

889
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,220
What's the meaning?

890
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,220
It's an approximate thing.

891
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,620
I owe you a favor.

892
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,020
Yu, the emperor's son-in-law,

893
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,820
the emperor's son-in-law.

894
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,620
But it's not me who owes Yu.

895
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,020
My brother.

896
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,220
You see,

897
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,420
Miao Guangyu is the one who is the chief of the design.

898
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,220
Zhao Kuangyin is the one who gave him the letter.

899
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,020
It's not his mother. It's his mother.

900
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,620
Did you send it to him?

901
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:22,620
All right.

902
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,820
Let's start the wedding.

903
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,220
You want it?

904
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,220
I'm a great god.

905
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,420
I'll keep it for you.

906
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,020
You don't have a way.

907
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,220
I'll help you.

908
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,220
Songci is very ambitious now.

909
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,820
The elite of Songci is Lu Yao.

910
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,820
How do you do it?

911
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,420
Half.

912
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,420
I'll kill you.

913
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,420
You say.

914
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,220
Yes.

915
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,220
You say you can do it.

916
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,620
You see, you do it.

917
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,020
You're better than a bad demon.

918
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,220
You can do it.

919
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,420
You can do it.

920
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,620
You can do it.

921
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,220
Five.

922
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,420
All right. I'll get you the money.

923
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,420
It's all right.

924
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,620
Why?

925
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,420
I want to choose the gold.

926
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,820
It's so hot.

927
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,020
I can't believe you.

928
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,820
You're so good.

929
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,820
Sister, you've been working for two years.

930
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,620
You're so good.

931
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,620
You're so good.

932
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,820
I'll give you a discount.

933
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,620
It's so hard.

934
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,420
All right.

935
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,020
I'll get you the gold.

936
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,420
I'll get you the gold.

937
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,620
Thank you, brother-in-law.

938
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,220
I can't believe you.

939
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,420
I'll give you the gold.

940
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,620
I heard that Songci has been promoted recently.

941
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,820
Is it a legal money?

942
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,420
What?

943
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,420
Do you want to make a fortune?

944
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,020
You're so good.

945
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,420
You're so filial.

946
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,820
You're so good.

947
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,820
You're so good.

948
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,220
You're a good man.

949
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,420
You're so good.

950
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,220
Where are you going?

951
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,820
I'm not going to die.

952
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,220
How much?

953
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,420
I'll give you a discount.

954
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,020
I'll give you a discount.

955
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,820
This is the first one.

956
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,420
Look carefully.

957
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,420
Where's the first one?

958
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,820
I'll give you a discount.

959
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,620
I'll give you a discount.

960
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,220
I'll give you a discount.

961
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,220
I'll give you a discount.

962
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,420
Why are you so good?

963
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,220
I'll give you a discount.

964
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,820
I've never seen you before.

965
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,220
I've never seen you before.

966
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,620
You look so good.

967
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,420
You look so good.

968
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,820
Is it expensive?

969
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,820
It's so good to have some more years as time passes.

970
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:02,420
I even get stuck in canceled комп Schulds.

971
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,620
So what?

972
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,020
partition cigarettes?

973
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,020
What?

974
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,500
It's nothing.

975
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,020
What's happened?

976
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,620
What are you talking about?

977
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,620
I can't stand it.

978
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,620
I can't stand it.

979
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,620
These are all meat.

980
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,620
Open it.

981
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,620
No, no, no.

982
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,620
It's your fault.

983
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,620
You can't do that.

984
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,620
I can't stand it.

985
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,620
I'll teach you a lesson.

986
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,620
Open it.

987
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,620
Si Zhu, you give us five.

988
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,620
You're making fun of me.

989
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,620
When I was a kid,

990
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,620
I could still beat the fat.

991
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,620
I'm so good at it.

992
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,620
But the fat is not enough.

993
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,620
I can't stand it.

994
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,620
I can't stand it.

995
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,620
Why don't you try?

996
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,620
I really can't.

997
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,620
This time,

998
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,620
you can teach the king of Huanan.

999
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,620
He knows.

1000
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,620
I'm teaching you today.

1001
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,620
Open it.

1002
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,620
Look carefully.

1003
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,620
What are you doing?

1004
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,620
What do you mean?

1005
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,620
You said you had a gift.

1006
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,620
I came to see you.

1007
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,620
You brought a crafty one.

1008
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,620
You're perfect.

1009
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,620
What crafty one?

1010
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,620
You drew a hundred thousands of words.

1011
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,620
You drew it yourself from the mall.

1012
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,620
You're just like a duck.

1013
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,620
You're the gift you got from the mall?

1014
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,620
What do you mean?

1015
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,620
You're the gift you got from the mall?

1016
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,620
How can you say that?

1017
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,620
I didn't get any from the mall.

1018
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,620
I got it from the duck.

1019
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,620
I can get it from the mall.

1020
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,620
I can't eat anything.

1021
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,620
I'm so sorry.

1022
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,620
You should go home and ask your brother-in-law.

1023
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,620
Okay?

1024
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,620
You've seen it.

1025
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,620
You're the gift you got from the mall.

1026
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,620
You're so cheap.

1027
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,620
You asked me to write you a letter.

1028
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,620
You know that you got the gift from the mall?

1029
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,620
You must know that.

1030
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,620
Look at the color.

1031
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,620
It's so nice.

1032
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,620
What are you doing?

1033
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,620
Why are you laughing?

1034
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,620
If you don't want to go,

1035
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,620
I'll do it for others.

1036
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,620
Boss,

1037
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,620
be careful when you come to our business.

1038
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:24,620
You must ask the truth and find the truth.

1039
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,620
You're right.

1040
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,620
You don't believe that I'm a real person.

1041
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,620
I'll think about it again.

1042
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,620
Look at the letter.

1043
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,620
It's a letter from Zhao Kuang Yi.

1044
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,620
He wrote it himself.

1045
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,620
It's from Miao Guang Yi.

1046
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,620
Think about it.

1047
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,620
You're so cheap.

1048
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,620
You're so cheap.

1049
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,620
You should go home and ask him the truth.

1050
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,620
You'll know.

1051
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,620
Okay?

1052
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,620
Bye.

1053
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:44,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1054
00:44:44,620 --> 00:45:14,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1055
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,040
I
