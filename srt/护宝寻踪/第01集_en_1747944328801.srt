But that doesn't mean that they automatically belong to you.

146
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
By your logic, does it mean that you can claim ownership of any item in our auction related to China?

147
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Blue and white Rui earways, which is dated back to the Qianlong period of the Qin dynasty.

148
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The shape, decorative patterns and inscriptions showcase the exquisite craftsmanship

149
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and its cultural heritage of porcelain production in the Qin dynasty.

150
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Hello, is this the Jin Yue Hotel in Beijing?

151
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I would like to ask if Professor Zan Maochang from the University of Qinbei has been admitted?

152
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Okay, thank you.

153
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No.

154
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If we keep causing trouble, we will be in a state of emergency.

155
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Will the emergency be delayed for the first year?

156
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Do you have other experts at your archaeological site?

157
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
No, it's like this.

158
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Isn't there a recent Qin Han Archaeological Research Conference in Beijing?

159
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Almost all the experts we can go to have been there.

160
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Wang Jun, if you want me to call the city and ask if there are any people who can still be found?

161
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Actually, we can answer these three questions.

162
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Do you know how big this is?

163
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Can you do your job in the city now?

164
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't care about friends in the city.

165
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Do you know that if you answer the wrong question,

166
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
those six black peaches will not come back?

167
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
This is a tough question to ask.

168
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Anyway, you have 20 minutes.

169
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The decision is yours.

170
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Hello?

171
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Hello?

172
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Professor Zan.

173
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Sir, I believe it is necessary to remind you

174
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
that there is only half an hour left before the auction of those six black pottery figurines.

175
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Wang Jun, Mr. You, the three of them are excellent.

176
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You can trust them with this matter.

177
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
We won't wait for anyone.

178
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Hurry up.

179
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Feng Kun, I'll be waiting for you by the phone.

180
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
There must be no mistake in this matter.

181
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Turn on the computer.

182
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay.

183
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Luo Qing, check the information about the excavation of the Yangling external pit and the burial tomb.

184
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:13,540
There are many ways to use the Yangling

185
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
external pit.

186
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Please take a closer look.

187
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
As you can see, the female and male forms are very obvious.

188
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
As well as the facial expressions, they are really realistic.

189
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This is a high-class artistic object and is considered to be a burial object as well.

190
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
These cultural relics are royal, spiritual, and burial objects.

191
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
These loquets should have been used by the Zhuo Yi clan.

192
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The price for lot number 32 is starting at $800.

193
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Please raise your pedals for bidding.

194
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
$800.

195
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
$850 here.

196
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
$900.

197
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The price for lot number 32 is starting at $800.

198
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000

199
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
$800.

200
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
$850 here.

201
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
$900.

202
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The first one was discovered in the Yangling area of the Hanjing area.

203
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The largest number, the most complete type, and the male and female forms are all there.

204
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Different characters are also found.

205
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The second one was discovered in the 80s in the Xuan area of the Western Han.

206
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The number is not as large as the Yangling area.

207
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The third one was discovered in the 80s and later in the Maoling area of the Hanwu area.

208
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The fourth one was discovered in the 90s in the southwest of the Changlin area of the Han High Group.

209
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But there are only male and female forms.

210
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The fifth one was discovered in the Ba Cunpu area of the northwest of the Han Chang'an city.

211
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The inspection room discovered the loquets, taoyong, and silk.

212
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Later, archaeologists discovered the production of loquets in the Ba Cunpu area.

213
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And also some unsold loquets.

214
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
How many times have you done it?

215
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The fifth time.

216
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The fifth time?

217
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
How can I remember there were six times?

218
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Where is the sixth time?

219
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The sixth time is...

220
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Ladies and gentlemen, are there any higher bid for the lot number 32?

221
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
$1500.

222
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The King of Liang, the Queen of Liang.

223
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The King of Liang's information.

224
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
This is the only information.

225
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's in Mangshan, Henan.

226
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The King of Liang, Mangshan.

227
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay.

228
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I got it.

229
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Mr. Manager, may I use your computer for a little while?

230
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Just a moment.

231
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Sir, please take a look.

232
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
If you have any question, I would like to explain it for you.

233
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
$1600.

234
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Are there any higher bids?

235
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And it goes $1600.

236
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Once, $1600.

237
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Twice.

238
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Wait.

239
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Dear ladies and gentlemen, I'm very sorry to inform you that the bid is over.

240
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Dear ladies and gentlemen, I'm very sorry to inform you that the auction for lot 32 is temporarily suspended.

241
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Mr. Hong, come here.

242
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What's up?

243
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Let's go.

244
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Mr. Hong, come here.

245
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Mr. Hong, I'm here to buy flowers for you.

246
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Okay.

247
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Let me have a look.

248
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'll do it.

249
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Where did you get this?

250
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You can keep it for us.

251
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Keep it in the shop.

252
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Is it a problem?

253
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Come on, Mr. Hong.

254
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'll buy you a lot.

255
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Here.

256
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Keep a look at the flowers.

257
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Okay.

258
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Go ahead.

259
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
How is it?

260
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's good.

261
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's a little bit red.

262
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's a little bit light.

263
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's a good work.

264
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This is a piece of work that's been passed down from the Yuan Dynasty.

265
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Do you know how to read the Luo Shen Wen Tongjing?

266
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
If you want to make a mistake, you have to make a mistake.

267
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Either you are a modern person or you are a person.

268
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
This Tongjing is a wine made by the Qing Dynasty to put in the Yuan Dynasty.

269
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's made of the essence of the tea.

270
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You're so good at it.

271
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You're so bad at it.

272
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't know if you understand it or not.

273
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
If I make a mistake, you can come to me anytime.

274
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:52,980
My

275
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Thank you.

276
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll eat later.

277
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Okay.

278
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What do you say?

279
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Give money.

280
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
People say that the dead make money.

281
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm a bad person.

282
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Don't believe it.

283
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Who wants to say that Lao Mu is not trustworthy?

284
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Why is this man trustworthy?

285
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Lao Mu read a lot.

286
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You put something here today.

287
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Is it rare or is it easy to understand?

288
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
He read it all for you.

289
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Come and take a look.

290
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What?

291
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What?

292
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Brother Song, I've been with you for years.

293
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I've done the Pei Xingqi thing.

294
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
If it's really that I can't do it, why do I have to go back?

295
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll report it to you when I get back.

296
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'll report it to you.

297
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'll just run away with the stuff.

298
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That's right.

299
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You have to say that you want to be a self-reliant.

300
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm drunk.

301
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm out there.

302
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I really don't have the heart to go out.

303
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm going to go.

304
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Who do you think is the murderer?

305
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't know.

306
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Do you know our rules?

307
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I know.

308
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The dead have to be killed.

309
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
The body is buried in the ground.

310
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The body is buried in the ground.

311
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I don't know.

312
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You don't give up?

313
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Then what do I do?

314
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Or I'll do it as a dead man.

315
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
One by one.

316
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's right.

317
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Then sit here.

318
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
All right?

319
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Come on, let's go.

320
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You get the bottom.

321
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You go first.

322
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Brother Sheng, you go that way.

323
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Hurry up.

324
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Brother Sheng, I'm wronged.

325
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Hu Wen, you're angry.

326
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Brother Sheng.

327
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Brother Shu.

328
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You haven't finished yet.

329
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You're not lucky enough to rob the farmer's gang.

330
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'll get our fortune.

331
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Brother Sheng.

332
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes, yes, yes.

333
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
This is right.

334
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The New Year can't be a bad thing.

335
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
We can't be unlucky.

336
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yes, yes, yes.

337
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yes.

338
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But it's been 23 years.

339
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Let's eat first.

340
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Eat, eat, Brother Sheng.

341
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Eat, eat, eat.

342
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I can't let him go.

343
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm talking about you.

344
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I can't afford to be angry.

345
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
If I die,

346
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
this meal should be a celebration.

347
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The place on the source

348
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
was bought by Shusheng for 150,000.

349
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Once it's done,

350
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
we'll have a meal.

351
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Brother Shou will have to spend a year.

352
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What's the use of Shou?

353
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
No, no.

354
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm not going to eat.

355
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm not going to eat.

356
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm not going to eat.

357
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm not going to eat.

358
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Shusheng is a country.

359
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
There's something I can't say.

360
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
But everyone eats in the same pot.

361
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's our own brother.

362
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm the chief today.

363
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I prepared a meal.

364
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Old Mu.

365
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
What do you mean?

366
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
We are the local people.

367
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
We can't break the rules.

368
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Shusheng is a mountain.

369
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Don't let everyone spy.

370
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You have to remember this.

371
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Qin Chuan and Sichang

372
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
keep secrets.

373
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The internal cabinet will be made later.

374
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What are you waiting for?

375
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Eat.

376
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm going to the office.

377
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Report the price.

378
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Don't lose the price.

379
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Don't lose?

380
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
The business with you,

381
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Qin Chuan's big fruit, big growth.

382
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'm a nobody in this industry.

383
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You must have never heard of it.

384
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
But I've always known you.

385
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I know a lot of people.

386
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But there are only a few people who can find me.

387
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
How did you get him?

388
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Uncle Liu.

389
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You did business with him.

390
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It has nothing to do with Lu Shusheng.

391
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It doesn't matter what relationship I have with him.

392
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I came to do this business with you.

393
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
This is for the royal family.

394
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's the black one.

395
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You don't have to touch my wound.

396
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm sorry.

397
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I was beaten in front of the government.

398
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You have seen it.

399
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You must know the weight of this thing.

400
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
How much?

401
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Two times more.

402
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
How much?

403
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
One thousand.

404
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Six hundred.

405
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Six hundred is six hundred.

406
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The show is great.

407
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I came with a shirt.

408
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I know you, King of South China.

409
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But I can only ask for one hundred.

410
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
One hundred?

411
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yes.

412
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It doesn't matter if you don't agree.

413
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You can find someone else.

414
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
My mother.

415
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It doesn't matter if the thing is good or not.

416
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
One hundred.

417
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
She went to Sichang to sleep.

418
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
She made it.

419
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
There is still next time.

420
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
If it doesn't work, I owe you a favor.

421
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'll wait for you to be careful.

422
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Even if someone else wants it, I won't sell it.

423
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Okay.

424
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I think that old man is deliberately messing with us.

425
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Making up the room, organizing the room.

426
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Is this what the department should do?

427
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Why waste time on our students?

428
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
How can this be a waste of time?

429
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Education in this department is the basic training.

430
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Professional skills must be learned in further development.

431
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I don't remember.

432
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm going to work in the field.

433
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Do you have a skill in drawing these things?

434
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
If you can accept that you can't draw better than a skill in the field,

435
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
you are like this.

436
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's this.

437
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Let me learn what kind of talent our high-class students are.

438
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Okay.

439
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You have a high-class skill.

440
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Communicate.

441
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Come on, put the horse here.

442
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I don't dare to be.

443
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Okay.

444
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It looks like you.

445
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But is it okay if the drawing is like this?

446
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I think you came here for a short time.

447
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Let me give you a simple copy of what our teacher Zan usually tells us.

448
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Listen carefully.

449
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Look, look at your eyes.

450
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Look at Mr. Zhang's drawing of Jiang Zai.

451
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's a very standard drawing of the archaeology.

452
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's primitive.

453
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It's life-changing and fun.

454
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Look at this drawing.

455
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What's wrong?

456
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It's cold and like winter.

457
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You said Mr. Zhang is the best in archaeology in China.

458
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Can I compare with him?

459
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
What are you standing up for?

460
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
What are you standing up for in class?

461
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Sit down.

462
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
If you don't draw like you, you'll learn.

463
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Can't you draw for two months if you don't draw well for a month?

464
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
If you can't draw well for two months, you can draw for a year.

465
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You can only draw until you're good.

466
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Teacher Zan.

467
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I have something to say.

468
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Luo Qing, Shilin.

469
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You guys clean up and give me a task.

470
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Teacher Zan, what task?

471
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Not far from the Yangling, we found a tomb of a thief.

472
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
The Cultural and Cultural Affairs Bureau asked us to do a rescue discovery as soon as possible.

473
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Okay, let's clean up and go.

474
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
What are you doing?

475
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Let's go.

476
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
This drawing is not only artistic,

477
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
but also the most basic scientific.

478
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Okay, you stay and continue drawing.

479
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
If you can't draw well for a month, you can draw for two months.

480
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
If you can't draw well for two months, you can draw for a year.

481
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You can only draw until you're good.

482
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Luo Qing has only been here for half a month.

483
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Why can't he go and I can't go?

484
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
He's better than you.

485
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I've been drawing well.

486
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Look at my hands.

487
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
These scissors are all evidence of hard work.

488
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
The effort that didn't take much effort is useless.

489
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Teacher Zan, do you have any objections to me?

490
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I have objections to you.

491
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Look at it yourself.

492
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You've been drawing for eight months and you've drawn like this.

493
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
What are you thinking about all morning?

494
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm a good person.

495
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Xing Zhi.

496
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Why are you here?

497
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Come, come, come, come with me.

498
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
What are you talking about?

499
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You're so stubborn.

500
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You've hit me with your attention.

501
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
What's wrong with you?

502
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You mean the pain?

503
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You're a man who studies love.

504
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Your hands are so deep that they're touching the ground.

505
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Xing Zhi.

506
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
How can Tang Mu say that it has nothing to do with me?

507
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Think about his position.

508
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
How close is it to our Yanglin?

509
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
His research information

510
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
has helped us to study the historical location of Yanglin.

511
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Zan Maochang.

512
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
These words are good for outsiders.

513
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I know your uncle.

514
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Your Yanglin research is short of funds.

515
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Take Tang Mu's work of rescue discovery.

516
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
There's no problem with the money.

517
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Right?

518
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I can't hide anything from you.

519
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Xing Zhi, this is it.

520
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Just do me a favor this time.

521
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You see, this time you found out that

522
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
you are the leader of the provincial council.

523
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
How good is it?

524
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Then let me and these kids

525
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
give you a good start.

526
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Master, you sit there.

527
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'll help you with the little things.

528
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'll help you.

529
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
How about it?

530
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You're back.

531
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yes, I'm back.

532
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Come on.

533
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm back.

534
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You're back.

535
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You should eat first.

536
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
The food is on the stove.

537
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
No hurry.

538
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I've already made the moon.

539
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'll make you a bowl of porridge first.

540
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm back.

541
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I'm sick.

542
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm so tired.

543
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Next year,

544
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
we'll move into a big house.

545
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
We'll build a sunroom

546
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and sunbathe every day.

547
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Is there money for the house?

548
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
No, no.

549
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Even others can get a house.

550
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
We can do it too.

551
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Where did you go today?

552
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Can I go there again?

553
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm selling goods.

554
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You're crazy.

555
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm a man.

556
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You don't know.

557
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You're crazy.

558
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm crazy.

559
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I should have sold you a pillow.

560
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Look.

561
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You and You Si.

562
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'll call you directly.

563
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Where did you get the money?

564
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I left it there.

565
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Do me a favor.

566
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
There's something in the bed.

567
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Take it out.

568
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
What is it?

569
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I found a little money.

570
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm going to give it to the kids.

571
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm going to give it to the kids.

572
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I got it from the countryside.

573
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You're lying.

574
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm not lying.

575
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I've already

576
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
suffered a lot.

577
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I don't have money to buy goods.

578
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't have money to buy vegetables.

579
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I have some money.

580
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I can't do it.

581
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I can't do it.

582
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I can't do it.

583
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I can't do it.

584
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'll pay you back sooner or later.

585
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I can't get used to it.

586
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I can't get used to it.

587
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm sorry.

588
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
But I can't watch you go to me.

589
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Shulan.

590
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Look.

591
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Look.

592
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Why are you crying?

593
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Think about it.

594
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Three people.

595
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
One minute and one minute.

596
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm making money.

597
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
My sister.

598
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
She can let me work.

599
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Besides, my sister can't jump.

600
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
My hands can't lift.

601
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I can't do it.

602
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I've been a little dizzy lately.

603
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Think about my brother.

604
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'd like to give me the goods.

605
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Let me make some money.

606
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I lied to you.

607
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I lied to you.

608
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm so scared.

609
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Don't be afraid.

610
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Open the box.

611
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Open it.

612
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Look.

613
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
New package.

614
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Come on.

615
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Wu Du. Mingwen.

616
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Cook the shrimp stock.

617
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Do it.

618
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Eat.

619
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I've decided.

620
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I won't do anything else.

621
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'll do it with you.

622
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What do you say?

623
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Don't worry.

624
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
We'll have a good day.

625
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
When you sing,

626
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I know

627
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
you can die.

628
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You must be a character.

629
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
In your opinion,

630
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
what kind of person is it?

631
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It must be

632
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
the Emperor's

633
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Emperor's son.

634
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
OK.

635
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
The king will use it in the future.

636
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
What do you like?

637
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Come on.

638
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I'll give you a toast.

639
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
OK.

640
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Thank you, Captain Qi.

641
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You've made a lot of money

642
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
in the south.

643
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I'm sorry.

644
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
We only found 34 black-spawns.

645
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
The rest are lost.

646
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You've tried your best.

647
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I know everyone is concerned

648
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
about the six black-spawns

649
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
that were shot by the Wen Suopu auction house.

650
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
We just got news from the embassy.

651
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
The customs officer

652
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
detained these cultural relics.

653
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
The reason is the evidence we provided.

654
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It's too simple.

655
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
They raised more questions.

656
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
For example,

657
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
can you clarify

658
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
how many

659
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
peach trees are planted in the tomb?

660
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Besides,

661
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
what else is in the tomb?

662
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
We don't even know

663
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
where the hole is.

664
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
How did you know?

665
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
The bottom line is

666
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
we need to find

667
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
the hole of the black-spawns.

668
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And we need to prove

669
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
that the black-spawns are from that hole.

670
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Zhaoyun,

671
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
can you find the six black-spawns?

672
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It depends on

673
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
whether we can get this case

674
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
after we get through the police.

675
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Where is Qi Xian?

676
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
He's not here.

677
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Da Cang.

678
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Da Cang.

679
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yes.

680
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
What did you find

681
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
about the black-spawns

682
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
in Suizhou?

683
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Sir,

684
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
we only know

685
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
that the six black-spawns

686
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and the 34 black-spawns

687
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
were from a foreign country

688
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
called Hualunwang eight months ago.

689
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
They were imported from Qinchuan

690
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
and sold to Hong Kong

691
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
and then to other countries.

692
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
They were sold to foreign retailers

693
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
in eight months.

694
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It's clear that the underground

695
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
trade chain is very mature.

696
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
So,

697
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
as long as we can find Hualunwang,

698
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
we can find the black-spawns

699
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
behind Hualunwang.

700
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Captain Yang,

701
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
have you heard

702
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
about Hualunwang?

703
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yes, but he's very cunning.

704
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
He's in contact with the country

705
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
and knows that his nickname

706
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
is Hualunwang.

707
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It's an ancient Chinese name.

708
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It's been a month.

709
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Time is heavy.

710
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
We can't

711
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
just leave it at that.

712
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Zhang Suo,

713
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
can you be sure

714
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
which country

715
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
is the black-spawns from?

716
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
From this...

717
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
From this pattern,

718
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
we can only see that

719
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
it's probably from the Western Han period.

720
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It might have come from the ground.

721
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
But

722
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
there are 11 ground-spawns in the Western Han.

723
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And there are many

724
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
black-spawns, black-spawns,

725
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and all kinds of ground-spawns.

726
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's too broad.

727
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
As for

728
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
which wood,

729
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
it's even harder to say.

730
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The Wen Suopu Pai Mai Hang

731
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
usually has a mark

732
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
on the source of the cultural relics.

733
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Do they provide information?

734
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Yes.

735
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
They mark

736
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
the six black-spawns

737
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
from the Sanmiao Village

738
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
in the west corner of our Qingchuan.

739
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
The cultural relics are very good.

740
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
In the next month,

741
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
we'll have to

742
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
send them to the Zansu tribe.

743
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
When you go to the Sanmiao Village,

744
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I'll call you if I need anything.

745
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Go to sleep.

746
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Go.

747
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Captain.

748
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
What?

749
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'll go with you.

750
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
We'll go together.

751
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
We have five cases.

752
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
He's my master, you're his master.

753
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Let's go.

754
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Thanks.

755
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Did you hear?

756
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The police

757
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
have brought back a batch of black-spawns.

758
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
How many?

759
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
34.

760
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Let's see what you and Xingcheng

761
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
will do with my money.

762
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
34?

763
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Only six?

764
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Are my six in the Wen Suopu Pai Mai Hang?

765
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I heard that these 34 are similar to mine.

766
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
They're probably the same size.

767
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
How are they similar?

768
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Are they the same?

769
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
They're all black-spawns.

770
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Who told you that?

771
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
My brother and sister-in-law

772
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
are working in the civil service.

773
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Who is he?

774
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
His ex-girlfriend.

775
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
You don't believe it?

776
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Of course I do.

777
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
The police called him by his name.

778
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
He's a man of great talent.

779
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
He can't leave any secrets behind.

780
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I won't tell him anything.

781
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
The police

782
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
are good at making people happy.

783
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I want to see how black-spawns work.

784
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I'm from the Public Security Bureau.

785
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I can't be a black-spawn.

786
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Why don't you ask if there's anyone

787
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
who can take you to the surveillance center?

788
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Surveillance center?

789
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I came back from the office.

790
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I thought I'd go to the surveillance center.

791
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Do you know anyone there?

792
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
No.

793
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
The man in the last painting

794
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
in the front two years

795
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
graduated from Peking University.

796
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Luo,

797
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
you're a little tired of the food.

798
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Here,

799
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
we'll take you to the city tomorrow.

800
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
We'll improve the food.

801
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Really?

802
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I'm a customer.

803
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I heard that a group of black-spawns

804
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
were caught by the police.

805
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Is there a part of them in the surveillance center?

806
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Now that's the situation.

807
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
The police are asking us to report

808
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
if we can get back the six pieces of the painting.

809
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
If we can get back the six pieces of the painting.

810
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
We're really worried.

811
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
What do you mean?

812
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Last time, you answered

813
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
a few of their questions.

814
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
This time, they asked some tricky questions.

815
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
The painting is still in the painting.

816
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
