1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,600
Meanwhile, there are innumerable secrets left!

2
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,820
ohh

3
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,400
HHHHHHH

4
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,200
100 million euro

5
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,060
We are moving forward.

6
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,680
What exactly do we wait so long for everybody is out there?

7
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,260
view right

8
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,820
I'm so confused as always

9
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,460
Do not open that door

10
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
wait

11
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,280
ridiculous

12
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,800
I wasn't sure if this was even possible

13
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,600
Someone mÃ¡s

14
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Let's go.

15
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
I'll beat you up.

16
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
I'll beat you up.

17
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
If you don't come out,

18
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
I'll get you out.

19
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
You just throw the knife in the hole.

20
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Let me throw the knife in the hole.

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Let's go.

22
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Come on, Zhang.

23
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Let's go.

24
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Let's go.

25
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Is this the place to store the goods?

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
It's over there.

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
I think it's here.

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
I think it's here.

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Think about it.

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Uncle Jiang, I came here last night.

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Think about it.

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Right, there's a rabbit here.

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
It's here.

34
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
I'll buy you a black tea.

35
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
I don't want to.

36
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Uncle Jiang,

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
look.

38
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
It should be here.

39
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Should be?

40
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Look.

41
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Come on.

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Come on.

43
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
There's something.

44
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
It's here.

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
It's here.

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Come on.

47
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Uncle Jiang,

48
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
I'll cut it.

49
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
One, two, three.

50
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Uncle Jiang.

51
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Uncle Jiang.

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Uncle Jiang.

53
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
You.

54
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
There's a lot of animals here.

55
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Uncle Jiang.

56
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Look, it's a

57
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
old-fashioned one.

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Did you bring it?

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Yes, I did.

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Where should I go?

61
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Go back.

62
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Don't move.

63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
You have to check it.

64
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Uncle Jiang,

65
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
it's far from the Yellow River.

66
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
It's here.

67
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
It's here.

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
What's wrong?

69
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
It's far from the Yellow River.

70
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
It's far from the Yellow River.

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
It's 500-600 meters away from the Yellow River.

72
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
How can it be so far?

73
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
And it's

74
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
much deeper than the outer pit.

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
What do you mean?

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
It's hard to say.

77
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Let me go have a look.

78
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Come on.

79
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
You're an intern.

80
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
You should be careful.

81
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
I've never eaten pork and never seen pork.

82
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
You can't do that.

83
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
What are you doing?

84
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Let me go have a look.

85
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Let me go.

86
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
You can't do that.

87
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
What are you doing?

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
You've worked hard.

89
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Professor.

90
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Where's Gao Dong?

91
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
He just came.

92
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Thank you.

93
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Thank you.

94
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Professor.

95
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Here.

96
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Attention.

97
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
You're so stupid.

98
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
You don't know anything.

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
You're just a fool.

100
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
I called Fang Kun.

101
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
These days,

102
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
he helped me find

103
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
important clues in the garden.

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Otherwise, I wouldn't have stolen the fly.

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
You're a wise man.

106
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I'm right.

107
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
I'll go back

108
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
and check the situation.

109
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Let's go.

110
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
What are we doing?

111
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Let's go.

112
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Wang Taiping.

113
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
How deep is the hole?

114
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
I can't tell.

115
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
I'm sweating.

116
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Captain Ji.

117
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
I need your help.

118
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Be careful.

119
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Slowly.

120
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Slowly.

121
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Slowly.

122
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Slowly.

123
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Slowly.

124
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Slowly.

125
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Slowly.

126
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Hold on.

127
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Hold on.

128
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Hold on.

129
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Go up.

130
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
How is it?

131
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
It's all wet.

132
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
It's all wet.

133
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
It's troublesome.

134
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
We can't get in

135
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
if we get in the water.

136
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Professor, you need a map.

137
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
I have an idea.

138
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
It's troublesome.

139
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
The other party's flag is only three days away.

140
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Look.

141
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Can we use this map and the information we have now

142
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
to deal with this situation?

143
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Chen.

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
I'll get the map

145
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
and do a test.

146
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Captain Qi. Captain Yang.

147
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Here it is.

148
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
I'll take the students

149
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
to sort out the files

150
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
and send them back to the report.

151
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Okay.

152
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Okay. Get in the car.

153
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Drive my car. I'll send you back.

154
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I'll take your car.

155
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Chief.

156
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Isn't this the Senghua's house?

157
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Seng is not the other house.

158
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
The front is the Da Ye's house.

159
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Go there.

160
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Let's go to the restaurant. We're almost there.

161
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
This one?

162
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
No.

163
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Go.

164
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Chief, I'm sorry.

165
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
You're too much.

166
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Chief.

167
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Who told you to do this?

168
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
I won't let you get away with this.

172
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
You think you can beat me?

173
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
I don't need it.

174
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Who told you to do this?

176
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Brother-in-law, come here.

177
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
This is Xiao Wu.

178
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
I didn't expect it.

179
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Senghua, why did you do that?

180
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
You can't do anything with these two thieves.

181
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
They took you to the underground.

182
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
You told them to give you to me.

183
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
I let you go to hide from them.

184
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
No matter what,

185
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
I have to get these two thieves.

186
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Not yours.

187
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
They took them.

188
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Chief, hurry up.

189
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I'm sorry.

191
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
I'm sorry.

192
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
You...

195
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
I'm sorry.

196
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
I'm sorry.

197
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Senghua.

199
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
It's almost done.

200
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Did you know it's my son's trap?

201
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
One does his own thing.

202
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
I admit it.

203
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
He's the one I hired.

204
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Let him go.

205
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
You really took my son's trap.

206
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
An organised round.

207
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
We will punish him.

208
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
You used to be so good.

209
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Now you're nothing.

210
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
I just used you.

211
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
I double the money

212
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
I was already paid

213
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
for this.

214
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
You didn't even eat either.

215
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
You cherished it to yourself.

216
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
We need the Peninsula.

217
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Big State,

218
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,260
Now this day

219
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,640
is gonna destroy our own chewing gum

220
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,880
and our own enjoyment

221
00:11:51,880 --> 00:12:08,740
We just have to make fun of your

222
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,120
modern life

223
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,360
and just give less court evidence

224
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:30,680
Yes, brushing away a Game of cards when I think of ì¶22 ÑÐ°Ðº

225
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:41,180
White

226
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,120
Use them

227
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,080
Hive

228
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,080
I'll buy you if you do as I say.

229
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
But we're relatives.

230
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,080
If you want to see me and send me a message,

231
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
you buy her for me.

232
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
I'll spare your life.

233
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Buy her!

234
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Brother! Brother!

235
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,080
Brother! Brother!

236
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Brother! Brother!

237
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,080
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

238
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,080
I won't see you! I won't see you!

239
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,080
I won't see you! I'm sorry!

240
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

241
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

242
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
I won't see you! I won't see you!

243
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
I'll spare your life!

244
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
I'll spare your life!

245
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Brother! Brother!

246
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Brother!

247
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
I'll spare your life!

248
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,080
I won't let you go no matter how long it takes!

249
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
I'll spare your life!

250
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
I'll spare your life!

251
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
Brother!

252
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,080
Brother!

253
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
Brother!

254
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Brother!

255
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
I'll kill you!

256
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
I won't see you! I won't see you!

257
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Why are you so scared?

258
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
You're my brother.

259
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
Don't die together.

260
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Come on.

261
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
I'll spare your life!

262
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
I'll spare your life!

263
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,080
I won't let you go no matter how long it takes!

264
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
Chief.

265
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
Chief.

266
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
I'm here to see you.

267
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
What's up?

268
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
Your wife is here.

269
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
She's not here.

270
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
She saw you pulling the strings.

271
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
She's not willing to leave.

272
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
What can I do?

273
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Hurry up and go.

274
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
Hurry up.

275
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
You came all the way here?

276
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
Your brother-in-law?

277
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
How would I know?

278
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
He came back last night.

279
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
He hasn't been able to get a hold of me.

280
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
I know men don't go home.

281
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
Either they run away by themselves,

282
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
or they run away with someone else.

283
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
If he's going to call someone,

284
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
I won't come to you to trust him.

285
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,080
Then you just wait and see if he can come back.

286
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
I'm not coming back.

287
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,080
Brother-in-law, you're here.

288
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
Fu Man.

289
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
Why are you here?

290
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Where did you go?

291
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
How did you get here?

292
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
I'm not filming. It's all a lie.

293
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
I'm dead.

294
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Last night, I went to see a big girl.

295
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Don't worry.

296
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
I'll go wash my face.

297
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Xiao Feng, I'll see you later.

298
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,080
Sister, let's go upstairs and have a rest.

299
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
Let's go upstairs and have a rest.

300
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
Let's go.

301
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
This way.

302
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
There's a platform here.

303
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
You can rest here.

304
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
Where's Tian Xiao Wu?

305
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
She's in love with someone.

306
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
What does that have to do with me?

307
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,080
Fu Xiao Li, don't be like this.

308
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
If a man is a fan of a woman,

309
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
you can only protect her by not protecting her.

310
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
I'm going to divorce her.

311
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,080
I'm going to sleep with her and protect her.

312
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
I don't care about her life.

313
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
Come in.

314
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Come in.

315
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
Thank you for coming.

316
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
What are you doing here?

317
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
I'm here to save you.

318
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
Take revenge.

319
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,080
Although you saved us,

320
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,080
I saved you.

321
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,080
I saved you.

322
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Why?

323
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,080
I don't know.

324
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
You're kind-hearted.

325
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
You're a shameless bastard.

326
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
You can't keep your money.

327
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
It's your problem or someone else's problem?

328
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,080
Wu Jian He, stop talking nonsense.

329
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
I can kill you once and I can kill you twice.

330
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
If you want to be alone on the road of the imperial family,

331
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,080
I'll let the gunmen be your partner.

332
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
I'm afraid you won't do it.

333
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
If you know that Yan Xiang Wu is there now,

334
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
can you still laugh it out?

335
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,080
What?

336
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
I'll give him a word less to cry.

337
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
He's angry.

338
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
I'll let him go all the things you've done in the past few years.

339
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,080
As long as you do it,

340
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
he will fight with the police.

341
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
This year, the political commissar is out of the old.

342
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
You're still there.

343
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,080
I went to Bai Lu Garden with Wang Taiping.

344
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
I saw the fire.

345
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,080
After dark,

346
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,080
we went to the green pit in the village.

347
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,080
Who's the green pit?

348
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
I know.

349
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
You know?

350
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
You know.

351
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
How do you know they're waiting for you there?

352
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
I heard it in the dark.

353
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
They're a few people.

354
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,080
Did you see them?

355
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
I think they're five.

356
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
It's too dark to see.

357
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,080
What's the situation in the village?

358
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
In the village,

359
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
it's very dark.

360
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,080
There's nothing.

361
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
It's just a black peach.

362
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
How many pieces?

363
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
Two.

364
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,080
What about after you get a black peach?

365
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
I bought it for the South China Sea King.

366
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,080
100 pieces.

367
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
100 pieces.

368
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,080
He gave me 10,000 yuan.

369
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,080
You bought 100 pieces for the South China Sea King.

370
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
How can you get 10,000 yuan?

371
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,080
What?

372
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
I let him do it?

373
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
What are you thinking?

374
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
You don't reflect on yourself.

375
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
You think you're losing?

376
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
Yes.

377
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
You're right.

378
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
I was wrong.

379
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
You bought it for him?

380
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,080
How did you recognize him?

381
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,080
I don't recognize him.

382
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,080
I was in the city of the sea.

383
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,080
I saw a fire.

384
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,080
He was the one who started it.

385
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,080
The South China Sea King, right?

386
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,080
Yes.

387
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,080
His name, phone number, address.

388
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,080
Do you know?

389
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,080
I don't know.

390
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
He's not like me.

391
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
As long as you promise me two conditions,

392
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
you won't go down to the south of the sea.

393
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
I won't go down to the south of the sea.

394
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
What are your conditions?

395
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,080
I want you to be careful last time.

396
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
Are you teasing me?

397
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,080
These years,

398
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
I've been helping you to cut the goods.

399
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,080
Every time you go to the sea,

400
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,080
you're like a beggar.

401
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,080
I gave you 200 yuan.

402
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
I just took it back.

403
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,080
If I took you to the sea,

404
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,080
you would starve to death.

405
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,080
I'm going to the sea.

406
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,080
The sea is so high.

407
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
Will you give it or not?

408
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Here.

409
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
Two conditions.

410
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,080
I want to sell.

411
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
I'm a dog.

412
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,080
If you don't move,

413
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,080
I'll kill you.

414
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,080
How do you know

415
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,080
that someone will go to the south of the sea?

416
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Because I don't know how to dig.

417
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
I can only dig by myself.

418
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
So I can only use this method

419
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,080
to hide from the big fish,

420
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,080
hide from the east,

421
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
and see the clouds.

422
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
If I meet a dead fish,

423
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
if I can't meet it,

424
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
I'll go to the northwest wind.

425
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Those days,

426
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
I just ran into this hole.

427
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
I'm so lucky.

428
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,080
I have such a good experience.

429
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
Generally, I rely on luck.

430
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
Generally, it's hard work.

431
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
At the same time,

432
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
I only met this one

433
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
in my heart for a year or two.

434
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Officer,

435
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
I made 10,000 yuan

436
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
for the first time.

437
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,080
I'm self-sufficient.

438
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,080
Can you give me a bigger deal?

439
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,080
Yan Xiaowu,

440
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,080
the premise of the first payment

441
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,080
is to visit the north.

442
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,080
Visiting the north is right.

443
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,080
You've been waiting for me for a long time.

444
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
What's more,

445
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,080
you're not wrong.

446
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
Don't say that.

447
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,080
I'm telling the truth.

448
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
Why didn't I say the truth?

449
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
I've already said it myself.

450
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Do I have to lie to you?

451
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
What else do you want?

452
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,080
I have someone.

453
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
It's Wang Taiping.

454
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Sit.

455
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
Come in.

456
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
I'll keep my money dirty in the future.

457
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,080
See you in the middle.

458
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
Shulan,

459
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
come.

460
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
Shulan.

461
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,080
It's all my fault.

462
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
You're so conservative.

463
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,080
In a few days,

464
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
we'll sell the house

465
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
and raise you.

466
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,080
I'll raise you.

467
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
What's wrong with you?

468
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
Why are you so sad?

469
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
I'm sad

470
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
because after Wang Taiping was arrested,

471
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,080
I was so angry.

472
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
I didn't dare to go back.

473
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
I hid in the toilet.

474
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
I was still in Nanshan

475
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,080
for a whole night.

476
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
I couldn't see the knife

477
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,080
and I dropped a stick.

478
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,080
That's how it turned out.

479
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
You're a part of the family

480
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,080
who gave the other members of the Huadao family

481
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,080
a place to hide.

482
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,080
Mr. Dong.

483
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,080
The kid's gold stone.

484
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
Pour it.

485
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,080
Sit.

486
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Sir.

487
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,080
There's a ladder.

488
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,080
Go up there.

489
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Go.

490
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
Slow down.

491
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,080
Captain Xi.

492
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Come in.

493
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
You can only be safe

494
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,080
when you come in.

495
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,080
I've been wronged for two years.

496
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,080
I promise you

497
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,080
that I won't let you go to jail.

498
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,080
Don't worry about your sister and Xiaobai.

499
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,080
You'll have to accept the change.

500
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
You'll be more than others

501
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
and less than others.

502
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,080
General, it's not easy.

503
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
Congratulations.

504
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,080
You finally got out of jail

505
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,080
before the deadline.

506
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,080
Yes.

507
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,080
Fortunately,

508
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,080
if the suspect didn't turn himself in,

509
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
the consequences would be dire.

510
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,080
It seems that your case

511
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
is just like our exam.

512
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,080
Besides being highly professional,

513
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,080
you need to be a little lucky.

514
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,080
That's right.

515
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
By the way,

516
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,080
where is the translation work

517
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
of the cultural and cultural affairs department?

518
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,080
Professor Zhan is working

519
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
on the case.

520
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
It should be ready to hand over.

521
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,080
Look.

522
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,080
Professor,

523
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
look.

524
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
There's a small one.

525
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,080
It's a little smaller than the one in Tan's room.

526
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,080
You can smell it only when you wash your nose.

527
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
Why are you here?

528
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
The case is solved

529
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,080
and you still have a long face.

530
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,080
What's wrong?

531
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
Who are you showing it to?

532
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Yan Xiaowu's surrender

533
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
is a little weird.

534
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
How is it weird?

535
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
His body is covered with soil

536
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
and wounds.

537
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
It's very weird.

538
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,080
And

539
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,080
when he took me to identify Heitao Yong,

540
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,080
I always felt that he wasn't hiding it.

541
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
But we don't have time

542
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,080
to deal with these things now.

543
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
It's not easy to catch two people

544
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
who are in the green pit.

545
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,080
We can't find anything.

546
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
There's no clue until now.

547
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,080
The King of Hua Nan

548
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
and the Daoist priest

549
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,080
have no clue.

550
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,080
That's right,

551
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,080
Chief.

552
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,080
Although

553
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,080
we haven't caught the Daoist priest and the King of Hua Nan,

554
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,080
most of Heitao Yong

555
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,080
are being chased back.

556
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080
Let's put this case aside for now.

557
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Let's go back and have a rest.

558
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Wake up.

559
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,080
You haven't been back for a month, have you?

560
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,080
You have a wife at home.

561
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,080
I really forgot about it.

562
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
Is that the case?

563
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,080
Uncle Shou.

564
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,080
Uncle Shou.

565
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,080
Kou, why are you back?

566
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,080
I came back to ask you to do me a favor.

567
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
What is it?

568
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,080
Help me measure the distance from the Daoist forest.

569
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,080
What?

570
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
Kou,

571
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,080
this is the middle of the Daoist forest.

572
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
We have to measure it here.

573
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Yes.

574
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,080
You have to figure it out.

575
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
How much did you measure?

576
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,080
You're right.

577
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,080
It's a lot.

578
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,080
Look,

579
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,080
I usually

580
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,080
count the number of people

581
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,080
who are in the green pit.

582
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,080
Why did you measure the distance

583
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,080
from the Daoist forest?

584
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
I just wanted to know

585
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,080
how many people are in the green pit.

586
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
What's the distance?

587
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,080
Uncle Shou,

588
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,080
the yellow forest is like

589
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
a bowl of noodles.

590
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,080
The main forest is like noodles.

591
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,080
There are many external storage holes

592
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
next to the main forest.

593
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,080
There are some funeral items

594
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,080
in the external storage holes.

595
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,080
Usually,

596
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,080
when we find a hole near the Daoist forest,

597
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
we will guess that

598
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,080
the external storage hole was made.

599
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,080
But in general,

600
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
the distance between the external storage holes

601
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,080
and the main forest is at most 400 to 500 meters.

602
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
After measuring,

603
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,080
the distance between the Daoist forest

604
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
is clearly more than that.

605
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
So you mean

606
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,080
we have two families of noodles

607
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:35,400
and we can't put the

608
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,360
noodles in the

609
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,360
outer storage holes.

610
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,360
There is also a photo.

611
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
Remember that.

612
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,360
You have a short wristband.

613
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
There is a wolf.

614
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Xiao Man.

615
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
Brother Fanggui.

616
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Why are you here?

617
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
Where is my dad?

618
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,360
Let's go.

619
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,360
Dad,

620
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,360
Brother Fanggui is here.

621
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
Where is my dad?

622
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,360
Where is my dad?

623
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Where is my dad?

624
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,320
Brother Fanggui, you are here.

625
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,320
Uncle Liang.

626
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
Who?

627
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
Brother Fanggui.

628
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Look.

629
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
You were taken away by my dad.

630
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
Why are you here?

631
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
You know what?

632
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,320
You should eat a hard bean

633
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
when you are drunk.

634
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Come on, come on, come in.

635
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
What hard beans?

636
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,320
I bought you some beef with soy sauce.

637
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
I brought two bottles of wine.

638
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
I'll drink with you today.

639
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
Uncle,

640
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,280
I'm afraid that you will get drunk

641
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
if you drink the wine

642
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,280
made by the Mingtang.

643
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
What do you mean by the Mingtang?

644
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,280
Is there any Mingtang?

645
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
I ate and slept in your house

646
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,280
a while ago.

647
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,280
I made you a lot of trouble.

648
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
I came to thank you.

649
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
It's not a big deal.

650
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
I came to ask you something.

651
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,280
I saw the photo and the location.

652
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
It looks like

653
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
the location of the cave.

654
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
This one.

655
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,280
This one.

656
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
This one.

657
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
This one.

658
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
This one.

659
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
This one.

660
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
It smells good.

661
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
This piece of paper

662
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,240
was made decades ago

663
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,240
when a cadet came to the county.

664
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
He said that

665
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
he would make some paper

666
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,240
to make a paper fan.

667
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
I said that I was working

668
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
with my grandpa in the field.

669
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,240
He said, make it.

670
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
I said, make it.

671
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
This piece of paper

672
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,240
is more than 50 years old.

673
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,240
It doesn't look like it

674
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
when you look at it closely.

675
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
Look at the slope behind it.

676
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
It's not even there now.

677
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,240
There's no slope.

678
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
I'm Feng Shui Jun.

679
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
I've been working in the field for hundreds of years.

680
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,240
That's true.

681
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
Why is this slope

682
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
flat?

683
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,240
I said that

684
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
I'm a poor man

685
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,240
who can't grow a seed.

686
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,240
I've been picking up soil everywhere.

687
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
I've even picked up the yellow scale.

688
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
My grandma must have been

689
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
picking up the scale.

690
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
Are you sure?

691
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,240
I've been collecting water.

692
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
I remember that.

693
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
The old people in my village must have remembered.

694
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,240
The water-resistant area.

695
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
I remember that

696
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,240
there was a slope before.

697
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,240
Later, when the sky was low,

698
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,240
it was flat.

699
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,240
What's the price?

700
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
150 yuan.

701
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
Sir,

702
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
is there anything wrong?

703
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,240
Master Luo

704
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
is not willing to pay me.

705
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,240
He's not willing to pay me.

706
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
This is 150 yuan.

707
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,240
The other 50 yuan

708
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,240
is for my brother.

709
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,240
I told him to pick up the soil.

710
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,240
Baiping,

711
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
you're not going to pay me.

712
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,240
I'm not going to pay you.

713
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,240
I'm not going to pay you.

714
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
You're going to use the black peach to tear it apart.

715
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
Then you can return to Qin Chuan

716
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,240
and continue to do business.

717
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
You're not going to pay me.

718
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
I'm not going to pay you.

719
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
I'm not going to pay you at all.

720
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
Are you kidding me?

721
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,240
Master,

722
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,240
you did a great job.

723
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
Really.

724
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
You helped me get out of the way

725
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,240
and also got Luo Shixin out of there.

726
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,240
You're really amazing.

727
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
Master,

728
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,240
I owe you a favor.

729
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,240
I'm going to do it.

730
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,240
If you're not willing to pay me,

731
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,240
then I'll call you a friend.

732
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,240
We're friends.

733
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
It's no problem to do business.

734
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,240
But you're also excited.

735
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,240
Most of my goods

736
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,240
were taken from Luo Shixin.

737
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,240
Your goods are too small.

738
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,240
So,

739
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,240
I think we should continue to cooperate.

740
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,240
The goods he took

741
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,240
are not as big as mine.

742
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
Do you dare to take them?

743
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
I'm afraid I have to.

744
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,240
But he has a lot of goods.

745
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
Don't worry.

746
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,240
How many goods do you want

747
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,240
and how many do you have in the future?

748
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
Master,

749
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,240
you're right.

750
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,240
The next step is another line.

751
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,240
There are two lines and three lines.

752
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
Are you going to take them?

753
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,240
How about this?

754
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
After ten days,

755
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,240
you can take the next batch of goods.

756
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
You have to believe me.

757
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,240
Brother.

758
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,240
I've been bothering you these days.

759
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
I've caused you trouble.

760
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,240
No.

761
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
It's kind of a token of gratitude.

762
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
Here.

763
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
What's this?

764
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,240
But you're making so much money.

765
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,240
Take this ten thousand

766
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
and make a plan.

767
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,240
Sell the assets, the money and the shares.

768
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,240
When the time comes, we'll do it right away.

769
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,240
We're not like Liu Shuxi and Wei Huashan.

770
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,240
We want to expand the market

771
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
and make it a professional private sector.

772
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,240
You'll be in charge of human resources and technology.

773
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
I'll take care of the accounts.

774
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,240
Guang,

775
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,240
is there anyone suitable to work for us?

776
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Yes.

777
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,240
The people in the mine are good brothers.

778
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,240
They're good friends.

779
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,240
Call them and arrange them.

780
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,240
Okay.

781
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,240
What's the plan for this time?

782
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,240
Not yet.

783
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
Wait for my message.

784
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
I'll go and get it.

785
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,240
Take whatever you want for 15 yuan.

786
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Don't take too much.

787
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
Okay.

788
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,240
Okay.

789
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
Okay.

790
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:54,240
Okay.

791
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,240
It's winter in the house of the Great Great-grandfather.

792
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
Why do you look a little pale?

793
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
I've been missing my grandfather.

794
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,240
What about Wuhang?

795
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,240
Wuhang is a very old place.

796
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,240
He's been helping others to pay the debt.

797
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
He's been in a few losses lately.

798
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,240
He wants to make a big fortune.

799
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
I hope the Great Great-grandfather can help.

800
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
You think this is a big deal?

801
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
How can you be so generous?

802
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,240
You're the first time you want to make a big fortune.

803
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,240
I'm afraid I can't make it.

804
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,240
This line is deep and deep.

805
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,240
Go back.

806
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,240
You're modest.

807
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,240
A few years ago, I was in the village of Yin in the mountains.

808
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,240
Someone made a big fire.

809
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
How did you know this time?

810
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,240
I'm not nervous.

811
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,240
I've known you for a long time.

812
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,240
If it weren't for the lack of kindness,

813
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,240
I would have come back a long time ago.

814
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,240
I heard that the tomb of the Grand Master Yuan Tiangang

815
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,240
is where you were born.

816
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,240
It's a very good place to see.

817
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,240
You don't treat me well.

818
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,240
Back then,

819
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,240
I was the only one who could dig the tomb of Yuan Tiangang.

820
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
When I was alive,

821
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,240
do you know why?

822
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,240
Why?

823
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,240
The tomb of Yuan Tiangang was guarded by a sword.

824
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:31,240
I was not satisfied after I took out all the treasures in the tomb.

825
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,240
I wanted to take the sword with me.

826
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,240
He took the sword and the sword.

827
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,240
One guy sent the mechanism of the tomb.

828
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,240
The steel was blown up.

829
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,240
It made me a dead man.

830
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,240
Since then,

831
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,240
I've made two rules.

832
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,240
First,

833
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,240
the descendants of the tomb can only search for the tomb.

834
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,240
They can't dig it.

835
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Second,

836
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,240
those who come to dig can't be greedy.

837
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,240
I can only be generous and dig.

838
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,240
But digging big, digging small, digging deep, digging shallow,

839
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,240
can't you get rid of the big trouble?

840
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,240
It depends on your luck.

841
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,240
I understand.

842
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,240
Do you know my business?

843
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,240
100,000 yuan for one pit.

844
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
Mr. Guan,

845
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,240
I want all three of them.

846
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,240
Greed is not enough to make a snake swallow incense.

847
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,240
I'll take the money.

848
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,240
300,000 yuan is in the car.

849
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
Xiao Ou,

850
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,240
your first hit is a little big.

851
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,240
I understand your luck.

852
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,240
I understand your ability.

853
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
Hello?

854
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,240
Wang Jie,

855
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
say it.

856
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
Okay.

857
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,240
I understand.

858
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,240
Teacher,

859
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,240
today is the last day.

860
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,240
I'm afraid

861
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,240
there will be some new problems.

862
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
There was just news.

863
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
Those six black peaches

864
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,240
they promised to return them.

865
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,240
Really?

866
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,240
Great!

867
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,240
Great!

868
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,240
Great!

869
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,240
Great!

870
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,240
Great!

871
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,240
Great!

872
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,240
Great!

873
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,240
Great!

874
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,240
Great!

875
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,240
Great!

876
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,240
Great!

877
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,240
Great!

878
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,240
Great!

879
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,240
Great!

880
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,240
Great!

881
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,240
Great!

882
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,240
Great!

883
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,240
Great!

884
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,240
Great!

885
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,240
Great!

886
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,240
Great!

887
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,240
Great!

888
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,240
Great!

889
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,240
Great!

890
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,300
you
