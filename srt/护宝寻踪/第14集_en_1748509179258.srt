1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
little bit of a

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,060
little bit of a

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,760
l

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He's rich and he even sent fruit.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He's so generous.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He's still the boss of the team.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He's generous?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
When you were young, what was his nickname?

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Wu Seipi.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Seipi Jiajia.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I've known him for 20 years.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've seen this.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He treated me to a meal.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
To pay for the trip.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How is Seipi?

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You'll have time to trick me.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
How many people are there in the Huawei team?

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Six.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Six more.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Twelve people, three teams. I'll take one team.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Get ready. I'll think of a plan later.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Six.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Come.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll go to the toilet.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Buy some good wine and good food.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Tell my old colleagues to take care of it.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll make sure they pay the bill.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Pay attention.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll tell my old colleague not to let him see it.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't worry. I'll make sure it's done.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Come.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
How can I sell good wine and good food for 100 yuan?

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What do you know?

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is called spending money on moving the dust.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Captain.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Captain, are you there?

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Xiaoduo.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes?

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Wu Xu.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Wu Xu?

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes?

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They went out for the first time.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You don't have to come.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll go to the front.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Wu Xu.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Attention.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Target appears.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't move.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Wipe your hands.

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hold the gun.

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Four of you.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Catch them.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't move.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's go.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't move.

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't move.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't move.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Come.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Catch him.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Come.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Put the gun down.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll shoot you.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You can't run.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Stop.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I've been shooting you for months.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I can't let you run away.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Take him away.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Go.

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll shoot him.

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Why are you two here?

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Wu Xu.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What about the others?

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll take this guy.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Take him away.

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why are you here?

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm in the big house.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I eat your fruit and tea.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You're here.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know you.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What's wrong with you?

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I tell you.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You can't take him away.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The contract is in Qingyuan County.

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I've been here for months

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to find someone to talk to.

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You want to help me?

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I gave you the contract.

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Right?

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Can you trust me?

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
No.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Just take him to the dog.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Your leader called me.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
He said I'm the one.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You send some people

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
to escort him back to Qingchuan.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What?

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I need to send someone to escort you back?

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You can call me.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What do you want?

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I want to talk to you about the bike.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll be very generous.

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You still mention the bike?

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're so childish.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's a pity that the big house

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is gone without me.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Go back.

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Go back now.

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They have.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Why don't we have them?

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Right.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You're right.

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I think

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
we should follow the team.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm a good driver.

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I tell you.

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If you follow me,

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
you'll know

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
that I'm a good driver.

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Captain Qi.

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What happened to you

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and Wu Ju?

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You said you were my bike.

140
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What happened?

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I told you.

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We're in love.

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We're not enemies.

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't think so.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The school held a bike

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
for the first time.

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It was a very expensive bike.

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It was very expensive.

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It was cheap.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I didn't pay attention.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I drank too much.

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I was so drunk the next day.

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What the hell?

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why did I do that?

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Did you win the bike?

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Of course.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So,

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
how can I not take revenge?

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Why?

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's been ten years since I took revenge.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's so good today.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Of course.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm not a loser.

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Actually,

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
there was another situation.

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I was with him

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
as a female diver.

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I was his brother.

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I was a little bit shy.

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
After the bike was broken,

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I was so angry

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
that I took your sister-in-law home.

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's you.

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
How can I teach you?

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Come in.

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You brought back the money?

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Of course.

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't want it.

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's very fragrant.

180
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You're good.

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're not bad at dealing with old classmates.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Didn't you say

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
which master I taught you?

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Don't talk nonsense.

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
When Monkey Sun went down the mountain,

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
you didn't mention what you told him.

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Did you forget?

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't worry.

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I made a mistake.

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The first one to give it to me

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
must be you.

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Go.

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Change your dirty clothes.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Change to something clean.

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What?

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Prepare to go to the flower school.

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Go on a vacation.

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Comrades,

199
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
in order to severely strike the cultural relics theft,

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
the problem of the ancient relics being destroyed,

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
the destruction of cultural relics in the field of engineering and construction,

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I am the cultural relics investigation team

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
actively cooperating with relevant intelligence departments

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
to decide to establish

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
the Cultural Relics Bureau of Qin Chuan,

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the National Security Bureau of Qin Chuan,

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and the customs and emergency department.

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The cultural relics safety contact meeting system

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
will form an infinite combination

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
of the criminal crimes of the cultural relics.

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We will explore a working method

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
that is effective in the execution of cultural relics.

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
At the same time,

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
we will establish a joint office

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
to establish a joint law system

216
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
for the construction of cultural relics and public security.

217
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The law of cultural relics will be formed.

218
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What?

219
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I've been looking for you.

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I know.

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I know.

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I know.

223
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I know.

224
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I know.

225
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I know.

226
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What's the matter?

227
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Nothing.

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's just a nightmare.

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Is this the one?

230
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No.

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Absolutely not.

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Look again.

233
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This one.

234
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes.

235
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes.

236
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This is the one.

237
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Which one is yours?

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm just a servant.

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't know why I came.

240
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I just came.

241
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Who?

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't know his name.

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I know he's a police officer.

244
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
His name is Datou.

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Datou?

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's a name.

247
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Anyway, he's the one

248
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
who called me here.

249
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't know if he has any other people.

250
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There are some rules

251
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
in the city.

252
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I can't just ask.

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What?

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You've been here before?

255
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
No.

256
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Just this.

257
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm not lucky.

258
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What?

259
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You're not lucky?

260
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You mean you're lucky

261
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
because you're a thief?

262
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No, I didn't mean that.

263
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I just know

264
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm not lucky

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
because I'm not lucky.

266
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You really know

267
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
that you're not lucky?

268
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You're a thief.

269
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You're not lucky.

270
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If you don't tell me,

271
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll tell you.

272
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You're a thief.

273
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're not lucky.

274
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm a thief.

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We've been here for a while.

276
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We didn't find the way

277
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
to the city.

278
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why did we come here?

279
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why didn't we

280
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
go to the tomb?

281
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Which tomb?

282
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The tomb of the Emperor.

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You should

284
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
have checked the place in advance.

285
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You should have

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
asked the lady of the law

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
to complain about the crime.

288
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You should have asked her to buy it.

289
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
How did you know?

290
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Hello?

291
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What's up?

292
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Brother,

293
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm busy.

294
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I forgot something

295
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and came here

296
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
at the last minute.

297
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I really love

298
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
your goods.

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But you can't leave your goods

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
here and your friends can't come too.

301
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Have you searched the seller yet?

303
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I should have known you were a lazy man.

304
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Don't try to be my brother.

305
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You're drunk and you're talking nonsense.

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're talking nonsense.

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You're talking nonsense.

308
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
No, bro.

309
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You're not a seller yet.

310
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yuan, Yuan.

311
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You can copy whatever you want.

312
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But it's very troublesome now.

313
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Did you hear that?

314
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The God of Death

315
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
is trying to make you a god.

316
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But Wen Baoyuan caught him.

317
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What?

318
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You don't know?

319
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You should be careful.

320
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The God of Death team will find your goods.

321
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Now we'll follow the road to check.

322
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If we find you...

323
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Bro.

324
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This pawn shop

325
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
is more than 100,000 yuan.

326
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We should count the goods.

327
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Count the goods?

328
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He will. I won't.

329
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He's still on the road to the dead.

330
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
When he realizes

331
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that he can't sell the goods

332
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and he can't get out of the ship

333
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
with the goods,

334
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
he will come back to beg me.

335
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Then

336
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
we can just sell them.

337
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What if I buy a new one?

338
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Uncle Liu is now

339
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
in a difficult situation.

340
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I have to contact

341
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Uncle Liu.

342
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Hello.

343
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The number you have dialed is busy.

344
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hello.

345
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The number you have dialed is busy.

346
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Hello.

347
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The number you have dialed is busy.

348
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're a bad guy.

349
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're so arrogant.

350
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I don't like you.

351
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You said it's a bad thing.

352
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
If you keep hitting me like last time,

353
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll beat you up.

354
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Enough.

355
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I thought you were in love with me.

356
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm not in love with you.

357
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm not in love with you.

358
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
If you come back,

359
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
you'll get a headache.

360
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Come back.

361
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Come back.

362
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Okay, okay.

363
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Come back.

364
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Don't worry.

365
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm still here.

366
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Take care.

367
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Let's go.

368
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Have a safe trip.

369
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Have a safe trip.

370
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Okay.

371
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,880
we have four cooperator

372
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,080
dating and exploring

373
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,560
just make sure

374
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,240
if Kzero will be their target

375
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,720
not least if their screw should be covered

376
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,040
it's them

377
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:55,720
but that is not Shrimp

378
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:20,100
Sorry for making Angche rather pushy to share your

379
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,100
The King of Guo would remember the strange car

380
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Yes, my friend Lu Fu is the same

381
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,100
The guy who buried the body in the tomb

382
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
He's a thief now

383
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,100
I told him

384
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,100
How could a person like you be involved in the knife-mooing?

385
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,100
But there's no such possibility

386
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,100
The knife-mooing thief knows the patrol time of Wenbao Garden very well

387
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,100
He's avoiding Wenbao Garden

388
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,100
I asked the patrol time of Wenbao Garden

389
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,100
It's all at the peak of the knife-mooing

390
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
But there's a gap in the middle

391
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100
They're all empty

392
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,100
I ask Xiao Du

393
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,100
Yes

394
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
The clue of the eight-headed

395
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100
Be sure not to let go

396
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,100
Yes, we continue to watch the black market

397
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,100
See the things that are unknown

398
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,100
If you have time, go to the Lü family

399
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
I'll send you down

400
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,100
You can say whatever you want

401
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
Come on, I'll save you

402
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Brother Bukui

403
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,100
Brother Xu, take me away

404
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,100
Let me go to the prison

405
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,100
What are you doing in the next village?

406
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,100
When I was alive, I was a man of honor

407
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,100
I have to take good care of the people in the village

408
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:03,100
I'm not afraid to see a man in the village

409
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,100
You take me away, I'll take you to the prison

410
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,100
Brother Bukui, I'm so scared

411
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,100
I thought you were a tomb raider

412
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
You're a tomb raider

413
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,100
I see you every day

414
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,100
You and your husband

415
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
You're fighting with me

416
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,100
What do I think

417
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:32,100
Brother, don't be useless with me

418
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,100
If you're a man of honor

419
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,100
Let's catch the tomb raider

420
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
I came here for this

421
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,100
I ask you

422
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
Ten thousand dollars

423
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Have you seen any strangers in this world?

424
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
There are many strangers

425
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
This year is the day of the harvest

426
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,100
There are many people who are in the mountains

427
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:03,100
Have you heard of the sound of the cannon?

428
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,100
No

429
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Did you shoot the cannon when you were in the city?

430
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,100
This place is full of cannons

431
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Right

432
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,100
So do you think it's possible?

433
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,100
Your family is shooting cannons

434
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,100
I'm shooting cannons in the field

435
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
Cannon

436
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
This is impossible

437
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
Why?

438
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,100
Although I've been looking for it these days

439
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,100
Hongfu and Dongsheng have been looking for it

440
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,100
If he sees anything strange, he will definitely shoot me

441
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,100
And that cousin

442
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
He came to the tomb the other day

443
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,100
If someone is in the tomb, he will definitely know

444
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,100
Your cousin

445
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,100
What is your hometown?

446
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Wangtai Ping

447
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,100
Wangjiawa Village

448
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,100
The black-haired man is Wangtai Ping

449
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
You don't understand

450
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,100
Captain, he made a mistake

451
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,100
But I hit him

452
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,100
He was afraid of me

453
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
I don't believe he can do this

454
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,100
I didn't do it

455
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,100
I think you

456
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
This is

457
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,100
We should be clear about it

458
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,100
In case he is black-haired

459
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Can you go?

460
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,100
Please go to Wangjiawa

461
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Ask him

462
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,100
I have no friends in the village

463
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,100
I will go with you

464
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
I

465
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
Give it to me

466
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,100
You are so arrogant

467
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,100
You are so arrogant

468
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,100
How can you be arrogant?

469
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,100
I don't have a mother these days

470
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
You don't believe me?

471
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
I will kill you

472
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,100
Taiping, are you here?

473
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,100
Brother, why are you here?

474
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
Brother, are you done with your work?

475
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,100
Almost

476
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
Li Mei

477
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
Take the money

478
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,100
I am not in good health

479
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,100
You are so embarrassed

480
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
I will get you tea

481
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Go

482
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
Go

483
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
You

484
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,100
Are you really my big boss?

485
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,100
I think he is the most suspicious

486
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,100
You

487
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,100
He just came out

488
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,100
Why are you so arrogant?

489
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,100
If we let that Lv Fugui

490
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,100
go to the big house

491
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,100
How can he have a group behind him?

492
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
He should be able to contact you

493
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,100
Does this have anything to do with you?

494
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
No

495
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,100
It must have something to do with me

496
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,100
It's good if it doesn't

497
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,100
How can I let you go?

498
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
Besides

499
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
I am also a man of my own

500
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,100
I can't let you go

501
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
I am a man of my own

502
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,100
Have you seen anyone

503
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,100
suspicious when you were a mother?

504
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
No, father

505
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
I haven't seen any of them

506
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
Brother

507
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
This is the police

508
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,100
I am sorry

509
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,100
Why are you so angry?

510
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,100
I am here

511
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,100
You have money

512
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,100
I know you

513
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
What did you do?

514
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
I am looking for the truth

515
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,100
What?

516
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,100
Nothing

517
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,100
I am looking for the truth

518
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,100
Dog

519
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
Dog

520
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Sorry

521
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,100
The number you have dialed cannot be connected for the moment

522
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,100
Please redial later

523
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
Please

524
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,100
Wu Mao

525
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,100
Wu Mao?

526
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,100
I have money in the big house

527
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,100
I will kill you

528
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,100
What are you doing?

529
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,100
I am sorry

530
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,100
I am sorry

531
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
I am sorry

532
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,100
I am sorry

533
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,100
I am sorry

534
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,100
I am sorry

535
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,100
You go and see who he calls

536
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,100
I will follow him

537
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,100
I am sorry

538
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,100
How is it?

539
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,100
Xingzhao Hu and Sa Wazai Mu

540
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,540
I've never been to the flying car factory.

541
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,140
Do you think these two

542
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,020
stole the goods and took the money?

543
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,900
Impossible.

544
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,780
No one will feel

545
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,300
the pain of the goods.

546
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,820
Where's Prince Huanan?

547
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,460
He's a coward.

548
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,460
He wants to eat fish but he's afraid of being killed.

549
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,140
Unless...

550
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,500
Unless what?

551
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,260
Unless he's on a mission to recruit the guards

552
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,580
and go to the Zhaoyou Forest.

553
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,580
But that's not possible.

554
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,980
The Zhaoyou Forest

555
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,940
doesn't accept extra car startup practices,

556
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,260
which are very illegal.

557
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,420
You know,

558
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,340
if he stops only after the second stop,

559
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,740
he'll be lucky in an accidental way.

560
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,200
stoppable.

561
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:33,240
His name was Sanlang Gonggui.

562
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:59,500
of the

563
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,220
Hey,تر تنص块

564
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,480
What are you doing?

565
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,300
I protect you

566
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:28,960
You can't remove the

567
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,960
I don't want to live in the back.

568
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
You can't live in the back.

569
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
You're angry again.

570
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Why are you so familiar?

571
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
You dare to touch my feet?

572
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
You're gonna die.

573
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,960
You're gonna die.

574
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
Who's there?

575
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Stop.

576
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,960
Don't move.

577
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,960
Who's there?

578
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
The big house.

579
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
Do you recognize me?

580
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Who's there?

581
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
You.

582
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,960
Chief.

583
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
I know I was wrong.

584
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
I know.

585
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
I was wrong.

586
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
You know you were wrong?

587
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
Come on.

588
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
It's all my fault.

589
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
I let you recognize me because of the big house.

590
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
I've been through a lot.

591
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
I want to live a good life.

592
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
I want to live a good life.

593
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
I want to be a good person.

594
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
Who knows?

595
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
I was looking for someone.

596
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Who?

597
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
I was looking for someone.

598
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
I was looking for someone.

599
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
I was looking for someone.

600
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
You were looking for someone?

601
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
Yes.

602
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Do you know the person who killed Yan Xiaowu?

603
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
No.

604
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
I've never heard Yan Xiaowu lie to me.

605
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,960
I guess Yan Xiaowu doesn't know that you're a murderer.

606
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
I guess Yan Xiaowu doesn't know that you're a murderer.

607
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
I don't know.

608
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
How did you find the murderer?

609
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
How did you find the murderer?

610
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
It was clean the other day.

611
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
It was clean the other day.

612
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
I didn't see the murderer.

613
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
I didn't see the murderer.

614
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
He almost killed me.

615
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,960
I wanted to prove

616
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960
I wanted to prove

617
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
that there's no way to leave Yan Xiaowu behind.

618
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
Look.

619
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
Look.

620
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
It's this tomb.

621
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
It's this tomb.

622
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
Can't you see?

623
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Who's this tomb?

624
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
It's me.

625
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
It's me.

626
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
I'm Xia Hu from the tomb.

627
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
And the one who was caught with me.

628
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
I'm Sang Wang.

629
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
And Xing Chaogu.

630
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
I'm Wang Feng.

631
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
I'm Wang Feng.

632
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
Where did you come from?

633
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
I can't see far away.

634
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,960
I can't see far away.

635
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
Did you contact me these days?

636
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
I just called Xing Chaogu.

637
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
I just called Xing Chaogu.

638
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
He's locked up.

639
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
Why did you go to the train station?

640
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,960
I was in Xing Chaogu.

641
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,960
I was afraid you would find me.

642
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
I wanted to ask him for some money.

643
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
I wanted to hide.

644
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
But I didn't come to Xing Chaogu.

645
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
I was afraid my mother would come.

646
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Do you know Datou?

647
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,960
No.

648
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
Where is Wulong now?

649
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Wulong

650
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
is on the train.

651
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,960
And on the roof of the house.

652
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
I'm the one who was caught with me.

653
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
Wulong

654
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Stop!

655
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Don't run!

656
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
Go!

657
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
Sang Wang.

658
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
Is this Sang Wang?

659
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
You're here.

660
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
What's your name?

661
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
I'm Zhen.

662
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
I'm the one who gave birth to my mother.

663
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,960
I'm Sang Wang.

664
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
Your surname is Guo?

665
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
Your name is Guo Fengshan?

666
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
Wulong is your cousin.

667
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
Why did you come here?

668
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
Even if I want to ask you,

669
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
you're innocent.

670
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Why did you come here?

671
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
If you don't believe me,

672
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
why did you come here?

673
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
I...

674
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
I...

675
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
I'm listening.

676
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
What did you do?

677
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
This

678
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
and this.

679
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,960
Did you do it?

680
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
No.

681
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,960
I don't want to cooperate.

682
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,960
This

683
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
and this.

684
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
Let's talk somewhere else.

685
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,960
I don't need that.

686
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,960
I...I'll tell you.

687
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
These two...

688
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
These two are not.

689
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
They are all of us.

690
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,960
You are all of us.

691
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
Who are you?

692
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
I'm Wang Taiping.

693
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
Wulong.

694
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,960
Are you still so righteous?

695
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,960
I'll give you a message.

696
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
Say hello.

697
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
Do you understand?

698
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
Say hello.

699
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,960
What's next?

700
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,960
I really don't understand.

701
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,960
I always say this.

702
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
What did you get in the house?

703
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,960
A...

704
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,340
a

705
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,960
a lighter.

706
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,960
And some...I don't know

707
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,960
which year it was.

708
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,960
And...

709
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
a lighter.

710
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,960
Let's go.

711
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
Look.

712
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,960
These are all of them.

713
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Yes.

714
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
In the house?

715
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,960
Yes.

716
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,960
What did your

717
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,960
carers do?

718
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
They called me

719
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,960
and asked me to go to the carers' office

720
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
to get the stuff out.

721
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
You guys go. Go to the right and check

722
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,960
if there are any other things.

723
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,960
Okay.

724
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
I got it.

725
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
There is no such thing as

726
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,960
a carer's office.

727
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
What's wrong?

728
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,960
I don't know.

729
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
You saw it.

730
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
I didn't even enter the carer's office.

731
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,960
And you brought me here.

732
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,960
What about Yuan Hua from Xingzhou?

733
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
He said I didn't let the police

734
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,960
check on me.

735
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,960
I don't have anyone to guard me.

736
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,960
He sent a group of people to hide in the carer's office

737
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,960
and asked me to get them out.

738
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
That's it.

739
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
Did he tell me about the carer's office or the carer's office?

740
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
When was the last time

741
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,960
you saw each other?

742
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
A few days ago.

743
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
Specifically?

744
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
It was a few days ago.

745
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,960
The first day we met.

746
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,960
It's not the first day.

747
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Someone asked us to check the carer's office.

748
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
No one came. Xingzhou was angry.

749
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,960
So he left.

750
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
We never saw each other again.

751
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
You don't know Xingzhou?

752
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
How did you meet?

753
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
I don't know.

754
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
He asked me to call him at 9 o'clock.

755
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
Wang Taiping.

756
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
How did you know him?

757
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
He was working in the construction site.

758
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
He met Wu Long.

759
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Wu Long brought him to the airport.

760
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,960
You didn't know him before?

761
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
No.

762
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,960
I don't know.

763
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
Wang.

764
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
Every word I ask you

765
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
is not random.

766
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,960
If you leave me a message

767
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
it's for yourself.

768
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,960
I really don't know him.

769
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,960
I'll give you one last chance.

770
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Hei Taoyong.

771
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Hei Taoyong.

772
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
Are you still here?

773
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
You know everything.

774
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
What else can I say?

775
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
What are you doing here?

776
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,960
That year

777
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,960
we set up a shop in the park.

778
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,960
It was very good.

779
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
The shopkeeper and Wang Taiping

780
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,960
were looking for a shopkeeper.

781
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
When we arrived

782
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,960
they came to us.

783
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
Who are you?

784
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,960
I'm Xing Zhaohu.

785
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,960
There are two more.

786
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
One is a watchman.

787
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,960
The other is a construction worker.

788
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
What's your name?

789
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
I don't know.

790
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,960
You're asking Xing Zhaohu?

791
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,960
He's the one who wrote it.

792
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,960
I don't know anything.

793
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
You don't know him?

794
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,960
I don't know him.

795
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
I...

796
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
I really don't know him.

797
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
Let's start from

798
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
Hei Taoyong's case.

799
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,960
Xing Zhaohu

800
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
took Shanhua to wait for the dead

801
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
and then he took the dead.

802
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,960
Wang Taiping

803
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,960
and Yan Xiaowu

804
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
took them to the shop.

805
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
This shop

806
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
is in Yan Xiaowu's old mansion.

807
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,960
Before

808
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,960
Wang Taiping

809
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
was recognized by Xing Zhaohu.

810
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
Xing Zhaohu was in danger.

811
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,960
Wang Taiping took them

812
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,960
to the Law Firm.

813
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,960
When they arrived

814
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,960
they were in the Firm.

815
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
They were not saved.

816
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
They were killed.

817
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
They were brought here

818
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,960
by four contract workers.

819
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,960
They were killed

820
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,960
in the Firm.

821
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,960
They were killed

822
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,960
in the Firm.

823
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,960
Why did they go to the Law Firm?

824
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
The Firm

825
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
is a law firm

826
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
that is

827
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,960
in the Firm.

828
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,960
The Firm is a law firm

829
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
that is in the Firm.

830
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
The Firm is a law firm

831
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
that is in the Firm.

832
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
The Firm is a law firm

833
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,960
that is in the Firm.

834
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,960
The Firm is a law firm

835
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
that is in the Firm.

836
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,960
The Firm is a law firm

837
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,960
that is in the Firm.

838
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,960
Don't stop

839
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,960
I'll go through the ship

840
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,960
and go to the sky

841
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,960
I'll pass my love

842
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,960
and make a wish

843
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,960
I'll ask the world

844
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,960
for a thousand hundred years

845
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,960
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

846
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,960
Who will protect the years

847
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,960
and make a wish

848
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:27,960
I'll go through the ship

849
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,960
and go to the sky

850
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,960
and make a wish

851
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,960
The pain of the heaven

852
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,960
is gone

853
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,960
The yellow river is still flowing

854
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,960
I'll be a man forever

855
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,960
and pretend to be strong

856
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,960
I'll go through the ship

857
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,960
and go to the sky

858
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,960
I'll pass my love

859
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,960
and make a wish

860
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,960
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

861
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,960
I'll ask the world

862
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,960

863
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,960
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

864
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,960
Who will protect the years

865
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,960
and make a wish
