EXaserse

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Story of the Dead

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Mr. Hu.

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What are you doing here?

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You seem to be interested in these exhibition.

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Look.

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Even Yao Qinghan is here.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm here to meet a man.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm here to give you a ride.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're not a big fan of the old man.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're a big fan of the money.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm not a big fan of the money.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I've been working in the business for a long time.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've been working in the business for a long time.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Look at this place.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's a big place.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Of course.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is the 10th anniversary of the Red East.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The 10th anniversary of the Red East.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I met him 20 years ago.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He's a treasured man.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Have you slit hisAD, father?

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There are rats here and cats here.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
They steal it.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
However, if you make that enemy

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
gets down on the ground every in participated camps,

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
we wouldn't even spare them.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're not hungry.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You can make a work out of killing your gratitude.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Right?

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
However, it's like thisimp구요,

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
who cooked for you

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and uses it to be the temple of family freedom.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This rubyTomass

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
on wood.

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,200
It's the same as before.

38
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,160
Don't worry.

39
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,600
I would rather hear you talking about his mellanery.

40
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,820
We really are just one món tender for him.

41
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,880
Look,

42
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,880
what else to do but inform you.

43
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,960
Milk is for two days a week.

44
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,120
Those who TV your novel

45
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,340
why don't you arrange

46
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,200
them one day?

47
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,600
No problem!

48
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,360
Take it easy.

49
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,340
Yes!

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,720
excluded

51
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,840
take a look.

52
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,180
What do I do at Sangcai-Sahua?

53
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,160
One move versus the other.

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,720
For the first time

55
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
This is the picture of this mother.

56
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Yes, yes, yes.

57
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
You are right.

58
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
You can see it.

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
The three-pointed view.

60
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
The river is clear.

61
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
The body is green.

62
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,720
The eyes are beautiful.

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
The two eyes are green.

64
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
You can see it.

65
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
This is the picture of the mother.

66
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
I will draw it.

67
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
I have been here since I was a child.

68
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
It's not easy.

69
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
You Ling.

70
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
If you want to stay here for a day,

71
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
I will go there.

72
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
You are not that big.

73
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
There is no such thing as a good thing.

74
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Let me read it.

75
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,720
I don't dare to.

76
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
You can teach him a lesson.

77
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Good.

78
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,720
The three-pointed view.

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
This is a good thing.

80
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,720
We can't see it.

81
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
It's clear.

82
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
The head is smooth and smooth.

83
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
With a clear vision.

84
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
A good one.

85
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
This is the picture of the mother.

86
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
The father is the mother.

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
I think you are smart.

88
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
You are right.

89
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
You are right.

90
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
This is the picture of the mother.

91
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
This is the picture of the mother.

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
You can see it.

93
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
You can see it.

94
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
You can see it.

95
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
You should know the people behind the table

96
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
that Tang Dynasty is a dirty cultural heritage.

97
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
There's still something good.

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
There's nothing good.

99
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,720
You can't just stand there and watch.

100
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
You have to come here and watch this.

101
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,720
What about the bronze gold?

102
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
This is a piece of cake.

103
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Tang?

104
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
Tang.

105
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
You Ling, if it's Han Tang,

106
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,720
we'll take the money and take the money.

107
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Of course.

108
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
If you want to give it to me,

109
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
we can't avoid people's attention.

110
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,720
You have to pay the debt.

111
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,720
I'll give it to my brother in the garden.

112
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
I'll give it to you.

113
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,720
You don't have the right to have a demon.

114
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,720
You have to do a demon war.

115
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
I'll congratulate you here.

116
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Okay.

117
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Qing, this is a few lines.

118
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
Okay.

119
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Qing, let's watch this.

120
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Okay.

121
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,720
This is Tang's great reputation.

122
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
He's a good woman.

123
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
He's a good woman.

124
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Yes.

125
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
Tang Dynasty is a dirty cultural heritage.

126
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
He's a good woman.

127
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,720
You Ling, you're really a good woman.

128
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Okay.

129
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
What's wrong?

130
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
What's wrong?

131
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
What's wrong?

132
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
What's wrong?

133
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Is it a new job?

134
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
New job?

135
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
You just came out?

136
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
What?

137
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
What's wrong with you?

138
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
You're here to get a job.

139
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
You can't even take a look at me.

140
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Then you should go to the kindergarten and get a job.

141
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
You're a fool.

142
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
You can't get a job.

143
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
You're a fool.

144
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
You're a fool.

145
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
You're a fool.

146
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
You're a fool.

147
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
You're a fool.

148
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
You're a fool.

149
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
You're a fool.

150
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
You're a fool.

151
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
You're a fool.

152
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
You're a fool.

153
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,720
What are you doing?

154
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm going to get a job.

155
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
You go ahead.

156
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
I'll get a job.

157
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
I'll take you to a new job.

158
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
Okay.

159
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
What's wrong?

160
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
You're a fool.

161
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
You're a fool.

162
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
You can't even look at me.

163
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
You're a fool.

164
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,720
How are you, bro?

165
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
I'm fine.

166
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
You're not very well.

167
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
You'll be fine.

168
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
I'll go get some salt.

169
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
I'll get some too.

170
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Bro.

171
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
We're not only good at people.

172
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
We're also good at people.

173
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Come on.

174
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Sit.

175
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Take care of your health.

176
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Okay.

177
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
I'll go get you some.

178
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Okay.

179
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Have some meat.

180
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
Okay.

181
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
San.

182
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Go inside.

183
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Okay.

184
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
Come on.

185
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Bro.

186
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
Are you okay?

187
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
I'm fine.

188
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm fine.

189
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
I'm fine.

190
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
I'm fine.

191
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
I'm fine.

192
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
You're still a fool.

193
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Come here.

194
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Bro.

195
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
I'll get you some water.

196
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Bro.

197
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Come here.

198
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
I'll get you some water.

199
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
I'm fine.

200
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
I'm fine.

201
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Come on.

202
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Come on.

203
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
I'll get you some water.

204
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Come on.

205
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
Come on.

206
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Come on.

207
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
I'll get you some water.

208
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
It's a big house.

209
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
It's a big house.

210
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
It's a big house.

211
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
It's a huge house.

212
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
I'm in a bad mood.

213
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,720
You're going to bury Yan Xiao's team in the forest.

214
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
I'm in a bad mood.

215
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Be careful.

216
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,720
I don't know if I can walk straight.

217
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
I can't walk straight.

218
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Use my sharpposition.

219
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Bro.

220
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
We'll do what you tell us.

221
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
This is getting an experienced driver.

222
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
It's a big house.

223
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
It's a small house.

224
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
You're still a fool.

225
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Don't go there again.

226
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,720
We'll kill you.

227
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
We'll kill you.

228
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Think about it.

229
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Think about it.

230
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Don't tell, don't tell.

231
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
We're going to have legal re-en strokes at the Second,

232
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,600
Small Monster, now please take them.

233
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,400
I play the Long-Run Boss WhooWit.

234
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,120
I don't play Long-Run Boss When,

235
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,120
when it comes to the菜iness of the room

236
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,220
as Paul

237
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,240
wears most superior on the stage.

238
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,720
Is that work?

239
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,600
Yes, it is.

240
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,600
I've already sold the 7-digit goods in Fengjia.

241
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
I'll go get it.

242
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Brother, isn't it a big deal to sell the Zhaoyou Bell?

243
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,600
We don't have to go to the southern part of the country because of him.

244
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
The southern part of the country is also a thief.

245
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
We can't go there.

246
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Zhaoyou Bell is different.

247
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
We went to his hand-picked station today.

248
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
We used the same gold as the Tianwang.

249
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
We just hid in a place with a wide life.

250
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
He's so cruel.

251
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
He's not afraid of the mirror and the door.

252
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
He's a good man.

253
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Even if he's a thief, he can't find out what's wrong.

254
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
The thing we have is a treasure.

255
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,600
It's a treasure that's been sold to the southern part of the country.

256
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
He's a man who's been trained to destroy the cultural relics in the sea.

257
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
You think it's unfair?

258
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,600
The world is a world where anyone who has money,

259
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,600
anyone who has a human being, has to be a person.

260
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
It's not fair to think it's unfair.

261
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,600
We can't just sell the Zhaoyou Bell and sell the Zhaoyou Bell.

262
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
We can just sell it ourselves.

263
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
The Zhaoyou Bell is a gold.

264
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
People ask you what you're doing.

265
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Are you ashamed to say that you're a thief?

266
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
I know that it's our fault.

267
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
We let the cultural relics go first.

268
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
It's our fault.

269
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
The public is their fault.

270
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Wei San.

271
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Don't you think we don't have a person?

272
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
The Zhaoyou Bell is a big tree.

273
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,600
We have to find a way to get it to its place.

274
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Cheng Cheng Liao.

275
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
He's not going to fight with us.

276
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
He's just a thief.

277
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,600
You should avoid the word of the devil in this period.

278
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Brother,

279
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
we can't just leave the Zhaoyou Bell.

280
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
As long as the wall is turned,

281
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,600
we can't go back to the tree.

282
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
What's that?

283
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
A cloud.

284
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
There's a way to get there.

285
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Let's go.

286
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
What's this?

287
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,600
This is the place where the Zhaoyou Bell is.

288
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,600
This is where the Lv family and the Sidani people live.

289
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
It's too long now.

290
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
We can't get in here.

291
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
But we can get in here.

292
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Let's go.

293
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
What a place.

294
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Why are you here?

295
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,600
I'm here to find a way to get in.

296
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
I have a chance for you.

297
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,600
If you can do something,

298
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,600
I'll buy you a place to work.

299
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
I'll buy you a place to work.

300
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
You're so stubborn.

301
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,600
You're just a little girl.

302
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Where is the place?

303
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
I don't know.

304
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
I can't remember where the smoke is.

305
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
I don't know.

306
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
What are you doing here?

307
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm just going to get in.

308
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
What?

309
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
I'm just going to get in.

310
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
What's that?

311
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Who's going to get in?

312
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
I don't know.

313
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
I'm just going to get in.

314
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
I'm going to get in.

315
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
I'm going to get in.

316
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
You're just going to get in.

317
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
What?

318
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
What's wrong with you?

319
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
I'm just going to get in.

320
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,600
I don't know why you're here.

321
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:05,680
The

322
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,600
The

323
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,600
the

324
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Fu Gui, you should go back.

325
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
I'll go with you.

326
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
I'm leaving.

327
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Don't let me finish.

328
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,600
This is a big wish.

329
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
I'm leaving.

330
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
I'm leaving.

331
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Fu Gui,

332
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
you're so stupid.

333
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,600
I can't believe I can see you in here.

334
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,600
If you really have the news, you can still go to the desert.

335
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Fu Gui, you've been a teacher for a lifetime.

336
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Who told you to stop?

337
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,600
You've taught so many students and so many skills.

338
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
You've been a teacher since I was a kid.

339
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
I'm sorry.

340
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
I'm sorry.

341
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,600
I'm sorry.

342
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
I'm sorry.

343
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
I'm sorry.

344
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,600
I'm sorry.

345
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,600
I'm sorry.

346
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,600
I'm sorry.

347
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
It's a big wish.

348
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Okay.

349
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Take it.

350
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Be careful.

351
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Okay.

352
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Take it.

353
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Take it.

354
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Take it.

355
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Go.

356
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Get back to work.

357
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Go.

358
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Fu Gui,

359
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
I've been here for a few years.

360
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
I can't remember anything.

361
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,600
It's like riding in the plane with one carillion on the back.

362
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,600
There're so many tries for the bike.

363
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,940
옛 a piece of paper.

364
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,180
An old motorcycle forgot me.

365
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,820
I'mance behind the rewrite in the village.

366
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,020
We've been praying such a long time with the bike most for so long.

367
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,860
It must be built in front of our village.

368
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,860
We are sorry for the loss of our family.

369
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,860
We should be more careful.

370
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,860
We should take care of you.

371
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,860
What?

372
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,860
Okay.

373
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,860
Let's take care of them.

374
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,860
Not only you.

375
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,860
We should take care of you.

376
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,860
Until we borrow money.

377
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,860
Brother Liu.

378
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,860
We should take care of them.

379
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
Do you dare to lie to me?

380
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,860
I think we should think about it.

381
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,860
Let's fight.

382
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:12,980
The

383
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:21,280
secret,

384
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,680
secret Jerky.

385
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,680
And skills.

386
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Send Shendong.

387
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,080
Send Rel exceptional skill

388
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,580
on them.

389
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:41,680
Anyway,

390
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,580
I'll feed you some.

391
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,800
Okay, no need.

392
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,180
You please come back.

393
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,620
Okay.

394
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,760
You and the Сe.

395
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,560
The confines.

396
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,040
We go up the

397
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,960
K逸's

398
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,680
...

399
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,440
have something else to say to the

400
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,040
mich Mā,

401
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,960
How is he?

402
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
I'm sorry.

403
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
I'm sorry.

404
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
I'm sorry.

405
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
I'm sorry.

406
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
I'm sorry.

407
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
I'm sorry.

408
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
I'm sorry.

409
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
I'm sorry.

410
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
I'm sorry.

411
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
I'm sorry.

412
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Hello, Hu Gang.

413
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
I'm going to the hospital.

414
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
I won't be here today.

415
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
Come on.

416
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
It's over there.

417
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Who's there?

418
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
Don't be silly.

419
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
This is the location of the hospital.

420
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Head of urine.

421
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,000
And the one on the touch-up

422
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,880
Let me ask you a thing for that weak reaction.

423
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840
Wu Si escorted food.

424
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,720
I know.

425
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,960
If I didn't watch me you'd take the heart...

426
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
and take those away.

427
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,920
I'll do anything if you want me to hurry any one minute.

428
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Collect the charts.

429
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Hurry up!

430
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,440
I

431
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,120
I

432
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,280
I'm not good at reading

433
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,960
Walking

434
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,520
Eatalk

435
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,280
цы

436
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,820
Oh, man, that couch is so much meidän

437
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,820
Zhao Youlin's eye contact is high

438
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,820
I can't get into his eyes

439
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,820
Shut up

440
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,820
We are fighting for you

441
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,820
Weisa is a good girl

442
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,820
There is no guarantee that the crime will be done outside

443
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,820
Wang

444
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,820
Look at Zhao Youlin

445
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,820
He is more timid than us

446
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,820
Weisa can stand on the stage

447
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,820
We can only be the scapegoat

448
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,820
You still have to save your wife

449
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,820
We can live a life without money

450
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,820
You can't be a wife

451
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,820
Fine, I know

452
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,820
I will continue

453
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,820
Hu

454
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,820
Don't look at me

455
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,820
I am hungry

456
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,820
I am hungry

457
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,820
I am hungry

458
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,820
Don't lose your face

459
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,820
Let's go

460
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,820
You can't lose your face

461
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,820
I am hungry

462
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,820
What are you doing?

463
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,820
I am here

464
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,820
Why do you come?

465
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,820
I am here to send you away

466
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,820
I am hungry

467
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,820
I can't eat anything

468
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,820
Where is the phone?

469
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,820
Give it to me

470
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,820
Where is the phone?

471
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,820
Give it to me

472
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,820
Give me the old bag

473
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,820
I don't have it

474
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,820
I will call you

475
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,820
What is the phone?

476
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,820
Give it to me

477
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,820
I will call you

478
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,820
I will call you

479
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,820
I am hungry

480
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,820
I am hungry

481
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,820
I am hungry

482
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,820
Don't look at me

483
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,820
I am hungry

484
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,820
I am hungry

485
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,820
Xiaoping

486
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,820
I see you are weak

487
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,820
Jiwen

488
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,820
You can't be a wife

489
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,820
Don't get up

490
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,820
Please

491
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,820
Please

492
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,820
Please

493
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Thank you

494
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,820
Please

495
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,820
Uncle

496
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,820
I have three problems with Dr. He

497
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,820
This problem was found by Dr. Hu

498
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,820
30 years ago

499
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,820
He was in the back of the village

500
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,820
He was in the hospital

501
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
Look

502
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,820
And this

503
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,820
was found by the local police

504
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,820
This was found by the local police

505
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,820
who was in the back of the village

506
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,820
But now we can't find it

507
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,820
How far is the land from the local police?

508
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,820
No

509
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,820
The water is about 50 meters

510
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,820
Last time

511
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,820
you asked about the comparison

512
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,820
I talked to some old friends

513
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,820
They didn't see this kind of situation

514
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,820
But you can guess

515
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,820
It should be a kind of building

516
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,820
If

517
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,820
If it is a person's tomb

518
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,820
Will it be related to the Empress Dowager?

519
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,820
Someone mentioned in the school

520
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,820
that it might be the granddaughter of the Empress Dowager

521
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,820
who is in charge of the princess

522
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,820
Who is the one?

523
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,820
We dare not make any conclusions

524
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,820
I suggest

525
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,820
continue to surround the Black Peach

526
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,820
and then make a more detailed investigation

527
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,820
to see if we can find

528
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,820
more direct evidence

529
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,820
Don't worry, Aunt

530
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,820
We will report this information to the police

531
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,820
Yes

532
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,820
Aren't you two participating?

533
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,820
My holiday is almost over

534
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,820
What are you going to do?

535
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,820
I have to go back to the fishing village

536
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,820
You are so stubborn

537
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,820
You two don't have to go today

538
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,820
to eat with Aunt

539
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
I learned a few dishes

540
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,820
It's good to be a little white mouse

541
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,820
Can you do it?

542
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,820
Let's go

543
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,820
What's wrong with you two?

544
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,820
We are not together

545
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
Don't come

546
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,820
You think Aunt doesn't know anything

547
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,820
You come to Qin Chuan

548
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,820
Isn't it just for the sake of it?

549
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,820
Aunt

550
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,820
Eat a meal and grow up

551
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,820
You really have no idea

552
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,820
You are more than a lover

553
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,820
You are so stubborn

554
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,820
We didn't mention it

555
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,820
You

556
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,820
You are so stupid

557
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,820
I thought you were a thief

558
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,820
I thought you were a sheep

559
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,820
I have been betrayed

560
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,820
I am in the fishing village

561
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,820
I am in the garden

562
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,820
There are 100,000 people in the garden

563
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,820
Isn't it a matter?

564
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,820
It's not fair to him

565
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,820
Besides

566
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,820
I don't know what he thinks

567
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,820
Will he accept this?

568
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,820
I don't care

569
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,820

I don't know.

612
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
You're right.

613
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
I'm not a big man.

614
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
I'm a big man.

615
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,640
I'm not a big man.

616
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,640
I'm a big man.

617
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,640
I can't come to see you.

618
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,640
I'll bring you a bag.

619
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,640
I'll bring you a bag.

620
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,640
Let me show you.

621
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,640
What's wrong?

622
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,640
I'm not feeling well.

623
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,640
What's wrong?

624
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,640
My brother has been in a coma recently.

625
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,640
He's been having a big problem.

626
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,640
He has to give up a lot of things.

627
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,640
Go away.

628
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,640
He's been giving up a lot of things.

629
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,640
He's not ashamed of himself.

630
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,640
What's wrong?

631
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,640
This is a real lie.

632
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,640
He's a lawyer.

633
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Do you know?

634
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,640
His brothers are all cowards.

635
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,640
One of them is called Lv Dalin.

636
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,640
The other one is his family.

637
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,640
I don't know if Lv Dalin can beat you.

638
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,640
Look.

639
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
He's a lawyer.

640
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,640
He's a lawyer.

641
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,640
He's a lawyer.

642
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,640
He's a lawyer.

643
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,640
Do you know that he's a lawyer?

644
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,640
I don't know.

645
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,640
You're so good at drawing.

646
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
I'll show you a few pictures.

647
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,640
Go away.

648
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
I'll show you a book.

649
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,640
I'll show you a book.

650
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,640
Listen.

651
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
I don't have a bag.

652
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,640
I don't have a lot of words.

653
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
I'm always self-sufficient.

654
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,640
I can't write anything.

655
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,640
I can't accept anything that sit at my desk.

656
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,640
My eldest son is very honest.

657
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,640
He doesn't attack hard at all.

658
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,640
He does little thing.

659
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,060
The original drama made them

660
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,560
pity your academics.

661
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,640
Eat yourself up.

662
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,640
He's joke on you.

663
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Brother Sheng.

664
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,640
Really?

665
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,640
Look.

666
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,640
No bit of them do right.

667
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
See if you can feel it.

668
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
That's not a scam.

669
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,640
No, I mean, this time it's really different.

670
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,640
I'm just a little bit of a whore.

671
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,640
I'm just a little bit of a whore.

672
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
It's impossible to get married.

673
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,640
I have a good skill and a good relationship with a good friend.

674
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
What kind of friend are you?

675
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
A good friend?

676
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Me?

677
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,640
Then how can you run to the store in your mother's house?

678
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,640
I'll hang you up.

679
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
How can you do that?

680
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,640
Go and get this off.

681
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
Wait, don't...

682
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
Don't...

683
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,640
This...

684
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
I'll get you a new job and go back to the office to study.

685
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,640
This person wants to learn from you.

686
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,640
Do you know that?

687
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
He's a good guy.

688
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,640
Here, take this job.

689
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,640
Go back to study well.

690
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
We don't have to talk.

691
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,640
Don't worry.

692
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,640
Then you should study well.

693
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,640
Then go back.

694
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,640
Don't be so greedy.

695
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,640
We'll help you out together.

696
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,640
Li Chuan.

697
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,640
Do you see the man in the warehouse?

698
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
He's looking for the man.

699
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
Do you think he's dead?

700
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
Yes.

701
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
Lu Ren Mo.

702
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
Just look.

703
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
I'm not here to sell you.

704
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,640
Sit down.

705
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,640
Sit down.

706
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,640
Give me that.

707
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,640
Look at this.

708
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
I'm not here to sell you.

709
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
I'm here to help you out.

00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640
I'm not here to sell you.

00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
I'm not here to sell you.

713
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
I'm not here to sell you.

714
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
I'm not here to sell you.

715
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
I'm not here to sell you.

00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,640
I'm not here to sell you.

717
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,640
I'm not here to sell you.

718
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
I'm not here to sell you.

719
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,640
I'm not here to sell you.

00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
I'm not here to sell you.

721
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,640
I'm not here to sell you.

722
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,640
Keep it.

723
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,640
Second uh uh

724
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
I don't know any short.

725
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
I'm not here to sell you.

726
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:46,740
I'm not here to

727
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,140

728
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,140
I'm not here to sell you.

729
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
I'm not here to sell you.

730
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,640
Second, we have to get the money back.

731
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,640
We'll get it back.

732
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
Let's go.

733
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
Let's go.

734
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
No, no.

735
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Let's go.

736
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,640
The red one.

737
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
The red one.

738
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,640
Bro, you're faster than me.

739
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,640
Don't be so serious.

740
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,640
Don't be so serious.

741
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,640
Come here.

742
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,640
Come here.

743
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
Come here.

744
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
I'm a little bit slow.

745
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,640
Bro.

746
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Bro.

747
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,640
What do you think?

748
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,640
It's good.

749
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,640
How much?

750
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,640
It's a little bit expensive.

751
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
It's a little bit slow.

752
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,640
How much does the red one cost?

753
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Five yuan.

754
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,640
Five yuan?

755
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
It's ten yuan at least.

756
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,640
I'm a little bit slow.

757
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
It's a little bit expensive.

758
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,640
It's a little bit short.

759
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,640
It's like a flower.

760
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,640
It's a big flat.

761
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
Twenty centimeters.

762
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
It's a little bit low.

763
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,640
It sounds like a demon word.

764
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,640
Demon word means a lot of words.

765
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
People hate it.

766
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,640
It means a lot of things.

767
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,640
It's a little bit expensive.

768
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,640
Let's go.

769
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,640
Come on.

770
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,640
Let's go.

771
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
Let's go.

772
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,640
Let's go.

773
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,640
Let's go.

774
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
Let's go.

775
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
Guang.

776
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Guang.

777
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
I'll ask you something.

778
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,520
Detective Wang.

779
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,380
Have you been seeing the criminal时间 overtime lately?

780
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,240
I don't know.

781
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,380
We were talking about Mo Zan in there.

782
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,700
Didn't we talk to her?

783
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,380
I saw her follow us.

784
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,780
I fell ill for them recently after the fall.

785
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,740
Besides, the criminal stayed like three days.

786
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,980
I forgot he was in Aihara Village.

787
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,100
That place is not good as that.

788
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,140
But I need to hear his garbage talk.

789
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,760
It's not safe to create aêm.

790
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,960
Forget it.

791
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,000
You may tastes it.

792
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I don't know.

793
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
But I've seen a lot of good things.

794
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
But we may have a private company here.

795
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
We can't afford to pay for it.

796
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
We don't know how much we can afford.

797
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
We can't afford to pay for it.

798
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
We can't afford to pay for it.

799
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Okay, Young Master.

800
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Let's go.

801
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Hello, brother.

802
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This is the boss of the famous Mu.

803
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
He's the chief of the Bureau of Rural Affairs.

804
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
We're brothers.

805
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
In the case of Yin Xiang,

806
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
we're four brothers.

807
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
We're in the same family.

808
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
We're four enemies.

809
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Brother Hu,

810
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
we're all sisters.

811
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
We have three brothers.

812
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I'll open the door.

813
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I heard that you're angry.

814
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm angry.

815
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I'm angry.

816
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'll let you have a taste of the document.

817
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
You're so interesting.

818
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I'll show you what you want to see.

819
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Brother, the money is in the pot.

820
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
We have to cut the money.

821
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The boss is the boss.

822
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
We're all filial.

823
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I brought the sincerity.

824
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You can't give me the face.

825
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
If you don't give me the front face,

826
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I can't stand it.

827
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I'm a Chinese.

828
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You're so stuck.

829
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Slow down.

830
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'll show you what you want to see.

831
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
After the shopping thing

832
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
you're like a mouse in the corner.

833
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Is that what you want to do?

834
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm the po소 in three ways.

835
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Ok, you're in a hurry.

836
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Ok.

837
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Go the other way.

838
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Faster.

839
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'll fire him.

840
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Let's go.

841
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
With a fight.

842
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Come.

843
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I want to hear your sincerity.

844
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Five million.

845
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
That's all.

846
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You are as kind as that Xing Zhao Hu.

847
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You have a lot of money.

848
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
You don't even eat pork.

849
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
You even dare to do that to your own family.

850
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
You are so impulsive.

851
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I will do my best.

852
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You are so stupid.

853
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You are so stubborn.

854
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
You are so arrogant.

855
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You are so stubborn.

856
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Xing Zhao Hu is so stubborn.

857
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You two are black-hearted.

858
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You are so stubborn.

859
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You can surely make money.

860
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Don't be so stupid.

861
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You are so stupid.

862
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I will not sell it to you.

863
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I will sell it to you.

864
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Brother, you are so stubborn.

865
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I am still talking.

866
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Let's not be so stubborn.

867
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Don't be so stubborn.

868
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
If you want to make money,

869
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
you have to do it for money.

870
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
If you can't make money,

871
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
you can't make money.

872
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Xiao Guang.

873
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
This is the house of Wu An.

874
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I brought this house with sincerity.

875
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You give me ten days to make it.

876
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I will make it five million yuan.

877
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
If you can make ten days,

878
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
you can make it more expensive than a housekeeper.

879
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You can sell it at any cost.

880
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You see, it will work.

881
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
The sky above my head

882
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
is the moon under my feet

883
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
and I am here

884
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
to take a look at the sky.

885
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
The black map is burning

886
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
and the hot spring is in the rain.

887
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The night is only the spring water

888
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
and the spring spring is in the spring.

889
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
The sky above my head

890
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
is the moon under my feet

891
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
and I am here to take a look at the sky.

892
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
The white map is burning

893
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
and the hot spring is in the rain.

894
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
The sky above my head

895
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
is the moon under my feet

896
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
and I am here to take a look at the sky.

897
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
The moon is only the spring water

898
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
and the hot spring is in the rain.

899
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
The sky above my head

900
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
is the moon under my feet

901
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
and I am here to take a look at the sky.

902
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
The white map is burning

903
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
and the hot spring is in the rain.

904
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
The night is only the spring water

905
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
and the hot spring is in the rain.

906
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
The sky above my head

907
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
is the moon under my feet

908
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
and I am here to take a look at the sky.

909
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
The white map is burning
