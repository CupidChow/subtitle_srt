1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit of a

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
little bit of a

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
little bit of a

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
little bit of a

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit of a

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
little bit of a

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit of a

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit of a

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit of a

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
little bit of a

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
little bit of a

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
little bit of a

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
little bit of a

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
little bit of a

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
little bit of a

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
little bit of

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
a little bit of a

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
little bit of a

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
little bit of a

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
little bit of a

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
斥

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
want

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
my

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,600
I'll hold you. You smell it.

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,080
The bag smells good.

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,360
He's been a horse rider since he was a kid.

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
He can't leave this horse.

31
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,680
He'll be a white horse

32
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,960
after two days.

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
It smells so good.

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,560
It's been a long time.

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,600
It's different.

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
What a pity.

37
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,560
If you don't explain it properly,

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
how can you eat it?

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Wait and see.

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,360
Why did you forget the man in front of you?

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
Captain Qi.

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
There's a man called Gousheng.

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,480
He gave me a job once.

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,120
He said he had a job

45
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
and he wanted to get a job in the county.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,800
Captain Qi, Gousheng is a big name.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,600
He's been busy lately.

48
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
What's the matter?

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,600
He's a good man.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,400
Gousheng is a good man.

51
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
So he's a good man.

52
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Captain Qi, this is Gousheng's house.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Come on.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,400
Why don't you clean it up?

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Here.

56
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
What's wrong?

57
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
It's the government's.

58
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
What are you doing?

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,200
What are you doing?

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
What are you doing?

61
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Tell me.

62
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Where's the house?

63
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
I'm in the countryside.

64
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,400
Where?

65
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,200
In the south.

66
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Which south?

67
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
Tao.

68
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Is there anyone in the house?

69
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,200
Captain Qi, there's no one here.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,200
What are you looking for?

71
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Here.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,200
I just washed my clothes.

73
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm going to sleep.

74
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,200
I don't see any clothes.

75
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,400
Why don't you take off your clothes?

76
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
What? I'm going to take off my clothes.

77
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Take it out and let everyone see it.

78
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Come on.

79
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,400
You want to see this?

80
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
I'll do it.

81
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
You do it.

82
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Gousheng almost killed us.

83
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
Bo bonus

84
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,100
Ok!

85
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,920
Have mercy on me.

86
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,120
Thank you, I'm worry about cho.

87
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Thank you, I'm worried about cho.

88
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,520
If I take it soon enough

89
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
if if I take it soon enough

90
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,720
Don't underestimate me.

91
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,640
What are you two doing?

92
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,160
Chen,

93
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,080
I can't even recognize you.

94
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,280
You're making me angry.

95
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,400
You're so angry.

96
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,680
If you didn't study hard at the kindergarten,

97
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,040
you wouldn't have been able to come here.

98
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,240
I'm so touched.

99
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,280
You're so touched?

100
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,920
You're so mean.

101
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't think I'm touched.

102
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,320
Let me tell you.

103
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,480
You're not worthy of being called a tiger.

104
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,400
You have a fair share.

105
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,440
Do you believe me?

106
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,720
I'll give you a ride to Tangcang.

107
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,800
No, no, no.

108
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,520
This is the cultural park here.

109
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,080
Chen.

110
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,640
Hello.

111
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,320
What are you doing here?

112
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,200
I...

113
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,320
I'm studying archaeology.

114
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,400
I came here with Uncle Shousun

115
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,800
to see if there's any tomb here.

116
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,200
There's no tomb here.

117
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,840
I've been searching this place for 15 or 16 years.

118
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,720
I've never seen any tomb here.

119
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,440
This is the fifth

120
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,720
Chinese cultural and cultural protection unit

121
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,360
in the country.

122
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,080
The search is very tight.

123
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,960
I can tell you with my chest.

124
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,200
It's impossible to find it.

125
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,520
I think Chen is right.

126
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,040
What do you mean?

127
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,880
I've been searching this place for 15 or 16 years.

128
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,920
Since 1956,

129
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,320
it's been rated as the first

130
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,080
Chinese cultural and cultural protection unit in the country.

131
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,600
Since then,

132
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,720
there hasn't been any tomb here.

133
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,680
You're still a reliable person.

134
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,080
Don't you know

135
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,200
that Zilin's tomb is there?

136
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,520
There's no conclusion yet.

137
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,360
But Mr. Wen has recorded that

138
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,320
during the Xi Jin period,

139
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,120
Zilin was named by Chang'an.

140
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,760
Look, look.

141
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,400
He hasn't been there either.

142
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,560
I don't know about the Xi Jin period.

143
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,880
I can give you a big guarantee

144
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,080
about the recent events.

145
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,800
He definitely didn't steal the tomb.

146
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,520
Comrades,

147
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,080
I'm innocent.

148
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,760
I didn't do anything wrong.

149
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,120
What did you do?

150
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,320
You didn't do anything wrong.

151
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,560
I heard that

152
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,320
you caught a bunch of people and came in.

153
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,560
I was scared.

154
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,840
I didn't let them hide.

155
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,720
Someone exposed you.

156
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,320
You did something wrong in the garden.

157
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,080
Did you?

158
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,680
I didn't do anything wrong.

159
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,080
I was wronged.

160
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,120
Look at me.

161
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
You're angry, right?

162
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,960
I'm innocent.

163
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,760
If I did something wrong,

164
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,560
my son wouldn't be like this.

165
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,760
Okay, okay.

166
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,600
Then I'll call the witness

167
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
to face the truth.

168
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,560
I'm telling the truth.

169
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,320
I was wronged.

170
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,080
I was wronged.

171
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,600
Keep your voice down.

172
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,200
Keep your voice down.

173
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,880
I was a fool

174
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,080
to admit that

175
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,920
I was a big shot

176
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,200
and I was a big shot.

177
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,880
I didn't know much about it.

178
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,920
What's your name?

179
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,600
I don't know.

180
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,040
I don't know the name of this business.

181
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,080
I just know that there's a big house on my face.

182
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,240
They call it a big house.

183
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,520
How do people contact you?

184
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,080
I don't know.

185
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,120
They all use public phones.

186
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I also asked.

187
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,280
I asked them what they were doing.

188
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,480
They didn't tell me.

189
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,480
I didn't believe them.

190
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,000
Why didn't you believe them?

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,320
My mom didn't allow me to believe them.

192
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,400
Suddenly,

193
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,920
your dad died.

194
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,120
I asked them for a reason.

195
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,840
My mom is famous in this area.

196
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,880
You don't have to believe them.

197
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,560
You're very smart.

198
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,440
Mom,

199
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,560
I'll send you some words.

200
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,120
Don't say anything you don't like.

201
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,760
There's one more thing I want to ask you.

202
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,360
I want to change my job.

203
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,920
Please bless me.

204
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,880
I'll work hard.

205
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,000
Can you do that?

206
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,800
Mom,

207
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,600
I know.

208
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
I can't do it.

209
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Dad, please introduce yourself.

210
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,800
No, no.

211
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,000
I really don't want to do this.

212
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,400
I'm old.

213
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,000
What if I get something wrong?

214
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
I can't even live well this year.

215
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
I have to work hard.

216
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,600
What can you do?

217
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Mr. Jiang,

218
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
I'm sorry.

219
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,400
I'm not a carpenter.

220
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,800
Carpenter?

221
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,000
If you're a carpenter,

222
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,400
you're a carpenter.

223
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,200
Don't say that.

224
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
I'm a carpenter.

225
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,800
I'll keep you company.

226
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll let you work in the house.

227
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
I'll make you wine.

228
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,600
Joe velocity

229
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,800
�

230
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,160
to cover their explosion.

231
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,480
Let the painter

232
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,640
draw a big house portrait with the dog.

233
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,840
Brother!

234
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,040
You're from the new house, right?

235
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,920
Yes, I am.

236
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,360
What's wrong?

237
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,600
I lost my black hair.

238
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,800
Tell me about it again.

239
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,200
I lost my black hair.

240
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,240
I'm new.

241
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
I heard a dog barking in the ground.

242
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,040
I wanted to draw it black.

243
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,360
I went to write it.

244
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,840
But I met two people.

245
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,560
I asked them,

246
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,280
have you seen my dog?

247
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,720
I saw it.

248
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,680
It was sitting on the road.

249
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,560
What's wrong with the dog?

250
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,880
It's been too long.

251
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,160
It's dark outside.

252
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,520
I can't remember.

253
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,160
Why are you so blind?

254
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,960
You're 80 years old.

255
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,960
It's dark outside.

256
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,560
Let me see.

257
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,120
Come on.

258
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,280
Let me see.

259
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,200
Who is this?

260
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,960
What are you looking for?

261
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,880
Go, go, go.

262
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,920
Don't say I'm not afraid of snakes.

263
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,640
But I remember this house.

264
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,400
I think it's this person.

265
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,040
This person?

266
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,080
I remember this house.

267
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,480
Let me go to that place and have a look.

268
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,000
Be careful.

269
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,520
It's here.

270
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,440
Don't let them see you.

271
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,440
This way?

272
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,160
Yes.

273
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,880
It's here.

274
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,320
I don't know.

275
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,120
I'm asking you.

276
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,720
You came here and saw this person.

277
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,520
You should have taken this person away.

278
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,880
I didn't touch him.

279
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,480
You saw it, right?

280
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,080
I saw it.

281
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,400
You saw it yourself.

282
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,520
You saw it.

283
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,680
Listen to me.

284
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,880
This is the house.

285
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,200
You saw it yourself.

286
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,080
I didn't touch him.

287
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,840
You didn't recognize me.

288
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,200
What should I do?

289
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,640
You should have taken him away.

290
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,520
What should I do?

291
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,640
What should I do?

292
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,520
Look at the ground.

293
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,160
There are many things on the ground.

294
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,720
It's possible that it's a hole.

295
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,800
What should I do?

296
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,520
What should I do?

297
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,640
What should I do if I fall down?

298
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,560
He really bit me.

299
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,400
It's okay.

300
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,360
It's okay.

301
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
So many people are here.

302
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,640
Look at you.

303
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,440
Look at you.

304
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
You are so beautiful.

305
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,520
Listen to me.

306
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,760
I'm sweating.

307
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Brother Chang.

308
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,400
So many people are watching.

309
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,320
Brother Chang.

310
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,600
This kid wants to kill me.

311
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,880
He beat me up.

312
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,480
I feel so bad.

313
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,760
Did you eat?

314
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,960
I didn't eat.

315
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,000
I couldn't hold myself.

316
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What else should I eat?

317
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,560
I'm starving.

318
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,040
I'm so sour.

319
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,440
I can't live.

320
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,080
This is the South Gate.

321
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,600
It's full of firecrackers.

322
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,680
It's full of firecrackers.

323
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,440
It's beautiful.

324
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,760
I'm moving the bowl.

325
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,480
I have to dig the hole.

326
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,840
What do you think I can do?

327
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,000
Look at the ground.

328
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,600
If I can dig a hole,

329
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,800
how can I put the ground?

330
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,680
I can't put the ground.

331
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,280
It's a waste of time.

332
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,360
Look at you.

333
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,920
Can you do it?

334
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,240
It's half an hour.

335
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,320
I'll dig it.

336
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,640
If there's nothing,

337
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,400
I'll fill it up for you.

338
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,600
It's okay.

339
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,960
If there's nothing,

340
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,800
I'll keep the time.

341
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,600
I'll keep the time.

342
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,080
I promise.

343
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,480
I can't do it.

344
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,200
You're so mean.

345
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,480
Well,

346
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,880
look at you.

347
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,400
It's up to you.

348
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,520
You have to keep your promise.

349
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,160
Keep your promise.

350
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,640
I'll keep my promise.

351
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,560
Xiaowen.

352
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,320
Come on.

353
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,760
You choose.

354
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,600
Come on.

355
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,440
Get out.

356
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,440
Are you stupid?

357
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,840
Don't be stupid.

358
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
What is deywith?

359
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
Look,

360
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,240
everyone is sharp here.

361
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,560
If you could see you~~~

362
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,600
Look,

363
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,640
look,

364
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
look at her!

365
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,080
She...

366
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,600
You think so?

367
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,240
But my return would lead me nowhere and to where I need to go.

368
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,760
So I can take aRed And Offkopia into space.

369
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,120
Do I really need to ask you this?

370
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,360
But I'm the same as you.

371
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,640
Take me to my house.

372
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,760
Understood?

373
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,120
I see.

374
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,040
The same as you.

375
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,700
Mom.

376
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,460
Mom.

377
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,340
Why did you kill my dad?

378
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,760
Mom.

379
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,840
You really favorite it that it m awkward you can

383
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,720
Ac refined women

384
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,640
I will continue drink even as ->

385
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,600
you will not fall in love

386
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,800
No

387
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,760
That's it I will find it first

388
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,680
And tell you later

389
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,700
Ok

390
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,640
Be patient

391
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,680
Now people in the village say that devils steal foods

392
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,680
Yes

393
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,600
You will have it

394
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,640
You guys leave now

395
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,720
don't be afraid

396
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,000
for the sake of my family.

397
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,840
I'll just give you a little bit of my money.

398
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,320
I have a lot of money in the village.

399
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,640
I can't give you any explanation.

400
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,320
Okay, okay, okay.

401
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,200
Uncle Mai said that

402
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,280
the local people in this village

403
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,320
are a little bit reluctant.

404
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,480
Why don't you go back first?

405
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,440
I'm not leaving.

406
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,200
I can't leave.

407
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,560
I have to find a hole.

408
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,600
Director, I promise you

409
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,880
I will never affect their family business.

410
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,920
If you do something wrong,

411
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,400
I'll tell you.

412
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,160
I can't wipe your ass.

413
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,360
Okay.

414
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,800
Look, is this going to work?

415
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,840
Is this going to work?

416
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,640
We don't allow the land to be planted.

417
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,760
The land is planted.

418
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,920
When planting the land,

419
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,120
you have to pay attention to

420
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,320
where the land is planted,

421
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,600
and what kind of land is not planted.

422
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,520
It's a timely report.

423
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,560
Okay?

424
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,440
There's another thing.

425
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,240
This is the person who plays the snake game.

426
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Can you give him the name card?

427
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,880
What?

428
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,240
I got it.

429
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
I have more than two thousand people.

430
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
How can I remember it?

431
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,400
No, no.

432
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,120
It's not a snake.

433
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,080
It's a person.

434
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
It's the name of the village.

435
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,560
Right?

436
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,040
Come on.

437
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,800
Get out of here.

438
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,560
I can't remember.

439
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,320
Did you fall into a gunshot?

440
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Uncle, Uncle.

441
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Uncle.

442
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
I think it's the snake.

443
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
It's possible.

444
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Uncle, what are you doing?

445
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
What are you doing?

446
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Uncle Yan, Uncle Yan.

447
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
I'm your uncle.

448
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
I've been searching every day.

449
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,320
I can't find the snake.

450
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
Uncle, don't worry.

451
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
It's just very possible now, right?

452
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Uncle, go back and draw a picture.

453
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,320
You can draw the picture of our village.

454
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Okay.

455
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
You draw the picture of the land

456
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
of our village.

457
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Let's take our time.

458
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
Can you do it?

459
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
Okay.

460
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
I'm sorry.

461
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
I'll go back now.

462
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
Okay, okay.

463
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
Slow down.

464
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
Don't worry.

465
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
Hello, what's up?

466
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Why are you back so early?

467
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
I haven't finished yet.

468
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Wait,

469
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
why are you free today?

470
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,320
I'm busy.

471
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
I'm not going to let you go.

472
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
Great.

473
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,320
Come to the park.

474
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,320
Bring me something.

475
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
This is the list of all the villages

476
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
in Weitian's social life.

477
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,320
I want to take a picture of all these villages.

478
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,320
I'll get someone to investigate with you.

479
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
This is the portrait of the big house.

480
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
This person has no impression.

481
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
But

482
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
I've asked many people

483
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
and they said they didn't recognize him.

484
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
He shouldn't be a old man.

485
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
And

486
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
the dog is the same size as his uncle.

487
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
Does he look like a good dog?

488
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Yes.

489
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
Shicheng,

490
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
send the portrait to the big house.

491
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
Send the portrait to the big house.

492
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
This is the feature.

493
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
Send all the names to the big house.

494
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Send it.

495
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
Send it, uncle.

496
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
Send it.

497
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Uncle,

498
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
I have something to tell you.

499
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Go ahead.

500
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Take a look.

501
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
Where is this person?

502
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,320
I haven't seen him.

503
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
There is a house on the face of the village.

504
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Look here.

505
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
What?

506
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
A house on the face.

507
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
And send it to him.

508
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Zhiren.

509
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,320
Zhiren.

510
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
Zhiren,

511
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
you've been awake for four years.

512
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,320
I've been sleeping for five minutes.

513
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
Have you slept?

514
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
I've slept.

515
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,320
Who slept?

516
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,320
Dad,

517
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
mom,

518
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
do you still have my wife?

519
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:28,260
This is the house of the

520
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,260
Who are you?

521
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,260
His friend.

522
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,260
He went out to eat and play cards.

523
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,260
He went out to work.

524
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,260
When did he go to school?

525
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,260
He left in the middle of the year.

526
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,260
He saw you study.

527
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,260
You are the one who took care of me.

528
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,260
Yes, I've seen him.

529
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,260
He left that day.

530
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,260
He left.

531
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,260
When will he come back?

532
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,260
I don't know.

533
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,260
Welcome, welcome.

534
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,260
You just came.

535
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,260
Mr. Luo is here too.

536
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,260
So many things.

537
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,260
How can I take them all alone?

538
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,260
I thought you were going to tie them up.

539
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,260
Why do you have so many things?

540
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,260
Search for three.

541
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,260
I don't care.

542
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,260
Let's go.

543
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,260
Give me that.

544
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
I'll take it.

545
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,260
I'll take it.

546
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,260
I'll take it.

547
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,260
I'll take it.

548
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
I'll take it.

549
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
I'll take it.

550
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,260
I'll take it.

551
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
I'll take it.

552
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,260
I'll take it.

553
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
I'll take it.

554
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,260
I'll take it.

555
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,260
I'll take it.

556
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,260
I'll take it.

557
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,260
I'll take it.

558
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,260
I didn't see that Mr. Luo is a good person.

559
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,260
I didn't come to give you food and drink.

560
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,260
I also want to see what you found in Bailu Garden for so long.

561
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,260
Don't you say there really is.

562
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,260
We have basically locked it.

563
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,260
The hole is in the village.

564
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,260
The forest of Phoenix Mountain is a few kilometers away from the village.

565
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,260
The forest is farther away.

566
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,260
The closest one is the 1500-meter-long fight.

567
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,260
How could it be here?

568
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:56,260
So don't you think things are getting more and more interesting?

569
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,260
What else can I do?

570
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,260
I'll put it back for you.

571
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
We'll be back.

572
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,260
Okay.

573
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,260
What do you plan to do?

574
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
What plan?

575
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,260
Continue to look for it.

576
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,260
Hua,

577
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,260
you have to fight this chess.

578
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,260
Guo, we've been classmates for years.

579
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Why don't you understand me at all?

580
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,260
What?

581
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,260
Mr. Luo,

582
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,260
I used to fight chess.

583
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
Isn't it now?

584
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,260
Black Peach has it.

585
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
What is that?

586
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
High-level funeral.

587
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,260
If it really comes out of the village, how do you explain it?

588
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,260
The phrase on the tree,

589
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,440
the sweat of the

590
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,260
capital is 20, the goods are treasure,

591
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,260
leads me here.

592
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,260
The more I walk,

593
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,260
the more I find the number in my head.

594
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,260
The ancients didn't bully me.

595
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,260
The book came to the end.

596
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,260
I know this is going to work.

597
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,260
Before, I might think

598
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,260
I'm right or I'm wrong.

599
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,260
Is it our teacher's right or our teacher's wrong?

600
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,260
But I don't think these are important now.

601
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,260
Even if I'm wrong, I can do it.

602
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,260
I'm an adult.

603
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,260
I can take the consequences of my mistakes.

604
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,260
But I've given up now.

605
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,260
I regret it all my life.

606
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,260
So now I just want to know

607
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,260
where the exact location of this hole is.

608
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,260
It's that simple.

609
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,260
Sit.

610
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,260
What he said makes sense.

611
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,260
Then I'll stay and look for it with you.

612
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,260
Go.

613
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,260
Are you sure?

614
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,260
I'm sure.

615
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
If you stay,

616
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,260
then you...

617
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,260
I...

618
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,260
I'll do it.

619
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,260
Sister-in-law,

620
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,260
you're free.

621
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,260
Why are you here?

622
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,260
I...

623
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,260
I'm here to apologize to you.

624
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,260
I don't want to.

625
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,260
What are you doing?

626
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
I was wrong that day.

627
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,260
Captain Qi has told me to take it.

628
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,260
If that day you were here,

629
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,260
you would have never come.

630
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,260
Captain.

631
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,260
Where did the dog come from?

632
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260
You're right. I'm right.

633
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Hurry up and get the dog.

634
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,260
Sister, do you have any clues?

635
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,260
Give me.

636
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,260
Fang Kun.

637
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,260
Come and save me.

638
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
Where did the dog come from?

639
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
It's...

640
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,260
Look.

641
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,260
It's like a dog that doesn't have a seed in the ground.

642
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,260
Your boyfriend taught you.

643
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,260
It's okay. Let him figure it out.

644
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,260
Is there a friend's dog

645
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,260
that is close to you?

646
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,260
Your boyfriend is afraid of dogs.

647
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,260
He jumped on the wall.

648
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,260
No, no.

649
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,260
Fang Kun.

650
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,260
Fang Kun, come here.

651
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,260
He's going to bite my book.

652
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,260
He's gone.

653
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,260
Fang Kun.

654
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,260
Can't you hear me?

655
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,260
You're so annoying.

656
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,260
Luo Qing.

657
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,260
Why are you still angry?

658
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,260
Do I look pretty when I'm angry?

659
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,260
Am I that despicable in your heart?

660
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,260
You can't be despicable.

661
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,260
But you can't be happy

662
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,260
when you're short of someone.

663
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,260
You admit that you're afraid of dogs.

664
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
You can change your mind, right?

665
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,260
This time I'm here.

666
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
I can help you get rid of them.

667
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
What if I'm not here next time?

668
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,260
What if you're alone?

669
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
I can't leave you.

670
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,260
Miss.

671
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,260
Hello.

672
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,260
Have you seen this person?

673
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,260
Mr. Jing, please give me the details.

674
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,260
I'm so familiar with him.

675
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,260
Maybe he's in a hurry.

676
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,260
No.

677
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,260
He's coming to me.

678
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,260
Miss.

679
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,260
I want to ask you.

680
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
It's the first day of the lunar month.

681
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,260
Do you have time to visit the snake farm?

682
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,260
I do.

683
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,260
What's your name?

684
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,260
Yan Xiaowu.

685
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,260
Yan Xiaowu.

686
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,260
Yan Xiaowu.

687
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,260
I heard someone in your village

688
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,260
has bitten a snake.

689
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,260
Have you ever bitten it?

690
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,260
I've never bitten it.

691
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,260
Then,

692
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,260
if you want to tell me something,

693
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,260
please report to your village.

694
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,260
I'll do it.

695
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,260
Let's go.

696
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,260
Why are you here in the middle of the night?

697
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,260
Are you here to report?

698
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,260
No.

699
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,260
I'm here to report today.

700
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,260
I checked the goods and went to the village.

701
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,260
Especially,

702
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,260
in this big house.

703
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,260
What's wrong with you?

704
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,260
You're a loser.

705
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,260
You're a loser.

706
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,260
I think you should go out and hide.

707
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,260
Come back when you're done.

708
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,260
A little bit forward.

709
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,260
No, I'm afraid it'll bite me.

710
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,260
Don't be afraid.

711
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,260
Don't pee.

712
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,260
Good girl.

713
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,260
Good girl.

714
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,260
Don't pee.

715
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,260
Yes, go forward.

716
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,260
How far is it?

717
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,260
It's far.

718
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,260
Go forward.

719
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,260
Don't pee.

720
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,260
I've decided to give up.

721
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,260
Good girl.

722
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,260
Enough?

723
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,260
A little bit.

724
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,260
Don't pee.

725
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,260
Go forward.

726
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,260
Go forward.

727
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,260
Almost there.

728
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,260
Almost there.

729
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,260
Uncle Shou Zun.

730
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,260
How far is it?

731
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,260
Uncle Shou Zun.

732
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,260
How far is it?

733
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,260
Go forward and you'll be there.

734
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,260
You're relieved now?

735
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,260
I'll practice with you.

736
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,260
You're practicing well.

737
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,260
It won't bite you.

738
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,260
Try again.

739
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,260
Don't touch it so suddenly.

740
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,260
Just put it on her gently.

741
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,260
You're holding her.

742
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,260
I'm holding her.

743
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,260
Trust me, okay?

744
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,260
Relax.

745
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,260
Just touch your friend.

746
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,260
It seems...

747
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,260
it's quite obedient.

748
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,260
How obedient?

749
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,260
Right?

750
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,260
It's really...

751
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,260
The doll likes me.

752
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,260
If you two like each other...

753
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,260
It's good if you can touch it.

754
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,260
I won't hold it.

755
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,260
At least I can touch it now.

756
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,260
You don't have to laugh at me.

757
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,260
Luo Qing, to be honest,

758
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,260
I've never laughed at you.

759
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,260
What's the dog's name?

760
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
Black-mouthed.

761
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,260
Black-mouthed doll.

762
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,260
Black-mouthed doll?

763
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,260
You asked your uncle to hold it back?

764
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,260
I asked him to hold it back and let me practice.

765
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,260
I don't want you to laugh at me.

766
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
Come on.

767
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,260
The dog is so obedient.

768
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,260
Look.

769
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,260
Touch it again.

770
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,260
Black-mouthed.

771
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,260
Don't bite me.

772
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,260
Touch it. It's okay.

773
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,260
It's so obedient.

774
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,260
Look, I won't touch it.

775
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,260
It won't bite you.

776
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,260
I really appreciate you.

777
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
You're right.

778
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,260
It's a long story to meet a dog in the field.

779
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,260
I can't always rely on others to drive the dog for me.

780
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,260
Uncle Shou Quan said

781
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,260
Black-mouthed's father was killed by the tomb raider.

782
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,260
So he will avenge his father.

783
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,260
Black-mouthed,

784
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,260
I'm going to take you to the tomb tomorrow.

785
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,260
Black-mouthed.

786
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,260
Brother San,

787
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,260
I told Brother Shou not to be too worried.

788
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,260
Brother,

789
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
what's wrong?

790
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,260
What?

791
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
The police are trying to take Taiping.

792
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
What?

793
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,260
How can we find him?

794
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,260
I don't know.

795
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,260
I know the police are looking for someone

796
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,260
who has a big house in the village.

797
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,260
This is not the police, but the police.

798
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,260
I'll go first.

799
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,260
Tell Taiping to run away in advance.

800
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,260
Otherwise, I'll have you take him away.

801
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,260
Are you crazy?

802
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,260
Who told you to tell him to run away?

803
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,260
If you don't run away,

804
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,260
you'll be caught.

805
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,260
Can you be more smart?

806
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,260
No.

807
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,260
The police only know who has a big house.

808
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,260
The police are in charge of the situation.

809
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,260
We all have a big house.

810
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,260
How do they know who it is?

811
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,260
You told him to run away.

812
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,260
Isn't this a perfect place?

813
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,260
Where is he?

814
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,260
Tell him to get back.

815
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,260
Okay.

816
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,260
Tell him to keep the order.

817
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,260
Even if he is called to Wenhua,

818
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,260
don't be afraid.

819
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,260
The police don't know anything.

820
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,260
I know.

821
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,260
I'm going to contact him by phone.

822
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,260
Okay.

823
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,260
Go.

824
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,260
Have you got the information about the incident?

825
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,260
Yes.

826
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,260
There are eight villages in the city

827
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,260
that participated in the operation.

828
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,260
After the investigation,

829
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,260
there are 23 people in the house.

830
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,260
They are all local people.

831
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,260
Out of 20 people,

832
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,260
they all left with the villagers.

833
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,260
The president didn't leave

834
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,260
and didn't do anything.

835
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,260
The other three people,

836
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
Li Zhimo, Lian Yishang,

837
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
should be from the original village.

838
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,260
Okay.

839
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,260
The next task is

840
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,260
to investigate these three people.

841
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:31,260
Welcome to the land of the Pacific.

842
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,260
I'm here to help him.

843
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,260
I'm here to help him.

844
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,260
Don't break it.

845
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,260
You are not my son.

846
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,260
Where are you going?

847
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,260
What kind of people are they?

848
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,260
I'm not going to land.

849
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Hurry up.

850
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,260
Where are you going?

851
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,260
Get out of the way.

852
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,260
You are blocking the way.

853
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,260
We can discuss it.

854
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,260
Do you have to be here?

855
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,260
Get out of the way.

856
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,260
You are not my son.

857
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
You are not my son.

858
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
It's a tough task.

859
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,260
Let's go.

860
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,260
What are you going to do?

861
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,260
Let's go.

862
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,260
What are you doing?

863
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,260
Let's go.

864
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,260
Go back.

865
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,260
Go back.

866
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,260
I see.

867
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,260
Go back.

868
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,260
Hurry up.

869
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,260
What's your name?

870
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,260
I'm Wang Taiping.

871
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,260
You are nervous.

872
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,260
How can I be nervous?

873
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,260
What should I say?

874
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,260
It's the first day of the lunar month.

875
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
You go to the village.

876
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,260
The first day of the lunar month?

877
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
Are you crazy?

878
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,260
You forgot the menu.

879
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
Yes.

880
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,260
You are crazy.

881
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,260
The village is busy.

882
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,260
They are all going to the village.

883
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,260
Who is going?

884
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,260
Everyone.

885
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,260
They are going to the village.

886
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,260
When will they come back?

887
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,260
They will come back at noon.

888
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
When?

889
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,260
I don't know.

890
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,260
I will go soon.

891
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,260
Yes.

892
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,260
They will come back.

893
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,260
Uncle Jiang,

894
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,260
why are you asking this?

895
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,260
I have a question.

896
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,260
What is it?

897
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
The debt you pay every day.

898
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,260
I pay it every day.

899
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,260
You are married.

900
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,260
You are married.

901
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,260
You should be more mature.

902
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,260
You should be more mature.

903
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,260
Go back.

904
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,260
Okay.

905
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
Let's go.

906
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,260
Go.

907
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,260
There is a place to lie to you.

908
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,260
What are you doing?

909
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,260
What's going on?

910
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,260
They just came back.

911
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,260
You are a pervert.

912
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,260
You broke into our house.

913
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,260
You pervert.

914
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,260
You don't let go of the woman.

915
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,260
You don't let go of the woman.

916
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,260
I will kill you.

917
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,260
Shut up.

918
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,260
Who is she?

919
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,260
Look carefully.

920
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,260
Is she the same woman

921
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,260
you saw before?

922
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,260
I...

923
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
I...

924
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
I forgot.

925
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,260
Didn't you say

926
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,260
you saw a black woman?

927
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,260
Well,

928
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,260
I gave her too much time.

929
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
I forgot.

930
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,260
I am not a chicken.

931
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,260
I feel like I am different.

932
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,260
Where did you lie?

933
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,260
I am from Africa.

934
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,260
I put a face mask on my face.

935
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,260
No way.

936
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,260
No way.

937
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
She told me everything.

938
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,260
The person who used the mask

939
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,260
in your family during the Chinese New Year

940
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,260
is the same as the one who used the mask.

941
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,260
I don't look like a pervert.

942
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,260
How can I look like that?

943
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,260
What's the difference?

944
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,260
I have arms.

945
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,260
Except for arms,

946
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
head, body,

947
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
what's the difference?

948
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
I...

949
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,260
I am a student.

950
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,260
I am a student.

951
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,260
I am from the south.

952
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,260
I am from the south.

953
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,260
I am from the south.

954
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,260
I am from the south.

955
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,260
You look like a pervert.

956
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,260
Where did you lie?

957
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
I am from Africa.

958
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,260
I put a face mask on my face.

959
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,260
I put a face mask on my face.

960
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,260
Uncle Jian,

961
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
you should have listened to him.

962
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,260
I was just playing with him.

963
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,260
The Chinese New Year is coming.

964
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,260
He just looked at me.

965
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,260
How can I be so clear about it?

966
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,260
You are young.

967
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,260
You are just a pervert.

968
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,260
Do you know what crime you committed?

969
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,260
Do you know?

970
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,260
You stole the country's old mother.

971
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,260
If you don't tell others,

972
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,260
we will treat you as a criminal.

973
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,260
If you tell others

974
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,260
that you want to be punished,

975
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,260
I will kill you.

976
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,260
You are not worth three lives.

977
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,260
You light it yourself.

978
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,260
You should tell me honestly.

979
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,260
What did you do in Yin Village?

980
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,260
We were really fast.

981
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,260
Xiage.

982
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,260
Anyone else?

983
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,260
Lian Xiaowu.

984
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,260
Is Lian Xiaowu there?

985
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,260
He is not there.

986
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,260
Come here.

987
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,260
Relax.

988
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,260
Where did you go?

989
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,260
I don't know.

990
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:48,260
This time, it was Yan Xiaowu who woke up.

991
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,260
It was almost New Year.

992
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,260
I still have a batch of rags that I haven't returned.

993
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,260
It seems that this year has not passed.

994
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,260
It's getting dark.

995
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,260
Yan Xiaowu woke up.

996
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,260
He said that there was a job that cost him a lot of money.

997
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,260
He kept saying that he was going to dig a grave every day.

998
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,260
I said, no, no, no.

999
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,260
This time, you can't go anywhere.

1000
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,260
Yan Xiaowu said that he didn't need to dig a grave.

1001
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,260
He just wanted to go to the grave.

1002
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:20,260
One day, he went to the grave to get some rags.

1003
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,260
When he was about to leave,

1004
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,260
he and Yan Xiaowu went to the cemetery.

1005
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,260
They waited for the rags to be taken away.

1006
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:33,260
Then Yan Xiaowu went to the grave to get something.

1007
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,260
He didn't go to the grave.

1008
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,260
When you say that you went to the grave,

1009
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,260
you mean another batch of people?

1010
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,260
How many people are there in the batch?

1011
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,260
There are four people.

1012
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,260
I don't know who did it.

1013
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,260
Yan Xiaowu didn't tell me.

1014
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,260
He arranged everything.

1015
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,260
After he finished the job,

1016
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,260
he came to ask me to go to the grave.

1017
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,260
He went to the grave.

1018
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,260
I don't know who did it.

1019
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,260
Then what did you do?

1020
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,260
Nothing.

1021
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:17,260
I just dug a grave.

1022
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,260
How many people exactly?

1023
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,260
I don't know.

1024
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,260
I just hid a lot.

1025
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:29,260
It's not worth it to hide in the grave.

1026
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,260
It's only 2500 yuan.

1027
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,260
Wang Taiping,

1028
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:42,260
you lost a lot of money for 2500 yuan.

1029
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,260
Do you know how much it is?

1030
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,260
Some things have been left abroad.

1031
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,260
You lost a lot of money for the country.

1032
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:54,260
It's not worth it to lose a million.

1033
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,260
What do you mean?

1034
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,260
What do you mean?

1035
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:04,260
There are many things that can be calculated.

1036
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,260
But they can't be calculated.

1037
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,260
Are you sure that Wang Taiping and Yan Xiaowu

1038
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,260
are both from Luma Kang?

1039
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,260
Are you sure?

1040
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,260
Wang Taiping was just caught by the news.

1041
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,260
I've asked around.

1042
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,260
I sent Yan Xiaowu and I to see the goods.

1043
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,260
What does it have to do with the tomb?

1044
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,260
Yan Xiaowu and the tomb

1045
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,260
are on the same watch.

1046
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,260
How can the tomb be free?

1047
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,260
Brother, I'm your brother-in-law.

1048
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,260
You can look at it.

1049
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:50,260
Brother, do you want to send Yan Xiaowu to our house?

1050
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,260
Yes.

1051
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,260
I want to go to his place.

1052
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,260
Come.

1053
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,260
Song Hua, what should we do?

1054
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,260
Eat.

1055
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,260
Eat the bread.

1056
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,260
Eat the bread.

1057
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,260
Brother, what's going on outside?

1058
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,260
Can we escape?

1059
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,260
We can't escape now.

1060
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,260
This is the entrance to the cage.

1061
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,260
It's dark.

1062
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,260
The more dangerous the place, the safer it is.

1063
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,260
You stay here for a few days.

1064
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,260
When the police come, I'll send you away.

1065
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:14,260
Brother, I'm almost crazy here.

1066
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,260
You won't leave me alone, will you?

1067
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,260
We're on the same boat.

1068
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,260
If you get in, do I have a way out?

1069
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,260
You can run, but I can't.

1070
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,260
I can't leave you alone.

1071
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,260
Eat the bread.

1072
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,260
I'm going to get it myself.

1073
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,260
I'll figure something out.

1074
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,260
Captain Qi.

1075
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,260
We just caught the thief.

1076
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,260
The thief is in the dark.

1077
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,260
We'll send someone to identify the thief.

1078
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,260
Okay.

1079
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,260
We found the thief.

1080
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,260
He's in the dark.

1081
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,260
Let's go.

1082
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,260
The night is dark.

1083
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,260
The night is dark.

1084
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,260
The night is dark.

1085
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,260
The night is dark.

1086
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,260
The night is dark.

1087
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,260
The night is dark.

1088
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,260
The night is dark.

1089
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,260
The night is dark.

1090
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,260
The night is dark.

1091
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,260
The night is dark.

1092
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,260
The night is dark.

1093
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,260
The night is dark.

1094
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,260
The night is dark.

1095
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,260
The night is dark.

1096
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,260
The night is dark.

1097
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,260
The night is dark.

1098
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,260
The night is dark.

1099
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,260
The night is dark.

1100
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,260
The night is dark.

1101
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,260
The night is dark.

1102
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,260
The night is dark.

1103
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,260
The night is dark.

1104
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,260
The night is dark.

1105
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,260
The night is dark.

1106
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,260
The night is dark.

1107
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,260
The night is dark.

1108
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,260
The night is dark.

1109
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,260
The night is dark.

1110
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,260
The night is dark.

1111
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,260
The night is dark.

1112
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,260
The night is dark.

1113
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,260
The darkness returns to dawn.

1114
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,260
Towards the nightfall,

1115
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,260
겁니다 tha ruo май

fal caayaw

1117
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,860
Without rest and suffocation,
