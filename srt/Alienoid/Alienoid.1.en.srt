2
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,640
For a long, long time,

3
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,490
aliens have kept their criminals locked up in human bodies.

4
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,600
But humans were unaware.

5
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,910
The aliens that could enter and exit humans at will

6
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,020
were called Paro.

7
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,270
Up there!

8
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,350
Kill it!

9
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,640
Over there!

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,640
The heavens have opened...

11
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:24,390
Case number 78247 - 268 trillion years have elapsed since awakening.

12
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,850
There have been human casualties.

13
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,250
We have to catch the prisoner before they escape into another body.

14
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,380
Track its location.

15
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,530
Prisoner is on the move. 35 meters.

16
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,980
30 meters.

17
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,580
Prisoner is approaching.

18
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,200
Don't worry.

19
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,070
I am unharmed.

20
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,640
I wasn't asking.

21
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,900
It's returning to its body!

22
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,240
Commencing extraction.

23
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,490
We'll keep coming.

24
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,760
I'm not the last one.

25
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,600
You guard bastards-

26
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,360
You're done for.

27
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,470
Mission complete.

28
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,570
Return to base.

29
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,650
My baby... please save her...

30
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,130
Oh!

31
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,130
A baby!

32
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,930
We don't get involved in human affairs.

33
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,290
I've heard that. 'I'm sorry, but we don't get involved.'

34
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,130
Hang on.

35
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,460
I have to shoot it!

36
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,980
Did you say shoot? A baby?

37
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,380
No!

38
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,860
This human bastard...

39
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,220
Criminal contained.

40
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,050
Wait, we're not taking the baby? It could die!

41
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,330
No interference. Can't you understand that?

42
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,250
No, c'mon.

43
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,660
Don't we want a baby?

44
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,910
Why do you do this every time?

45
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,460
Why?

46
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,240
Scared it'll take after me?

47
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,480
Wait a minute.

48
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,230
The baby... in the future...

49
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,540
Don't tell me she's in one of your visions.

50
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,900
Let's go. The door is closing.

51
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,960
Then I guess we've got to get back.

52
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,840
What can you do?

53
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,250
Why are you sitting back there?

54
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,760
Ah, I'm too tall like this, right?

55
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:27,660
Now departing!

56
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,190
These alien prisoners have existed across time and across space,

57
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,110
and it was Guard and Thunder's job to manage them.

58
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,880
So far, there have been seven escaped Paro,

59
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,020
and seven successful recontainments.

60
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,570
But that day was a little different.

61
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,530
What?

62
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,020
What is this?

63
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,520
Right? Why would there be a baby here?

64
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,480
I said, what is this?

65
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,300
The most important thing is that- That-

66
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,670
See, the thing is- Is-

67
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,140
It's-

68
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,740
Where do you think you're going?

69
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,140
No, I'm not-

70
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,390
Why would I be going anywhere?

71
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,340
Why did you bring it here?

72
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,760
Looks like we'll have to put it back.

73
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,940
Or... should we kill it?

74
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,850
Kill it? Why didn't you just leave it?

75
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,770
Ah, why have I done this?

76
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,490
Aha.

77
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,600
I propose an experiment!

78
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,440
Wouldn't it be so wild if we examined its brain...

79
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,870
and learned more about humans?

80
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,130
So then...

81
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,470
First, we should...

82
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:15,950
First? What?

83
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,670
... bring it into the house?

84
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,120
Me?

85
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,130
Yep!

86
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,030
What do these things eat?

87
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,690
Infant humans drink milk produced by their mothers.

88
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,810
Primary ingredient is lactose lipoprotein. Substitute formulas are sold in shops.

89
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,850
Well, shall we examine the baby's brain?

90
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,580
Why not? We can just discard it when we're done.

91
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,580
Right. Of course.

92
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,320
Prepare for transmission.

93
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,600
Case number 7847, the seventh prison breakout, successfully resolved.

94
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,880
Analysis of the Earth society in progress.

95
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,990
There are cases where human minds can reject our implanted memories.

96
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,810
There is a high possibility that humans are more complicated than we anticipated.

97
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,130
Hey.

98
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,510
How much longer do we have to stay here?

99
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,190
That information is not provided.

100
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,340
The next prisoner convoy is expected to arrive in ten years and eight months.

101
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:16,840
End of transmission.

102
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,010
End of transmission.

103
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,630
Ten years and eight months.

104
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,530
Aigoo.

105
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,640
Have you ever put your hand into the mist rising from a waterfall?

106
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,990
Ah, so it's like... you can smell the water?

107
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,630
Hm.

108
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,990
That's nonsense.

109
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,600
As I was saying, when you put your hand in the mist,

110
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,620
where does the air end and the water begin? The mist and your hand become one entity.

111
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,540
Master.

112
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,660
Let's have a demonstration.

113
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,260
It's not something that one can really demonstrate but...

114
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,880
With the ancient art of Dosa,

115
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,520
Mureuk can even summon the wind! With one motion, he-

116
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,260
I don't want to disappoint the people who came out to see the cherry blossoms...

117
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,390
but I can't disappoint my customers either.

118
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,100
And when you are as advanced as I, you are immune to injury of any kind.

119
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,610
Of any kind?

120
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,590
Yes.

121
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,550
Here. Take that, and right here-

122
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,890
So I can do this, then?

123
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,730
A knife??

124
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,890
You didn't even hesitate, you just-

125
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,710
Handkerchief. Han- Han-

126
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,210
I'll take it out!

127
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:44,900
No, dont-

128
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,970
I said, don't!

129
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,200
It's fine.

130
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,200
Emergency! Thieves in the village!

131
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,180
Hey! Did you say there were bounty hunters in town?

132
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,370
Over here! Over here!

133
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,090
He'll catch them for you!

134
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,520
Are these the men?

135
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,860
Oh, yes!

136
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,730
Let's get to work. Shall we catch some thieves?

137
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,830
Three men are running.

138
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,580
There's a bell.

139
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,050
Are there shrines nearby?

140
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,050
That way!

141
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,760
What are you running from?

142
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,280
Goodness. Just because it's there, doesn't mean you can steal it.

143
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,020
Think of your next life. Do you want to live like this then, too?

144
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,790
I hope you can learn from this and become a productive member of society.

145
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,420
What was that?

146
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,030
Well then. Looks like we're about to fill a bounty.

147
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,020
Oh look, it's that Mureuk guy with the cats.

148
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,530
Lay down your goods!

149
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,260
We will be enacting justice on this beautiful day.

150
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,930
Who's enacting justice?

151
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,680
What are you saying about filling bounties when I'm already here and-

152
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,010
No, come on now, whoever gets their sights on a bounty first has dibs right?

153
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:15,200
Isn't that so?

154
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
I have a claim to thi-

155
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,990
Tie yourselves up properly. Now.

156
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,540
That is, if you want your eardrums intact.

157
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,190
Where did you guys come from, anyway?

158
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:41,990
Aw, again?

159
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,220
I'm telling you, this bounty is mine.

160
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,700
In the wind, of the wind.

161
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,700
Out you come.

162
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,780
Was it like this?

163
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,960
You presume to imitate Gangwon's ancient traditions? If you studied for a hundred years, you couldn't-

164
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,460
Bounty for three thieves, successfully filled.

165
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,450
Hey Mureuk!

166
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,320
Take a look at the new listings!

167
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,240
Let's see...

168
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,390
What kind of bastard should we catch next?

169
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,760
Definitely someone going for a high price.

170
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,220
What a bunch of louts.

171
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,090
Look at this one here.

172
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,860
That's the face of a woman born to be a criminal.

173
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,070
50 pil?

174
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,600
Twenty-

175
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,630
No, two hundred- Wait no-

176
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,360
Two thousand pil?

177
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,380
Wait, I've seen this somewhere b-

178
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,710
Are you okay?

179
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,410
Do you have another headache?

180
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,260
This description is just so vivid, it really makes me feel like I've seen it myself.

181
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,260
Ah, that one.

182
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,590
And you know who's in for public intoxication right now, right?

183
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,200
Here we go~

184
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,100
Gotta go see Dogturd.

185
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,000
Do you know where Dogturd is, Master?

186
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,430
Might be worth talking to.

187
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,390
Don't you worry.

188
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,760
I know Dogturd well.

189
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,460
Aigoo, my lord.

190
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,080
This poor bastard has come to see his beloved father, Dogturd.

191
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,650
Greet the man.

192
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,810
His poor father is going to drink himself to death.

193
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,180
Ah, what's this?

194
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,610
A gift of our esteem.

195
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,390
Have just a sip, sir.

196
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,400
Oh, it looks like very fine stuff...

197
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:16,610
So sweet!

198
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,520
Hits the spot!

199
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,060
Since you brought this here, you can take a cup in to your father before you go.

200
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,050
Can I?

201
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,790
Your kindness will surely be rewarded.

202
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,200
Your son is here to see you!

203
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
He's crying and everything.

204
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,180
I have a son?

205
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,930
Father...

206
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,800
Your son Mureuk is here to see you.

207
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,340
Mureuk, you bastard -

208
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,060
You should be ashamed to show your face around me, you thieving bastard!

209
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,880
If you say another word, I'll -

210
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,970
That's how happy he is to see him! Such a welcome!

211
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,340
That's a lot of hurtful words, Father.

212
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,380
What can you tell me about this?

213
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,320
Do you think I'd tell you?

214
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,600
Even if I trusted you, you couldn't offer me enough to get me to talk.

215
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,260
Get out of here before I kill you!

216
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,540
Then I guess my Father doesn't want this key.

217
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,740
Oh, my beloved son!

218
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,660
Come to his ailing father...

219
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,050
Tell me about the knife.

220
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,030
I'll tell you what I know.

221
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,300
On August fifth, a strange knife came up in a net near Mount Hwangnyeong.

222
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,100
It had a strange jewel for a blade.

223
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,930
At first, they had thoughts of selling the jewel...

224
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,290
But even the blacksmith couldn't separate it from the hilt.

225
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,140
When the knife ricocheted into the crowd, it struck a man and should have killed him...

226
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,900
But he got up as if he was unharmed!

227
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,810
Surely this is a precious artifact that must be protected!

228
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,100
Don't you think?

229
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,230
Then who has the knife now?

230
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,370
Well, that's -

231
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,510
It was bought by a man who was a Hwangneung magistrate a long time ago.

232
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,400
But nowadays, it belongs to a man in Gyeseong.

233
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,570
He runs a place called Byeoknanjung.

234
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,500
Ah, this is all very exciting.

235
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,040
Your son will see himself out now.

236
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,210
Be careful.

237
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,530
That man is the best Dosa in the country.

238
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,080
How good a Dosa could an ex-magistrate be, honestly?

239
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:33,270
Oh, my father, if only you could change your ways...

240
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,750
It's been a long time since you've gone up against another Dosa.

241
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,500
I wonder if you'll be a match for him.

242
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,200
I may lack in formal training,

243
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,730
but I've got on-the-job experience. Every day!

244
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,050
Practical knowledge beats book learning. Everyone knows that.

245
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,850
Don't I look like a man at the top of the game?

246
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,110
The top- Do you really think that?

247
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,570
After all, you're the rightful owner of that fan!

248
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,720
Aren't you? Why didn't you say anything?

249
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,020
We're only following you because you said you were the owner of the fan.

250
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,890
Come to think of it, you've still never drawn the great sword.

251
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,080
You think I can't draw the sword? Huh?

252
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,850
Is that what you think?

253
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,180
I'm gonna draw the sword and then you're all gonna be sorry!

254
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,180
I'm really doing it!

255
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,630
Here we go!

256
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,690
He's really doing it!

257
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,060
Today's the day!

258
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,060
In the wind, of the wind.

259
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,730
You see this? You see it?

260
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,530
Seems heavy.

261
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,890
Next time.

262
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,600
Too many people around.

263
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,620
That's right. Don't wanna startle anyone.

264
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,830
I'm becoming more and more suspicious that you aren't actually our rightful owner.

265
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,690
If you're going to talk back this much, I'll just turn you back into a cat.

266
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,360
Don't be like that. Leave us human.

267
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,390
Who's human?

268
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,220
Sit down.

269
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,910
Let's have a quick drink.

270
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,510
We'd like to order, ma'am!

271
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,360
The way I see it, you'll get the upper hand on the magistrate no matter what!

272
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,180
Ma'am, where is Byeoknanjung from here?

273
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,940
Go that way and it's straight ahead.

274
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,650
Who's that?

275
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,420
I've never seen clothes like that before.

276
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,340
Right?

277
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,180
[BYEOKNANJUNG]

278
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,080
I'm good for anything!

279
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,340
He got it!

280
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,730
Can I speak with you gents for a moment?

281
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,050
I heard there was a man here who used to be a magistrate.

282
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,550
Do you know him?

283
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,140
I've heard of that fan. You can name your price for it.

284
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,750
Ah this?

285
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,250
It's an heirloom. It's priceless to me.

286
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,620
Lot of people eating here...

287
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,360
How can something be an heirloom if you stole it?

288
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,180
Like a coward.

289
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,820
You're lucky I have to be nice to my elders.

290
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,370
You can't just go around accusing people of stealing things!

291
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:46,820
Hey, you bastard!

292
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,700
We don't allow your kind in here!

293
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,370
The magistrate...

294
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,370
None of that indoors, thank you.

295
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,610
This isn't about physical strength, this is about force of will.

296
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,450
You can't think it, so you can't do it.

297
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,370
What nonsense is -

298
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,140
Do you know me?

299
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,910
I know men like you.

300
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:21,690
Stop chasing after bounties and live honestly.

301
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,800
You can get back to your meals, gentlemen.

302
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,240
Help me...

303
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,280
Help!

304
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,710
Has our guest arrived?

305
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,620
Yes. And the information you asked for.

306
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,760
Why is this so difficult?

307
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,660
His name isn't listed.

308
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,450
You said you know what this is.

309
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,800
Of course I know.

310
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,810
How did you learn of it?

311
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,290
Because it's ours.

312
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:06,540
Ours?

313
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,110
Yep.

314
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,250
And who is that?

315
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,980
Where did the magistrate go?

316
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,350
The magistrate? He's upstairs.

317
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,670
It seemed like he knew you.

318
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,750
Me? I've never seen the man in my life.

319
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,080
Do you see him? That looks like Dogturd.

320
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,820
Dogturd?

321
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,210
You're right. Ugh, I can smell him.

322
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,620
He must be after the knife.

323
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,150
In the wind, of the wind.

324
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,620
In the wind, of the wind.

325
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,650
In. The. Wind. Of. The. Wind!

326
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,670
Are you hurt?

327
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,990
The knife... Don't awaken...

328
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,860
Don't -

329
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,800
What do you m-

330
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,740
I think Dogturd's stolen it!

331
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,500
I see you eat well here.

332
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,420
You showed him!

333
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,130
You good?

334
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,340
I'm fine, I'm fine.

335
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,040
You stole that knife again, didn't you?

336
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,450
It's not like that!

337
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,330
Go! Run!

338
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,730
Where is he?

339
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:07,280
He's here, he's here!

340
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,060
Master, master!

341
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:10,440
Mureuk!

342
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,770
Mureuk!

343
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,920
Wake up!

344
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,300
Where did he go?

345
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,360
We've got to find that knife.

346
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,690
Well this is interesting. How did he do this to you?

347
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,460
Dogturd made a run for it again.

348
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,020
Are you alright?

349
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,670
I think I threw my back out.

350
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,930
Why does my cheek hurt?

351
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,290
Did you hit me?

352
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,370
Me?

353
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,220
Noooo. Why would I do that?

354
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,810
Hey, wow! Would you look at that?

355
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:57,980
What is this?

356
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,080
Is it a stone?

357
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,660
What kind of stone shines like that?

358
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,980
Whatever it is, it looks like money.

359
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,390
It must have surfaced because of the the drought.

360
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,170
- It's making a noise. 
- Hey there's someone over there.

361
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:45,340
We called you because there's a problem with Yian.

362
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:49,400
She recently went to a police station and tried to report you.

363
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,650
When the police asked why she'd come,

364
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,610
She said that you had kidnapped her,

365
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,850
and that you had been messing with her memory since then, and so on.

366
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,850
Well, let's just play the tape.

367
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,350
We got it straight from the station.

368
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,410
Why does your father play with your brain?

369
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,570
Is he a doctor?

370
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:10,690
No, ma'am.

371
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,690
Honestly, he's not my father.

372
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,010
He's a robot.

373
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,210
Like a cyborg.

374
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,370
Well, that's exciting.

375
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,120
And how can you tell your father is a robot?

376
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,250
That's a good question. You see, I took a video yesterday-

377
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,790
Because sometimes he's not my dad, he's Thunder.

378
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,330
So I doubted-

379
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,080
Who's Thunder?

380
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,410
He's the car my father drives,

381
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,410
but sometimes he changes into my father.

382
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,910
I remember from when they took me.

383
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,550
Oh, they've already erased the video.

384
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,020
I should have been more careful.

385
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,630
I'll get another video and come back.

386
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:50,310
And she left the station and came to school. What are your thoughts?

387
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,810
Wipe the video from the station.

388
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,600
It's already done.

389
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,290
That woman's been watching you. Be careful.

390
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:00,890
Which one?

391
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:01,830
Straight ahead.

392
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,840
Afternoon!

393
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,230
You must be waiting for Yian!

394
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,450
I'm Minsun's aunt.

395
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,100
I see.

396
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,610
Minsun and Yian are such good friends!

397
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,330
Probably because they're both so bad at soccer.

398
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,920
I bet they'll be lifelong friends! Don't you think so?

399
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,340
Sure.

400
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,860
Would you like some coffee?

401
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,980
I've seen you around the school a few times,

402
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,120
so I figured I should introduce myself!

403
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,400
How old are you? Do you own any real estate?

404
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,020
My aunt thinks your dad is handsome.

405
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,960
He is.

406
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,760
That's where I got my good looks.

407
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,540
But what can we do?

408
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,890
My dad doesn't like her.

409
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,560
He looks like he's playing dodgeball.

410
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,860
She'll be fine. Look at her.

411
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,880
She's a woman who never gives up.

412
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,770
Auntie!

413
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,790
Hey Minsun!

414
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,820
Ah, so you're Yian! You're so pretty!

415
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,460
Did you get your good looks from your dad?

416
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,710
These are a little something I baked up myself.

417
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,000
These are for you and Yian!

418
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,900
They're shockingly good.

419
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:05,700
Drive safe.

420
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,060
Let's go!

421
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,520
Kay.

422
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,250
What?

423
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,310
What did the principal say?

424
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,150
Aren't you curious what I did with my friends today?

425
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:26,890
No, I'm not.

426
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,660
Ah. I see.

427
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,120
Thanks for the ride, Thunder.

428
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,860
Who are you talking to?

429
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,330
To him.

430
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,990
Cars can't talk.

431
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,920
Thunder used to. When I was little.

432
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:51,910
I remember.

433
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,430
Your days are numbered...

434
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,110
Have you been talking to her?

435
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,270
Not a word.

436
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,350
I mean, I did when she was younger.

437
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,310
Does she remember that far back?

438
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,560
But what's Thunder?

439
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,030
Is that my name?

440
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,240
Quit it.

441
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,760
Something's weird.

442
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,560
You talk too much.

443
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,570
Why would that have been erased? My name?

444
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,960
Just give me the report.

445
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,230
Report: Nineteenth prisoner convoy. High-ranking Paros.

446
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,830
Will arrive on earth for implantation. 107 subjects needed.

447
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,550
Implantation? What's that?

448
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,330
Location.

449
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,520
I'm still searching.

450
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,950
We'll need 107 human hosts. Convoy estimated to arrive in eighteen hours.

451
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,230
Eighteen hours. That's tomorrow.

452
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,050
Every night at 9 o'clock, my father disappears,

453
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,210
and all the lights go out.

454
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,600
There it is.

455
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,850
Thunder!

456
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,890
Too good for me?

457
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,040
I see how it is.

458
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,410
Guess I gotta get all my answers myself.

459
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,340
What is that?

460
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,310
Don't.

461
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,080
Huh?

462
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:34,920
Don't.

463
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,230
Don't touch that!

464
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,100
Thunder.

465
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,160
From when I was little.

466
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,640
But... Why is my name Thunder?

467
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,940
You don't like it?

468
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,310
I'm getting used to it.

469
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,610
It's good.

470
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,660
So, what exactly are you?

471
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,690
Where did you come from?

472
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,190
For your first question, I am a program,

473
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,890
that processes data and can vary its physical form.

474
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:03,950
What would you like?

475
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,990
Your dad?

476
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:10,630
But... you're not...

477
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,840
Are you a hologram?

478
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,790
No, I'm real. I'm really here.

479
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,930
I even used to hold you.

480
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,620
You asked where I'm from!

481
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,520
You came all the way from there?

482
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,180
Does that mean you and Dad are aliens?

483
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,550
To me, you're the alien.

484
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,110
Is my Dad your boss?

485
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,560
Boss? No.

486
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,320
We're comrades. Equals.

487
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,190
I just leave the combat to him because I'm against violence.

488
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,260
Is your home far away?

489
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,150
Well, it's far, but it doesn't take us very long beca-

490
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,370
Einstein.

491
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,150
You're fast.

492
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,490
You grew up so smart!

493
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,770
You even found my name for me.

494
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:59,030
Really? Hey! You're the one who changes the snacks in the vending machine!

495
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,410
I do! How do you eat so much fish jerky?

496
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,930
- Right? And corn snacks!      - Right!

497
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,800
Oh and what and where is the implantation tomorrow?

498
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,200
Ah at the hospital? They'll find bodies for the prisoners.

499
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,420
Implantation.

500
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,720
You heard the message.

501
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,920
Traitor.

502
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,830
I'm not a traitor. I just wanted to kn-

503
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,590
Your dad's coming. Get out! Quickly!

504
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:29,840
Wait.

505
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,280
Where did I come from?

506
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,310
I'll tell you next time! You gotta go!

507
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,520
Tell me, please!

508
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,630
Where did I come from?

509
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,870
The past! 646 years ago!

510
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,640
And forget what I told you about the hospital!

511
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,970
You have to!

512
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,410
Who were you just talking to?

513
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,310
Just now?

514
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,360
There's a new message.

515
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,480
implantation will take place 8 km from here, at Jisang Hospital.

516
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,330
Are you okay?

517
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,190
I'm fine.

518
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,690
What are you filming?

519
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,370
I just like making records of people.

520
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,360
You never know when you'll lose your memory.

521
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,580
You're a little morbid.

522
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,650
What kinds of things do you forget?

523
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,630
Nothing yet, but... you never know.

524
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,460
Hang on.

525
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,520
If anything happens, call me, okay? I'm a cop.

526
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,320
Pass.

527
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,810
Do you see that? It's pretty!

528
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:19,430
Preparation for prisoner extraction is complete.

529
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,210
What is-

530
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,690
What are you doing here?

531
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,710
What did I come in here for?

532
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:45,580
Poor man.

533
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,460
Oh, what a devastating loss...

534
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,730
We had so much left to talk about.

535
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,230
This is the first time I've seen you like this.

536
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,410
I told you he was the one with the knife, didn't I?

537
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:00,900
You did.

538
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,890
And that other man stole it!

539
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,010
A criminal!

540
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,550
What kind of Dosa could he be?

541
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,990
First of all,

542
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,050
I feel certain he isn't a Dosa.

543
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:12,410
The thief was here. Something sharp went through the wall and and smashed the door.

544
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,600
Maybe the stolen item?

545
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,010
Somehow, I don't think so.

546
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,470
A tentacle?

547
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,570
Here?

548
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,500
Here, of all places?

549
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,470
My heart races.

550
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,290
Is it like that thing we saw-?

551
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,990
I think so.

552
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,350
Do you remember?

553
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,700
That man who's been living in Milbon.

554
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,360
Yes, I think we should pay him a visit.

555
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,060
I think we should.

556
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,520
Are you... the mages of Samgak mountain?

557
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,650
Correct.

558
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,630
And you sell the trinkets?

559
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,300
Trinkets? Are you hearing this guy?

560
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,310
The people in town said this guy has lived here for ten years!

561
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,510
He is extremely dan-

562
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,530
Are you actually going in?

563
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,620
Yeah.

564
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,420
Not gonna check it out or-

565
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,780
Locate the Divine Sword in the temple and bring it to the agreed-upon location.

566
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,900
Locate what?

567
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,920
The what?

568
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,390
Do you think it's the temple at Milbon?

569
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,320
Are they the ones ordering this?

570
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,040
Why would they be looking for the same knife?

571
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,310
Whoa. This picture is strange.

572
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,160
What is that?

573
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,250
Oh!

574
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,740
Why do I feel like I've seen this square thing before?

575
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,930
So the guy who lived here was actually just crazy, then.

576
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,950
Where could someone see all these weird things?

577
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,620
That was an awfully long way to come, just to be able to knock on this fine door.

578
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,950
I sure hope he hasn't gone anywhere.

579
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,290
From what you told me, that doesn't seem to be his style.

580
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:57,380
I heard he hasn't stepped foot outside these gates since he arrived here ten years ago.

581
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,340
What kind of person do you suppose he is?

582
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:03,990
Let's sell our little trinkets as hard as we can and see if we can figure that out.

583
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,170
The mages of Samgak mountain have arrived, my lord.

584
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,970
Goodness gracious, the man himself.

585
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,990
He's overjoyed to see us. I can feel it even through his mask.

586
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,690
You're so right.

587
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:22,630
So you're the incredible mages I've heard so much about.

588
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,160
Thank you for gracing me with your presence.

589
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,500
If we hear that Milbon has interest in our wares, of course we must come right away.

590
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,280
Let us show you what we can offer.

591
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,830
things

592
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:35,750
The products that we have offered Milbon so far pale in comparison to the wares we bring you today.

593
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,300
For example, this talisman...

594
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,920
can allow me to be in two places at once.

595
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,310
Watch closely.

596
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,100
Ah, I see this is not what you're looking for.

597
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,670
Let's try something else.

598
00:41:58,650 --> 00:41:59,500
Don't go anywhere.

599
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,740
I have caught you fast.

600
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,050
If you are so kind to purchase one from us, I will add a second one in gratitude.

601
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,110
I see.

602
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,960
And here! We have this magnificent bronze mirror!

603
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,070
Other mirrors can simply not compare.

604
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:18,500
A dishonest man can look into this mirror and see his dishonesty magnified tenfold.

605
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,860
And I can see my own beauty and purity.

606
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,030
Would you like to have a look?

607
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,320
In Milbon, our own appearances are of no importance.

608
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,860
How wise of you.

609
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,960
But the mirror's magnifying powers can be of other uses as well.

610
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,440
With its help, small things don't have to be small.

611
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,940
Just one drink can become enough for an entire gathering.

612
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:42,020
And in a fight, just one small fist can become an entire army.

613
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,010
Keep your eyes on my hand.

614
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,350
Alright, here we go.

615
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,680
Oh, there's going to be big trouble as soon as I do this.

616
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,920
I think we've shown him enough.

617
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,520
I'm amazed to hear that mere humans could make such extraordinary products like this.

618
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,410
Yes, aren't we quite remarkable.

619
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,120
And this.

620
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,860
A priceless Arabian whetstone.

621
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:08,070
Even if thousands of soldiers used this stone every day, it would take 15 years to begin to wear away.

622
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,920
The blade's edge will hold for three years.

623
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,400
It's priceless when you think about it.

624
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,000
But if you had to put a price on it...

625
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,310
70 pil, at least.

626
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,440
Oho!

627
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,200
Ah, there's no reason to bring that up if you're not interested.

628
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,060
Did you find something?

629
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,070
If you are not charmed by our wares on first glance, there is no point in selling them to you.

630
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,030
Let's see if that bar is still around here.

631
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,410
It's been so long, I really wonder...

632
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:31,440
Waste of a meeting.

633
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,450
Do the two of you really know where the Divine Knife is?

634
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:35,260
Of course.

635
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,710
Bukchon, in the hands of a business owner.

636
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,400
Or it was, at least.

637
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,930
Unfortunately, a man named Dogturd stole it.

638
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,050
Is there any way that Milbon can assist you in finding it?

639
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:48,580
Ho ho.

640
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,990
An excellent question.

641
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,910
What do these bastards think they're doing?

642
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,890
Oh, the groom is a very fine man indeed.

643
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:09,350
And sporting a fine mustache. Did you see that mustache?

644
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,000
What? Dismount.

645
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,060
Lend me your mustache.

646
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:17,890
My- My mustache?

647
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:18,630
Yep.

648
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:21,320
He's here. He's here!

649
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,330
The groom has arrived!

650
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,370
The groom is a real man!

651
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:49,040
Everyone gather 'round quickly!

652
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,230
Is it over there, do you think?

653
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,340
I'm not sure.

654
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,840
The bride and groom are gathered! Let the ceremony begin!

655
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,720
Let's share our first drink together!

656
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,400
Um. What comes off first?

657
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,410
My bride...

658
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,560
...is beautiful.

659
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,440
But...

660
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,020
Haven't we met somewhere before?

661
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,800
That's impossible.

662
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,990
What if we just-

663
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,220
Get rid of-

664
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,070
What is this?

665
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,050
It's nothing that you need to concern yourself with.

666
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,830
Shall we start with a drink?

667
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:06,910
Sure. Let's do that.

668
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,640
Shouldn't we let our master enjoy himself?

669
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,360
We have work to do! We can't be playing dress-up!

670
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,330
Ridiculous.

671
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,490
Oh look, they steamed fish!

672
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,850
It's not even in season!

673
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:25,790
This precious stuff...

674
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:26,560
First...

675
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,010
A little snack.

676
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:28,990
Yes, just a little.

677
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:30,750
It's not spring, no...

678
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:32,620
But this fish is even better in the fall!

679
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,080
I think you're right.

680
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,190
Ah, just one second. I need to take care of something.

681
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:49,350
I can't seem to believe it.

682
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,650
That I've married someone like you.

683
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:04,970
He's cute.

684
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,630
Why are you being so insistent?

685
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,560
I had to make sure it wasn't in there!

686
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,020
Master, we heard it's in the family storehouse, over that wall.

687
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,840
I get it, I get it.

688
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,670
Were you drinking?

689
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:19,230
I just had a little one.

690
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:40,330
What-

691
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,630
What's happening to me?

692
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,670
We are the dual mages of Mount Samgak.

693
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,660
No one leaves this house.

694
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,690
Bring us the contents of your storehouse and don't cause any trouble.

695
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,940
We are aided by the Dosa of Milbon...

696
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,140
So don't cross that line if you want to see morning.

697
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,800
Stop them immediately!

698
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,230
What do you think you're doing?

699
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:40,400
I don't know what the hell you're doing here

700
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,300
But you get out of my house bef-

701
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,070
Your will is mine.

702
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,430
Yes.

703
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,000
Your will is mine.

704
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,340
Bring me what you've hidden.

705
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,080
Your will is mine.

706
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,230
Bring me your hidden treasures.

707
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:12,720
Yes.

708
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,020
Anything you say.

709
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:19,450
Aigoo.

710
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,500
My lady! What are you doing here?

711
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:25,000
What happened to you?

712
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,010
Eunnie, eunnie!

713
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:30,070
They tied me up like this!

714
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,350
But if you're here... then who got married?

715
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,900
Sorry to have kept you waiting-

716
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,820
Bring the Divine Knife to me immediately!

717
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,690
Wait, are you- Are you not the real bride?

718
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,280
Seems like you're not the real groom, either.

719
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:57,950
Wait...

720
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,060
Did you drug me?

721
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:02,190
Yeah.

722
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,150
'Yeah'??

723
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,330
You won't die. Don't worry.

724
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,130
Antidote.

725
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,260
There must be an antidote.

726
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:16,710
There isn't.

727
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,760
There isn't?

728
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,300
Just sleep it off. You'll be fine.

729
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,710
I'll take care of those bastards.

730
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,410
I'm the only one who can.

731
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:29,930
You've got this.

732
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,750
You can do it.

733
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:32,850
You are...

734
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,370
Out of your mind!

735
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,840
I know I'm not the real bride,

736
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,740
but I'll remember today very fondly.

737
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,370
Stay where you are!

738
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:02,810
Ah, so that's a gun.

739
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,360
It doesn't matter.

740
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:07,530
Give that to me.

741
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:08,510
Yes, ma'am.

742
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,140
Don't move.

743
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:25,190
By the way... how are you at solving puzzles?

744
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,860
That's very sharp.

745
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:04,680
Ow, that stings!

746
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,190
I've got her!

747
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,480
Bring the girl with us.

748
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,810
Yes, sir.

749
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:51,940
Mureuk!

750
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,110
He's coming to.

751
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,430
Massage him, massage him.

752
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:00,390
Where did that woman come from?

753
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:01,990
I tried to ask her that, but -

754
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,020
The groom is inside.

755
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,190
Let's get out of here.

756
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:09,780
Hey, that thing.

757
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,160
The bang-bang! Grab it!

758
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,250
The bang-bang? This -

759
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,630
What?  What is this?

760
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,740
What's a bang-bang?

761
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,510
Hey, Yian.

762
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,330
Why weren't you at school?

763
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,830
I ran away from home.

764
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:26,890
Can I stay over tonight?

765
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,980
Oh my God! Is this really our hospital?

766
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:31,580
And you filmed this yourself?

767
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,230
Right.

768
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:34,780
What are those things going into their heads?

769
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,780
Is your dad one of those things?

770
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,320
Shh.

771
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:39,440
Auntie?

772
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:40,620
Huh?

773
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,910
I'm- I'm not doing anything.

774
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:44,830
I'm just passing by. Naturally.

775
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:46,390
I'm going away...

776
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,160
We've arrived in from of Minsun's house.

777
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,140
I never know what to say to humans.

778
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,900
You go instead.

779
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:58,310
Me?

780
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,130
What appearance should I use?

781
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,060
Me! I'll do it! Pick me!

782
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:04,870
I've always wanted to persuade a human!

783
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,470
Have you ever spoken to a human?

784
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,290
You haven't, have you?

785
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,290
I'm just waiting for the right opportunity.

786
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:10,670
I know a little bit about humans.

787
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:11,550
I'll go.

788
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:12,900
Hold your horses.

789
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,320
Do you know how to seduce a woman?

790
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:15,850
Have either of you ever talked to one?

791
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,660
Speak deeply, make eye contact, ask questions, hold her waist.

792
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:22,320
Do you have any experience in these things?

793
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,260
Should we all three go then?

794
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:26,260
No. Just one of you. Just one.

795
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:28,640
You do it.

796
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:30,670
Just keep it short.

797
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:31,400
and get Yian.

798
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,970
That's the spirit.

799
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:34,240
Shall we?

800
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,390
Let's steal some hearts.

801
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:02,410
Oh, hello...

802
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,550
There you are.

803
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,720
So.

804
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,480
Ah, did you come to get Yian?

805
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,370
Isn't it obvious?

806
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:10,530
I know that you're interested in me.

807
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:10,980
I am?

808
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:11,980
You are.

809
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:18,990
Ah, I had wondered if I could call you up sometime. 
Is that alright then?

810
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:19,970
Yes.

811
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:22,210
You should definitely do that.

812
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,170
Should I get Yian, then? She's upstairs.

813
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,990
I'd rather keep talking to you.

814
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,490
What's your name?

815
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:33,960
Ah, I'm Min Gye-in. (sounds like 'alien')

816
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:38,870
I already know.

817
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,910
Why would my mom call me that, right?

818
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,810
I've picked up a lot of nicknames. Well. Mostly just 'Alien, Alien.'

819
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:45,790
Minsun!

820
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,460
Miss Min Gye-in.

821
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:49,940
The thing about you...

822
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:52,470
Is you're so lucky...

823
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:54,600
You're no alien.

824
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,160
Very kind of you.

825
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,890
Welp. Let's head out.

826
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,940
What went into those people at the hospital?

827
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,920
I'm asking you a question!

828
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,720
Ooh, she's mad.

829
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,200
Do you still not understand humans?

830
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,400
There's no point in trying to hide things from them.

831
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,600
Yian. Sit, sit.

832
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,300
What went into those people?

833
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,540
So then. We will answer exactly three of your questions.

834
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,630
Okay? So!

835
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,720
What went into those people?

836
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,370
Ah, that.

837
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:56,390
So the thing is...

838
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:00,250
for a really long time we've been locking up our planet's prisoners in human bodies.

839
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:00,560
Right?

840
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,250
Stop.

841
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,730
No, I've got this.

842
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:07,910
Every planet is the same, right? There's civilization, there's war, there's a decline in population...

843
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,670
But everybody wants peace.

844
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:11,550
We have criminals like anybody else, sure.

845
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,420
But then a whole new problem appears.

846
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,340
Our population starts mutating.

847
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:18,140
Life and peace turned upside down!

848
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:21,200
Mututions so powerful they can destroy and kill.

849
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,680
Then what?

850
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,270
So then you need a prison.

851
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:26,770
You have to take them so far away that they can never come back.

852
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:31,210
The most impenetrable place there is.

853
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,840
A prison that even the wardens won't remember.

854
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,330
The human mind.

855
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:38,040
Put a criminal in there,

856
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,540
And they're trapped, until the human dies and destroys them both.

857
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:44,190
That's how we do it.

858
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:45,690
But we haven't agreed to this.

859
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:47,300
Going into our brains without permission?

860
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:48,720
Why would we need permission?

861
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,820
You shouldn't treat people like that.

862
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:52,450
Humans matter.

863
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:54,420
You grew up so smart!

864
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,890
It's your best trait.

865
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:56,400
Shut up.

866
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,450
Next question.

867
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,620
Can these criminals leave their human bodies?

868
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,260
For a little bit, but the atmosphere is different here.

869
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,300
About what, five minutes?

870
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,040
Yeah. They can stay out for about that long.

871
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,620
If they awaken, I trap and store them.

872
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:11,570
Where?

873
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:12,380
Here.

874
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,230
There's a room back there?

875
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:25,470
If they awaken...

876
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,520
People get hurt?

877
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,440
That's what I'm here to prevent.

878
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,390
So you're protecting us.

879
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:32,830
I'm a Guard who manages prisoners.

880
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,200
Humans are not my concern.

881
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,610
Question time is over.

882
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,990
Then why did you raise me?

883
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:45,600
Question time is over.

884
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,500
I can sleep here tonight, right?

885
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,040
Thanks.

886
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:11,930
How long have you been on Earth, Thunder?

887
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:13,040
Have you always been here?

888
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,430
Why did you bring me with you?

889
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,500
If we didn't, you would have died.

890
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,910
Sleep tight, Yian.

891
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,220
Good night, Thunder.

892
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:04,320
Suspect is heading toward you.

893
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,120
Operation commencing.

894
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,120
What are you doing? Hold the line!

895
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,880
Stop right there!

896
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,990
This is police harassment, you know.

897
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:30,460
Ah, what a waste.

898
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,160
Don't shoot me! Don't shoot!

899
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:44,290
Thank you for everything.

900
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:46,860
Hey, Moon Doseok.

901
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,420
Yeah.

902
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,170
What do you think you're doing, shooting at a civilian?

903
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,590
Just a little warning shot at a criminal.

904
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,040
Hey.

905
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,540
Next time, you should hit me.

906
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,450
Detectives never get the job done.

907
01:01:58,980 --> 01:01:59,600
Excuse us.

908
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:20,890
Where's the rest of it?

909
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,980
I hid it in the bike in the loft.

910
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,190
The bike in the loft?

911
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,230
Wanna go have a fun night?

912
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:33,540
Ta-da!

913
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:35,810
What's going on?

914
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:44,610
Go check it out.

915
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:55,470
Mr. Cho?

916
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:16,930
New message incoming.

917
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,090
Escaped prisoners headed for Earth.

918
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:20,270
Armed and dangerous.

919
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:21,110
Capture with care.

920
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:22,250
Did you say armed?

921
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,040
What are you doing?

922
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:29,790
What's wrong with you?

923
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:35,160
Emergency message!

924
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,560
Urgent recovery of a prisoner required!

925
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,080
Who exactly are we supposed to catch?

926
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:43,380
This bastard! He was among the prisoners from the hospital!

927
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:49,850
Got him! Found the bastard!

928
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:51,080
He's here.

929
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:54,110
Name: Moon Doseok.

930
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,570
The bodies were found in the stairwell, and we're trying to obtain the CCTV.

931
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:18,560
We've sent samples from this hatchet off to forensics.

932
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:19,970
The detective isn't answering his phone.

933
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:48,450
Yian, get out.

934
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:49,790
No.

935
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:52,600
I'm going to see what you and Thunder are doing.

936
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,150
Get out.

937
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:54,650
I'm not getting out.

938
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:55,830
I'm your family. It's my business too.

939
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,200
Urgent message!

940
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,160
The ship- The ship is approaching the planet!

941
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,280
Then hold tight.

942
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,820
There's no way to drive there in time.

943
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,710
Then we'll fly.

944
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,590
Dad, what is this?

945
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:19,850
Sit.

946
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:36,860
Moon DoSeok.

947
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,900
Where are youu?

948
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,020
Stay out of this.

949
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:20,840
What is Moon Doseok's location?

950
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:23,010
Twenty-first floor. By the elevator.

951
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,360
That thing is catching up to him.

952
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,640
Moon DoSeok.

953
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:42,780
Our controller has been locked inside you.

954
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:50,400
Who -

955
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,580
I must free the controller from your human body.

956
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,490
I will use the Guard's energy to do so.

957
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:01,470
Are you ready?

958
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,720
Who's the Paro in Moon Doseok?

959
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:18,970
Prisoner #197A: The controller.

960
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:20,280
The controller?

961
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:23,600
The same agent of the destruction on our planet.

962
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:26,070
The leader of the rebellion.

963
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,750
Do you think they're planning to escape?

964
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,410
Or do they want something else?

965
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,020
The hell is that?

966
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:13,120
Controller, can you hear me?

967
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,140
Are you ready to be set free?

968
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,860
The earth's atmosphere has changed.

969
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,550
It is time to free them all.

970
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:24,260
And we will begin with you.

971
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:26,500
The time... is now.

972
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,120
What is this bastard saying?

973
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,120
Yian, we're starting.

974
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:46,810
Thunder, get ready.

975
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:48,180
Yian, hold on tight!

976
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:52,830
Divert energy to weapons.

977
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:53,770
Levels up!

978
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:08,680
We've got him!

979
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,640
Not yet. We've just winged him.

980
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:11,500
Weapons up!

981
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,240
Weapons to their highest level!

982
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:28,010
Careful! He's right on our tail!

983
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:32,960
Analyze weak points!

984
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:35,320
There's only one point of access to the interior systems.

985
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,060
That bright red part is like its heart!

986
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,570
Hit it directly, and you can disrupt their power!

987
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:41,290
It opens every time it shoots!

988
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,080
We're catching humans in the crossfire...

989
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:51,170
Let's get somewhere clear!

990
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:03,490
Ready...

991
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:06,730
Set...

992
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:07,210
Fire!

993
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:13,940
Its heart moved!

994
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:15,580
Shield depleted.

995
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:18,250
We've been hit!

996
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:19,730
Crash is imminent.

997
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:21,770
More energy!

998
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,570
I need more time! I need more time!

999
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:56,200
Mission complete.

1000
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:01,410
The controller is awakened.

1001
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:20,220
The controller is free.

1002
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:23,720
And now I will self-destruct...

1003
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:25,810
And take you with me.

1004
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,380
Warning: Guard's life support activated.

1005
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:38,180
Energy depleted!

1006
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:44,100
Yian!

1007
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:45,020
Wait in the car!

1008
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:50,980
Energy levels at 17%.

1009
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,120
16%. 14%.

1010
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:52,820
Reaching critical levels.

1011
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:00,000
Beginning emergency recharge.

1012
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,580
Emergency recharge, in progress.

1013
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:52,160
36%.

1014
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:52,930
38%.

1015
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:54,950
My reserves are depleted.

1016
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,240
The controller is awakened.

1017
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,030
We need a status update.

1018
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:01,920
Understood.

1019
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,100
Try not to move!

1020
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,700
The controller has access to the ship.

1021
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:43,790
Haava.

1022
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:45,350
It's Haava.

1023
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:47,850
They brought it to this planet!

1024
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:51,370
Haava? All the way from our world?

1025
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:54,830
Earth's atmosphere is too different!

1026
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:55,750
If they can deploy the Haava,

1027
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,470
They'll be able to change Earth's atmosphere permanently!

1028
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:00,510
They won't need human bodies anymore.

1029
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:02,460
They could all be awakened!

1030
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:07,420
If this is released,

1031
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:09,200
all the humans will die in the new atmosphere.

1032
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:10,890
This is truly... the end.

1033
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:12,230
We have to stop the controller!

1034
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,240
Use the energy knife to disrupt the deployment!

1035
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:29,400
Energy levels falling again!

1036
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:41,870
Stopping the Haava is the important thing.

1037
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:50,950
Go out and catch the controller

1038
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:52,450
before he can jump into another body!

1039
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:17,950
Yian, are you okay?

1040
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:18,820
What is that thing?

1041
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,510
That's what we're here for.

1042
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:24,260
I don't see the controller.

1043
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:26,200
Get in the car.

1044
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:32,140
Status report.

1045
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,100
Two doses of Haava have left the ship.

1046
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:36,530
I'll try to contain them.

1047
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:40,040
Find the controller first. He can't be allowed to set them off.

1048
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:50,920
Detonate the Haava.

1049
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:53,100
Calling all Paro within range.

1050
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:53,990
Awaken.

1051
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:41,360
Open your eyes! Wake up!

1052
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:43,010
The belt- I can't-

1053
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:47,790
They've deployed one dose of Haava!

1054
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:49,400
Save the humans first!

1055
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:53,110
I'm going!

1056
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:12,590
Yian, let's go.

1057
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:20,300
I'm sending you home.

1058
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:21,300
Thunder!

1059
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:25,450
I have to save your world.

1060
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,020
Let's go.

1061
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:28,810
I have to find the controller.

1062
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:08,200
The people who died...

1063
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:10,500
That bright cloud of Haava...

1064
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:18,230
That day I couldn't forget, even ten years later...

1065
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:27,140
Who are you?

1066
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,590
You've grown up. Did you forget me?

1067
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:35,370
We came here together, you know. Ten years ago.

1068
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:39,910
I'll keep trying to get that knife.

1069
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:40,720
Sure.

1070
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:43,180
You need that thing we rode here, too.

1071
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:44,560
Where is it?

1072
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:45,360
Dunno.

1073
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:51,780
Really? I know.

1074
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,080
That's why I need that knife.

1075
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:56,710
Where is it?

1076
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:05,130
It's time you learned what it's like to be in a prison.

1077
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:11,490
We've got time. Think about how you're going to survive the mess you're in.

1078
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:12,070
Mister.

1079
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:15,690
Why don't you have dinner before you go?

1080
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:18,130
Like you said. We've got time.

1081
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,150
We've been trapped in time.

1082
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:44,830
We have to find the controller before we go back.

1083
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:46,930
He must have changed bodies,

1084
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:50,070
but the magistrate wasn't awakened. He just died.

1085
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:56,020
So whose body could the controller be in?

1086
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:58,350
Four humans saw us that day.

1087
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:04,960
The magistrate died. The dual mages were both cut by the knife, but they were not awakened either.

1088
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,500
Now we must only locate the last one.

1089
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:09,340
It's fine.

1090
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:11,650
She can neither hear nor speak our secrets.

1091
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,450
Why are you staying in such a weak body?

1092
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:20,700
Wouldn't it be better to switch?

1093
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:22,890
I'll love my memories.

1094
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:26,890
And if I don't want to be imprisoned again, I'll need-

1095
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:39,720
Mureuk?

1096
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:40,580
Are you alright?

1097
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:43,620
Isn't it going to be too difficult to get into Milbon?

1098
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:45,380
Difficult?

1099
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:47,080
For us?

1100
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:51,410
Look at this. If we can just fill this one bounty, then...

1101
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,150
This will solve all our problems.

1102
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:56,360
What do you think it is, anyway?

1103
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,510
It's obviously something important.

1104
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:02,340
Is it possible to be as handsome and smart as you are?

1105
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:04,550
Just the very smartest! Very most handsome!

1106
01:26:04,770 --> 01:26:05,930
Don't you know me?

1107
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:09,320
They're coming.

1108
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,600
Shall we get to work?

1109
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:28,370
In the wind, of the wind.

1110
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:55,500
Why are you so late?

1111
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:56,890
Did you find it?

1112
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:59,140
They're waiting on you. Let's go.

1113
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:00,040
Right.

1114
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,250
Are you going to move any faster than that?

1115
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:04,860
We're hurrying.

1116
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:07,330
Where do you think you're going?

1117
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:08,600
Right, right.

1118
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:15,400
Oh, the medicine is here.

1119
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:19,260
We have found the medicine, great mages.

1120
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:20,390
It must have been elusive.

1121
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:20,590
Yes, sir.

1122
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:21,830
Give it here.

1123
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:22,290
You heard him.

1124
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,170
That deadly mushroom...

1125
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:29,580
Chew it thoroughly.

1126
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:31,870
Which one of you is the antidote expert?

1127
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:35,590
Our antidote expert...

1128
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:37,420
Is this man here.

1129
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:38,250
Right.

1130
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:39,710
Expert.

1131
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:41,390
Hurry. Chew it.

1132
01:27:58,750 --> 01:27:59,390
Don't stop chewing.

1133
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:08,270
Mash it up.

1134
01:28:08,430 --> 01:28:09,040
Get some saliva in there.

1135
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,270
That's it, that's it.

1136
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:20,210
And now, what you have brought for me.

1137
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:26,440
This?

1138
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:29,740
Here, spit.

1139
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:40,600
You chewed it very effectively.

1140
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:51,710
The ship has surfaced in the valley near Byeoknanjung.

1141
01:28:52,690 --> 01:28:54,090
We've got it.

1142
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,610
Why is the knife reacting now?

1143
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:05,400
It's lighting up all on its own!

1144
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,750
All on its own? It must be special!

1145
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:15,750
It's stopped.

1146
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:19,740
Why are so many people looking for this little thing?

1147
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:23,750
Even after getting injured so many times today,

1148
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:26,050
you still can't keep your hands to yourself.

1149
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:28,080
She was just wondering.

1150
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,540
Right. Just thinking aloud.

1151
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:34,680
I will not be requiring your services any further today.

1152
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,700
Have some dinner before you go.

1153
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:38,700
What are you three doing?

1154
01:29:41,390 --> 01:29:45,030
I'd be very interested to know 
what else is going on around here.

1155
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:48,730
Did you see the knife?

1156
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:51,400
Let's come back at night.

1157
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:53,170
Obviously.

1158
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:56,050
The money is as good as ours.

1159
01:29:57,490 --> 01:29:57,860
You.

1160
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,410
Take this.

1161
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:03,640
Give it to the girl out back and return immediately.

1162
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:05,090
Don't speak to her.

1163
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:05,900
Yessir.

1164
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,780
You two. Wash the dishes.

1165
01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:12,000
Out back?

1166
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,920
Where is that?

1167
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:32,770
Such a beautiful day. Even the birds think so.

1168
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:37,610
Let's see, let's see.

1169
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:42,260
Oh, I see.

1170
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:45,030
And a little gap here.

1171
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:47,860
How did they make this thing?

1172
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:53,090
Does the fire cause it?

1173
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:53,860
Well then.

1174
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,160
Oh, that didn't do anything.

1175
01:30:57,570 --> 01:30:58,090
Darn.

1176
01:30:58,210 --> 01:30:59,040
Hey.

1177
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:02,010
Are you that thief?

1178
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:03,120
Thief? That's harsh.

1179
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,160
And after I brought you dinner.

1180
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:09,310
Am I supposed to eat the flower too?

1181
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:10,800
Why would you do that?

1182
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,630
So you'll even eat flowers to survive.

1183
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,690
How did such a brave girl wind up locked up out here?

1184
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,620
Same reason as you.

1185
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:21,730
Aren't you here for the knife?

1186
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:24,730
Of course not. I live right over there.

1187
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:25,610
Did you steal it yet?

1188
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:27,170
No, not yet.

1189
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:29,610
But just before I came out here,

1190
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,710
I saw it start glowing

1191
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,090
With this beautiful, soft blue light.

1192
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,160
It lit up? In front of you?

1193
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:38,180
I was just there when it happened, but -

1194
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:39,460
But wait.

1195
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:43,280
I really feel like I met you when I was younger.

1196
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,500
But it's foggy.

1197
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:47,610
If you're about to tell me you like me, please don't.

1198
01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:49,320
We're not really married.

1199
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:54,530
No, listen. I really feel like if I could just remember that day...

1200
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:56,070
Help me remember.

1201
01:31:57,290 --> 01:31:58,170
Where are you from?

1202
01:31:58,170 --> 01:31:58,890
How did you get here?

1203
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:01,680
Do you really need my life story?

1204
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:05,330
Mr. Thief, just live your life far away from me.

1205
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:07,210
Earn an honest living.

1206
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:08,810
I knew you'd say that.

1207
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:11,830
Now, what is the significance of this?

1208
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:14,400
Where did this come from?

1209
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,740
How does the thunder come out?

1210
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,920
Don't pull that!

1211
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:18,480
Give it to me, carefully.

1212
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:22,180
First, tell me where the knife came from.

1213
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:23,170
From the future. (mirae)

1214
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:24,740
Mirae?

1215
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,090
Mirae?

1216
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:31,400
Wait, I've been there. That neighborhood by Wolcheongni -

1217
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:33,680
No, that's not right.

1218
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:38,100
That was Miorae.

1219
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:39,320
I haven't visited, then.

1220
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,810
I came here from over 600 years in the future.

1221
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,230
What do you think of that?

1222
01:32:43,230 --> 01:32:45,080
So I'm not getting 
any answers from you today, either.

1223
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,880
Wow. "What do you think of that?" with such a straight face.

1224
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,420
You'll need a better lie than that to get rid of me.

1225
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:52,260
So you're saying you live there. In the future.

1226
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:52,720
Yep.

1227
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:53,280
Does that make sense?

1228
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:56,080
Wait. Wait, let go, there's fire -

1229
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,130
Give me my gun.

1230
01:32:58,580 --> 01:32:59,390
Fire! I'm on fire!

1231
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,520
Hot!

1232
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:08,040
Where is that man?

1233
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:14,440
I'll give it back, 
but I think I'll get the knife first.

1234
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,740
Who were you talking to?

1235
01:33:40,610 --> 01:33:40,820
Let's go.

1236
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:13,560
[THE RECORD OF THE MAGISTRATE]

1237
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,660
The girl?

1238
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:16,910
She ate the food.

1239
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:18,500
She's dying now.

1240
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:19,590
Bury her.

1241
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,010
Bury them both together.

1242
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:22,210
Understood.

1243
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:24,700
Bring the knife.

1244
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:26,140
Yes, sir.

1245
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:36,060
Do you know how long it's been 
since we ate Milbon's food?

1246
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:38,170
Ten years, I think.

1247
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:39,720
Let's eat first and -

1248
01:34:43,690 --> 01:34:44,450
Poison... in the food?

1249
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:45,990
Could it be?

1250
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:49,090
Let's move quickly.

1251
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:50,350
Before the petrification sets in.

1252
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:55,310
The antidote, quickly.

1253
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:02,040
The petrification

1254
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:05,610
Is.  Here.

1255
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:28,490
Hurry, hurry.

1256
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:31,440
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

1257
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:47,760
Pull, pull.

1258
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,450
Food. Poison.

1259
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:12,410
An. Ti. Dote.

1260
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:13,810
Antidote?

1261
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,250
Coffins are coming

1262
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,180
What. Coffins?

1263
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:30,850
Our! Coffins!

1264
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:32,550
And who are you?

1265
01:37:03,970 --> 01:37:05,830
Poison in the food.

1266
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:07,490
Poison in the food?

1267
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:10,760
Poison in the food.

1268
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:16,070
But I gave her some of that food.

1269
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:18,950
The antidote.

1270
01:37:26,630 --> 01:37:29,000
That rat bastard.

1271
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:53,180
In the wind, of the wind!

1272
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:41,540
If you'll excuse me...

1273
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:34,690
Master!

1274
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:41,090
Get him.

1275
01:39:41,090 --> 01:39:42,470
To the forest!

1276
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:43,210
Catch them!

1277
01:39:55,210 --> 01:39:56,030
It's hot!

1278
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:57,570
It's so hot.

1279
01:39:59,090 --> 01:40:01,770
Hot...

1280
01:40:17,150 --> 01:40:18,210
Hot...

1281
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:04,680
Did you just wipe your mouth?

1282
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:07,910
Sure. I'll let that slide.

1283
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,610
Let's go find out why that bastard wants us dead.

1284
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:21,270
Wait-

1285
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:24,630
I'll lead them away.

1286
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:30,100
There he is! Get him!

1287
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:31,930
Catch him!

1288
01:41:33,470 --> 01:41:34,680
I have to go back.

1289
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:35,750
Stay here.

1290
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:38,130
No, you can't go.

1291
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:40,940
That woman...

1292
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:42,610
She could die.

1293
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,420
Mureuk, you could also die.

1294
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:48,660
It's okay.

1295
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:50,310
I'll be right back.

1296
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:51,900
In the wind, of the wind.

1297
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:15,200
The antidote.

1298
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:17,080
I brought the antidote.

1299
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:26,590
I'm sorry.

1300
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:29,490
I'm the one who brought you the poison.

1301
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,010
I'm so sorry.

1302
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:33,460
I'm sorry.

1303
01:42:42,230 --> 01:42:42,870
You're doing great.

1304
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,120
You'll be fine.

1305
01:43:28,430 --> 01:43:30,790
Bury the girl. Dump the boy in the river.

1306
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:34,990
Prepare the kiln.

1307
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:38,690
It's time to go back.

1308
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:58,230
[It is not known where the mysterious cloud came from...]

1309
01:43:58,230 --> 01:44:01,400
[But we are urging people to stay out of the affected areas of Seoul.]

1310
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:11,490
[Officials are trying to evaluate the threat, but there is no word yet on what can be done.]

1311
01:44:12,450 --> 01:44:13,410
What's that?

1312
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:15,800
This is the source of our energy.

1313
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:17,590
With the power in this knife,

1314
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:19,540
we can catch escaped criminals...

1315
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:21,400
We can even shift time, and see across it.

1316
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:24,030
It isn't linear, for us.

1317
01:44:24,350 --> 01:44:25,460
It all exists at the same time.

1318
01:44:27,730 --> 01:44:28,570
When we brought you back...

1319
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:30,710
This is what we used to do it.

1320
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:34,520
Then, if I went back, I could save people?

1321
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:35,520
That's not what I mean.

1322
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,170
In some sense, those people have already died.

1323
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:41,260
And this energy has become increasingly unstable.

1324
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:42,370
You have no idea.

1325
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:48,250
The future I see... Is fractured. Unclear.

1326
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:23,030
Find the collector. Give him this weapon.

1327
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:34,200
There are people here but- they're floating.

1328
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:35,800
I said, they're floating!

1329
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:01,540
Don't touch-

1330
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,010
I think I saw myself...

1331
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:15,440
It's been too long.

1332
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:20,430
It seems you are not restored to your full strength.

1333
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:23,770
No, I will need to stay in this form for a little while longer.

1334
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:28,830
I am not yet myself, I fear.

1335
01:46:30,830 --> 01:46:33,030
At least 3 ambulance workers have been lost inside the fog.

1336
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:38,070
As you can see, it remains quite thick, so it is best to plan alternate routes for the time being.

1337
01:46:38,070 --> 01:46:41,910
In addition, drones have filmed some mysterious footage-

1338
01:46:57,410 --> 01:46:59,320
That's the red stuff from earlier, right?

1339
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:01,700
People died.

1340
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:05,060
That was only one dose of Haava.

1341
01:47:05,910 --> 01:47:07,220
They have a lot more.

1342
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:08,530
In that ship?

1343
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:10,460
Dad, are you hurt?

1344
01:47:12,430 --> 01:47:12,890
I'm fine.

1345
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,230
I have to go take care of that ship.

1346
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:22,490
It's dangerous and I might not come back, so...

1347
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,730
I'll tell you something important.

1348
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:26,620
About your mom.

1349
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:27,870
My mom?

1350
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,440
I was the one that killed her.

1351
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:33,220
Why?

1352
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,880
I needed to kill the thing that was locked in her.

1353
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:39,080
And I brought you here because I needed you.

1354
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:41,090
If I had a child...

1355
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:43,860
I could live among humans without notice.

1356
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:46,550
But now you're getting in the way.

1357
01:47:48,820 --> 01:47:49,590
So I'll ask you to leave.

1358
01:47:51,580 --> 01:47:52,420
You're lying.

1359
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:53,590
Robots don't lie.

1360
01:47:55,570 --> 01:47:56,420
I'll go.

1361
01:47:57,210 --> 01:47:59,000
I knew you weren't human, but...

1362
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,540
Then send me back to where I came from.

1363
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:17,790
Your emergency reserves are down to 9%.

1364
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:19,080
If I leave, your survival rate-

1365
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:20,500
I'm aware. Stop talking.

1366
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:24,120
Yian, wait outside for a moment.

1367
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:25,110
Thunder-

1368
01:48:25,110 --> 01:48:27,000
Take her to Minsung's house. I know.

1369
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:55,590
What did you write on the picture?

1370
01:48:58,870 --> 01:49:00,670
[Run away, dummy.]

1371
01:49:07,090 --> 01:49:07,610
Thunder.

1372
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:09,510
Deliver my final message for me.

1373
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:15,180
We were wrong. To use humans like this.

1374
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:19,650
But Guards can never run away.

1375
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:21,730
So even if I don't have the reserves to win this fight...

1376
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:23,490
I must follow my program.

1377
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:25,670
Reserves? What does that mean?

1378
01:49:26,630 --> 01:49:27,520
It's how much life he has left.

1379
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:29,530
He's running out, little by little.

1380
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:32,140
Right now... reserves are at 8%.

1381
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:35,090
Odds of survival...

1382
01:49:35,290 --> 01:49:36,010
1%.

1383
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:33,770
Thunder, we have to go back.

1384
01:50:34,110 --> 01:50:34,610
I can't.

1385
01:50:35,330 --> 01:50:37,010
I have to take you to safety.

1386
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:38,420
Dad needs you.

1387
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:39,840
Turn the car around.

1388
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:41,360
There's no way you can help him.

1389
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:43,480
Maybe, but my heart says we have to try.

1390
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:45,690
Let's go back to Dad.

1391
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:01,960
So where is this bastard?

1392
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:04,070
The alarm has been turned on.

1393
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:07,080
We should finish this and go.

1394
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:20,630
Your heart?

1395
01:51:21,150 --> 01:51:21,530
Yes.

1396
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:34,630
Human hearts are really amazing.

1397
01:51:34,630 --> 01:51:35,810
Why?

1398
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:37,230
Odds of battle success...

1399
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:38,640
2%.

1400
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:39,480
3%.

1401
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:40,890
Now 4%.

1402
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:53,610
Prepare deployment.

1403
01:51:56,900 --> 01:51:58,730
Calibrations complete.

1404
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:08,230
We're almost there.

1405
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:09,660
Why are you coming back?

1406
01:52:09,660 --> 01:52:10,840
That ship has a weakness...

1407
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:12,980
The connection between the inner and outer systems...

1408
01:52:12,980 --> 01:52:14,690
That red heart, remember?

1409
01:52:17,250 --> 01:52:18,500
Who are you talking to?

1410
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:19,990
I'll get the knife to you.

1411
01:52:19,990 --> 01:52:20,600
Get it into the heart.

1412
01:52:21,110 --> 01:52:22,050
Moving now.

1413
01:52:29,870 --> 01:52:30,410
Got it!

1414
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:05,710
So you're the one who's been chasing us.

1415
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:08,530
Living here all this time..

1416
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:10,890
Even raising one of their children.

1417
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:17,640
Dad!

1418
01:53:35,450 --> 01:53:36,570
Let's get out of here, Dad.

1419
01:53:36,570 --> 01:53:37,880
Why did you come back?

1420
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:45,710
Thunder, are you listening?

1421
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:47,480
Where is it?

1422
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:24,030
Dad!

1423
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:34,250
They're coming!

1424
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:36,340
We can't stop them.

1425
01:54:36,340 --> 01:54:37,950
They're just going to keep chasing us.

1426
01:54:42,370 --> 01:54:42,820
Dad!

1427
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:43,770
He's on the car!

1428
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:52,630
We have to stop them before they can release the rest of the Haava!

1429
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:54,420
Let's switch times.

1430
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:55,930
Ready, set...

1431
01:54:56,310 --> 01:54:56,660
Go!

1432
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:12,690
So this was his room...

1433
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:17,370
And his clothes?

1434
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:22,680
Does this... look like a record of time to you?

1435
01:55:23,220 --> 01:55:25,310
If it's a calendar, it must be about 3600 days.

1436
01:55:25,530 --> 01:55:26,610
What's he been doing?

1437
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:27,890
Is he waiting for something?

1438
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:33,560
Jungmoon, Heuksol... That's us.

1439
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:38,070
That's the magistrate, and that's Dogshit...

1440
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:47,400
Look here. He destroyed something.

1441
01:55:47,950 --> 01:55:50,340
Goryeo Year Six, Hwangnyon Province.

1442
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:51,890
This is a record from ten years ago.

1443
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:58,380
The heavens opened. A strange carriage, pulling humans behind it, fell from the sky.

1444
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:01,940
I saw it with the magistrate, who was hunting nearby...

1445
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:06,380
And the dual mages of Mount Samgak.

1446
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:08,310
We're in the book.

1447
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:20,690
10 YEARS AGO

1448
01:56:20,990 --> 01:56:21,810
What is that?

1449
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:23,630
They've come through some sort of portal.

1450
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:24,390
Investigate it.

1451
01:56:25,390 --> 01:56:26,170
Wait here.

1452
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:29,110
I'll report back.

1453
01:56:34,050 --> 01:56:35,680
My lord, my lord!

1454
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:36,830
What on earth is happening?

1455
01:56:37,970 --> 01:56:39,200
It's dangerous! Stay back!

1456
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:40,290
But it's right by our house!

1457
01:56:53,530 --> 01:56:54,990
Thunder!

1458
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:07,530
We lost them. Let's get back, Thunder.

1459
01:57:08,530 --> 01:57:10,650
Gotta... get back...

1460
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:11,380
Thunder-

1461
01:57:12,340 --> 01:57:12,890
Thunder!

1462
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:22,030
Stay in the car.

1463
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:38,550
Dad!

1464
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:40,290
Thunder, take her back!

1465
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:44,620
Do it now!

1466
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:47,300
Thunder!

1467
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:48,390
Thunder!

1468
01:58:04,330 --> 01:58:05,520
Dad!

1469
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:13,640
Odds of victory: 10%...

1470
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:14,290
15%.

1471
01:58:14,750 --> 01:58:15,440
17%.

1472
01:58:16,330 --> 01:58:17,120
Why is it increasing?

1473
01:58:19,130 --> 01:58:20,150
I'm dying...

1474
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:30,970
Yian will do it.

1475
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:36,780
With another human. I can see it now.

1476
01:58:52,780 --> 01:58:54,860
The door has closed.

1477
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:20,010
Yian...

1478
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:21,850
You have to find me again!

1479
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:23,610
We can fix this!

1480
01:59:26,390 --> 01:59:27,730
I need another body...

1481
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:31,320
Human...

1482
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:34,170
I must find a human!

1483
02:00:15,370 --> 02:00:16,020
You're awake!

1484
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:17,440
Where are you from?

1485
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:18,550
Your clothes are strange!

1486
02:00:20,550 --> 02:00:21,200
Thunder!

1487
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:22,260
Thunder!

1488
02:00:23,510 --> 02:00:25,470
Energy - I can't lose the -

1489
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,480
Did you see a thing that looks like a knife?

1490
02:00:29,590 --> 02:00:30,010
A knife?

1491
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:32,280
Is it something important?

1492
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:34,200
I'll go look for it.

1493
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:35,720
Stay here.

1494
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:38,010
Who...

1495
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:41,680
It can't be... me...

1496
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:43,890
Why am I there?

1497
02:01:45,270 --> 02:01:46,290
Is this a dream?

1498
02:01:55,990 --> 02:01:57,450
I remember this.

1499
02:01:58,310 --> 02:02:00,390
I found a girl on the riverbank.

1500
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:04,700
She asked me to find a knife.

1501
02:02:18,130 --> 02:02:19,670
How am I still alive?

1502
02:02:30,580 --> 02:02:32,550
Have you ever put your hand...

1503
02:02:32,980 --> 02:02:35,890
into the mist rising from a waterfall?

1504
02:03:02,650 --> 02:03:03,310
She's not-

1505
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:09,650
Where are they?

1506
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:02,390
Our turn.

1507
02:04:23,090 --> 02:04:25,300
You are sleepy.

1508
02:04:25,300 --> 02:04:27,570
Don't you want to lay down?

1509
02:04:28,420 --> 02:04:31,960
Your body is heavy... Your eyes are closing...

1510
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:24,880
Freeze.

1511
02:05:32,060 --> 02:05:34,870
Should have bought it when we offered it, you bastard.

1512
02:05:39,560 --> 02:05:41,530
Rub your eyes if you want to go blind.

1513
02:05:43,180 --> 02:05:43,880
And next...

1514
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:49,860
We are pleased to introduce...

1515
02:05:50,230 --> 02:05:52,370
Something else you should have bought.

1516
02:05:52,370 --> 02:05:54,090
Our newest product!

1517
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:27,700
Soorisoori-ma, soorisoori-ma.

1518
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:31,860
Soorisoori-ma-ha, soorisoori-ma-ha.

1519
02:06:52,450 --> 02:06:53,000
Is that -

1520
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:53,910
It's the magistrate's sword.

1521
02:07:16,270 --> 02:07:19,700
Well, how about that. The antidote worked.

1522
02:07:21,880 --> 02:07:23,300
You're not dead! Are you okay?

1523
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:24,690
Seems you don't know Dosa.

1524
02:07:26,360 --> 02:07:28,110
I'll finish this one off.

1525
02:07:28,310 --> 02:07:30,510
Be careful. 
These bastards can even enter your body.

1526
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:31,710
Just buy some time.

1527
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:32,950
Hmm. I can do that.

1528
02:07:34,900 --> 02:07:37,750
Ah. I remembered where we met befo-

1529
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:46,580
This is an excellent new product. We did well.

1530
02:07:47,410 --> 02:07:48,860
She's still alive.

1531
02:07:49,710 --> 02:07:51,030
That's great.

1532
02:07:56,090 --> 02:07:56,810
Why am I -

1533
02:07:58,020 --> 02:07:59,530
I'm feeling her pain like it was my own.

1534
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:02,090
Because that's Suyang's daughter.

1535
02:08:04,410 --> 02:08:05,570
Hey, kid.

1536
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,860
Put this medicine on your injuries.

1537
02:08:08,070 --> 02:08:08,430
Catch.

1538
02:08:09,890 --> 02:08:11,710
I'm sharing because 
it seems like we're on the same side.

1539
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:13,680
I'm sorry about before.

1540
02:08:14,230 --> 02:08:15,230
I'm sure you are.

1541
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:18,200
I'm Heuksol, of the Mount Samgak mages.

1542
02:08:19,250 --> 02:08:20,250
I'm Yian.

1543
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:21,690
What an unusual name.

1544
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:28,340
In the wind, of the wind.

1545
02:08:30,820 --> 02:08:32,020
Finally.

1546
02:09:47,220 --> 02:09:47,630
Help her!

1547
02:09:48,740 --> 02:09:49,880
I'll hold him here!

1548
02:09:50,490 --> 02:09:51,850
This looks like a job for me!

1549
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:37,860
Hot.

1550
02:10:39,630 --> 02:10:41,100
Very hot.

1551
02:10:58,490 --> 02:10:59,450
Heuk-sol!

1552
02:11:56,480 --> 02:11:58,060
How did he get that sword?

1553
02:12:09,750 --> 02:12:11,070
Yian!

1554
02:12:11,070 --> 02:12:12,050
Shoot, shoot!

1555
02:12:13,010 --> 02:12:15,590
Into that mirror, there!

1556
02:12:15,590 --> 02:12:16,950
Shoot!

1557
02:13:03,010 --> 02:13:04,280
He's breaking free!

1558
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:05,850
Hold him!

1559
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:53,140
Hey. I'm the one you're looking for.

1560
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:04,950
Right Paw, Left Paw! Go with the girl!

1561
02:14:41,860 --> 02:14:43,540
Done. Your five minutes are up.

1562
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:05,500
There's something...

1563
02:16:05,500 --> 02:16:07,860
Got it... Inside you...

1564
02:16:08,370 --> 02:16:08,770
What did you say?

1565
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:13,140
In you... there's something...

1566
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:14,310
What's inside me?

1567
02:16:15,090 --> 02:16:16,800
In you...

1568
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:20,800
That... That... That thing...

1569
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:23,300
In you...

1570
02:16:24,660 --> 02:16:25,930
What are you sayi-

1571
02:16:46,290 --> 02:16:47,510
I didn't find any knives...

1572
02:16:48,270 --> 02:16:49,300
But is this yours?

1573
02:16:49,590 --> 02:16:50,040
Yes.

1574
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:56,750
What's your name? I'm Mureuk.

1575
02:16:57,330 --> 02:16:58,240
Yian.

1576
02:16:58,610 --> 02:16:59,320
Yian.

1577
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:01,620
Yian.

1578
02:17:03,690 --> 02:17:04,340
What is it?

1579
02:17:07,660 --> 02:17:09,070
There might be something dangerous out there.

1580
02:17:09,350 --> 02:17:10,200
I'll go take a look.

1581
02:17:10,530 --> 02:17:11,060
No!

1582
02:17:11,610 --> 02:17:12,660
Don't worry.

1583
02:17:12,660 --> 02:17:14,070
I'm very sturdy.

1584
02:17:50,070 --> 02:17:50,890
Found one...

1585
02:17:51,820 --> 02:17:52,780
A human...

1586
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:10,970
Heuk-seul... Earlier...

1587
02:18:12,580 --> 02:18:15,520
There were four names hanging up.

1588
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:18,540
But it wasn't all of us.

1589
02:18:19,690 --> 02:18:20,680
Not four.

1590
02:18:21,690 --> 02:18:22,660
Five of us saw them.

1591
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:23,660
Then...

1592
02:18:26,440 --> 02:18:28,040
So the last one they needed to find...

1593
02:18:31,250 --> 02:18:32,020
He has the powers of a Dosa...

1594
02:18:33,210 --> 02:18:35,230
And one of those monsters inside him.

1595
02:18:36,010 --> 02:18:37,110
Do we have to kill him, then?

1596
02:19:23,480 --> 02:19:25,940
We have to stop them before they can release the rest of the Haava!

1597
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:29,590
We have to act fast!

1598
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:31,410
Let's switch times.

1599
02:19:36,460 --> 02:19:36,900
What is that?

1600
02:19:54,130 --> 02:19:56,250
48 minutes left until detonation.

1601
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:58,430
The controller is awakened.

1602
02:19:58,980 --> 02:20:00,940
Freedom is coming.

1603
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:01,840
The time...

1604
02:20:02,210 --> 02:20:02,840
is now.

1605
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:43,000
