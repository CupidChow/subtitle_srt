PRESENTED BY LOTTE ENTERTAINMENT

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,999
A SOOFILM PRODUCTION

4
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:15,093
A MIN KYU-DONG FILM

5
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:20,642
1505 A.D. King Yeonsan-gun ordered
'Beauty Recruit Officers'

6
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:23,042
to bring him over 10,000 women
for his carnal desires,

7
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:25,347
which led to widespread anger
among the populace.

8
00:01:25,347 --> 00:01:27,076
- ANNALS OF THE JOSEON DYNASTY-

9
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,077
To understand how
a king ruined his nation,

10
00:01:34,122 --> 00:01:37,023
hear my tale.

11
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:42,062
It is the 10th year of his rule.

12
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:46,033
On the night of Blood Moon,

13
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:50,994
two men met the mother of
deposed Queen Yoon.

14
00:01:52,073 --> 00:02:00,037
Through them the king obtained

15
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,074
a blood stained woman's clothing.

16
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:07,044
ls this really what
my mother was wearing

17
00:02:09,057 --> 00:02:11,126
when she was killed?

18
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:12,160
Your Highness!

19
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,153
The late king wanted to
keep this a secret,

20
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:19,801
so I desired to
take this to my grave...

21
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:22,065
So why bring it now?

22
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,107
An unknown party
hired an assassin to steal it!

23
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:28,844
By whom?

24
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:33,144
Half of the court tried to
dethrone the late Queen,

25
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:37,114
so we do not know
who's behind the plot.

26
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:42,157
But we could not ignore
where this may lead to.

27
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:44,125
Who'd have thought,

28
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:53,100
a piece of clothing would
result in a blood bath.

29
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:58,094
Where did
the enraged king first visit?

30
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:01,176
He killed his father's
2 resentful concubines

31
00:03:01,176 --> 00:03:04,077
with his bare hands,

32
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:06,136
and iron mace.

33
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:12,176
Their bodies were torn up
and scattered in the mountain.

34
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:20,183
He also killed his grandmother
for slandering his mother,

35
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:24,199
and those who spread
defaming rumors,

36
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,234
supporters of dethronement,

37
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:29,871
maids who transported the poison,

38
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:32,237
they were all mercilessly killed

39
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:38,145
by poison, decapitation,

40
00:03:38,213 --> 00:03:41,205
and dismemberment into pieces.

41
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:45,118
Traitors' tombstones were destroyed,

42
00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:48,121
their remains dug up

43
00:03:48,223 --> 00:03:51,215
and smashed to smithereens,

44
00:03:52,227 --> 00:03:58,166
eventually ending up as
dust in the air.

45
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:07,198
Over 200 remains were
fed to the pigs.

46
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,202
This killing spree
became known as

47
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,215
the Second Literati Purge.

48
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:21,245
However, two men never stopped
laughing during the purge:

49
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,225
Minister IM Soong-jae,

50
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:28,228
and his father IM Sa-hong.

51
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,266
They were
the most treacherous men alive.

52
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:36,270
What goes around
comes around,

53
00:04:37,272 --> 00:04:46,203
your bone dust
may fly in the wind one day...

54
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:51,241
THE TREACHEROUS

55
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:02,030
Your Highness, we can't...

56
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,225
Don't move!
I'm almost done.

57
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,236
This brush won't let go
once in my hand.

58
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:11,295
Minister!

59
00:05:11,373 --> 00:05:13,307
Yes, Highness.

60
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:18,079
I believe all vicious weeds
have been uprooted.

61
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:24,314
Your resolve to eliminate them
has reached the heavens.

62
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,312
Lt wasn't my resolve alone,
your efforts paid off.

63
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:31,291
All done.

64
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,316
Come in!

65
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:44,362
Please sit.

66
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:51,311
Lt is quite a sight.

67
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:55,315
I just love this silver knife.

68
00:05:55,383 --> 00:06:00,343
With the will of the taker against
the defender of chastity,

69
00:06:01,322 --> 00:06:05,258
two innate desires in one...

70
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,325
It is simply magnificent.

71
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:10,065
I am honored, Your Highness.

72
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:14,434
I must reward you two
for your continuous sacrifices.

73
00:06:16,171 --> 00:06:18,366
Hope you like it.

74
00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:24,379
Your grief over the recent affairs

75
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:27,371
is clearly expressed.

76
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,351
What say you?

77
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:36,351
Vivid sensuality is enough
to arouse one's lust,

78
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:41,391
but their false expression
prevent it from reaching grace.

79
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:44,432
Then I must throw this out.

80
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:48,366
There is a way to elevate it.

81
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:50,370
IM

82
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:54,976
IM Soong-jae

83
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:59,414
By claiming it as my own,
it'll not taint your reputation,

84
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:05,353
and it is a masterpiece
considering my limited talent.

85
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:09,322
Bullshit!

86
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:15,395
You are something!

87
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:19,433
Did the king really
bestow you this?

88
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:22,436
Don't you see my name on it?

89
00:07:22,504 --> 00:07:26,406
Now, whoever
mimics this pose the best,

90
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:30,444
will be awarded with
this golden toad.

91
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:36,484
My Lord.

92
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:40,483
We only have
one new addition today.

93
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:46,261
ls she not the one?

94
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:48,456
If you give me that drawing,

95
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,932
I'll show you something better.

96
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:52,422
What?

97
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,459
I heard you check
all the new girls.

98
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:01,509
Who could you be looking for?

99
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:06,412
I'm not sure, but you are
definitely not the one.

100
00:08:10,518 --> 00:08:14,338
I heard you're the king's
most trusted confidant.

101
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:16,239
However,

102
00:08:16,908 --> 00:08:19,377
tonight, you are my king.

103
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:28,436
Then I shall show you
how a king jests.

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,231
For every jar I empty,
take off an article.

105
00:08:35,572 --> 00:08:38,541
If I pass out
before you're naked,

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,700
in addition to the drawing,
I'll bring you into the palace.

107
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:51,053
But if I win,
you'll walk the streets naked.

108
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,901
- Will you accept?
- Of course.

109
00:09:58,868 --> 00:10:00,836
Hurry up.

110
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:05,830
Good.

111
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:17,843
That was the final drink.

112
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:25,827
- My Lord...
- Get on with it!

113
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:28,386
My Lord!

114
00:10:32,835 --> 00:10:33,802
Please spare me!

115
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,874
Spare you?
It was merely a jest!

116
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:40,775
I overstepped...

117
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:45,780
You sly devious whore!

118
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:49,285
- Strip all the way!
- What's going on?

119
00:10:49,285 --> 00:10:50,887
Stop this at once!

120
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:53,890
The king's gift is an heirloom!

121
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,859
You must be joking.

122
00:10:57,327 --> 00:10:59,852
That lewd drawing
as an heirloom?

123
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:02,865
You ungrateful bastard!

124
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:03,854
How dare you!

125
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:08,837
Don't you know
I got you reinstated?

126
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:12,999
Everyone out!
At once!

127
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:58,697
After these two men
shook up the country,

128
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:03,725
streets were filled with criticisms.

129
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:09,542
The king left official duties behind
for carnal desires,

130
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:15,742
royal advices from
his ministers fell on deaf ears.

131
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:21,754
He turned a city
into a hunting ground...

132
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:28,783
The hunt for his populace
or animals has begun!

133
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,735
As his tyranny peaked,
this nation faced a crisis.

134
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:44,743
'We must call for an uprising,

135
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:48,747
that thrones a fair king
to replace the old!'

136
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:56,778
Today's hunt is
starting off with a bang.

137
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:58,849
Let's go!

138
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,856
No need for tears.

139
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:04,794
Your life will change
if he asks for you.

140
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:06,798
Giddyup!

141
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:13,802
It's been a while since
us brothers went on a hunt.

142
00:13:13,873 --> 00:13:16,774
Indeed, Your Highness.

143
00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:20,580
Have you walked the streets
under a disguise lately?

144
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,448
Well, yes.

145
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:25,815
If I am preoccupied with
official duties,

146
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:29,787
it is your duty to keep an ear
on the populace on my behalf.

147
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:30,845
Yes.

148
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:37,829
Or are you holding
something back?

149
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:40,799
What do you mean?

150
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:55,814
I am simply jesting!

151
00:13:57,584 --> 00:14:02,922
You Highness, how about
a friendly race?

152
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:05,220
Yes, that'd be fun!

153
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:06,881
Minister PARK!

154
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:08,861
Yes, Your Highness!

155
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:13,923
So...

156
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,892
What should we bet?

157
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:20,940
I have nothing worthy to bet,
Your Highness.

158
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,742
You have your life.

159
00:14:22,742 --> 00:14:25,210
Highness, you jest.

160
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:26,946
Don't worry.

161
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:31,883
Many will offer their necks
in your stead.

162
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:38,891
How about we test
their loyalty to you?

163
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,369
Your Highness!

164
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:28,425
Get the royal physician!

165
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:30,451
Physician! Physician!

166
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,370
I order you to exterminate storks
from our land at once.

167
00:16:43,472 --> 00:16:45,474
Do you understand?

168
00:16:45,474 --> 00:16:47,442
Yes, Your Highness!

169
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:29,211
The king began to suffer from
apparitions and insomnia,

170
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:36,194
it was said that this was
due to heavy blood loss.

171
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:41,221
It was unlike of Soong-jae
to miss this chance.

172
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,374
Your Highness.

173
00:18:44,386 --> 00:18:46,377
How do you feel?

174
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:51,324
What do you think
of the sun?

175
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:58,364
It is brilliantly radiant,
and all encompassing...

176
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:01,425
Just like Your Highness.

177
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:08,409
Then, like the sun,
do I...

178
00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:12,403
encompass all of Joseon?

179
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:17,441
If you grace women of Joseon
with your light,

180
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:22,457
it will rid of their shadows
and cure Your Highness.

181
00:19:22,457 --> 00:19:27,394
What nonsense,
when His Highness is ill.

182
00:19:28,463 --> 00:19:33,423
There is no shame in
pursuing carnal desires.

183
00:19:34,436 --> 00:19:39,396
I'll bring you a millennium of
pleasures for one night!

184
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:49,714
My baby.

185
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:55,355
It is my duty to select
the girls for the king.

186
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,450
I know my baby's taste
the best.

187
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:04,460
I will handpick the girls
for my baby's liking,

188
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:06,501
so why don't you allow me...

189
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:09,499
I have plans,

190
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:15,441
so set your worries aside,
and help me sleep.

191
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:17,467
What plans?

192
00:20:18,513 --> 00:20:22,449
Your Highness,
Minister IM has arrived.

193
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:24,509
Let him in!

194
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:35,496
Just in time,
I've been curious.

195
00:20:35,564 --> 00:20:38,465
Here is the list of
candidates.

196
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:43,494
They say your life flashes
before you when facing death.

197
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:48,472
Do you know what I saw
at that moment?

198
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:52,514
I saw the look of those
who wished for my death.

199
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:57,451
I cannot forget
the anticipation on their faces.

200
00:20:58,553 --> 00:21:02,580
They'll hide their teeth
and wait for their time.

201
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:06,583
If their teeth are hidden
behind their lips,

202
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:11,498
why not sew them shut
for good?

203
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:18,539
I've been holding banquets
despite difficult circumstances,

204
00:21:19,608 --> 00:21:24,545
to seek those who could
bear me an heir.

205
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:30,552
I realized I should have
searched farther.

206
00:21:31,553 --> 00:21:36,547
Ergo, I order a nationwide
beauty recruiting.

207
00:21:37,158 --> 00:21:42,596
They'll be called 'comforters',
and live up to that name.

208
00:21:43,164 --> 00:21:46,497
Therefore, Minister IM Soong-jae,

209
00:21:46,568 --> 00:21:48,593
and Minister of Defense IM Sa-hong

210
00:21:49,104 --> 00:21:53,564
are given full royal authority
as 'Beauty Recruit Officers'!

211
00:21:55,577 --> 00:21:59,604
We are eternally grateful,
Your Highness.

212
00:22:02,684 --> 00:22:04,652
It's a sunny place

213
00:22:05,153 --> 00:22:09,424
and a prime spot
to watch the sunset.

214
00:22:09,424 --> 00:22:15,056
I was saving it for a gazebo,
but I hope you like it.

215
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,633
It's good enough for a palace!

216
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:20,601
Palace? Nice!

217
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:27,642
How would we solicit
to change king's orders?

218
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:30,577
We cannot accept this.

219
00:22:34,683 --> 00:22:35,684
Sir...

220
00:22:35,684 --> 00:22:38,585
- Out of my way!
- Minister YU...

221
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:42,555
Consort JANG must be desperate.

222
00:22:42,991 --> 00:22:45,619
But you didn't
need to be so cold.

223
00:22:45,694 --> 00:22:48,663
We cannot ignore her.

224
00:22:49,698 --> 00:22:54,635
Thought the candidates
were chosen at random?

225
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:04,635
Those who looked down on us
will beg for their lives.

226
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,640
The strong gets to pick,
the weak gets picked.

227
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:12,654
One more drink, please?

228
00:23:12,654 --> 00:23:15,623
- Come here, bitch!
- Minister PARK, it's not our room!

229
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:20,695
I didn't realize the loyal subjects

230
00:23:20,695 --> 00:23:25,632
who work tirelessly
for the king's virility were here.

231
00:23:26,668 --> 00:23:28,636
Excuse me.

232
00:23:32,173 --> 00:23:36,610
As if all your scheming
and pimping weren't enough,

233
00:23:36,678 --> 00:23:41,877
now you'll scrounge
every virgin for his pleasure?

234
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,619
Drink quietly.

235
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:45,608
Soong-jae.

236
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:48,656
Are you so desperate for power?

237
00:23:48,656 --> 00:23:52,615
ls it today?
Your sister's death anniversary.

238
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:59,701
When the king frequented her room,
I was often by his side.

239
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:03,660
What I heard weren't screams,
but moans.

240
00:24:03,738 --> 00:24:05,073
So why the suicide?

241
00:24:05,073 --> 00:24:06,700
IM Soong-jae!

242
00:24:07,075 --> 00:24:08,702
How does it feel!

243
00:24:09,244 --> 00:24:12,747
To know that
you bow down to the man

244
00:24:12,747 --> 00:24:16,649
who raped your sister?

245
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:22,162
May I have another?

246
00:24:33,217 --> 00:24:37,347
Are you confident that
you can serve the king?

247
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:41,192
I have experienced
men of all kinds,

248
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:45,128
from nobles, farmers, butchers,
to even thugs.

249
00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:47,164
Any man with balls intact,

250
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:50,167
I can wrap him in my skirt

251
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:52,101
and suck his soul out.

252
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:55,206
How dare you compare
the king to peasants!

253
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:57,174
But isn't the king

254
00:24:58,175 --> 00:24:59,944
also a man?

255
00:24:59,944 --> 00:25:04,176
Overconfidence aside,
you'll do.

256
00:25:04,248 --> 00:25:07,183
Glad that she's to your liking.

257
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:11,187
I cannot tolerate
the two 'lM's anymore.

258
00:25:11,255 --> 00:25:13,724
I must regain my power,

259
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:16,192
so take special care,
Minister YU!

260
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,162
Red!

261
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:26,236
It's red!

262
00:25:26,904 --> 00:25:31,204
One word out of the king,
the red flag is raised.

263
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:37,208
Show yourself!
Show yourself to me!

264
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:43,152
The one who'll comfort the king
will become Comforters!

265
00:25:43,254 --> 00:25:46,189
The one who'll cleanse him,

266
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,191
will be the Consort!

267
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:52,229
It's not a formal court affair.

268
00:25:52,863 --> 00:25:58,233
So it won't be guaranteed
whether the king will grace her.

269
00:25:59,036 --> 00:26:04,269
But ultimately she'll serve the king.

270
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:06,266
Father!

271
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,268
Let me go!

272
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:11,270
Honey!

273
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:18,253
Daughters, wives, mistresses
were all requisitioned...

274
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:23,294
Wearing red uniform
and taking girls away,

275
00:26:23,294 --> 00:26:25,285
they were the grim reapers,

276
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:30,299
and not a single woman
was spotted on the street.

277
00:26:31,302 --> 00:26:38,265
There are more than
one way to find girls!

278
00:26:42,313 --> 00:26:44,213
Oh no!

279
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:45,305
Your Majesty!

280
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,321
This young lady is destined to
become a queen!

281
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:51,322
Please stop.

282
00:26:51,322 --> 00:26:53,313
Your Majesty!

283
00:26:54,325 --> 00:26:55,960
Dammit.

284
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,258
- Come with us!
- Wait! Hold on!

285
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:08,304
So much chaos
and shady deals.

286
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,377
One could not watch on
without tearing up.

287
00:27:13,377 --> 00:27:14,366
Virgin!

288
00:27:15,346 --> 00:27:20,283
Virgins were marked red,
while others blue.

289
00:27:21,318 --> 00:27:24,310
The royal artist painted
day and night,

290
00:27:24,388 --> 00:27:29,325
turning teary faces
into happy ones.

291
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:35,321
I think we have enough.

292
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:41,361
But the king will want someone
truly unique.

293
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,371
They are not enough
to win against the Consort.

294
00:27:46,977 --> 00:27:48,376
If so...

295
00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:52,383
there's one last place to visit.

296
00:27:52,383 --> 00:27:55,318
NEUNGJU

297
00:27:56,353 --> 00:27:57,342
Enough!

298
00:28:04,395 --> 00:28:05,419
Listen here.

299
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:10,468
Debt must be repaid with money,
what is this nonsense?

300
00:28:10,468 --> 00:28:16,240
You moved up the deadline,
this was all I could muster.

301
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,405
So, didn't I say
I'll void your debt

302
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:24,380
for a drink
with your daughter.

303
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,383
Do you not understand?

304
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:32,378
I'll make her an orphan

305
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:34,424
and take her!

306
00:28:38,462 --> 00:28:41,098
Who's this?

307
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:43,434
You haven't changed at all.

308
00:28:43,434 --> 00:28:46,403
Your sharp tongue is
still the same.

309
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,404
Come in.

310
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:50,373
Come.

311
00:28:50,441 --> 00:28:52,773
Father! Father!

312
00:28:53,444 --> 00:28:55,344
Are you all right?

313
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:03,487
I heard you and my father
were old friends.

314
00:29:03,487 --> 00:29:05,455
We were indeed.

315
00:29:05,523 --> 00:29:10,460
Time travels faster
than an arrow.

316
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:14,899
I also heard you promised
to achieve greatness together!

317
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:16,901
Did we?

318
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:21,463
Well, it became difficult
since my father was dismissed.

319
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:28,145
You could've prevented
his dismissal.

320
00:29:28,145 --> 00:29:32,479
But instead,
you spoke ill of him!

321
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:36,487
Checkmate.

322
00:29:36,487 --> 00:29:38,421
Bad move.

323
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:40,191
Mind if I take back?

324
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:41,988
Not at all!

325
00:29:43,494 --> 00:29:45,485
Not a problem at all.

326
00:29:48,532 --> 00:29:53,492
Look, I couldn't help him
back then,

327
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:58,437
since I was too weak
to stand against the court.

328
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:00,500
There was no malice.

329
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:06,574
Please forgive me... Take my fortune!
Just look at her, she's my only daughter!

330
00:30:07,585 --> 00:30:12,492
A palanquin will come for her,
so have her ready.

331
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:18,859
Did you hear?
Even Lord JO got raided.

332
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:23,675
Those scouts are
no better than pirates.

333
00:30:23,675 --> 00:30:26,678
They already took more than
ten thousand girls!

334
00:30:26,678 --> 00:30:27,838
It's insane!

335
00:30:28,847 --> 00:30:31,883
If I ever see
one of those scouts,

336
00:30:31,883 --> 00:30:34,818
I'll skin them alive!

337
00:30:35,854 --> 00:30:39,847
Why aren't I recruited?
I'm the fairest.

338
00:30:41,067 --> 00:30:43,058
Leaving already?

339
00:30:43,136 --> 00:30:45,036
They'll begin soon.

340
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:46,105
Begin what?

341
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:49,097
Aren't you here for the show?

342
00:31:03,356 --> 00:31:08,293
The world is in disarray,
people are driven into mountains,

343
00:31:08,361 --> 00:31:13,264
and the hunger has forced them
to eat each other.

344
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:20,261
The enraged mountain god
sent a tiger!

345
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:26,345
With the god's order,
it came to renounce the world,

346
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:31,248
but could not find any
guilty men.

347
00:31:31,317 --> 00:31:34,286
Why should people be guilty
of poverty?

348
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:39,313
Corrupt officials behind high walls
are the guilty ones.

349
00:31:39,392 --> 00:31:40,426
They deserve to die!

350
00:31:40,426 --> 00:31:45,363
When the tiger could not
climb over the high wall,

351
00:31:45,998 --> 00:31:51,300
it decided to become flesh
and blood of the peasants,

352
00:31:51,404 --> 00:31:58,333
and help wreak havoc
on the corrupted.

353
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:06,774
He saw her briefly.

354
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:10,579
Wide forehead,
eyebrows like weeping willow,

355
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,583
clear peacock eyes,
sharp nose,

356
00:32:16,595 --> 00:32:19,587
and lips like peach skin...

357
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:24,558
He knew he had found the one!

358
00:32:25,604 --> 00:32:28,573
But... she was a meager butcher.

359
00:32:28,641 --> 00:32:30,575
A butcher!

360
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,360
Look here!

361
00:33:26,436 --> 00:33:28,138
May I help you?

362
00:33:28,138 --> 00:33:29,400
Could you remove your hat?

363
00:33:29,906 --> 00:33:32,442
It's no face for a noble.

364
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:33,431
Hey! It's him.

365
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,435
Fitting your title
as the women hunter!

366
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:39,482
Going after a girl
like a dog in heat!

367
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:42,417
How dare you
talk to a noble like that!

368
00:33:42,485 --> 00:33:45,454
I got no business
with you two, so get lost.

369
00:33:46,422 --> 00:33:47,389
Let's go.

370
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:53,462
Who hired you?

371
00:33:54,197 --> 00:33:55,391
Hire me?

372
00:33:55,465 --> 00:33:56,466
You got it wrong.

373
00:33:56,466 --> 00:33:59,469
I volunteer myself
to kick the shit out of you!

374
00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:00,458
- Agree?
- Sure.

375
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:17,419
I got him good!

376
00:34:28,464 --> 00:34:29,431
You bitch!

377
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:32,458
You bastard!

378
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,457
Feeling better, sir?

379
00:34:58,561 --> 00:34:59,528
Are you hurt?

380
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:01,496
It's nothing.

381
00:35:01,564 --> 00:35:05,432
Why did you follow me?

382
00:35:07,537 --> 00:35:11,473
I once knew a sword dancer.

383
00:35:12,475 --> 00:35:16,502
She had a unique
hand gesture and steps.

384
00:35:17,547 --> 00:35:20,482
Where did you learn
that dance?

385
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:24,516
It came to me
while working as a butcher.

386
00:35:24,587 --> 00:35:27,488
Not from a teacher.

387
00:35:29,525 --> 00:35:30,514
I see.

388
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:35,564
Sir, I have a favor to ask.

389
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,564
Could you...

390
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:39,568
recruit me?

391
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,539
I'll pretend
I didn't hear that.

392
00:35:44,607 --> 00:35:48,311
ls it because my hands reek
of animal blood?

393
00:35:48,311 --> 00:35:49,612
At least you know.

394
00:35:49,612 --> 00:35:50,601
But sir!

395
00:35:51,581 --> 00:35:54,516
My father has a large debt.

396
00:35:54,617 --> 00:35:55,585
So please...

397
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:56,552
Let go.

398
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:01,190
I will even...

399
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,556
offer myself to you.

400
00:36:14,634 --> 00:36:17,501
Come on out!

401
00:36:36,056 --> 00:36:38,388
Show your face!

402
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:45,397
I am Jung-hwa,
Lord JO's daughter.

403
00:37:19,065 --> 00:37:20,233
I'm back, father.

404
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:21,427
Good work.

405
00:37:30,076 --> 00:37:32,374
- Let's go inside.
- Yes.

406
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:42,519
Over there!

407
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,520
What are you doing?

408
00:38:02,534 --> 00:38:06,470
Nothing wrong with
getting a little taste.

409
00:38:06,572 --> 00:38:08,506
Hold still!

410
00:38:14,112 --> 00:38:15,511
Do you wish to die?

411
00:38:16,014 --> 00:38:18,505
She's a property of the king.

412
00:38:19,484 --> 00:38:20,519
Spare me, sir!

413
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:22,453
Your father allowed it...

414
00:38:22,521 --> 00:38:25,456
- You lie!
- It's true.

415
00:38:27,092 --> 00:38:29,492
Was this your plan
all along?

416
00:38:29,561 --> 00:38:35,466
She'll be defiled at the palace,
it won't make a difference.

417
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:39,493
She's just paying for
her father's crimes.

418
00:38:40,105 --> 00:38:44,565
Will you give up your power
over petty grudge?

419
00:38:45,344 --> 00:38:48,541
Makhana lotus flower
blooms once a century.

420
00:38:48,647 --> 00:38:51,583
She is the lotus I found!

421
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:55,576
It's too early to know
if she'll bloom or wither.

422
00:38:57,623 --> 00:39:02,594
The path towards the king
won't be so smooth.

423
00:39:02,594 --> 00:39:04,528
I was just startled.

424
00:39:04,596 --> 00:39:09,533
A lowly butcher personating
a noble's daughter...

425
00:39:10,602 --> 00:39:12,570
What are you really after?

426
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:18,332
Repaying my father's debt,
that's all.

427
00:39:19,311 --> 00:39:23,611
You chose to walk this path,
let's see how long you last.

428
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:33,523
Your Highness!

429
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:37,528
- Minister PARK reporting...
- Who dares to interrupt!

430
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:53,577
- Are they here?
- Yes, Your Highness.

431
00:40:11,663 --> 00:40:13,893
Minister IM Sa-hong.

432
00:40:14,132 --> 00:40:16,600
Minister IM Soong-jae.

433
00:40:17,202 --> 00:40:20,603
We returned from our duties...

434
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:24,643
Okay! Good!

435
00:40:24,643 --> 00:40:25,667
I've waited so long!

436
00:40:26,111 --> 00:40:28,875
Good, raise your heads!

437
00:40:29,114 --> 00:40:30,103
Now!

438
00:40:30,649 --> 00:40:33,618
You'll eat Joseon's
greatest delicacies

439
00:40:33,685 --> 00:40:36,654
on gold plates
to your heart's content.

440
00:40:37,189 --> 00:40:40,852
You'll wear clothes of
silk and satin,

441
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:47,666
we'll hold banquets on the river,
bathe in the valley,

442
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:52,660
hunt tigers together,
and make love every day...

443
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:57,409
However, if you miss
your husband or lover,

444
00:40:57,409 --> 00:40:59,578
or even think about escaping,

445
00:40:59,578 --> 00:41:01,705
I'll behead you on the spot!

446
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:13,715
All right! I'll take you
to our playground!

447
00:41:15,694 --> 00:41:16,718
Behold!

448
00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:25,704
Let me introduce your peers!

449
00:41:25,704 --> 00:41:29,606
This university is intended
to educate...

450
00:41:29,674 --> 00:41:35,747
Even Confucius said
if you disregard interaction,

451
00:41:35,747 --> 00:41:41,379
you can't expect
true growth, right?

452
00:41:42,187 --> 00:41:46,825
There are strict code of conduct
between men and women.

453
00:41:46,825 --> 00:41:50,693
I even brought your wife here.

454
00:41:50,796 --> 00:41:52,787
So don't be so harsh.

455
00:41:53,765 --> 00:41:56,529
How's our baby?

456
00:41:56,802 --> 00:42:00,761
I found a wet nurse,
so don't worry.

457
00:42:05,777 --> 00:42:09,247
Until these comforters
become consorts,

458
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:11,550
they'll reside here,

459
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:16,715
and lower comforters will be
disciplined at nearby temples!

460
00:42:16,788 --> 00:42:18,779
Yes, Your Highness!

461
00:42:22,527 --> 00:42:25,764
This is unbearable.

462
00:42:25,764 --> 00:42:30,895
Turning universities and temples
into comforter training camps!

463
00:42:31,336 --> 00:42:34,772
This has gone too far
and too long.

464
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,774
How long must we wait?

465
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,709
Who must we induct?

466
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:46,774
Who else?
Prince Jinseong, of course.

467
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:51,789
Our time will come.

468
00:42:52,824 --> 00:42:56,726
People's resentment is
getting deeper.

469
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:02,733
Wake up!

470
00:43:03,735 --> 00:43:06,727
Move faster!
Hurry!

471
00:43:07,028 --> 00:43:09,397
What makes an ideal woman?

472
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,334
How do you consider yourself
for the ultimate contact?

473
00:43:29,558 --> 00:43:33,722
- Confucius said... - With respect...
Aren't we just wet holes for the king to fuck?

474
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:37,463
We're royal palace piss pots, albeit the best kind.

475
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,500
Capable of taking any loads from men of all ages and sorts.

476
00:43:42,738 --> 00:43:44,141
We are like medicine.

477
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,000
Using our body to heal another.

478
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:51,084
That is the real contact.

479
00:43:52,815 --> 00:43:54,840
Very good!

480
00:43:54,909 --> 00:44:00,648
Whatever it may be,
nobody knows who among you

481
00:44:00,648 --> 00:44:03,776
will become consorts
or discarded as slaves.

482
00:44:03,884 --> 00:44:05,852
Contests and lectures will be held,

483
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,855
so do your absolute best.

484
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:13,827
Do you really believe
you're a medicine?

485
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:17,831
I shall teach you
how to be one.

486
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:22,636
How ridiculous,
how ridiculous...

487
00:44:22,636 --> 00:44:27,835
The king is a poet,
so learn the metaphors.

488
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:30,844
He is a brilliant painter!

489
00:44:30,911 --> 00:44:34,813
Use your body
to express yourself.

490
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:39,819
Pierce the moon with your toes!

491
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:40,854
Higher!

492
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:46,792
Raising your heels will develop
your pelvic muscles.

493
00:44:47,895 --> 00:44:50,864
Cleaning with unbent knees
stimulates the uterus,

494
00:44:50,864 --> 00:44:52,832
and tenderizes your inside.

495
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,604
Mix sulfur, gemmifera roots,
cornus fruit, and cnidium,

496
00:44:56,604 --> 00:44:58,936
grind and sift them,
then insert it.

497
00:44:59,207 --> 00:45:02,768
It'll shrink your vagina
and make it more sensitive.

498
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:07,762
Mix 3 spoons of sulfur in water
and wash your privates.

499
00:45:08,774 --> 00:45:11,510
It'll make it
like a young girl's.

500
00:45:13,682 --> 00:45:15,616
Do not flinch!

501
00:45:15,684 --> 00:45:18,676
Feminine energy stems from
lower abdomen.

502
00:45:22,657 --> 00:45:26,650
After sensual Taoist trainings,

503
00:45:26,728 --> 00:45:29,663
only two remained!

504
00:45:30,132 --> 00:45:33,932
A butcher who hid her true self,

505
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:38,669
and a concubine who was
filled with deep jealousy.

506
00:45:39,741 --> 00:45:45,646
Squeeze out the seeds
and don't spill a single drop.

507
00:45:46,555 --> 00:45:50,548
Testicles are sensitive,
only use tongue to stimulate.

508
00:46:18,246 --> 00:46:22,683
With everyone in one place,

509
00:46:23,384 --> 00:46:25,753
it's like addressing
the entire nation.

510
00:46:25,753 --> 00:46:28,722
We're not worthy,
Your Highness.

511
00:46:29,357 --> 00:46:32,724
Pick a dish
and introduce yourself.

512
00:46:38,733 --> 00:46:42,726
I'm from deep valleys
of Milyang.

513
00:46:42,804 --> 00:46:46,797
Your southern accent will
charm us all!

514
00:46:47,475 --> 00:46:48,772
You're the Cutie.

515
00:46:49,444 --> 00:46:50,775
I am...

516
00:46:52,346 --> 00:46:55,550
Look at her!

517
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,711
I'll call you the Wimp.

518
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:01,716
The Elegant, the Beautiful,
the Skilled...

519
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:04,758
The king inspected
everyone very carefully,

520
00:47:04,826 --> 00:47:07,989
but soon got bored of it,

521
00:47:08,162 --> 00:47:11,757
and didn't even bother anymore.

522
00:47:15,803 --> 00:47:17,737
That's her.

523
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:37,821
They say, a horse's penis
even gave Buddha an erection.

524
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:50,033
I am Seol,
a Kaesong concubine.

525
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:58,031
With one glimpse,
I can tell you are special.

526
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:09,085
You are the Bewitcher.

527
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,358
Best of the bunch!

528
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,295
I'll see you
in the palace soon.

529
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:20,830
Yes, Your Highness.

530
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:26,302
Anyone else?

531
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:38,280
That's inedible!

532
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,414
Stand up.

533
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:52,394
Where was this jewel found?

534
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:56,331
I'm Jung-hwa,
Neungju Lord JO's daughter.

535
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,425
Do you know
what you just ate?

536
00:48:58,736 --> 00:49:03,435
It is heifer's uterus,
preserved with garlic,

537
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,143
a placenta dish.

538
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,512
It's my favorite dish.

539
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:12,349
How did it taste?

540
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,340
It was sorrowful.

541
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,385
Sorrowful?

542
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:23,393
Teardrops on a pillow,
raindrops on a step stone,

543
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:28,559
over the window,
rain falls all night,

544
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:34,371
and a mother's jacket...

545
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,411
turns crimson.

546
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:56,483
A true diamond
in the rough.

547
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,454
You are... the Master.

548
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:05,434
I am honored, Your Highness.

549
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,472
- Minister IM!
- Yes, Your Highness!

550
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:11,108
I want her in the palace
right now!

551
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,510
- But it is not...
- Your Highness.

552
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:16,469
Good things come to
those who wait.

553
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,151
You should observe
until she's ripe.

554
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:21,482
Observe?

555
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,197
If you so insist.

556
00:50:31,993 --> 00:50:36,987
The fact is, I feel so empty
and lonely.

557
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,959
Please rush the training.

558
00:50:43,038 --> 00:50:44,972
Yes, Your Highness!

559
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:48,977
I never anticipated
this contest,

560
00:50:48,977 --> 00:50:51,713
but of all the girls,
why her?

561
00:50:51,713 --> 00:50:54,944
You see,
it's unfolding as I've told you.

562
00:50:55,016 --> 00:50:55,983
Nonsense!

563
00:50:56,985 --> 00:51:01,589
When I think of my life in exile,
while her father...

564
00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:05,992
Do you think I'd hand over
such power to them?

565
00:51:11,466 --> 00:51:15,960
Lord JO's daughter?
What a treacherous pair!

566
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:21,938
How could the lMs support
a daughter of their nemesis?

567
00:51:26,548 --> 00:51:30,951
But I can see why
he would support her.

568
00:51:32,554 --> 00:51:36,923
Yes, there's something
special about her,

569
00:51:36,991 --> 00:51:39,961
even her scent is...

570
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:40,985
Enough!

571
00:51:41,963 --> 00:51:44,932
Minister YU!

572
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,602
Get it together!

573
00:51:47,602 --> 00:51:49,037
My apologies!

574
00:51:49,037 --> 00:51:53,375
From Neungju, right?
Find out more about her.

575
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:55,036
- Certainly.
- Right now!

576
00:51:56,077 --> 00:51:58,978
You better up your game!

577
00:52:05,053 --> 00:52:09,012
Looks like the butchering
gave you the edge.

578
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:12,992
But for an uneducated
peasant,

579
00:52:13,061 --> 00:52:15,797
how did you come up
with such a poem?

580
00:52:15,797 --> 00:52:18,994
Even a lowly girl has
good taste buds,

581
00:52:19,067 --> 00:52:22,969
I just tried to mimic
what I learned.

582
00:52:23,071 --> 00:52:24,436
Begin.

583
00:54:37,388 --> 00:54:39,686
As if in a dream,

584
00:54:39,757 --> 00:54:44,751
a wave of realization
came over him.

585
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:57,929
Her delicate hand gesture
startled his pupils,

586
00:54:58,941 --> 00:55:07,974
and melted
his frozen memories.

587
00:55:40,274 --> 00:55:44,210
Your transfixion left you
ignorant to my presence.

588
00:55:44,278 --> 00:55:46,246
My apologies, Your Highness.

589
00:55:58,292 --> 00:56:00,328
As with last time,

590
00:56:00,328 --> 00:56:04,230
you bring me many delights.

591
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:07,197
I'm not worthy,
Your Highness.

592
00:56:10,338 --> 00:56:15,241
I'll soon open a banquet
to test your training.

593
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:19,245
The winner will not only
become my consort,

594
00:56:19,313 --> 00:56:21,315
she'll receive
a large sum of gold...

595
00:56:21,315 --> 00:56:23,249
When I am in the palace,

596
00:56:23,351 --> 00:56:27,253
even a million gold coins
hold no value.

597
00:56:34,328 --> 00:56:38,230
Then what'd
make you happy?

598
00:56:40,267 --> 00:56:45,227
This sword knows the answer,
but how could you not?

599
00:56:48,275 --> 00:56:49,264
Minister IM!

600
00:56:49,343 --> 00:56:51,345
Soong-jae! Come at once!

601
00:56:51,345 --> 00:56:52,277
Right away!

602
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,215
- Let's play a game!
- Yes, Your Highness.

603
00:56:55,282 --> 00:56:57,250
Come, you adorable things!

604
00:57:01,578 --> 00:57:03,739
ls your daughter still sick?

605
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:06,749
She's... recovering.

606
00:57:06,816 --> 00:57:13,722
But I just don't see her
around anymore.

607
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:24,795
Let's be frank.

608
00:57:27,837 --> 00:57:31,830
You've gone too far
this time.

609
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:33,476
What do you mean?

610
00:57:33,476 --> 00:57:37,344
The king's tastes are
rather unique.

611
00:57:37,647 --> 00:57:44,849
Why is he attracted to
whores or butchers?

612
00:57:45,555 --> 00:57:52,358
Perhaps a tyrant and butcher
are a match made in heaven.

613
00:57:53,997 --> 00:57:55,965
Hurry up and get ready!

614
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,868
Good afternoon, sir.

615
00:58:01,971 --> 00:58:03,939
Looking for this?

616
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:10,947
Why is it so sharp?

617
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:13,939
Just best prepared for
the performance.

618
01:01:07,066 --> 01:01:09,057
That's it...

619
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:11,236
So fair...

620
01:01:57,082 --> 01:01:59,073
Come on.
Come at me!

621
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,202
Protect the king!

622
01:02:16,202 --> 01:02:17,169
Your Highness!

623
01:02:17,236 --> 01:02:19,205
Protect him!

624
01:02:19,205 --> 01:02:21,196
Protect His Highness!

625
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:24,142
Your Highness!

626
01:02:25,211 --> 01:02:28,146
Take him out of here!

627
01:02:29,215 --> 01:02:31,115
Hurry!

628
01:02:43,162 --> 01:02:45,153
It's poison-laced!

629
01:02:45,831 --> 01:02:48,163
A rare poison used
in China.

630
01:02:49,001 --> 01:02:51,170
This is the antidote,
treat him.

631
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:52,194
How did you get this?

632
01:02:52,638 --> 01:02:55,573
We're on the same boat now,
understood?

633
01:03:05,184 --> 01:03:06,919
Was that really necessary?

634
01:03:06,919 --> 01:03:11,253
How can I watch
a butcher bed the king?

635
01:03:11,924 --> 01:03:16,190
Plus, she must have been
scheming.

636
01:03:16,262 --> 01:03:18,230
It had to be done.

637
01:03:20,266 --> 01:03:22,200
Did you...

638
01:03:22,701 --> 01:03:25,226
know who she really was?

639
01:03:25,971 --> 01:03:29,909
You pathetic idiot!
Haven't I warned you?

640
01:03:29,909 --> 01:03:33,546
You can't give everything up
over petty feelings!

641
01:03:33,546 --> 01:03:36,174
Petty feelings?

642
01:03:37,249 --> 01:03:40,218
I am not incompetent
like you.

643
01:03:40,286 --> 01:03:41,253
What?

644
01:03:41,253 --> 01:03:44,924
Obedience and flattery
will not work forever.

645
01:03:44,924 --> 01:03:45,658
Why you!

646
01:03:45,658 --> 01:03:49,219
When mother committed suicide
during exile,

647
01:03:49,295 --> 01:03:51,997
you did nothing but watch.

648
01:03:51,997 --> 01:03:53,666
- Shut your mouth!
- I'm not like you!

649
01:03:53,666 --> 01:03:56,201
I have the power
over the king!

650
01:03:56,201 --> 01:04:00,160
Because I am
king above the king!

651
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:01,206
Shut up!

652
01:04:03,275 --> 01:04:06,645
Keep quiet
and watch how I do it.

653
01:04:06,645 --> 01:04:10,308
What would you
threaten me with?

654
01:04:10,716 --> 01:04:15,354
Forgot what you really gave
the king that night?

655
01:04:15,354 --> 01:04:19,725
Will you betray your father
over a girl?

656
01:04:19,725 --> 01:04:22,216
Like father, like son.

657
01:04:22,294 --> 01:04:26,321
Like a father who gave up
his family for power!

658
01:04:35,307 --> 01:04:39,266
The assassin's already dead,
and no clue whatsoever.

659
01:04:39,345 --> 01:04:42,246
How will you conclude
this matter?

660
01:04:42,314 --> 01:04:46,273
Since you favor Jung-hwa,

661
01:04:46,352 --> 01:04:49,722
other comforters
may have instigated this...

662
01:04:49,722 --> 01:04:51,280
This is treason.

663
01:04:51,357 --> 01:04:53,291
How dare you!

664
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,127
Ln king's presence!

665
01:04:55,127 --> 01:04:56,287
Minister.

666
01:04:57,096 --> 01:04:58,620
Do you really believe that?

667
01:04:58,831 --> 01:05:03,135
Your Highness,
this has to be treason!

668
01:05:03,135 --> 01:05:07,333
What of your reputation
if your life was at risk over

669
01:05:07,973 --> 01:05:10,305
mere comforters' jealousy?

670
01:05:10,909 --> 01:05:15,278
You must wipe out
your enemies with this chance.

671
01:05:16,015 --> 01:05:17,312
Who knows?

672
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:20,011
The real perpetrator
may be among them.

673
01:05:24,323 --> 01:05:26,314
Bring out the daughters
of traitors!

674
01:05:27,326 --> 01:05:30,261
This is unfair.
Please save me.

675
01:05:38,337 --> 01:05:40,703
Rash behavior will be met
with discipline.

676
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:42,967
Get up!

677
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:45,503
Drag her out!

678
01:05:54,444 --> 01:05:57,811
My father obtained
this poison from China.

679
01:05:59,416 --> 01:06:01,782
With enough dosage,

680
01:06:01,851 --> 01:06:04,752
it could lead to death.

681
01:06:04,854 --> 01:06:08,813
During exile, my mother didn't
want to burden my father,

682
01:06:09,392 --> 01:06:11,257
so she drank this.

683
01:06:12,662 --> 01:06:15,859
We obtained power that way,

684
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,835
so we ended up like this.

685
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:25,833
I've told you everything,
now it's your turn.

686
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:28,837
Why did you attempt
to kill the king?

687
01:06:28,912 --> 01:06:32,682
- What do you mean?
- I knew Lord KIM ll-son.

688
01:06:32,682 --> 01:06:35,913
He was a respected official
and an upright man.

689
01:06:36,553 --> 01:06:39,852
He was executed for
criticizing the king.

690
01:06:39,923 --> 01:06:40,890
Please stop.

691
01:06:41,858 --> 01:06:43,927
- His remains must be...
- Stop!

692
01:06:43,927 --> 01:06:46,862
You do not deserve to
utter his name.

693
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:48,898
You must give up
your revenge plot.

694
01:06:49,466 --> 01:06:50,900
It's all pointless.

695
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:55,860
For a power chaser,
it's all pointless to you.

696
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,874
I will stop you.

697
01:06:59,776 --> 01:07:02,836
If you do,
you will lose your life.

698
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:09,942
I will use all my power

699
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:11,688
to get you out.

700
01:07:11,688 --> 01:07:13,883
IM Soong-jae.

701
01:07:14,824 --> 01:07:16,917
ls that power...

702
01:07:17,994 --> 01:07:20,827
really yours?

703
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:36,980
This is unjust!

704
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,914
Minister IM has arrived!

705
01:07:40,517 --> 01:07:42,917
Minister! Minister!

706
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:43,986
Minister!

707
01:07:44,954 --> 01:07:45,978
Please save me!

708
01:07:46,956 --> 01:07:48,924
This is unfair!

709
01:07:48,992 --> 01:07:51,961
Should have been careful,
Minister YU!

710
01:07:52,929 --> 01:07:54,897
Soong-jae...

711
01:07:54,998 --> 01:07:58,900
For Consort JANG's sake,
I'll let you keep your neck,

712
01:07:58,968 --> 01:08:00,959
so sit back and rest.

713
01:08:03,006 --> 01:08:06,908
You are all wives
and daughters

714
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:10,080
of those who plotted my death!

715
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,982
You'll be punished accordingly!

716
01:08:14,084 --> 01:08:15,985
Have mercy, Your Highness!

717
01:08:15,985 --> 01:08:21,791
But you may be pardoned
at today's shooting ceremony.

718
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:28,064
And I will accept you back
as my comforters.

719
01:08:28,064 --> 01:08:30,794
We're eternally grateful!

720
01:08:33,069 --> 01:08:34,331
Prime Minister's daughter!

721
01:08:35,672 --> 01:08:36,661
Come forward!

722
01:08:45,548 --> 01:08:47,015
Come here.

723
01:08:54,057 --> 01:08:58,994
I'll aim, you just let
the arrow loose.

724
01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:01,018
Yes, Your Highness.

725
01:09:12,075 --> 01:09:14,066
Father! Father!

726
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:18,047
Heaven's wrath...

727
01:09:18,681 --> 01:09:20,080
No!

728
01:09:23,887 --> 01:09:25,081
Remove her!
Next!

729
01:09:28,091 --> 01:09:32,050
If you look away,
you'll be flagged!

730
01:09:34,097 --> 01:09:36,031
Let the game begin.

731
01:09:36,099 --> 01:09:37,123
Treason

732
01:09:41,104 --> 01:09:42,705
Left!

733
01:09:42,705 --> 01:09:44,774
Next!

734
01:09:44,774 --> 01:09:48,107
He embraced the comforters
and fired the arrows.

735
01:09:48,711 --> 01:09:53,011
Left! Right!
All direct hits,

736
01:09:53,149 --> 01:09:57,051
the girls shed tears of blood.

737
01:09:57,654 --> 01:10:02,057
A twisted celebration!

738
01:10:02,125 --> 01:10:07,864
He danced
and jumped in joy,

739
01:10:07,864 --> 01:10:13,166
it was a gruesome
sight to behold!

740
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:18,164
He's not it!

741
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:22,145
He's not what?

742
01:10:22,145 --> 01:10:24,180
That man is not
my husband.

743
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:29,117
You were mine all along,
Your Highness.

744
01:10:31,187 --> 01:10:33,155
How will you prove it?

745
01:10:45,168 --> 01:10:47,159
No!

746
01:10:48,137 --> 01:10:50,162
Stop!

747
01:11:15,298 --> 01:11:18,563
If he's not your husband,
then he should die.

748
01:11:21,271 --> 01:11:22,238
Don't move!

749
01:11:22,872 --> 01:11:23,600
Your Highness!

750
01:11:29,245 --> 01:11:30,234
Come on!

751
01:11:30,747 --> 01:11:31,771
Do it!

752
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:49,227
Tear her into pieces,
and feed her to the pigs!

753
01:11:50,233 --> 01:11:53,168
Soong-jae,
the mood is ruined.

754
01:11:54,237 --> 01:11:55,226
Your Highness...

755
01:12:16,935 --> 01:12:19,870
So many rejects.

756
01:12:25,944 --> 01:12:29,982
Those who are called
are the contest rejects.

757
01:12:29,982 --> 01:12:33,941
You'll be reassigned
or become slaves!

758
01:12:34,653 --> 01:12:36,883
HAN Ja-soon, HYE Dang-hwa,

759
01:12:36,989 --> 01:12:39,890
HYANG ll-hwa, SO Hyang,

760
01:12:39,992 --> 01:12:42,927
SEOL, and JO Jung-hwa.

761
01:12:54,006 --> 01:12:54,973
What is it?

762
01:12:55,407 --> 01:12:57,976
Suffering such humiliation
over a butcher girl.

763
01:12:57,976 --> 01:12:59,876
What a pity.

764
01:13:00,946 --> 01:13:02,914
Stupid whore.

765
01:13:02,981 --> 01:13:06,974
Please ask Consort JANG
and put me back in.

766
01:13:07,953 --> 01:13:12,185
You want to be back
in the contest?

767
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:16,917
Rumor says, a traitor's daughter
is a comforter.

768
01:13:18,063 --> 01:13:22,432
She was put in that place
by someone high up.

769
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:31,976
Your Highness, may your
loyal subject speak?

770
01:13:32,044 --> 01:13:33,045
Yes, what is it?

771
01:13:33,045 --> 01:13:39,017
The contest may be ruined,
but a winner must be decided.

772
01:13:39,017 --> 01:13:45,946
And she must fulfill her duty.

773
01:13:46,558 --> 01:13:48,958
What should I do?

774
01:13:49,027 --> 01:13:52,963
Result is important,
but so is the process.

775
01:13:53,065 --> 01:13:58,935
I asked the head trainer to
recommend the best one.

776
01:13:59,037 --> 01:14:05,033
But, she came up with
two names instead.

777
01:14:07,045 --> 01:14:09,013
Two names?

778
01:14:09,781 --> 01:14:13,018
Then pit them
against each other.

779
01:14:13,018 --> 01:14:17,055
Ergo, I had them brought here.

780
01:14:17,055 --> 01:14:19,046
Bring them in!

781
01:14:25,097 --> 01:14:28,066
All right,
show your faces.

782
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:35,707
Your Highness!

783
01:14:35,707 --> 01:14:39,745
They no longer have
any right to compete.

784
01:14:39,745 --> 01:14:43,078
They've poured their souls
into the contest,

785
01:14:43,148 --> 01:14:46,083
and had been
outstanding candidates,

786
01:14:46,151 --> 01:14:50,088
so if they're deprived
of their chance,

787
01:14:50,088 --> 01:14:54,092
how can we say that
we're selecting the best?

788
01:14:54,092 --> 01:14:56,060
- Your Highness!
- Enough!

789
01:14:56,128 --> 01:14:59,029
I was sorry to let them go.

790
01:14:59,097 --> 01:15:02,000
Let's have a final match!

791
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,992
Yes, Your Highness.

792
01:15:07,139 --> 01:15:10,074
- You're a schemer!
- Why're you so enraged?

793
01:15:10,976 --> 01:15:15,080
It's not like she'll die
in his bed.

794
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:21,041
Or can you not love someone
tainted by the king?

795
01:15:24,089 --> 01:15:26,091
Must you be so cruel?

796
01:15:26,091 --> 01:15:29,060
No matter what,
you can't have her.

797
01:15:30,095 --> 01:15:32,898
She has no feelings for you.

798
01:15:32,898 --> 01:15:36,061
Why not just take her?
That's more like you.

799
01:15:36,768 --> 01:15:39,032
Love isn't your style.

800
01:15:41,139 --> 01:15:46,076
I will set you straight,
even if I have to kill you!

801
01:15:48,113 --> 01:15:51,014
I'll look forward to it,
my Lord.

802
01:16:08,099 --> 01:16:11,068
Use the hidden silver knife,
no mistake.

803
01:16:11,136 --> 01:16:13,104
Minister, you can't come in!

804
01:16:22,781 --> 01:16:25,183
I heard the rules,
so don't worry...

805
01:16:25,183 --> 01:16:27,583
So you'll do it
at all cost?

806
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:31,147
Life itself is prison
for me.

807
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:33,692
I'll take whatever punishment.

808
01:16:33,692 --> 01:16:36,092
Fine, if that's your wish.

809
01:16:36,161 --> 01:16:38,163
This is the final lesson.
Strip.

810
01:16:38,163 --> 01:16:40,154
- Lord!
- It's an order!

811
01:16:47,172 --> 01:16:51,108
Lose, you'll die,
win, you won't survive.

812
01:16:51,176 --> 01:16:54,145
If you so desire to die,
listen carefully.

813
01:16:54,212 --> 01:16:58,148
Remember this sensation
with your body.

814
01:17:02,921 --> 01:17:04,656
Be aroused first,
and you lose.

815
01:17:04,656 --> 01:17:07,318
Not aroused, you lose.

816
01:17:07,726 --> 01:17:10,126
Control your own senses,

817
01:17:10,529 --> 01:17:13,089
and you become the best.

818
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:37,026
Most desirable woman would
seduce with her scent...

819
01:17:37,094 --> 01:17:38,994
I'm bored.

820
01:17:40,731 --> 01:17:44,963
One cannot claim to be the best
by killing a few soldiers.

821
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:50,098
One must defeat
the enemy general.

822
01:17:53,144 --> 01:17:56,113
A tiger and a phoenix.

823
01:17:57,114 --> 01:18:00,106
Seduce each other
before me.

824
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:10,026
I will award the winner
with the loser's pretty head.

825
01:18:14,131 --> 01:18:19,103
Your Highness,
this is against nature.

826
01:18:19,103 --> 01:18:22,095
Look at their eyes
and say that.

827
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:29,111
We've forbid any contact
between comforters...

828
01:18:30,147 --> 01:18:34,083
Must I cut off your tongue?

829
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:48,063
Begin.

830
01:18:58,209 --> 01:19:00,177
Good, very good.

831
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,095
Good...

832
01:19:25,202 --> 01:19:27,137
That's it!

833
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:29,206
So Soong-jae trained
Jung-hwa?

834
01:19:29,206 --> 01:19:33,108
I did everything possible
for your pleasure.

835
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:45,121
So, is it SEOL?

836
01:19:48,225 --> 01:19:50,216
Get into it!

837
01:19:57,234 --> 01:19:59,168
That's right.

838
01:20:03,974 --> 01:20:05,202
Yes.

839
01:20:05,976 --> 01:20:07,204
Bit more.

840
01:20:08,913 --> 01:20:11,143
Don't stay still.

841
01:20:12,283 --> 01:20:14,251
That's right!

842
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:27,728
Jung-hwa this time?

843
01:20:32,236 --> 01:20:34,227
Jung-hwa, concentrate!

844
01:20:39,276 --> 01:20:41,210
Good!

845
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:46,204
Very good!

846
01:20:47,284 --> 01:20:49,275
Oh come on.

847
01:20:50,921 --> 01:20:54,254
Flip over, flip!

848
01:20:55,326 --> 01:20:57,294
Don't lose, keep going!

849
01:20:57,795 --> 01:20:59,285
Seek your chance!

850
01:21:00,331 --> 01:21:02,322
Keep going, harder!

851
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,408
Keep moving, go on!

852
01:21:18,015 --> 01:21:20,245
It's not over! Go on!

853
01:21:20,317 --> 01:21:24,253
Concentrate! Keep going!

854
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:28,247
We're almost there!

855
01:21:31,362 --> 01:21:35,298
Try harder.
Harder.

856
01:21:37,334 --> 01:21:39,302
Tired already?

857
01:21:47,311 --> 01:21:51,338
Unable to finish
without an instrument?

858
01:21:55,386 --> 01:22:00,323
It is pitiful and desperate.

859
01:22:01,392 --> 01:22:07,331
A struggle towards the sun.

860
01:22:07,398 --> 01:22:13,303
Venting with a dagger in hand.

861
01:22:13,404 --> 01:22:20,333
The dragon's hand
swings ferociously,

862
01:22:20,411 --> 01:22:25,382
and the snake's tongue
remains silent.

863
01:22:25,382 --> 01:22:26,371
Soong-jae!

864
01:22:27,384 --> 01:22:31,343
This is what I've been
waiting for!

865
01:22:32,389 --> 01:22:36,519
Be aroused first, you lose,
not aroused, you still lose.

866
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:40,998
Control your own senses,

867
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:43,330
and you become the best.

868
01:23:09,426 --> 01:23:10,415
That's it!

869
01:23:19,436 --> 01:23:23,429
I'm dead,
I'll lose my head!

870
01:23:24,441 --> 01:23:25,430
Move aside.

871
01:23:25,943 --> 01:23:29,480
Didn't you promise me
a pretty head?

872
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:32,449
And I'm fulfilling that now.

873
01:23:32,449 --> 01:23:33,183
Let the girl go.

874
01:23:33,183 --> 01:23:37,381
But she won't be pretty
if dead.

875
01:23:37,454 --> 01:23:38,443
What?

876
01:23:48,432 --> 01:23:52,425
A true Makhana lotus!

877
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:55,105
Your Highness...

878
01:23:55,105 --> 01:24:00,441
Make SEOL her slave and
I'll bed the winner tomorrow.

879
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:08,384
Let's go another round.

880
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:19,418
Delicate flower,
with its crimson radiance,

881
01:24:21,498 --> 01:24:25,434
greets the young east
forgetting to bloom.

882
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:31,396
ls the sky dark
blinded by madness?

883
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:36,970
Or is the sky turned dark
by a bleak mind?

884
01:24:48,992 --> 01:24:51,119
My old friend.

885
01:24:51,595 --> 01:24:53,497
You still got it.

886
01:24:53,497 --> 01:24:54,464
You're too generous.

887
01:24:54,531 --> 01:24:58,490
Now, as promised,
let's hear your request.

888
01:25:01,238 --> 01:25:05,436
Please select another girl
as your new consort.

889
01:25:09,046 --> 01:25:11,446
Are you in love with her?

890
01:25:11,515 --> 01:25:14,450
Do you remember when
we were young?

891
01:25:14,518 --> 01:25:16,486
I did everything
you told me to do.

892
01:25:16,553 --> 01:25:18,522
Even if it wasn't fit
for a boy.

893
01:25:18,522 --> 01:25:21,491
Yes, we were close
as these balls.

894
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:26,485
So I beg of you,
give her to me!

895
01:25:26,563 --> 01:25:28,497
How dare you!

896
01:25:28,565 --> 01:25:34,526
Coveting a king's property
is punishable by death!

897
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:38,440
Answer me this.

898
01:25:39,543 --> 01:25:44,480
Do you desire her
at the risk of your life?

899
01:25:54,558 --> 01:25:55,582
Soong-jae...

900
01:25:56,593 --> 01:25:59,562
Do you also believe
I'm mad?

901
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:06,502
No sane man can live through
this turbulent age.

902
01:26:07,638 --> 01:26:09,572
Turbulent age?

903
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:14,543
My madness has turned
the sky black!

904
01:26:16,146 --> 01:26:18,546
Will you stop me?

905
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:22,552
Even after
deflowering thousands,

906
01:26:24,087 --> 01:26:27,545
the ghosts of the dead
won't leave me!

907
01:26:27,624 --> 01:26:32,561
I've gone utterly insane!

908
01:26:42,606 --> 01:26:47,543
Life is like
dew on grass leaves...

909
01:26:50,681 --> 01:26:52,581
Go on.

910
01:26:52,683 --> 01:26:54,651
Please stop me.

911
01:26:56,653 --> 01:27:01,358
Your Majesty,
kill me instead!

912
01:27:01,358 --> 01:27:03,588
No, no!

913
01:27:05,062 --> 01:27:08,432
How can I kill
a loyal subject?

914
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:14,564
You couldn't fulfill your duty
due to my lack of virtue!

915
01:27:14,671 --> 01:27:16,571
Stop me...

916
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,575
Please! Please!

917
01:27:19,676 --> 01:27:22,577
Your Highness!

918
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:27,606
Let go!

919
01:27:30,654 --> 01:27:31,621
Your Majesty!

920
01:27:31,688 --> 01:27:33,588
Baby!

921
01:27:38,428 --> 01:27:41,591
Who dared to bother
my little baby.

922
01:27:41,665 --> 01:27:42,632
My baby.

923
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:46,625
Rest easy in
mommy's bosom.

924
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:51,698
That's it,
everything's all right.

925
01:27:55,412 --> 01:27:58,711
I'll take care of him,
leave us now.

926
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,297
It is time, my lady.

927
01:28:25,078 --> 01:28:26,875
I'm here for
the new consort.

928
01:28:52,105 --> 01:28:55,108
This was the only way
to save you.

929
01:28:55,108 --> 01:28:58,134
The boat will depart soon,
don't ever come back.

930
01:29:04,884 --> 01:29:06,112
But how...

931
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:10,055
It was her request.

932
01:29:41,254 --> 01:29:43,188
Are you ready?

933
01:29:47,861 --> 01:29:50,159
Make no mistake.

934
01:30:07,213 --> 01:30:10,205
We cannot
miss this chance.

935
01:30:18,191 --> 01:30:21,558
If you hear the signal,
kill everyone.

936
01:30:22,629 --> 01:30:26,156
Even the new consort.

937
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:42,544
I've waited long for
this moment.

938
01:30:43,983 --> 01:30:48,249
I too felt the same.

939
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:15,179
Your Highness!

940
01:31:15,281 --> 01:31:19,240
Before you can have me,
you must solve a riddle.

941
01:31:21,254 --> 01:31:22,278
A riddle?

942
01:31:23,656 --> 01:31:24,958
Go on then.

943
01:31:24,958 --> 01:31:29,258
It normally floats, but sinks
at times.

944
01:31:29,796 --> 01:31:33,061
You have 3 chances
to solve it.

945
01:31:43,343 --> 01:31:45,277
Stop right there!

946
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:26,352
Floats but sinks?

947
01:32:26,352 --> 01:32:28,021
Can a man ride it?

948
01:32:28,021 --> 01:32:29,318
You're close.

949
01:32:29,489 --> 01:32:31,320
A horse?

950
01:32:31,391 --> 01:32:36,328
Your Highness!
You really don't know?

951
01:32:41,401 --> 01:32:43,369
Or a palanquin?

952
01:32:44,437 --> 01:32:48,373
One last chance,
what is your answer?

953
01:33:17,103 --> 01:33:18,137
It's a boat!

954
01:33:18,137 --> 01:33:21,368
It normally floats,
but sinks in harsh waters.

955
01:33:21,941 --> 01:33:26,378
I shall ride you,
you're my boat today!

956
01:33:30,383 --> 01:33:33,318
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

957
01:33:35,154 --> 01:33:39,318
It keeps a boat afloat
or sinks it.

958
01:33:40,093 --> 01:33:41,390
It is water.

959
01:33:41,994 --> 01:33:45,364
It is said, the people is water,
the king is the boat.

960
01:33:45,364 --> 01:33:48,390
You're the boat that
the water will sink today!

961
01:34:08,054 --> 01:34:09,385
Sly bitch...

962
01:34:12,425 --> 01:34:15,360
Your Highness!
Are you all right?

963
01:34:24,003 --> 01:34:25,368
Who hired you?

964
01:34:26,038 --> 01:34:30,441
The king is not fit to rule,
so I did what anyone'd do.

965
01:34:32,478 --> 01:34:33,706
Bring him in.

966
01:34:39,485 --> 01:34:42,420
Lord JO,
is this your daughter?

967
01:34:46,459 --> 01:34:49,394
Spare me,
Your Highness.

968
01:34:49,462 --> 01:34:51,396
Please...

969
01:34:52,131 --> 01:34:53,428
Minister IM...

970
01:34:53,499 --> 01:34:56,202
Please speak on my behalf!

971
01:34:56,202 --> 01:34:57,999
How could we...

972
01:35:00,572 --> 01:35:01,903
Next.

973
01:35:06,578 --> 01:35:11,481
My lady,
glad to see you alive.

974
01:35:13,184 --> 01:35:19,487
You there,
is this your daughter?

975
01:35:21,593 --> 01:35:25,495
No better than
a mad butcher!

976
01:35:25,563 --> 01:35:26,530
Get a grip!

977
01:35:26,598 --> 01:35:28,498
Please!

978
01:35:31,169 --> 01:35:32,568
Next.

979
01:35:41,646 --> 01:35:43,614
Here it is,
Your Highness.

980
01:35:44,649 --> 01:35:47,584
This was hard to find.

981
01:35:47,652 --> 01:35:51,611
I'll ask for the last time.

982
01:35:52,624 --> 01:35:55,593
ls she your daughter?

983
01:35:56,594 --> 01:35:58,562
Lord KIM ll-son!

984
01:35:58,630 --> 01:35:59,597
Father...

985
01:35:59,664 --> 01:36:01,632
Why are you silent?

986
01:36:06,638 --> 01:36:09,163
So disloyal!

987
01:36:09,574 --> 01:36:13,378
Why isn't anyone
answering me!

988
01:36:13,378 --> 01:36:16,609
Why! Why?

989
01:36:23,254 --> 01:36:25,357
You are pathetic.

990
01:36:25,357 --> 01:36:26,624
What?

991
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:30,617
Surrounded by pigs
busy stuffing themselves,

992
01:36:31,663 --> 01:36:33,688
with your eyes and
ears shut,

993
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:36,663
who'll tell you the truth?

994
01:36:37,435 --> 01:36:42,474
What is the truth you're
so desperate to tell?

995
01:36:42,474 --> 01:36:44,676
Go on, tell me.

996
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:53,139
Become a human,
if not a king.

997
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,567
Soong-jae.

998
01:37:05,235 --> 01:37:10,607
ls this a masterpiece or
should I put your name on it?

999
01:37:10,607 --> 01:37:15,943
I am solely to be blamed
for my son's faults.

1000
01:37:16,146 --> 01:37:20,913
Please take my life
and forgive him!

1001
01:37:21,251 --> 01:37:22,513
Forgive?

1002
01:37:23,553 --> 01:37:26,523
How can I forgive anyone,
when I can't even

1003
01:37:26,523 --> 01:37:28,548
recognize my mother's
belongings?

1004
01:37:29,593 --> 01:37:34,587
Remember this?
A symbol of our relationship.

1005
01:37:34,665 --> 01:37:40,865
Without this, I'd still be
a plaything for her enemies.

1006
01:37:41,204 --> 01:37:45,573
So let me ask,
why'd you bring me this?

1007
01:37:45,642 --> 01:37:49,980
I was sincerely looking after
your well-being...

1008
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:51,607
My well-being?

1009
01:37:53,317 --> 01:37:58,619
I used it to solidify my throne,
and you regained power.

1010
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:02,558
Your sincerity is noted.

1011
01:38:03,226 --> 01:38:05,160
So can I throw it away now?

1012
01:38:09,633 --> 01:38:10,667
Your Highness!

1013
01:38:10,667 --> 01:38:12,302
But it's your mother's article!

1014
01:38:12,302 --> 01:38:17,638
It's my mother's,
so why do you care?

1015
01:38:19,643 --> 01:38:24,580
The late king worried about
seeds of trouble,

1016
01:38:25,649 --> 01:38:30,586
so any articles that
belonged to the queen

1017
01:38:30,654 --> 01:38:33,589
were all destroyed.

1018
01:38:37,494 --> 01:38:38,654
Father...

1019
01:38:45,402 --> 01:38:48,672
Did you really took me
for a fool?

1020
01:38:48,672 --> 01:38:53,710
The late queen was indeed
killed by conspiracy...

1021
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:55,371
I'll ask again!

1022
01:38:56,380 --> 01:39:02,319
When a king makes an error,
should his subjects object,

1023
01:39:02,319 --> 01:39:06,619
or should they comply
for the fear of their lives?

1024
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:08,725
A loyal subject should...

1025
01:39:08,725 --> 01:39:13,730
Pandering to my needs,
regardless of its consequences,

1026
01:39:13,730 --> 01:39:15,664
you're a treacherous subject!

1027
01:39:15,732 --> 01:39:18,735
You blinded me with flattery,

1028
01:39:18,735 --> 01:39:23,695
you're a traitor
who ruined this nation!

1029
01:39:25,742 --> 01:39:29,678
Your Highness!
Please take my life!

1030
01:39:29,746 --> 01:39:33,648
No loyal servants exist
in my court,

1031
01:39:34,751 --> 01:39:36,719
only faithful dogs.

1032
01:39:36,787 --> 01:39:43,693
But a dog should not be
put down over one bite.

1033
01:39:57,774 --> 01:40:00,709
What an interesting family.

1034
01:40:00,777 --> 01:40:04,713
A father, who offered
his own wife's keepsake,

1035
01:40:04,781 --> 01:40:08,717
and his son,
who offered his lover.

1036
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:17,726
What will you do
for me now?

1037
01:40:21,498 --> 01:40:24,262
Can you bring me
paint for the drawing?

1038
01:40:38,315 --> 01:40:39,782
Get out.

1039
01:40:48,825 --> 01:40:49,814
Do it.

1040
01:40:50,861 --> 01:40:54,797
I've no reason to live...

1041
01:41:20,857 --> 01:41:22,848
Yes, this is it.

1042
01:41:26,863 --> 01:41:31,766
This is my reward to you,
so retain your loyalty.

1043
01:41:31,835 --> 01:41:34,360
I'm eternally grateful.

1044
01:41:35,539 --> 01:41:38,838
And recruit for the next
group of comforters.

1045
01:41:38,942 --> 01:41:40,842
No mistakes this time.

1046
01:41:40,911 --> 01:41:42,879
Yes, Your Majesty.

1047
01:41:52,923 --> 01:41:56,859
Dying in your hand
will be an honor.

1048
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:16,379
She'll be taken
out of the palace.

1049
01:42:16,379 --> 01:42:18,609
Treat her well.

1050
01:42:19,916 --> 01:42:23,852
That is the reason
why I kept you alive.

1051
01:42:31,628 --> 01:42:32,925
This was your sister's,

1052
01:42:33,396 --> 01:42:35,956
and the only detachable one
from the screen.

1053
01:42:36,566 --> 01:42:38,932
I'd have used it too,

1054
01:42:39,002 --> 01:42:42,938
to avenge a sister
who met a shameful death.

1055
01:42:44,708 --> 01:42:47,939
Shouldn't have trusted
a whore.

1056
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:52,881
Care for an amusement?

1057
01:42:53,984 --> 01:42:57,187
When blood river soaks
the dry land,

1058
01:42:57,187 --> 01:42:59,956
old boat's clamors
shake the world!

1059
01:42:59,956 --> 01:43:01,890
Cowardly boatman!

1060
01:43:01,958 --> 01:43:04,950
Seize the moment to build
a new boat!

1061
01:43:07,964 --> 01:43:11,923
Treacherous words from
a treacherous subject.

1062
01:43:14,971 --> 01:43:16,962
Round everyone up!

1063
01:43:17,757 --> 01:43:19,826
Close the door,
another purge is coming!

1064
01:43:19,826 --> 01:43:25,765
Hide yourself,
they'll take you away!

1065
01:43:27,567 --> 01:43:28,761
You are all pigs!

1066
01:43:28,835 --> 01:43:31,838
Fattened up
on the king's lands,

1067
01:43:31,838 --> 01:43:34,474
and offered
back to the king!

1068
01:43:34,474 --> 01:43:38,774
That is the very reason
of your life!

1069
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,993
Peasant blood and sweat
fueled the king's madness,

1070
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:54,108
it knew no boundary.

1071
01:43:54,370 --> 01:43:59,042
If the screams of his populace
don't stop his dance,

1072
01:43:59,042 --> 01:44:03,240
he must be stopped
at any cost.

1073
01:44:03,912 --> 01:44:06,904
When IM returns with
new comforters,

1074
01:44:07,182 --> 01:44:12,120
public's rage will be at its limit,
we'll start the rebellion.

1075
01:44:13,350 --> 01:44:17,309
You bastards!
Heaven will judge you.

1076
01:44:17,421 --> 01:44:20,390
Go to hell, you bastards!

1077
01:44:21,325 --> 01:44:23,350
Don't you have family?

1078
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:31,133
How is she?

1079
01:44:31,202 --> 01:44:33,102
She's a stubborn one.

1080
01:44:39,644 --> 01:44:42,374
Why is everyone
so desperate to die?

1081
01:44:57,228 --> 01:45:00,220
I've returned from duty,
Your Highness.

1082
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:07,028
Where is everyone?

1083
01:45:07,101 --> 01:45:11,506
Due to long travel,
I've allowed them to rest.

1084
01:45:11,506 --> 01:45:13,274
But I should at least
greet them!

1085
01:45:13,274 --> 01:45:18,007
They will look better
when they are rested.

1086
01:45:20,081 --> 01:45:24,085
All right,
I can wait a night.

1087
01:45:24,085 --> 01:45:29,990
You must also be tired,
so rest up.

1088
01:45:32,026 --> 01:45:35,018
Go now.
Take a rest.

1089
01:45:36,030 --> 01:45:37,964
Thank you, Your Highness.

1090
01:45:45,106 --> 01:45:46,073
Anyone there?

1091
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:49,075
Yes, Your Highness,
are you all right?

1092
01:45:49,143 --> 01:45:51,111
They should all be
rested, right?

1093
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:52,146
Pardon me?

1094
01:45:52,146 --> 01:45:54,137
I wish to see
the comforters now.

1095
01:45:54,649 --> 01:45:57,752
But I must alert
the security guards...

1096
01:45:57,752 --> 01:46:00,084
You can be
my security detail!

1097
01:46:00,721 --> 01:46:02,086
Get ready at once!

1098
01:46:02,156 --> 01:46:06,115
Your Highness,
Minister IM is here.

1099
01:46:09,163 --> 01:46:11,097
Soong-jae!

1100
01:46:12,099 --> 01:46:13,868
If you had everything ready,

1101
01:46:13,868 --> 01:46:17,099
you should've told me before
I got drunk.

1102
01:46:18,105 --> 01:46:19,072
Forgive me.

1103
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:21,108
I was too conscious
of others.

1104
01:46:21,108 --> 01:46:23,076
It's okay, very good.

1105
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:30,117
Everyone's so afraid of me,
always, 'Your Highness!'

1106
01:46:30,117 --> 01:46:32,108
Shut the hell up!

1107
01:46:33,087 --> 01:46:34,121
Damn it!

1108
01:46:34,121 --> 01:46:36,112
- Soong-jae!
- Yes, bud!

1109
01:46:36,557 --> 01:46:43,121
Let's have some real fun,
like we did as kids!

1110
01:46:53,207 --> 01:46:55,107
Girls!

1111
01:46:57,211 --> 01:47:00,146
Soong-jae,
where is everyone?

1112
01:47:01,782 --> 01:47:05,953
What's going on?
Don't joke around!

1113
01:47:05,953 --> 01:47:07,147
Do you remember?

1114
01:47:07,221 --> 01:47:10,156
The girl role play,
that you liked?

1115
01:47:10,224 --> 01:47:11,521
What?

1116
01:47:12,193 --> 01:47:17,153
Now, you take the role
that I always had to play.

1117
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:20,925
You must be mad!

1118
01:47:22,803 --> 01:47:26,102
If you want it intact,
hide it.

1119
01:47:34,215 --> 01:47:36,217
What's going on?

1120
01:47:36,217 --> 01:47:39,243
- My Lord!
- What happened?

1121
01:47:41,289 --> 01:47:45,293
Don't be upset
over the past.

1122
01:47:45,293 --> 01:47:49,195
I understand,
I'll forget about this.

1123
01:47:49,297 --> 01:47:51,162
So sheath your sword.

1124
01:47:54,302 --> 01:47:56,600
Sheath your sword!

1125
01:47:58,272 --> 01:48:02,208
The world will be better off
without it.

1126
01:48:04,245 --> 01:48:05,279
Fine, fine.

1127
01:48:05,279 --> 01:48:07,281
You think I won't do it?

1128
01:48:07,281 --> 01:48:08,248
I will...

1129
01:48:18,292 --> 01:48:20,226
Your Majesty!

1130
01:48:28,269 --> 01:48:29,258
Yes, Lord!

1131
01:48:43,317 --> 01:48:44,306
Enough!

1132
01:48:45,319 --> 01:48:48,288
How dare you
look at me that way!

1133
01:48:48,756 --> 01:48:52,326
Contempt for the king
won't go unpunished!

1134
01:48:52,326 --> 01:48:58,265
I only see a murderer,
so where is the king?

1135
01:49:10,845 --> 01:49:14,315
Do you still feel inferior
for your mother's passing?

1136
01:49:14,315 --> 01:49:17,307
Since you love blood so much,
how fitting!

1137
01:49:18,052 --> 01:49:20,121
Why are you doing this?

1138
01:49:20,121 --> 01:49:24,325
Evil wins power,
so all desire to be more evil.

1139
01:49:24,325 --> 01:49:28,095
It's the source of our tragedy,
and what tortures your soul!

1140
01:49:28,095 --> 01:49:30,256
I shall uproot it.

1141
01:49:30,331 --> 01:49:33,100
Even if I die,
you can't take my place!

1142
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:38,299
Friend! Evil is replaced by
a greater evil.

1143
01:49:41,142 --> 01:49:43,372
You underestimate me!

1144
01:49:49,116 --> 01:49:50,344
Your Highness.

1145
01:49:50,418 --> 01:49:55,321
I'll bring out the comforters,
and leave you be.

1146
01:49:55,389 --> 01:50:00,349
Pale skin, full buttocks,
sharp nose tip.

1147
01:50:01,028 --> 01:50:03,326
They fit your taste,

1148
01:50:03,397 --> 01:50:07,034
so please fulfill your duty
as a king.

1149
01:50:07,034 --> 01:50:08,331
You bastard!

1150
01:50:09,370 --> 01:50:12,339
Stop right there!

1151
01:50:43,504 --> 01:50:46,439
ls anyone outside?

1152
01:50:50,478 --> 01:50:52,378
Let's go!

1153
01:50:55,483 --> 01:50:57,451
Do not back down!

1154
01:50:58,486 --> 01:51:02,422
We must take the palace!

1155
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:05,415
Captain!

1156
01:51:08,095 --> 01:51:09,463
Minister YU,
you brought reinforcement.

1157
01:51:09,463 --> 01:51:12,364
We can't last very long
this way.

1158
01:51:12,433 --> 01:51:13,422
Still no orders from the king?

1159
01:51:13,501 --> 01:51:16,368
He's nowhere to be found.

1160
01:51:20,107 --> 01:51:22,405
The palace gate is open!

1161
01:51:22,476 --> 01:51:24,444
Advance!

1162
01:51:26,447 --> 01:51:27,436
Minister!

1163
01:51:31,185 --> 01:51:33,087
What took you so long?

1164
01:51:33,087 --> 01:51:37,421
I want nothing more than
to save this country!

1165
01:51:38,125 --> 01:51:40,525
I heard that fox Soong-jae
visited you.

1166
01:51:41,262 --> 01:51:45,494
How can you lead the uprising
with his help?

1167
01:51:51,539 --> 01:51:55,509
And, I know I'm late
to the party,

1168
01:51:55,509 --> 01:51:59,445
but reserve me a spot
in the court.

1169
01:51:59,547 --> 01:52:01,447
Advance!

1170
01:52:06,554 --> 01:52:11,491
IM Soong-jae!

1171
01:52:28,247 --> 01:52:31,951
Do it! I can't endure
more shame!

1172
01:52:31,951 --> 01:52:34,181
You've done so much harm,

1173
01:52:35,187 --> 01:52:36,889
you call this shame?

1174
01:52:36,889 --> 01:52:41,189
It wouldn't be enough to
rip you to shreds!

1175
01:52:47,166 --> 01:52:50,192
What are you waiting for?
Kill me!

1176
01:52:59,879 --> 01:53:03,371
Did you think you could
redeem yourself this way?

1177
01:53:04,183 --> 01:53:07,118
I too have blood
on my hands,

1178
01:53:07,186 --> 01:53:10,178
how am I any different
from the mad king?

1179
01:53:12,191 --> 01:53:16,195
If you could at least
laugh at me...

1180
01:53:16,195 --> 01:53:18,163
Stay alive.

1181
01:53:19,198 --> 01:53:22,133
Your sins will not
wash away so easily.

1182
01:53:22,201 --> 01:53:26,160
Survive and live to undo
all your wrongs.

1183
01:53:27,172 --> 01:53:29,163
Undo everything.

1184
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:35,353
Majesty, I'll take care of her,
please stay back!

1185
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:39,289
Your Highness!

1186
01:53:42,337 --> 01:53:46,341
Why're you wearing
the king's robe?

1187
01:53:46,341 --> 01:53:49,344
I am playing my part as
the treacherous subject.

1188
01:53:49,344 --> 01:53:52,114
What have you done
to deserve it?

1189
01:53:52,114 --> 01:53:55,311
A hero is a nobody
during peace,

1190
01:53:55,384 --> 01:53:59,354
and a moral man is useless
on the battlefield.

1191
01:53:59,354 --> 01:54:01,322
What's the difference?

1192
01:54:01,390 --> 01:54:03,255
Father!

1193
01:54:03,325 --> 01:54:04,314
No, my son.

1194
01:54:05,027 --> 01:54:06,328
It's not too late.

1195
01:54:06,328 --> 01:54:07,396
Where did you hide
the king?

1196
01:54:07,396 --> 01:54:09,431
We should kill him first!

1197
01:54:09,431 --> 01:54:11,365
Power cannot be contained.

1198
01:54:11,433 --> 01:54:12,400
Nonsense!

1199
01:54:12,468 --> 01:54:15,404
Like you said, we can build
a higher levee!

1200
01:54:15,404 --> 01:54:16,438
Have you gone blind?

1201
01:54:16,438 --> 01:54:18,407
You're the blind one!

1202
01:54:18,407 --> 01:54:22,111
I know you started everything
for that bitch!

1203
01:54:22,111 --> 01:54:26,377
Move aside, I'll kill her
and bring you back!

1204
01:54:26,448 --> 01:54:29,417
Enough!

1205
01:54:30,419 --> 01:54:35,322
This is the only way for me
as your son.

1206
01:54:41,363 --> 01:54:43,398
No, no, please!

1207
01:54:43,398 --> 01:54:44,422
Please no! Please!

1208
01:54:45,367 --> 01:54:46,435
You can't! Please!

1209
01:54:46,435 --> 01:54:48,369
No! No!

1210
01:54:50,405 --> 01:54:53,442
Soong-jae, my son!

1211
01:54:53,442 --> 01:54:58,402
For upholding tyranny,
creating a mad king,

1212
01:54:59,414 --> 01:55:03,185
blinding you with power,
being a terrible son,

1213
01:55:03,185 --> 01:55:05,380
I'll pay for it all.

1214
01:55:07,122 --> 01:55:08,453
Please...

1215
01:55:10,125 --> 01:55:13,929
No, you have to live!

1216
01:55:13,929 --> 01:55:17,387
How can I face your mother
if you die like this?

1217
01:55:17,466 --> 01:55:19,434
- No, please!
- Fools...

1218
01:55:19,501 --> 01:55:22,436
How did you not know?

1219
01:55:28,510 --> 01:55:30,512
You destroyed both of us.

1220
01:55:30,512 --> 01:55:35,449
We could have accomplished
so much together.

1221
01:56:02,477 --> 01:56:07,414
I thought we had the dragon
but it's only 2 vipers.

1222
01:56:08,584 --> 01:56:10,518
Drinking bud,

1223
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:14,512
it will only end by
taking my life, right?

1224
01:56:15,557 --> 01:56:17,491
Do you have a last wish?

1225
01:56:17,593 --> 01:56:22,530
Take that whore,
and send her far away.

1226
01:56:23,565 --> 01:56:25,556
She's rather irritating.

1227
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:40,514
Do you have any regrets?

1228
01:56:41,250 --> 01:56:42,512
Regrets?

1229
01:56:43,552 --> 01:56:49,548
I had the king and the world
at my fingertips.

1230
01:56:51,226 --> 01:56:53,558
I had my share
of the world.

1231
01:56:54,229 --> 01:57:00,498
Your vile reputation will
last a millennium.

1232
01:57:07,175 --> 01:57:09,575
The king is not here,
move out!

1233
01:57:19,653 --> 01:57:25,592
Rest easy now.

1234
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:07,235
Do you also covet
my comforters?

1235
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:12,761
Go on and take them.

1236
01:58:17,807 --> 01:58:22,767
The pigs had the last laugh!

1237
01:58:27,783 --> 01:58:31,087
1506 A.D.
After Joseon's first uprising,

1238
01:58:31,087 --> 01:58:34,750
The Beauty Recruits perished
With King Yeonsan-gun.

1239
01:58:34,824 --> 01:58:40,785
Those who led the reform soon became
the new treacherous subjects.

1240
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:29,569
What makes an ideal woman?

1241
02:02:29,569 --> 02:02:33,873
Large mouth and clean teeth
that can envelop a manhood,

1242
02:02:33,873 --> 02:02:37,866
long black hair like silk
and slender ankles.

1243
02:02:38,511 --> 02:02:42,845
Satin-like skin
and warm body temperature.

1244
02:02:42,949 --> 02:02:47,852
Full buttocks and thin bones!

1245
02:02:49,656 --> 02:02:53,820
And what makes
a desirable vagina?

1246
02:02:54,461 --> 02:02:57,897
First, the opening should be
near the front.

1247
02:02:57,897 --> 02:03:02,891
Second, less pubic hair is best,
and must be thin and fair.

1248
02:03:03,536 --> 02:03:07,939
Third, it must always be
warm and moist.

1249
02:03:09,509 --> 02:03:12,945
When it comes to size,
it should be

1250
02:03:13,613 --> 02:03:19,653
just big enough
to fit the king's manhood.

1251
02:03:19,653 --> 02:03:23,885
Sex positions all have
one principle:

1252
02:03:23,957 --> 02:03:27,893
to achieve pure bliss
through proper contact.

1253
02:03:27,463 --> 02:03:30,900
There are 6 intercourse guidelines.

1254
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:31,889
One.

1255
02:03:32,685 --> 02:03:36,644
Like a wet cloth,
embrace him tightly.

1256
02:03:36,873 --> 02:03:39,842
Two, uterus must be warm.

1257
02:03:40,410 --> 02:03:43,868
Otherwise, there'll be
vaginal discharge.

1258
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:46,771
Three.

1259
02:03:47,317 --> 02:03:53,688
Upon insertion,
tighten your vaginal walls

1260
02:03:54,791 --> 02:03:56,691
Four.

1261
02:03:57,260 --> 02:04:00,752
When on top,
gyrate your hips.

1262
02:04:01,731 --> 02:04:02,789
Five.

1263
02:04:02,866 --> 02:04:06,825
Moan seductively under him.

1264
02:04:07,971 --> 02:04:09,905
Six.

1265
02:04:10,974 --> 02:04:14,933
When you don't reach orgasm,
he may work too hard for it.

1266
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:20,848
If he ejaculates too early,
it could only mean trouble.

1267
02:04:20,849 --> 02:04:22,840
- So you must climax hastily.
- It's all right.

1268
02:04:23,019 --> 02:04:24,420
It's not all right!

1269
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:26,820
Do not forget these guidelines!

1270
02:05:31,916 --> 02:05:34,316
Must Minister YU do this?

1271
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:37,344
Sit down!

1272
02:05:39,323 --> 02:05:44,283
Imagine him as the king,
and entice him with drinks.

1273
02:05:51,969 --> 02:05:53,368
Stop.

1274
02:05:59,077 --> 02:06:00,374
Stop.

1275
02:06:07,418 --> 02:06:08,385
Stop!

1276
02:06:11,422 --> 02:06:12,411
Go on!

1277
02:06:20,098 --> 02:06:21,326
Hear ye!

1278
02:06:21,399 --> 02:06:25,136
Must I be humiliated
by a worthless pussy?

1279
02:06:25,136 --> 02:06:28,039
Maybe you don't look like the king.

1280
02:06:28,039 --> 02:06:29,440
Remove her at once.

1281
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:32,341
SEOL is up next!

1282
02:06:36,414 --> 02:06:38,348
May I

1283
02:06:39,450 --> 02:06:42,419
offer you a precious view?

1284
02:06:46,424 --> 02:06:49,494
Your Highness,
what do you see?

1285
02:06:49,494 --> 02:06:53,430
It is a featherless quail!

1286
02:06:55,066 --> 02:06:56,431
Your Highness!

1287
02:06:57,468 --> 02:06:59,436
Now what do you see?

1288
02:06:59,504 --> 02:07:04,464
It is pink, and wet,
like a ripe persimmon.

1289
02:07:05,543 --> 02:07:08,478
I shall tell you what it is.

1290
02:07:09,213 --> 02:07:14,480
What a strange sight,
what a bold sight!

1291
02:07:14,819 --> 02:07:20,485
Like a mouth of an old monk,
so bald and toothless!

1292
02:07:22,994 --> 02:07:28,432
Like a valley shaped by
centuries of rain.

1293
02:07:28,499 --> 02:07:34,472
Like a groove in the wood,
made by a sharp axe.

1294
02:07:34,472 --> 02:07:39,466
Like an oasis,
it is always wet and flowing.

1295
02:07:41,512 --> 02:07:46,083
Like an abalone
waggling its tongue.

1296
02:07:46,083 --> 02:07:50,555
Like a large seed
inside a dried persimmon.

1297
02:07:50,555 --> 02:07:56,516
Like a proud rooster
with bright comb on its head.

1298
02:07:57,528 --> 02:08:01,566
An abalone, a persimmon,
a rooster and water!

1299
02:08:01,566 --> 02:08:05,502
It's a magnificent feast!

1300
02:08:12,543 --> 02:08:13,544
Enough!

1301
02:08:13,544 --> 02:08:16,180
I told you to treat him
like the king!

1302
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:18,512
I've made a grave mistake.

1303
02:08:20,551 --> 02:08:23,486
JO Jung-hwa is next!

1304
02:08:26,591 --> 02:08:32,461
Minister, we aren't here to
save appearances.

1305
02:08:32,563 --> 02:08:36,465
May I suggest one of
the king's favorite plays?

1306
02:08:36,534 --> 02:08:38,468
Will you accept?

1307
02:08:39,203 --> 02:08:43,503
For every drink I down,
take an article off.

1308
02:08:44,008 --> 02:08:47,645
If I pass out before
you're naked, you win.

1309
02:08:47,645 --> 02:08:51,581
If I still stand,
your body is mine.

1310
02:08:52,617 --> 02:08:55,586
This is not appropriate,
please retract.

1311
02:08:55,586 --> 02:09:00,546
I didn't realize you could be
so easily offended.

1312
02:09:01,959 --> 02:09:04,519
Please continue.

1313
02:09:07,632 --> 02:09:10,601
Have you heard of
a nut-cruncher?

1314
02:09:11,669 --> 02:09:13,569
What is it?

1315
02:09:13,638 --> 02:09:16,539
It is an old method

1316
02:09:17,642 --> 02:09:20,543
to tame bulls and hogs.

1317
02:09:42,633 --> 02:09:46,637
A bull's hormones cause it
to behave aggressively,

1318
02:09:46,637 --> 02:09:50,539
so it is better to castrate it
when the time comes.

1319
02:09:50,608 --> 02:09:54,567
It is just a hunk of meat,
there's no use for the sack.

1320
02:09:54,645 --> 02:09:58,604
It's a repulsive sack of skin,
it's better off gone!

1321
02:09:59,583 --> 02:10:00,651
You bitch!

1322
02:10:00,651 --> 02:10:04,610
Even if you are a king,
you must treat a lady fairly.

1323
02:10:05,089 --> 02:10:07,625
You're no different than
animals with testicles.

1324
02:10:07,625 --> 02:10:08,614
What?

1325
02:10:10,661 --> 02:10:12,561
Please stop.

1326
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:24,802
If you can't even endure this,
how will you bed the king?

1327
02:11:25,471 --> 02:11:27,803
You'd better just quit.

1328
02:11:29,875 --> 02:11:31,809
I'll try again.

1329
02:11:34,847 --> 02:11:38,442
Murderous intent will
blunt your moves.

1330
02:12:00,850 --> 02:12:03,785
Have you fallen for her?

1331
02:12:04,403 --> 02:12:08,806
If you take a king's plaything,
3 generations will perish!

1332
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:13,902
We are grooming
is a beast, not king.

1333
02:12:13,902 --> 02:12:20,205
When we scratch its itch,
we're rewarded handsomely.

1334
02:12:20,942 --> 02:12:25,879
Once that stops,
the beast will swallow us whole!

1335
02:12:27,182 --> 02:12:30,151
Eliminate useless feelings.

1336
02:12:34,289 --> 02:12:36,280
Empty your mind!

1337
02:12:38,127 --> 02:12:40,459
Do you really intend to
have me bed him?

1338
02:12:40,796 --> 02:12:41,558
What?

1339
02:12:41,630 --> 02:12:44,258
Are you training me,

1340
02:12:45,267 --> 02:12:47,336
or showing me
that you're jealous?

1341
02:12:47,336 --> 02:12:48,303
Nonsense!

1342
02:12:48,303 --> 02:12:52,330
You asked me if I consider
myself as medicine.

1343
02:12:52,775 --> 02:12:55,335
And what it treats.

1344
02:12:56,412 --> 02:12:58,710
I'll answer you now.

1345
02:13:04,353 --> 02:13:07,345
I am medicine
prescribed to you.

1346
02:13:08,190 --> 02:13:12,286
But your feelings for me
defies the king.

1347
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,934
Are you not afraid
of the heavens?

1348
02:17:35,002 --> 02:17:36,970
Do you not know who I am?

1349
02:17:36,970 --> 02:17:37,971
Of course we do!

1350
02:17:37,971 --> 02:17:42,142
A former concubine,
who feeds off the populace,

1351
02:17:42,142 --> 02:17:46,909
you're just a temptress
who fueled tyranny!

1352
02:17:46,980 --> 02:17:47,969
Take her out!

1353
02:17:48,382 --> 02:17:50,984
You're just a pathetic pawn!

1354
02:17:50,984 --> 02:17:53,953
I was a loyal subject...

1355
02:17:59,059 --> 02:18:02,961
Die, you bitch!

1356
02:18:49,915 --> 02:18:52,907
Not quite civil officers,

1357
02:18:53,919 --> 02:18:55,887
but more than a concubine.

1358
02:18:55,988 --> 02:18:59,891
Not quite selection process,

1359
02:18:59,891 --> 02:19:02,917
but exercising power
that was given.

1360
02:19:03,962 --> 02:19:06,931
How could I best explain this?

1361
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:10,898
So what happened
to the mad king in the end?

1362
02:19:10,969 --> 02:19:12,904
Haven't you been listening?

1363
02:19:12,904 --> 02:19:16,135
His sexual appetite
got him banished,

1364
02:19:16,475 --> 02:19:20,012
so comforters were what
got him killed!

1365
02:19:20,012 --> 02:19:21,912
Good riddance!

1366
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:26,917
Tell us once more about how
the treacherous lMs were killed!

1367
02:19:26,985 --> 02:19:27,974
Yeah!

1368
02:19:30,022 --> 02:19:33,958
The lMs tried to help
a concubine,

1369
02:19:34,026 --> 02:19:37,928
and the two were found
in ashes.

1370
02:19:39,031 --> 02:19:41,932
Do that to me too!

1371
02:19:42,968 --> 02:19:44,936
Their ashes were spitted on,

1372
02:19:45,003 --> 02:19:49,940
and they deserved
the worst fate in the world.

1373
02:19:51,710 --> 02:19:54,008
If your drinks are empty,
get going!

1374
02:19:54,596 --> 02:19:55,324
Hurry!

1375
02:19:58,967 --> 02:20:00,935
It's here! It's starting!

1376
02:20:11,947 --> 02:20:16,907
It is 3 years into
the era of tyranny,

1377
02:20:17,986 --> 02:20:24,693
the two lMs were
up to no good,

1378
02:20:24,693 --> 02:20:28,993
so desperate to get on
the king's good side,

1379
02:20:30,032 --> 02:20:32,967
can't just let this
cruelty continue!

1380
02:20:33,035 --> 02:20:37,972
The enraged mountain god
sent a tiger!

1381
02:20:40,042 --> 02:20:43,978
I'm gonna hurt my back!

1382
02:20:45,013 --> 02:20:47,948
Empty your pockets!

1383
02:20:52,054 --> 02:20:58,026
It searched the world for
deluded subjects,

1384
02:20:58,026 --> 02:21:03,665
It searched and searched
but could not find them.

1385
02:21:03,665 --> 02:21:07,999
Hidden behind a human mask,
can't tell what's in his heart.

1386
02:21:10,072 --> 02:21:16,204
All right, feed on my body,

1387
02:21:16,545 --> 02:21:20,003
and if you're a good man,
I'll strengthen your body,

1388
02:21:20,082 --> 02:21:26,043
or I'll become poison
and kill you.

1389
02:21:34,062 --> 02:21:36,053
I found you!
