7
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,639
Thankfully, she bounced off something before she hit the ground,

8
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,980
so she is not critically hurt.

9
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,908
She'll wake up soon,

10
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:15,280
but she looks undernourished.

11
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,819
I think she's severely anaemic too.

12
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,150
We should run some tests on her when she regains consciousness.

13
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,790
"Thankfully?" That's so easy for you to say.

14
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,719
She ended up like this, and you're "thankful?"

15
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,530
Don't look at me like that.

16
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,230
Don't worry. I won't hit you.

17
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:38,140
Why would I hurt people who are here to treat her?

18
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:46,780
Cheer up.

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,810
That jerk doesn't even like you. Why are you wasting away...

20
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,039
just to be with him?

21
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,939
You made this choice.

22
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,150
What has it done to you? Take a good look at yourself.

23
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:27,550
Who abandoned this pretty girl?

24
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,519
- I want one too. - I want that pretty one.

25
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,929
- Can I get one too? - Thank you!

26
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,699
- I want one too. - Thank you.

27
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,689
Forget Yoon Gyeo Rye.

28
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,389
You should've been my sister.

32
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:36,090
Hey, it's me.

33
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,060
Thankfully, she bounced off a handcart before hitting the ground,

34
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,259
so she's not critically injured.

35
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,169
No!

36
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,139
- No! - No!

37
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,340
No!

38
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,050
My gosh.

39
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,318
She's still breathing!

40
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,089
- She is breathing. - She's alive.

41
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,549
- Is this 911? - Thank goodness.

42
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,550
Hey! Hurry!

43
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,919
- Please hurry, okay? - Oh, dear.

44
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,629
Are you going to tell Gyeo Rye?

45
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,369
- I'm not sure. - Oh, boy.

46
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,029
She's hurt,

47
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,139
so I feel bad saying this.

48
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,509
But if they stay together, they'll both be miserable.

49
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:35,149
I think Gyeo Rye should just stay at the hospital.

50
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,519
Okay, thanks. I'll call you later. I have to go.

51
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:01,970
I'll head in first. Go say hi to Mr. Kang.

52
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,209
Oh, wait.

53
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,079
Well, about today...

54
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,490
Thank you.

55
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,089
You're the first person who came to my rescue and saved me.

56
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,899
I wish I could've saved your sister too.

57
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,370
Anyway, go say hello to those who have been waiting for you.

58
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,639
I'm working the night shift today. I'm so dead.

59
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:42,810
Oh.

60
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,720
Welcome back home.

61
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,019
Go say hi.

62
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,810
Hey, it's chilly. What's with the motorcycle?

63
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,139
Your body isn't even well.

64
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:14,378
Everything you do gets on my nerves.

65
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:17,249
It's not like you ever approved...

66
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,920
of anything I did.

67
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,889
And as for this motorcycle, I won't ride it again.

68
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,290
So don't worry.

69
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,360
Hey, I never said I was worried about you.

70
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,029
You were worried about me.

71
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,310
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,850
This is embarrassing.

73
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,149
I talked as though I'd never come back,

74
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,819
but here I am.

75
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,259
Have you eaten yet?

76
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,459
No, not yet.

77
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,029
You haven't eaten yet? What were you doing?

78
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,328
You look even skinnier now.

79
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:10,398
He does. He's ruined his handsome face.

80

They had to put a pause on granting the patients' wishes...

81

because of you.

82
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:16,939
I said I was sorry, you brat.

83
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,050
- I'm sorry. - If you're really sorry,

84
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,480
sit down.

85
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,189
- I sat down. - Then...

86
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,199
Here.

87
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,199
Eat with us.

88
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,470
Have some.

89
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,279
Ms. Yeom worked hard to bake them for you.

90
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,750
If curry is your second favourite, how about walnut cookies?

91
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:06,060
Is it your number one favourite food?

92
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,258
You know, when people go on a trip,

93
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:10,490
they always buy these at the rest stops.

94
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,660
That's why.

95
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,529
Let's just think...

96
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,300
that Gyeo Rye was away on a trip.

97
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,170
Anyway, isn't it good?

98
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,649
Well, I would probably rank these number two...

99
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,279
Are you kidding me?

100
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:32,220
No, number one!

101
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,490
By the way, where is Nurse Seo? She should have some cookies too.

102
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,659
Oh, she was supposed to work the morning shift,

103
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,028
but she suddenly had to go to Seoul because of someone,

104
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:43,389
so she has to work late today.

105
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,399
She just started to feel better. My goodness.

106
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,168
Oh, right. She likes walnut cookies too.

107
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:51,639
- Could I take some to her? - Yes.

108
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,379
- Here. - Thank you.

109
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,580
By the way,

110
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:10,320
how about we go on a trip together?

111
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,659
- My gosh. - We've never done it before.

112
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:15,389
- Wow. - My gosh.

113
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,100
Nice. We have enough money, right?

114
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:20,399
Can we go abroad instead of a domestic destination?

115
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:21,970
Are you crazy?

116
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,500
Anyway, when you eat walnut cookies,

117
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:28,409
you must drink the multigrain smoothie.

118
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,979
Good idea!

119
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,279
Come on!

120
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,610
- Let's go make the smoothie. - Okay.

121
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,419
- This is good. - Really? I love you.

Nothing. Just spare me a moment.

Who are you to make me feel like a bad person?

130
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,559
I shouldn't be doing this.

131

Oh, it's a hospice hospital.

132

What are you doing?

134
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,178
I told you Mr. Kang wasn't here.

135
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:49,909
He went somewhere else. How many times must I tell you?

How dare you report me to the police and go into hiding?

152
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:28,250
You decided to invest in it because you thought it'd be lucrative too!

And you're acting like you have a conscience?

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,129
We cannot let it happen. He'd never do such a thing!

169
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,700
Nurse, please. I beg of you.

170
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,870
And please don't tell Tae Sik about this.

171
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:37,389
That's Mr. Yoon's last wish?

172
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,029
It's about saving a life,

173
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,629
so it can't be a bad thing.

174
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,330
Right?

175
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,169
- Yes, of course. - Yes.

176
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,070
We shouldn't let anyone else find out about this.

177
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,000
But...

178
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,209
Nurse Seo, just do your job as a nurse...

179
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,808
until he wakes up.

180
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:00,908
We'll help you with all the rest.

181
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:03,479
This man will figure out what to do when he wakes up.

182
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,449
Whether he decides to report Mr. Kang or not,

183
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,320
it's between the two of them.

184
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,389
Yes, just until he wakes up.

185
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,289
You're just doing your job as a member of Team Genie...

186
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:17,059
and as a nurse. That's it.

187
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,710
Whatever you choose to do,

188
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:12,519
just don't die.

189
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:22,330
Hey.

190
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:24,799
Hey!

191
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,090
Sir, can you hear me?

192
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,429
Can you hear me?

193
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,279
Thanks.

194
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:14,179
For what?

195
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,649
Well...

196
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,279
You told Nurse Seo...

197
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,049
where I was.

198
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,159
How did you know?

199
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,370
It was so obvious.

200
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,000
My gosh, your friends had to stand out in the cold because of me.

201
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:45,879
Gyeo Rye.

202
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:52,419
That girl who's like family to you. That sister of yours.

203
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
Well...

204
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:00,659
Is it really okay to just leave her there?

205
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,769
What if she comes back here looking for you?

206
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:11,299
I don't know.

207
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,539
But I won't run away again.

208
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:19,539
Well, if something bad happens,

209
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,950
I'm sure you'll step in and take care of it.

210
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,150
I have Nurse Seo too, you know. Right?

211
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,519
That's right.

212
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,358
Ms. Yeom, Ms. Choi, Mr. Hwang,

213
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,289
and Seo Jin too. We're all...

214
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
on your side.

215
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:38,900
You're on my side?

216
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,970
That's nice.

217
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,400
Okay, I won't worry then.

218
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:56,849
Gyeo Rye.

219
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,680
Yes.

220
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,950
Don't you...

221
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,890
want to meet your real family?

222
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:10,390
Your parents.

223
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,930
I have no memories of my mother who ran away when I was little.

224
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,099
As for my father, I've completely erased him from my memory.

225
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,869
You really don't remember anything?

226
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,480
You know what's so funny?

227
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,950
I really don't remember his voice or what he looked like.

228
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,089
But I faintly remember that the man called my father...

229
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:37,689
was a horrible person.

230
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,920
No, he was subhuman.

231
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,229
He'd swing a hammer.

232
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,559
He'd get drunk and swing a knife too.

233
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,329
You saw it. The scar here.

234
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,769
From the iron.

235
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,980
You piece of... I'll kill you all.

236
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,579
Mister, your shoes.

237
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,420
Right, thanks.

238
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,470
Why are you barefoot?

239
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,868
I didn't want to make a sound when I was sneaking out.

240
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:00,769
My dad doesn't know, so he'll kill me if I get caught.

241
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,440
I have to rush home.

242
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,740
Goodbye.

243
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,410
- Hey, kid. - Yes?

244
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:11,420
Come here.

245
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,940
Run.

246
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,410
If you're in pain and scared, don't endure it.

247
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,980
Just run away. You have to live.

248
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,619
Holding out with all you've got will not help you.

249
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,829
You can live without a father like that.

250
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,529
The world isn't that unfair.

251
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,910
Never forget what I told you.

252
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,279
Okay?

253
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:24,249
Anyway, it was to the point...

254
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,759
I ran away at full speed to an orphanage.

255
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:28,960
I see.

256
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,299
Running away back then...

257
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,930
was a wise decision.

258
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,369
Right? That was the only thing I could do back then.

259
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:48,549
But there are scary moments that give me goosebumps.

260
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,849
And it's none other than...

261
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,749
the thought that, like two peas in a pod,

262
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,319
I might become a scumbag like my father.

263
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:00,059
You know what people say.

264
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,629
"Children take after their parents."

265
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,099
"And sons especially..."

266
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,329
"take after their fathers."

267
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:10,470
Darn it.

268
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:12,839
Gyeo Rye.

269
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:15,869
You...

270
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:18,809
are nothing like him.

271
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,349
Even the son...

272
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:27,319
of the most vicious...

273
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:30,750
and evil human I had ever met...

274
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,630
was very warm...

275
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,559
and kind.

276
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:43,869
There was someone like that?

277
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,380
I'll take this to Nurse Seo.

278
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,450
Goodnight.

279
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:00,779
You, too. Sleep tight.

280
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,619
- I'm off. - Okay.

281
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:26,940
(Room 102)

282
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,230
Good evening.

283
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,859
I gave him a stabilizer, so he should be fine for a while.

284
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:24,200
- I'm sorry. - Why...

285
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:27,500
Why on earth did you do it?

286
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,369
Putting aside the hospital,

287
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:31,940
it could put you in danger too.

288
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:33,579
Then...

289
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,720
what should I have done that day?

290
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:42,990
Well...

291
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,119
Because of a momentary mistake,

292
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:50,130
a good person like Mr. Kang became the perpetrator...

293
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:52,359
and a man, who lived an evil life...

294
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,199
No, an evil criminal,

295
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,470
who committed all kinds of crimes,

296
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,069
became the victim.

297
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:03,640
I...

298
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:08,950
made the best decision.

299
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,880
I saved him for now.

300
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,920
And...

301
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:18,890
granted someone's last wish.

302
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,660
Seriously.

303
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,660
But...

304
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,069
right now,

305
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:32,769
I just want to stop...

306
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:36,769
Mr. Kang from passing away as a criminal.

307
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:40,339
You know...

308
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,109
about his relapse?

309
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:25,420
It must have been really heavy all by yourself.

310
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,859
By any chance, did you hear everything?

311
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:33,160
Yes.

312
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,000
Do you think you're Wonder Woman?

313
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,069
Nobody can solve that alone.

314
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,269
You're right.

315
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:46,778
And the lack of sugar in your body...

316
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:48,710
is making you exhausted.

317
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,849
Here. Have it.

318
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,150
Oh, well.

319
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,589
You had a big fight today.

320
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:03,589
Hey.

321
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:07,599
The last room on the fourth floor.

322
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,029
Keep it a secret from Mr. Kang, okay?

323
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,999
- I don't want to. - No.

324
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,210
You have to.

325
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,940
If you have another one.

326
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,680
It's good, right?

327
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,750
Hold on.

328
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,319
It is.

329
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,940
Jun Il.

330
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,279
Honey.

331
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,079
We might...

332
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,349
be able to meet soon.

333
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,869
Sonny.

334
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,940
Remember the promise I made you?

335
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,769
I'll keep it.

336
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,079
But recently, my cancer came back.

337
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,910
That's why I needed you to come here...

338
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,609
and take over my position in Team Genie.

339
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,700
And...

340
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,910
I will never run away again.

341
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,069
Mr. Kang?

342
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,549
You should at least sleep comfortably.

343
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,619
(Rooms 101 to 104, Room Adela, Lounge, Cafeteria)

344
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,349
Wonder Woman!

345
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,359
- Are you going home now? - Yes.

346
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,129
Gosh, I heard how you brought Gyeo Rye back.

347
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,099
What a tough girl you were.

348
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:01,970
Gosh.

349
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:03,970
I punched her like this.

350
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:08,839
Gosh.

351
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:10,670
Mr. Kang.

352
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:12,578
Yes?

353
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,079
Can you spare me a minute?

354
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:16,009
Sure.

355
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,750
Are you sure about not getting chemotherapy?

356
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,119
Goodness.

357
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,359
Who was it that let the cat out of the bag?

358
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,900
Was it Gyeo Rye or Dr. Yang?

359
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,529
I'm remaining silent.

360
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,569
I know it's hard. I know.

361
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,769
But can't you consider it the last time and receive it?

362
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,410
Even now,

363
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,710
I'm doing well and happily at that.

364
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,980
Didn't you want to live a proper life at least once?

365
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,919
"Because of one ill friendship during my youth,"

366
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,859
"I have lived with regret until now."

367
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:01,460
"So I want to live a proper life, at least once."

368
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,089
That is what you said the moment you regained consciousness.

369
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:07,400
And that is why...

370
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:10,299
I'm living my life here...

371
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,269
with a new name, Kang Genie.

372
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:14,599
This is...

373
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,739
But you're using your time for others...

374
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,379
and not for yourself.

375
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,710
I'm doing that for myself.

376
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,950
And this is for me too.

377
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,130
(Boss)

378
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,069
- Yes, Boss? - What are you doing?

379
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,538
Do you think I'm joking right now?

380
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:23,539
No, Boss.

381
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,009
I was watching Ha Jun Kyung.

382
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,880
She probably knows where Yoon Gyeo Rye is staying right now.

383
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,519
Hey. Unless Yoon Gyeo Rye is an idiot,

384
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,690
he wouldn't have returned to that place, would he?

385
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,328
But I should at least pay a visit.

386
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:46,400
Is that so?

387
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:55,970
It looks like...

388
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,279
you're nursing Ha Jun Kyung, not watching her.

389
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:02,809
But that's not because I have poor eyesight, is it?

390
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,820
Shouldn't I call the police?

391
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,288
Seok Jun. Fall out of that love.

392
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:21,159
Even the thugs in movies back in the 1990s weren't like you.

393
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,300
In other words, that love of yours...

394
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,440
is truly abnormal.

395
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,469
That's a form of assault, too,

396
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,539
you bullying jerk.

397
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,159
What's sadder...

398
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,800
than losing your money and not being able to get it back?

399
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:59,070
I don't want to strangle the life out of my people.

400
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,969
So do a better job, Seok Jun.

401
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:04,869
Yes, Boss.

402
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,710
Get back safely.

403
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,129
- This is... - Gosh. Stay still, will you?

404
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,900
I never asked you to do this.

405
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:28,969
Isn't this outfit going too far?

406
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:31,928
Did you buy this suit?

407
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,868
No way. I borrowed it...

408
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:35,440
from Mr. Park in Room 302.

409
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:38,170
- I have to return it to him. - Gosh.

410
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,280
By the way, do you even know how to tie a neck tie?

411
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,980
You know nothing about me, do you?

412
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,119
Thugs like me need to know tricks like this...

413
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:49,489
to survive.

414
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:53,618
- Stop exaggerating. - Let go of me.

415
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:56,230
Stay still. I'll make it pretty. Okay.

416
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,190
You're looking good.

417
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,030
- Gyeo Rye. - Yes?

418
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:08,699
Doing this for me feels like...

419
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,869
you're my son.

420
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:18,409
Son? No way. You're creeping me out. Stop it.

421
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,619
By the way, where are you going all dressed up?

422
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:23,250
To a date?

423
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,530
I'm going...

424
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,500
to meet my old friends.

425
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,760
What? Friends?

426
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,329
You have friends?

427
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:38,769
Listen, punk.

428
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,539
I have lots of hotshot friends.

429
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,679
But...

430
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,849
I don't have dress shoes for the suit.

431
00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:00,219
Oh, right. I totally forgot about them.

432
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,920
What are you doing?

433
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,929
- It's just... - Hey.

434
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,739
- Those? - Yes.

435
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,908
No.

436
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:17,710
Just wear them. Don't be picky.

437
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,079
No, period.

438
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,449
Stop being picky and wear them.

439
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:30,050
Hello?

440
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,789
Yes, it's me. Hey.

441
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:36,089
A coffee shop?

442
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,388
No, this place is good too.

443
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,460
I'll wait here, not at some coffee shop.

444
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,500
Don't mind me. Take care of your business.

445
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:46,340
Come when you're done. I'll wait for you here.

446
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:49,840
Okay. Got it. Thanks.

447
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:51,809
Bye. Okay.

448
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,300
(My Love Yuzu)

449
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,968
Seriously, punk. Why won't you wait at a coffee shop?

450
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,340
You're making me uneasy.

451
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,480
I'm really okay.

452
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:31,250
But gosh.

453
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,049
How long has it been?

454
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,119
Hey, thanks for coming down.

455
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:39,389
Here.

456
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:40,789
Forget it.

457
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:46,029
Didn't you go around everywhere with a business card to start up...

458
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,500
an entertainment business?

459
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,669
Did you quit? You're giving off a different vibe.

460
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,109
Yes. I'm no longer doing that job.

461
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,570
That's great news.

462
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:01,339
You knew nothing about that industry.

463
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,309
And what's more, you had met the wrong person.

464
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:06,250
Hey, that was no showbiz.

465
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,590
You were nothing but a pimp picking up young women.

466
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:11,789
You're right. It was all my fault.

467
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:15,590
Ignorance is a sin, after all.

468
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:21,500
Since you're reflecting on yourself, I'm kind of willing to help you.

469
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:23,730
So what do you need?

470
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,538
I heard you didn't even know the address.

471
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:30,069
"It happened a long time ago, so my memories are fuzzy."

472
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,210
"Can you really find them?"

473
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,610
If we do,

474
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,349
how will you communicate with them?

475
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,719
Please become my voice.

476
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,449
Letters...

477
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:48,659
will not be able to express my feelings properly.

478
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,530
Oh, you see.

479
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,928
Are you still a production director at this broadcasting station?

480
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:57,199
For real?

481
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:00,598
Do you know how old I am? I'm the director now.

482
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,539
If I weren't, I would've done a solo coverage of you.

483
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:04,809
You're right.

484
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,110
If you don't mind me asking...

485
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:14,948
The production director who stopped in the middle...

486
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:17,319
of covering the re-examination...

487
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,659
of Unsung-dong's One Heart Supermarket...

488
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,489
murder case 50 years ago.

489
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,460
Does he still work at your company?

490
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,729
I think so. Why do you ask?

491
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,428
Oh, really?

492
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:32,699
I have something to find out.

493
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:36,170
Can you introduce him to me?

494
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,880
Okay.

495
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,280
But let's have dinner tonight.

496
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,949
Okay.

497
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,760
He happened to come to see me when we were having a meeting.

498
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,300
Tae Sik, long time no see.

499
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,699
Has it been six years?

500
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,839
Right. You've changed so much.

501
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,009
You were all covered in luxury products...

502
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,210
for your business with a condescending attitude.

503
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,250
It wasn't a business. It was a fraud.

504
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,718
Stop it.

505
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:22,218
He was scammed too.

506
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:23,988
He didn't know what kind of business it was.

507
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:26,618
How could he invest all that money without knowing?

508
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:28,159
He pretended not to know.

509
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,629
It's true that he made a lot by selling kids.

510
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,198
How's that different...

511
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,900
from being a pimp?

512
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,030
Stop it.

513
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,339
He thought entertainment was just for raising celebrities.

514
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,308
That prick didn't take our advice...

515
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:46,679
and got mad at us for not trusting him.

516
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,050
I'm very sorry.

517
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:54,219
Tae Sik. Is it true that you lived on the street?

518
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:57,150
Someone saw you on the street. Is it true?

519
00:41:57,989 --> 00:41:59,050
Yes.

520
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:01,888
That was me.

521
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:03,488
You made a ruckus to find investors.

522
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:05,058
Did you lose all that money?

523
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:07,459
Not exactly.

524
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,659
Then why?

525
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,530
Well...

526
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,039
I'm not sure...

527
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,070
why I did that.

528
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:20,079
At some point,

529
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,780
I wasn't able to sleep...

530
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,820
if I was physically comfortable.

531
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:33,320
So I wandered around like a lunatic...

532
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,059
and passed out on the street.

533
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,929
I still prefer...

534
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:47,000
sleeping outside.

535
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:50,170
I like it.

536
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:58,210
Anyway, I'm really sorry about what I did.

537
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,920
I truly am.

538
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:16,530
Did it show that I brought you here on purpose?

539
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,539
- Are you upset? - No.

540
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:29,280
I actually feel better after getting criticized.

541
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,079
I should've visited you guys early.

542
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:37,590
You have no idea how much you upset us.

543
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,260
When you reach this age,

544
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,590
you realize your friend from childhood means a lot.

545
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,229
But you made us look like...

546
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,369
we were jealous of your jackpot.

547
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,199
Sorry.

548
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,769
Sometimes you get blinded.

549
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:01,210
You don't realize how precious the small chances are.

550
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,210
You don't realize you're hurting your fist...

551
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:06,550
for an opportunity that doesn't even exist.

552
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,848
I punched people who mean a lot to me...

553
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:11,090
with that fist...

554
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,989
and broke their hearts.

555
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:22,429
Thank you for bringing me here.

556
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,289
Hello, sir.

557
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:50,190
Gyeo Rye. How did you know I was here?

558
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:53,360
I'm here to pick you up, sir.

559
00:44:56,269 --> 00:44:57,500
Stop calling me sir.

560
00:44:57,969 --> 00:45:00,299
Our company sedan broke,

561
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,539
so I drove an ambulance here instead.

562
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:05,940
What are you doing?

563
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:09,339
I assumed you drank a lot,

564
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,179
so I prepared a hangover reliever.

565
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,780
Okay.

566
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:16,289
I could only prepare one, sir.

567
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,389
This is crazy.

568
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,319
You're also scheduled for social...

569
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,860
I mean, volunteer in the early morning, sir.

570
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,800
Okay.

571
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:35,400
Anyway, it was nice to see you after all these years.

572
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:38,710
Bye.

573
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:46,250
You should lie down. I'll take you to your bedroom, sir.

574
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,119
Open the passenger seat.

575
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,389
Bye.

576
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,630
Tae Sik.

577
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,469
I talked to the producer already. You should give him a call.

578
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,280
Thanks a lot.

579
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:15,980
Bye.

580
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:19,719
Watch your head, sir.

581
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,519
Goodbye.

582
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:39,030
- I will set off now, sir. - Bye.

583
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:40,800
See you.

584
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,309
I guess he's up to something good now.

585
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,449
Right. I see that he has someone working for him.

586
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:58,989
That's a relief.

587
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:04,360
But he was loyal since he was young.

588
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:06,030
He happened to meet the wrong person.

589
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,570
Let's go.

590
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,699
Yes, let's go.

591
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:19,808
He only sleeps three hours a day.

592
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:22,578
He's the most diligent guy ever.

593
00:47:22,579 --> 00:47:24,110
That's right.

594
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:27,650
Let's give it up for Tae Sik.

595
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,730
My goodness.

596
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:06,050
Hey. Oh, dear...

597
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,259
Don't even think about becoming an actor.

598
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,789
That was terrible.

599
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,599
My goodness.

600
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,368
I realized it from the musical.

601
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:19,269
What's wrong with my acting?

602
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:22,539
I deserve the grand award.

603
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,739
Besides, if I was an actor,

604
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:29,909
I'd be known for my look.

605
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:31,610
Do you even know what that means?

606
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,679
My goodness.

607
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:37,218
You always beat around the bush...

608
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:39,888
before saying thank you.

609
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:43,559
Did you expect me to compliment you?

610
00:48:43,789 --> 00:48:45,889
I never got complimented in my life before.

611
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,460
I'm not interested.

612
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:58,909
What's this?

613
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:05,349
Clothes?

614
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:09,019
Did you come...

615
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,920
to give these to me?

616
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,219
Where did you borrow these?

617
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,300
They're new.

618
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:26,369
Yoon Gyeo Rye bought these himself...

619
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:28,198
for me?

620
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,069
You said you were meeting your friends.

621
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,569
You shouldn't be discouraged.

622
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,979
Honestly, we may not be rich, but we still have pride.

623
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:37,780
Hey. What's wrong with Mr. Hwang's shoes?

624
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,948
Old shoes are softer and more comfortable...

625
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:43,718
because they're worn out.

626
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:45,448
Give them back. I'm returning them.

627
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,618
- Hey. - Give them back.

628
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:49,789
- Stop it. - I'm going to return them.

629
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,960
- What are you doing? - They are...

630
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,300
pretty comfortable.

631
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,070
My goodness.

632
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,170
Gyeo Rye.

633
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:07,079
From now on,

634
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,679
don't spend your money on something like these for me.

635
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,679
And...

636
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,679
don't come to get me.

637
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:17,749
I'm so sick of it.

638
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,888
You never say thank you.

639
00:50:20,889 --> 00:50:22,559
I'm so sick of it.

640
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,059
Thank you.

641
00:50:26,929 --> 00:50:27,929
There you are.

642
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:34,699
It's so hard to hear a thank you.

643
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:36,809
Sir, where to?

644
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:38,670
Stop it.

645
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:45,110
(Bae Jae Seok)

646
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:47,349
- Sir, who are you calling? - Stop it.

647
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,150
Hello?

648
00:50:50,989 --> 00:50:55,559
Is this Producer Bae Jae Seok?

649
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,300
Yes. Hello.

650
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:02,559
Sorry for calling you so late.

651
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,840
I got your number from Chief Hwang Jae Chul.

652
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:09,340
Yes, my name is Kang Tae Sik.

653
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,570
Nice to meet you.

654
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:13,940
I called you...

655
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:19,110
to ask you about the One Heart Supermarket murder case...

656
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:24,488
in Unsung-dong...

657
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:27,590
which you covered before.

658
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:32,030
Yes.

659
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:36,130
(Ambulance)

660
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:42,070
I found him,

661
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,980
but he's in Mokpo.

662
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:50,780
It's quite far.

663
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:52,780
Do you think you can go?

664
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:02,489
Okay.

665
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:05,730
Of course.

666
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,800
I'll go even if he's in the US.

667
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:11,929
Even if I die on the way, I must go.

668
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:20,340
You're ready for it.

669
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:31,650
Okay.

670
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:36,530
I'm praying every day...

671
00:52:37,289 --> 00:52:39,460
worrying that it's not too late.

672
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:47,269
We'll get ready for it.

673
00:52:58,579 --> 00:52:59,650
Song Chang Woo.

674
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:02,150
Song Chang Woo.

675
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,449
Are you kidding me?

676
00:53:08,659 --> 00:53:10,689
Why do you keep changing your words?

677
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:11,929
That's not it.

678
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,699
I think I'm mistaken.

679
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:17,598
Do you know how serious perjury is?

680
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,839
You'll end up in prison.

681
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,900
Get it?

682
00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:39,549
Mokpo? Isn't that really far?

683
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,889
It's pretty much the end of the peninsula.

684
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,329
Right. It'll take a long time.

685
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,460
So I asked him a few times,

686
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,730
and he said he'll even go to the US if he has to.

687
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,329
He should go if that's what he wants.

688
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,499
I'm glad we have Mr. Kang's ambulance.

689
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,840
It's worth the most of all the things I bought.

690
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:05,579
I made lunch for you...

691
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:09,879
and porridge for Mr. Song.

692
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,589
If he can't eat, he should get an IV on the way.

693
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,859
Thank you so much for the lunch.

694
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,629
What's in the lunchbox? Is there one for me too?

695
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,860
Of course, Gyeo Rye.

696
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,460
Yours is here.

697
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:25,230
You got me too.

698
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:29,799
We should all go on a trip...

699
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,939
to somewhere nice later.

700
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:33,408
I'd love to.

701
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:34,578
- Gyeo Rye. - Yes.

702
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:36,538
- Mt. Geumgang. - Sounds good. Let's go.

703
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,949
- Hawaii. - England.

704
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,518
- I want to go to Neth... - Let's set off to Mokpo.

705
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:43,419
- Okay. - See you later.

706
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,820
Bye.

707
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,260
Let's go.

708
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,230
Take me with you next time.

709
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:56,699
Have a good trip.

710
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,138
- Close the door. - Okay.

711
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:02,170
Mr. Kang.

712
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,869
I'm not sure if we should be doing this.

713
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:09,039
He's getting worse lately.

714
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:14,719
Have a good trip.

715
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:16,849
Don't worry.

716
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:20,219
We'll do our best.

717
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:22,589
Right. You've got me. No need to worry.

718
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:23,989
The hospital's Wonder Woman...

719
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,959
Let's go.

720
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,698
Wonder Woman Seo Yeon Joo.

721
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,268
- I'm relying on you. - Yes, don't worry.

722
00:55:30,269 --> 00:55:31,428
Drive safe.

723
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:32,699
No need to worry.

724
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:35,440
- Let's go. - He'll be fine.

725
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:37,808
Don't worry.

726
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:38,869
(Ambulance)

727
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:51,519
(Rest Stop)

728
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:53,760
Hello.

729
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:55,820
Choose one.

730
00:55:57,929 --> 00:56:00,929
It's fun to get food here.

731
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,098
You don't know what's romantic.

732
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:05,669
We're not travelling here. We're volunteering.

733
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,469
Watch what you say.

734
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:09,900
Two fishcakes and potato please.

735
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,070
Sausage too.

736
00:56:14,409 --> 00:56:16,809
And he's paying.

737
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,219
Oh, do you like it?

738
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,018
What the? How much is it?

739
00:56:22,019 --> 00:56:23,219
- Fifteen dollars. - Fifteen dollars?

740
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,219
- Give me five bucks. - Hurry up and pay for it.

741
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,829
Thanks to you, we're having a good time.

742
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,829
- Thank you. - Bye.

743
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,709
Hey. That sausage is...

744
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:49,908
for Nurse Seo. Why are you eating it?

745
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:53,049
She always works out. She doesn't like this.

746
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,618
This is fast food.

747
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:57,090
You can give her the potatoes. It's healthy.

748
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:58,449
You little...

749
00:56:58,789 --> 00:57:00,050
(Ambulance)

750
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,860
- Gyeo Rye. - What?

751
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,699
Be honest with me.

752
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,800
- What? - Have you ever...

753
00:57:14,269 --> 00:57:15,340
kissed a woman before?

754
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:18,969
Aside from Nurse Seo.

755
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:21,840
No, I...

756
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:27,550
What?

757
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:31,420
Are you saying you kissed Nurse Seo?

758
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,159
It was recent.

759
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:41,098
When we had the musical recently,

760
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:43,059
we had to kiss.

761
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,169
That's what I meant.

762
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:48,070
Look at you.

763
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,769
So Nurse Seo is your first kiss.

764
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:53,340
You think I...

765
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,510
Stop lying. You're cute.

766
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,010
What...

767
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:02,550
What are you looking at? Stop laughing at me.

768
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,749
Where are you going? You forgot this.

769
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:06,889
Restroom.

770
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,959
Here are the potatoes.

771
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,059
Good.

772
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,529
- What's wrong with your face? - What?

773
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:17,928
- Let me see? - What's wrong?

774
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:20,468
Your face is red.

775
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:21,539
Red?

776
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:26,980
You're so cute.

777
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:29,679
I'm going to the restroom.

778
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,050
Hey.

779
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:33,510
What was that?

780
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,050
Gosh.

781
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:42,159
How are you doing?

782
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,230
Do I look cute?

783
00:59:27,869 --> 00:59:30,809
What do I do?

784
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:36,179
Gyeo Rye. Yoon Gyeo Rye!

785
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:38,710
Gyeo Rye.

786
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:40,849
Yoon Gyeo Rye!

787
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:44,989
Call 911.

788
00:59:47,389 --> 00:59:48,989
- Mr. Kang. - Mr. Kang.

789
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:52,429
- Gyeo Rye. - Mr. Kang.

790
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:55,629
- Mr. Kang. - Mr. Kang.

791
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:57,268
What happened?

792
00:59:57,269 --> 00:59:59,429
Mr. Kang. Are you okay?

793
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:01,170
Mr. Kang. No.

794
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,809
Mr. Kang. No!

795
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:22,860
(If You Wish Upon Me)

796
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,989
Why are you blaming me? You killed him!

797
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:28,059
I want to stop now.

798
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,300
You know your sister's number, right?

799
01:00:30,929 --> 01:00:33,170
There are things that effort can't do.

800
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:35,599
Still, it's a promise.

801
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:37,340
I must keep it.

802
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,239
Who are you?

803
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:41,739
You love me, don't you?

804
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,909
Time doesn't wait.

805
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:48,050
Are you sure you didn't do it?

806
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,949
I won't say sorry.

807
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:53,619
Are you feeling better?
