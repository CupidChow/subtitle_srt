- Hi. - What's your deal?

18
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,060
Did I do something wrong?

19
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:54,979
Yoon Gyeo Rye.

20
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,080
Hey, Yoon Gyeo Rye!

21
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,620
That punk.

22
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,800
(Establish law and order)

23
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,479
Who are you? Why did you run away?

24
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,150
That hurts.

25
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,750
- Where's Yoon Gyeo Rye? - Let me go.

26
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,019
I don't know who that is.

27
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,788
I ran away because you suddenly came after me and intimidated me.

28
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:37,059
Tell me the truth.

29
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,519
He wore this jacket when he went to prison.

30
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,188
I found it in the prison trash can.

31
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,529
No! Don't kill me!

32
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,860
I'm sorry. Don't kill me!

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,598
I'm sorry. Please don't kill me. I'm begging you.

34
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,469
It's all my fault. Please!

35
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,439
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:01,610
I'll be better. I'm sorry.

37
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,549
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,119
Don't kill me.

39
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,389
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:10,319
I'm sorry. Spare my life.

(Seok Jun)

42
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,628
Seok Jun. Long time no see.

43
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,039
You want to die? Do you have two lives?

44
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,639
I'd appreciate it if you kill me without getting my hands dirty,

45
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,970
but if I have two lives, do I have to die twice?

46
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,179
I'd kill you right away as soon as I see you,

47
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,779
so I'll ask you one last time.

48
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,508
Where did you siphon off the 320,000 dollars?

49
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:38,278
Park Hyo Soon said he's never met you or got money from you.

50
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,350
This is crazy.

51
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,050
Look.

52
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,560
I met him and gave him the money.

53
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,689
So, Seok Jun.

54
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,159
Stop calling me, you lunatic.

55
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,899
You piece of trash. Are you out of your mind?

56
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,670
Darn.

57
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:17,659
- Bye. - Thank you.

58
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,660
Bye, Somi. Take care.

59
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,180
So...

60
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:41,949
you're saying...

61
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,879
he's...

62
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:49,149
terminally ill?

63
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,560
Yes, he doesn't have much time left.

64
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,089
Surgery won't help.

65
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,229
This is crazy.

66
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,958
You never called me after you left the orphanage,

67
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,170
then you suddenly showed up and asked me to look after the dog.

68
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:03,769
Of course it's crazy.

69
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,268
Where's the bag?

70
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:07,339
Wait here.

71
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,120
It's darn heavy.

72
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,759
Is it dangerous?

73
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,560
It belongs to me. I only got my stuff back.

74
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,970
Hey. Here.

75
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,870
Take it.

76
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:42,170
I don't need this much. It doesn't cost much to stay.

77
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,609
You kept it for me. You didn't take off with it.

78
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,179
Take that as compensation for that.

79
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,878
Just take what you can get.

80
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,420
I'd never refuse it.

81
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,990
- Hey. I don't need it. - What?

82
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,489
- For real? - No thanks. Take it back.

83
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,629
Don't regret it.

84
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,529
He won't last long anyway.

85
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:07,869
Sometimes he'll be in pain and have a seizure.

86
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,869
Don't dwell on it too much and you better put him to sleep.

87
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,540
Seriously. I'll take care of it.

88
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,509
Were we this close?

89
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,339
I'm talking to you as a vet, not as your family from the orphanage.

90
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,610
Don't be ridiculous. We're not family.

91
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:26,378
Let's be honest. You were there only for a short time...

92
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,388
while your rich parents were getting a divorce,

93
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:31,160
but I walked in there myself to survive. There's a difference.

94
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:32,959
Bye.

95
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,059
Let's go, baby.

96
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,430
Besides, I'm two years older than you. Have you forgotten?

97
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,399
Yoon Gyeo Rye. Hey. What about Jun Kyung?

98
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,540
How's she doing?

99
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,470
You were always together.

100
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:57,149
Son. Have you seen this before?

101
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:58,720
No, right?

102
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:00,589
You've got to see this.

103
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,620
- Sir? - Yes?

104
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,490
What brings you to our hotel?

105
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,860
I'm staying here tonight.

106
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,290
You're staying in our hotel?

107
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:10,959
Yes. Is there something wrong?

108
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,170
I got money. I can afford it.

109
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,170
Hang on.

110
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,079
Give me the best room here.

111
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,419
Is that not enough?

112
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,889
Here. The most expensive room.

113
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,590
Great.

114
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,730
Is this the most expensive room?

115
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,129
- How many rooms are in here? - Sir. It's on your right.

116
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:48,970
I see.

117
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,240
Gosh.

118
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,809
Look at this.

119
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:58,509
Great.

120
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:03,480
Amazing.

121
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:05,449
Check this out.

122
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,620
This is huge.

123
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,960
This is awesome.

124
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,690
Awesome.

125
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,029
I can see everything.

126
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,029
Oh, look at that.

127
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:24,500
Sir. Enjoy your stay.

128
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,600
Thank you.

129
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,710
It's so high.

130
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,480
Money is great.

131
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,049
Right.

132
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,850
Here.

133
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:44,960
- It's okay. - You worked hard.

134
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,259
Here. Take it.

135
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,860
- Have a good night. - Thank you.

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,539
Bye.

137
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,799
Good night!

138
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,340
Yes. It's crazy!

139
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,350
Happy birthday to you

140
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,850
Happy birthday to you

141
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,519
Dear...

Dear Yoon Gyeo Rye

143
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,230
Happy birthday to you

144
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,679
That was a lie!

145
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,759
How am I supposed to know when I was born?

146
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,230
No one ever told me.

147
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,769
Hey. When's your birthday? You don't know?

148
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,610
Come on. Eat.

149
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,219
Eat.

150
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,620
Why aren't you eating? You're sick.

151
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,489
You think your previous owners who abandoned you...

152
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,460
felt too guilty to eat?

153
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,559
Nonsense. Don't be ridiculous.

154
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:36,398
If they could feel guilty,

155
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,369
they would've never abandoned you in the first place!

156
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,139
Come on! Eat. You need to eat to survive!

157
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,409
Come on.

158
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,049
It's a darn big room.

159
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,269
How beautiful.

160
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,200
This is why I can't leave this place.

No one picked this up?

169

How can they just leave? Catch.

00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:46,730
Hello.

172
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,699
- Good morning. - Morning.

173
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,939
Hello.

174
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,940
(Ward, Cafeteria)

175
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,970
Is it causing trouble again?

176
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:56,809
- Is it not working? - No.

177
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,610
- There. - Thank you.

178
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,888
Thank you, doctor.

179
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,850
I'm not a doctor.

180
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,220
It's hot in here.

181
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,860
Hello.

182
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,428
He's Mr. Kang.

183
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:18,158
He's a volunteer.

184
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,559
I see.

185
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,970
Thank you for your help.

186
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,609
Ma'am. Good morning.

187
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,579
I'm cleaning.

188
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,178
Use the restroom on a different floor.

189
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:34,749
I have to finish it fast and get to the third floor.

190
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,518
You think I'd pee in front of you?

191
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,820
Did you miss me that much?

192
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,819
You don't hesitate to walk in when I'm cleaning.

193
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,220
Don't fall for me.

194
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,158
I've never had a boyfriend before,

195
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:50,860
but I only like handsome.

196
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,699
When I was young...

197
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,899
Ma'am?

198
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,199
I told you to get up on time for breakfast,

199
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,899
but you always sleep in.

200
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,269
Okay.

201
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,840
Oh, it's good. It's amazing.

202
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,210
Your cooking skill should be awarded.

203
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,909
Especially this coastal hog fennel.

204
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,048
- That's right beside. - What?

205
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:47,580
- It's brachycarpa. - Right. brachycarpa.

206
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,559
When I was young, I hated greens.

207
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,719
Now that I'm getting old,

208
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,889
I crave greens in the middle of the night.

209
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:59,158
I'll make it for you as much as you want. Just get up early.

210
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,470
How can someone living in the hospital get here after us?

211
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,700
Nothing upsets me more than preparing a meal twice.

212
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,269
Okay.

213
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:15,679
You're going with Mr. Yoon today. Are you going to be okay?

214
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,980
Oh, right.

215
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,820
I was going to give him a bath before we hit the road.

216
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,120
It must break your heart.

217
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:28,090
You treated him like your brother.

218
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,970
By the way, I thought Nurse Seo was coming for a meal.

219
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:39,600
Where did she go? I haven't seen her.

220
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,168
She's probably working on the same thing...

221
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,379
in the same place upstairs.

222
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,250
Hi.

223
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
So when are you becoming an MMA fighter?

224
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,150
I don't have time for it.

225
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:30,849
I'm too busy.

226
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,359
Go.

227
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,000
- It's time. - Right.

228
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,470
What about school?

229
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,299
I'll go later. This is more important.

230
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,269
Hey.

231
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,849
Mr. Yoon. Is it nice?

232
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:11,930
My goodness.

233
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,960
Mr. Yoon.

234
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:17,869
You always wanted to see the snow.

235
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,569
It's your wish come true.

236
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,509
In this hospice hospital, we have special people.

237
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,049
People who make snow in the middle of summer.

238
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,089
Regardless of age, gender, and occupation,

239
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:38,720
they have beautiful hearts.

240
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,029
We call people who grant the last wish...

241
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,930
Team Genie.

242
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,700
Today, we're granting Mr. Yoon's last wish...

243
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,670
who created Team Genie.

244
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,440
Maybe...

245
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,680
it could be all our wishes.

246
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,849
For the miracle Team Genie has created...

247
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,349
and more to come,

248
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,690
we're praying again.

249
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,730
Now you should plan...

250
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,730
the Christmas party with your wife...

251
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,109
on the beach in your hometown.

252
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:31,680
Okay?

253
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:34,650
Yes.

254
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,289
Gosh.

255
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:57,700
Life is crazy.

256
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,869
For both you and me...

257
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,710
(Come to Goseong!)

258
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,650
Why, do you want to see the ocean?

259
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,759
Shall we go see the ocean for the last time before you die?

260
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,369
Let's do that. We have no place to go anyway.

261
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,750
You have what looks like a burn on your skin.

262
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
It's the skin condition...

263
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:50,349
from radiotherapy you received.

264
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,518
It's due to weak immune system.

265
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,259
If you apply this ointment, you'll get better soon.

266
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,029
I know it hurts.

267
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,730
I'll be quick.

268
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:04,169
Oh, dear.

269
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,000
(Nurses' Lounge)

270
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:09,839
Where do I start?

271
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,880
- Unit 203. - Okay.

272
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,180
Dr. Yang.

273
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,549
Later, you're coming with me, right?

274
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:24,048
Yes. I promised, after all.

275
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,959
Thank you so much.

276
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,390
I was worried about...

277
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:29,059
Oh, gosh.

278
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,799
Right. I'm sorry.

279
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:37,200
Did you bring thick clothes?

280
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,768
If we're doing it, we should go all out.

281
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:42,538
Yes. I brought my coat.

282
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,779
The snow in the morning was pretty.

283
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,680
It was worth sacrificing my arms.

284
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,079
By any chance,

285
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,109
well,

286
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,980
are you free in the evening after we return?

287
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,659
But it's your birthday. You must already have plans.

288
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,430
Oh, my. How did you know today's my birthday?

289
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,559
Gosh, I'm touched.

290
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,329
What a bummer. I don't have any plans today.

291
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,869
But I wonder why. It's weird for me not to have one.

292
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:14,869
Anyway, I'll try to make time in the evening.

293
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:17,669
- So let's go to the East Sea first. - Okay.

294
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,879
But before that, go to Room 203.

295
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
- I should, right? - Yes.

296
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
We can do it!

297
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:32,920
I can do it!

298
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,470
What's wrong with this?

299
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,799
Why won't it... Oh, got it.

300
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,338
Oh, my gosh. This is bad.

301
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:49,239
I'm sorry, sir. I'm so sorry.

302
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,169
Did it hurt? Are you okay?

303
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,210
My goodness.

304
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,869
This watch.

305
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,440
Isn't it the most expensive thing you own?

306
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,650
You used to boast about it.

307
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,380
My time...

308
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,250
is over...

309
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,390
now.

310
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:56,970
Shall we go?

311
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,750
I'll go ahead first.

312
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:57,269
Hey, Sunny. Did you find the location?

313
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,440
It's not "Sunny" but "Seo Jin."

314
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,639
My bad. So did you find it?

315
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,809
I'm looking for it right now.

316
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,950
It's sizzling hot. Why do we have to act like it's winter?

317
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,150
We even put up Christmas decorations during mid-summer.

318
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,078
The hospital said...

319
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,220
Mr. Yoon was going to make it until this winter. But you know.

320
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:22,029
He had high hopes to see snow this winter.

321
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,900
Being born in the winter, he loves snow.

322
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:38,039
I packed some food.

323
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:40,410
Place them in front of his wife's grave.

324
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,210
Thank you.

325
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:47,220
Don't mention it. It's my job too.

326
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,059
Will he make it to his hometown?

327
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,700
He was doing fine until this morning.

328
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,029
But does he really have to go there?

329
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,799
It's something he dearly wanted.

330
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:13,079
Thank you for making our patients' wishes come true.

331
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,650
So I will pray that you can fulfill your dream too.

332
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,259
I will pray with her too, Mr. Yoon.

333
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:31,589
Mister, thank you for all your hard work until now.

334
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,689
- Goodbye! - Bye!

335
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,259
- You've worked hard. - Farewell.

336
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,470
I'll take this one.

337
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,139
- That one? - Yes.

338
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,578
You've got an eye for cars.

339
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:20,108
It came in just recently.

340
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:22,249
The colour’s sexy and suits you perfectly.

341
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,819
Also, consider this car almost brand-new and not second-hand.

342
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,420
- Do you need an instalment plan? - In cash.

343
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,230
Right.

344
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,730
Hey, Seok Jun.

345
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:46,700
The guy you were looking for with a rose tattoo on his wrist.

346
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:47,899
(Name: Yoon Gyeo Rye)

347
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,309
Was it Yoon Gyeo Rye?

348
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,539
Yes. So what car did he buy?

349
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,730
Mr. Yoon. It's nice, isn't it?

350
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,409
It would've been great if the whole Team Genie came with us.

351
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,940
But I'm the only one who can drive. The others are novice drivers...

352
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,839
or have driver's licenses for nothing.

353
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:31,079
At least I have no history of accidents.

354
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,970
What? His pulse is dropping.

355
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:51,970
Mr. Yoon!

356
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:54,268
Wake up, Mr. Yoon.

357
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:56,969
Mr. Yoon, hang in there just a bit longer.

358
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,778
We're almost in your hometown. Okay?

359
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,839
Mr. Yoon!

360
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,180
Darn it. Please come around.

361
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:11,789
Hey, Yoon Gyeo Rye.

362
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,460
Stop the car.

363
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,558
Stop it, you jerk! You hear me?

364
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:19,500
- This darn leech. - Yoon Gyeo Rye.

365
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,059
Stop the car!

366
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,339
Hurry up and step on it! Stop the car, darn it.

367
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,170
Hey!

368
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,769
Seriously.

369
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:41,049
Darn it.

370
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:49,829
What?

371
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,859
That crazy punk. He sucks at driving.

372
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,470
He's in respiratory distress.

373
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,769
Do something, will you? He's having difficulty breathing.

374
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,670
You know he signed the advance directive.

375
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:06,739
I can't insert a tube or do CPR.

376
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,049
Of course, I know that.

377
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:13,149
But I want to fulfill his wish of going to his hometown.

378
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,920
That is Mr. Yoon's last wish.

379
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:17,490
So do something.

380
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:19,759
Nurse Seo?

381
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,059
I'm sorry.

382
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,089
But let me break it just this once.

383
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,230
I'll accept any punishment.

384
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,569
Please, Mr. Yoon. Hang in there.

385
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,160
- What? - Stop!

386
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:17,480
- His pulse is back to normal. - Are you okay, sir?

387
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:18,819
My leg hurts.

388
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,278
- What is it, Mr. Kang? - Are you hurt?

389
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,450
No, I'm totally fine.

390
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:25,889
- What was he thinking? - What the heck?

391
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,019
- Was there an accident? - Drive safely, darn it.

392
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:33,400
Sonny, are you okay? Hey, Sonny.

393
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,099
Darn it.

394
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,899
Give me a second.

395
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,339
- Mr. Kang? - Mr. Kang!

396
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,569
- Darn it! - Hey!

397
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,508
- Hey! - I'm sorry.

398
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:48,079
- Get out of the car. Hey. - Stop blocking the road, will you?

399
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:50,109
- Seriously. - Get out.

400
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,549
- What is it? - Get out and drive that car.

401
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,980
For goodness' sake, what the heck is wrong with you?

402
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,450
Yoon Gyeo Rye!

403
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,519
Yoon Gyeo Rye!

404
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,219
- Come here. - Wait.

405
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,130
Time out. Okay, I'll drive that car.

406
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,959
Yoon Gyeo Rye!

407
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,730
- Come here. - Darn it.

408
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,699
Drive that car, got it?

409
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,129
- What's going on? - Everything's okay.

410
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,339
- Yoon Gyeo Rye! - What is it?

411
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:13,699
- Call the police! - You.

412
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,368
- Hey! - Do something.

413
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,639
- Drive. - What's with this ambulance?

414
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,440
I can't drive right now because of you.

415
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,049
So take responsibility and drive this car.

416
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,078
- Darn it. Fine. - Hurry.

417
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,348
- Yoon Gyeo Rye! - Seriously.

418
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:27,420
Hold on.

419
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,919
- Yoon Gyeo Rye. - What's this?

420
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,159
My Sonny. Hold on to this bag.

421
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,558
Mr. Kang, who is he?

422
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:38,899
Mr. Kang. What's gotten into you after Nurse Seo?

423
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,129
What the heck? You scared me. Darn it.

424
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,230
Are you okay, Mr. Yoon?

425
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:46,339
I will take you to your hometown, the East Sea,

426
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:48,239
no matter what.

427
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,768
The East Sea?

428
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:51,309
Yes, the East Sea. Now go.

429
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,210
Okay.

430
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:57,778
- Mr. Yoon, hang in there. - Yoon Gyeo Rye.

431
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:00,848
- Boss. That car. - Listen, sir.

432
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:03,019
- Hey, Yoon Gyeo Rye! - What's going on?

433
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,160
- Do something. - What are you doing?

434
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:08,759
Here's the compensation!

435
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,288
- Hey, Yoon Gyeo Rye! - What?

436
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,528
- What was that? - Yoon Gyeo Rye!

437
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:12,900
- Move. - Come here!

438
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:15,229
Move out of my way!

439
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,069
Darn it. Hey!

440
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:19,970
Hey!

441
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,410
Darn it.

442
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,480
- It's money. - Pick them up.

443
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:41,960
Mr. Yoon, we're here.

445
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:53,700
Please excuse me, Mr. Yoon.

446
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:12,889
Ms. Kim.

447
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,829
I hope the food is to your taste.

448
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,659
These foods.

449
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:25,099
They have Ms. Yeom's special sauce in them,

450
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,099
and everyone loves it.

451
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,869
So please savour them.

452
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,110
And...

453
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,480
And if you meet with Mr. Yoon,

454
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,420
please enjoy them with him.

455
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,630
Everyone,

456
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,670
thank you.

Honey.

459
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,969
It was lonely by yourself, wasn't it?

460
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,510
We can be together from now on.

461
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,349
Hey, is this your first beach?

462
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,150
Me too. I've never seen the ocean in real life before.

463
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,460
I might have when I was little.

464
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:35,429
Gosh.

465
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:38,570
There's nothing special about the ocean.

466
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,469
Right?

467
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,889
Shall we go?

468
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:08,599
Gosh.

469
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,210
Shall we go now?

470
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,349
Gyeo Rye, people like us...

471
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,119
should die rather than live.

472
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,670
Don't go.

473
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,940
There's no point...

474
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,750
in living any longer.

475
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:52,130
Goodness. Youngsters these days have no sense of shame.

476
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,599
Look.

477
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,808
You did this to my foot.

478
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:58,510
So take full responsibility for it...

479
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,980
and not wash your hands off.

Is this the right address?

- I don't have a home. - Why not?

486
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:31,269
Why not? Because I don't have one.

487

What? Am I your first homeless guy?

488
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:35,639
Seriously, this jerk.

489
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,178
Hey. Are you playing games with me?

490
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,280
Does it look like I am?

491
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:41,420

Gosh, sorry I didn't recognize you.

502

00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,589
I got imprisoned...

505
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,788
for a short period because of arson.

506
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:23,489
But I didn't do it on purpose. What...

507
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,829
Darn it.

508
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,158
I should've been the victim...

509
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,300
but became the perpetrator and was wrongfully charged.

510
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,198
For both pocketing the settlement aid...

511
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,599
and the fake bank book.

512
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,570
- Hey. - Darn it.

513
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:41,179
- Hey. - Seriously. What are you doing?

514
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,249
Isn't that a burn from an iron?

515
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,179
He's a wacko.

516
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,448
Don't people ask such things carefully,

517
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,949
starting with, "Sorry to ask?"

518
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,719
And why did you have to pull me by the collar?

519
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,760
What is he? An expert in burns or something?

520
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,730
By the way, mister.

521
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,969
You have a nasty temper but won't go to the pit.

522
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,440
So you grant last wishes?

523
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:11,869
Yes, I do.

524
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,710
Why?

525
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:17,409
There's no reason. I just do it.

526
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,420
I see.

527
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,948
Do you get paid a lot?

528
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:24,219
No. I do it for free.

529
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,219
Right. For free?

530
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,590
Yes.

531
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:32,460
He's driving me nuts.

532
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,130
That's being nosy.

533
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,808
You killed them, so why are you blaming me?

534
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:49,209
You piece of trash.

535
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,750
Son of a gun like you, who blame others,

536
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:54,280
should drop dead.

537
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:57,349
Darn it.

538
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,889
Dad?

539
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,780
How could you do whatever you wanted?

540
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:26,118
He would have had a peaceful passing at the hospital.

541
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,979
You made a patient suffer until his death...

542
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,349
and even caused a car accident.

543
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,618
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

544
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:34,658
He was on his deathbed, but you didn't even call us!

545
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:37,030
We did.

546
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,928
We left text messages...

547
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:42,828
and called numerous times, but you never answered.

548
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:44,469
You should've called until we picked up.

549
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,500
You didn't answer once for three months.

550
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,639
You never once picked up.

551
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,679
But you answered when we called to tell you that he passed away.

552
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,719
- Why? For the insurance money? - My gosh.

553
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:03,750
Who is he?

554
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,018
He leads the volunteer team at the hospital.

555
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:08,190
He was closest to your father.

556

No matter the circumstances,

560
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:38,420
you should never be shameless, you fools.

561
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,519
Who were the ones that were by his side until his final moments?

562
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,360
That's rich coming from you. Have some shame.

That watch. Hey, isn't it Dad's?

564
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:51,899
My gosh. I understand that he's dead now,

565
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,968
but how dare you take his watch?

566
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:55,299
And all things aside, how could you...

567
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,210
let him leave the hospice when he was barely breathing?

568
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,780
I never liked that hospice hospital to begin with.

569
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,249
You should've treated him until the end. How could you give up?

570
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,920
- Exactly! - People will speak ill of us.

571
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,289
I guess you have to put the blame on us...

572
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,889
to free yourselves from the guilt of being terrible children.

- What's your deal? - Hey, let go.

575

- Hey! What is your problem? - I can't believe this.

You.

577
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,340
Your father said this to me.

578
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:29,769
"You can't choose when you're born,"

579
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:32,239
"so be it."

580
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,610
"But I want to choose when I die."

581
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,780
This watch.

582
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:43,789
He gave it to me and said his time was now over.

583
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,590
He said...

584
00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:51,389
it was my time from now on.

00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:42,308
- I'm back. - Mr. Kang!

670
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:45,149
My gosh. Where have you been? You didn't even call us once.

671
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,209
We were worried.

672
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,380
Right, is your leg okay?

673
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:49,789
Yes.

674
00:50:50,449 --> 00:50:52,948
I'll have to keep the cast on for the time being.

675
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,960
See? My goodness.

676
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:58,889
Where are we going to find someone who can drive?

677
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,239
Case Number 2021-GY0819.

678
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,570
Violation of the Road Traffic Act.

679
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:13,479
Causing an accident that injured three people including Mr. Kang.

680
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,749
Ergo, Mr. Yoon Gyeo Rye shall be fined 5,000 dollars.

681
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,079
Look, Mr. Attorney.

682
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,650
This is not fair. It's not like I did it on purpose.

683
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,288
This is too much.

684
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:26,420
Please.

685
00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:29,219
Do you want to go back to jail for contempt of court?

686
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:31,428
Darn it.

687
00:51:31,429 --> 00:51:32,760
(Judge)

688
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:35,760
If Mr. Yoon is not financially able to pay the fine,

689
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,829
he may work off the fine with community service.

690
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:41,599
Hey, Mr. Attorney.

691
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:44,968
Let's make sure we're on the same page. I admit everything,

692
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:48,840
but I cannot pay the fine.

693
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,550
I have a lot of money!

694
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,479
Seriously, I'm loaded.

695
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,219
I swear, I can afford to pay it. But the thing is...

696
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,619
I refuse to give money to the government.

697
00:51:58,389 --> 00:52:02,059
Why should I pay a fine when the government has done nothing for me?

698
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:04,130
Hey, mister. I refuse to pay the fine!

699
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:22,039
His name is Yoon Gyeo Rye. He's my friend.

700
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,578
We were supposed to meet up here today, but he's not picking up.

701
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:25,710
Hello.

702
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:38,530
Darn it, Sonny...

703
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,730
Gosh.

704
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:47,469
Hello, sir.

705
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,268
Hey, Sonny. What's wrong?

706
00:53:18,269 --> 00:53:19,699
Are you okay? Are you not feeling well?

707
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:22,900
Gosh, what is the matter with you? This is nuts.

708
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:38,289
Doors are closing.

709
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,760
Hey, let's go this way.

710
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,440
Go all the way to the end.

711
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:08,079
Hello.

712
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,690
Shoot.

713
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:16,690
Darn it!

714
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,780
Hey, Jin Gu!

715
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:40,849
(Animal Hospital)

716
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,079
I brought Sonny.

717
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:53,059
Here.

718
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:05,369
Isn't he heavy?

719
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:08,340
He's as light as a feather.

720
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,909
It looks like he's been through a lot.

721
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:13,250
I suggest you just let him go.

722
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,949
Okay?

723
00:55:17,219 --> 00:55:18,819
It's a sin to keep him alive...

724
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,789
knowing how much pain he is in just to fulfill your greed.

725
00:55:26,929 --> 00:55:28,199
He must be in a lot of pain now.

726
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,429
Gosh...

727
00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:47,619
Darn it.

728
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,860
Okay, yes.

729
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:00,699
So you've made up your mind, right?

730
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,039
Okay, you made the right decision.

731
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,380
Sonny, let's go.

732
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,349
Come here.

733
00:56:18,949 --> 00:56:20,380
Come here. Good boy.

734
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:22,119
Oh, no.

735
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:29,360
What is it?

736
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:34,429
Hey, you have to go now.

737
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,340
Why? Do you want to live a little longer?

738
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,210
You weren't like this at the beach. Do you not like the hospital?

739
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:56,179
Hey, not today.

740
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,819
Hey, he must be in a lot of pain now...

741
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,949
Hey! What do you even know?

742
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,459
You have no idea.

743
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,630
Maybe he wants to live a few more days.

744
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:05,329
I mean...

745
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:09,300
He might want to live a bit longer even if he's in a lot of pain.

746
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:13,399
And who knows? There could be things he wants to do before he dies.

747
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,469
I'm off.

748
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:39,928
(Western District Court)

749
00:57:39,929 --> 00:57:41,429
(Notice of Fine)

750
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:47,940
Darn, seriously...

751
00:57:52,909 --> 00:57:54,279
(You may complete community service at Woori Hospice Hospital...)

752

(in lieu of paying the fine.)

753
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,210
What is "hospice"?

754
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,119

(of terminally ill patients and attending...)

757

(to their emotional needs at the end of life.)

758
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:28,639
It's a sin to keep him alive...

759
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:32,009
knowing how much pain he is in just to fulfill your greed.

760
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,280
He must be in a lot of pain now.

761
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,319
(Hospice care focuses on the quality of life...)

(for the terminally ill and their caregivers.)

763
00:58:49,929 --> 00:58:51,300
Mr. Kang!

764
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:53,469
Someone will be here to do community service.

765
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:55,900
Oh, really?

766
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,039
It must've been decided then.

767
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,179
You knew about it?

768
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,250
Well...

769
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,849
- Oh, sir. - Yes?

770
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:11,550
Hello.

771
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:15,690
I requested it.

772
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:18,429
I see. That's great.

773
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:20,659
This person must be a good driver, right?

774
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:23,428
Well, I guess that would depend...

775
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:25,299
on how you define "good".

776
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,329
We'll wait and see...

777
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,000
I'm sure he'll be fine.

778
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:41,679
If the pain becomes unbearable, please let us know.

779
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:43,219
We'll give you an analgesic injection.

780
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,559
Oh, right. Sir.

781
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:52,259
Your wife is buying you a cool new outfit with her chit fund.

782
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,960
She'll be here later today.

783
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,360
Just wait a couple of hours.

784
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:59,130
Someone is coming here today to do community service.

785
00:59:59,369 --> 01:00:01,599
- Really? - Oh, that's great.

786
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:03,808
I wonder if it's a guy.

787
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:05,768
You heard him say it was for community service.

788
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:06,980
She may be desperate, but...

789
01:00:07,579 --> 01:00:08,639
Me?

790
01:00:09,809 --> 01:00:12,649
Come on. I'm not that desperate.

791
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,650
That's right. There's Dr. Yang.

792
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:18,149
I think Dr. Yang has a crush on you.

793
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:19,819
- What? Really? - Yes.

794
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,920
My gosh! That's so great!

795
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,788
- He comes from a family of doctors. - Is that right?

796
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,159
He's an elite doctor who is a gentleman.

797
01:00:32,869 --> 01:00:35,070
My gosh, you couldn't be more wrong.

798
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:37,969
You really can't read the room, can you?

799
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:41,638
Dr. Yang can't stand me.

800
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:44,210
He thinks I'm a troublemaker who always does useless things.

801
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:47,779
Dr. Yang has a crush on me? Oh, please.

802
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:48,949
That was hilarious.

803
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:53,590
Oh, dear. She sure can't take hints.

804
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,090
She's a nice girl though.

805

(Cathedral, Annex, Retreat House)

806
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,210
This punk...

807
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:29,558
He's not here yet, right?

808
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:31,988
Sunny. Why are you here already? What about school?

809
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:33,260
I left early today.

810
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,629
I had to be here on this historic day.

811
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,329
You little... I can't believe you left school early.

812

(Hospital Entrance)

813
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:43,199
What time is it now?

814
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:45,440
It's 4:30pm.

815
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,440
Wasn't he supposed to arrive by 2pm?

816
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:51,948
Goodness. What a slacker.

817
01:01:51,949 --> 01:01:53,650
I guess he's not coming today. Let's go inside.

818
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:55,320
We should have some coffee.

819
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:58,219
My goodness.

820
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:14,199
Goodness. It's in the middle of nowhere.

821
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,309
Are we sure he's here to do community service?

822
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:20,739
What's with those snake eyes? He looks like Medusa.

823
01:02:21,139 --> 01:02:22,280
Be quiet.

824
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,550
You must not judge people based on their looks.

825
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:29,320
All I know and can see is how he looks.

826
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:31,750
Hey!

827
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,559
You are that jerk.

828
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,460
Are you here to do community service?

829
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,429
That's right.

830
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:45,630

(If You Wish Upon Me)

832
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:23,739
Will it be possible?

833
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:27,809
Have you lost your mind? Come out at once!

01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,110
Some families live together but don't talk to each other at all.

835
01:03:32,449 --> 01:03:35,078
- Why do you live? - I wanted to die. Who saved me?

836
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:36,420
It was you!

837
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:40,150
Why did you have to be here?

838
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,359
Today, either I leave,

839
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,429
or you leave!

840
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:47,260
I didn't choose this. What should I do?

841
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:50,300
What happened, all of a sudden?
