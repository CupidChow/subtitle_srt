7
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,770
Help me.

8
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:23,519
Help me.

9
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,829
Please save my grandmother.

10
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,729
- Hey, Ho Yeon! - What?

11
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,870
I told you not to walk around alone.

12
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,609
Who are you, mister?

13
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,540
What? Me?

14
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,709
Come here. Let's go.

15
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,180
I told you not to talk to strangers.

16
00:01:58,189 --> 00:01:59,260
Gosh.

17
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,560
Excuse me.

18
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:34,759
Hey.

(Episode 12)

21
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,859
Oh, do you know where Nurse Seo is?

22
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,929
She's very busy.

23
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,968
We'll be really busy starting today.

24
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:17,300
The head nurse is on vacation.

25
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:19,038
By the way, I heard Nurse Seo...

26
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,538
used up her vacation days to go to Mokpo.

27
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,038
I know that it was for a good cause,

28
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,038
- but she has no work-life balance. - Wait.

29
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,979
- She's really something! - Wait, Nurse Seo...

30
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,750
Hello.

31
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:32,379
Oh, there she is.

32
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,749
If the pain continues, please let me know.

33
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,750
Hey.

34
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,258
Let's see. The injection doesn't hurt, right?

35
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,389
Seo Yeon Joo.

36
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:46,699
I'll check back in a moment.

37
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:53,270
- Hey, I need to talk to you. - Okay, what's up?

38
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,978
- That room on the fourth floor. - Right, you started yesterday.

39
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:59,180
I'm so busy right now. Thanks so much for taking care of that.

40
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,609
- No, it's... - Right, I have to go.

41
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,580
No, that room on the fourth floor...

42
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,718
Gosh. Why is she so busy today?

43
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,020
- Darn it! I have to tell her. - Where are you going?

44
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:12,918
- Where do you think you're going? - Go away.

45
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,860
Come on. Let's go see Grandma.

46
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,459
Sorry.

47
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,860
Their grandmother in Room 102 was admitted when you were in Mokpo.

48
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,370
I see.

49
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:23,870
But the thing is, I was told...

50
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,040
that their grandma is raising them because their parents died.

51
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,579
So when their grandma dies,

52
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:34,610
they'll probably be sent to an orphanage, right?

53
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,479
Why? Do they not have any relatives?

54
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,680
I'm not sure.

55
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,120
But these days, people don't even want kids.

56
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:46,490
Who'd want to raise someone else's children? Two kids at that.

57
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,559
- What? - You brat. You're talking like...

58
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,670
you've been through it all in front of these elders.

59
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,829
Do you think this is right?

60
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,839
Well, I guess time will tell.

61
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,069
My goodness.

62
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,910
I have to say, you can draw so well.

63
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,949
When you're self-taught and can let your hand...

64
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,649
and heart guide you, the drawing looks so much better.

65
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,019
My, it's so good.

66
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,850
I'm not self-taught.

67
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,319
I took art classes.

68
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,389
I paid for them.

69
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,430
Oh, hello.

70
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:34,870
- Hey, Gyeo Rye. - Yes?

71
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,610
When you're done,

72
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,810
can we go for coffee?

73
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,980
Help me.

74
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,689
What's with that look?

75
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,620
It's nothing. Sure, I'll see you in a bit.

76
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,360
All right. See you.

77
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,328
What did you do?

78
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,540
Did you steal some dried persimmons Mr. Kang had stashed away?

79
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,470
Why dried persimmons?

80
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,410
You could've said macarons or croffles.

81
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,179
Stop hanging out with the ladies here. Go out...

82
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,379
and play with your friends.

83
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,079
You know that I have no friends.

84
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,088
Stop isolating yourself.

85
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,148
You even have a boyfriend.

86
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,119
Go on dates with your boyfriend.

87
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,818
Aren't you Gen MZ? What's with you?

88
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,529
- You're talking like an old man! - I am an old man.

89
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,069
Gosh...

90
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,649
(Ha Jun Kyung)

91
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,120
Wake up.

92
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,029
For one last time, I need to check and see...

93
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,730
if you really meant it or not.

94
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,129
I may have to rot in prison for the rest of my life.

95
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,579
I really meant it.

96
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,980
So you really want me...

97
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,620
to kill you and Gyeo Rye?

98
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,990
Yes.

99
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,589
So far, I've managed to get away with the things I did in the past.

100
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,000
But this is different. It'll all be over.

101
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:41,999
The fact that it's still not over yet...

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,069
sounds more surreal to me.

103
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:53,579
Do you really not want...

104
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,609
to see a psychiatrist?

105
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,620
A psychiatrist?

106
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,990
No, I don't want to.

107
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,388
If I saw a psychiatrist and took medications and stuff,

108
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:06,519
I'd have to live more.

109
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:15,569
Thanks.

110
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,040
In the past and even now.

111
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:23,370
To Gyeo Rye, you were always a jerk.

112
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,040
But to me, you were like a big brother from time to time.

113
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,120
I hope...

114
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:39,159
you live to 100.

115
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,879
You know...

116
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:44,460
That room at the end of the hallway on the fourth floor.

117
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,960
Right, Room 403.

118
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,830
In that room...

119
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,070
There's a ton of medical equipment in that room.

120
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,970
I had to clean the room recently.

121
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,440
I was curious about that room for no reason.

122
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:05,538
You don't need to worry about that room anymore.

123
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:06,610
All right.

124
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:12,219
Anyway, did you need to talk to me about something important?

125
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,249
You even put out these dried persimmons.

126
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,519
Aren't you leaving tomorrow?

127
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Here.

128
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,129
What's this?

129
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,428
(Hogeweyk, Netherlands)

130
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:27,970
It's a village in the Netherlands called Hogeweyk.

131
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,599
The Netherlands? Hogeweyk...

132
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
(The Hogeweyk Dementia Village)

133
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,240
"Dementia Village?"

134
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,268
That's right.

135
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,679
(The Hogeweyk Dementia Village)

136
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,490
In that village, 170 staff members take care of the patients all day,

137
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,490
wearing casual clothes instead of uniforms.

138
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:58,230
And there are 140 volunteers who assist them.

139
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,898
There are twice as many staff members as patients,

140
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:04,600
and they all live together in the village.

141
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,839
The support staff play roles such as a grocery store clerk, hairstylist,

142
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,210
bus driver, and so on.

143
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:17,049
There are no price tags on the goods sold at the stores,

144
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,149
so the patients can buy things like bread without having to pay.

145
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,320
They can draw,

146
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:25,759
dance at a club, and enjoy a wide variety of hobbies,

147
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,129
so they do not feel like they're hospitalized.

148
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,500
The patients are very satisfied with everything there,

149
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,740
which helps slow down the progression of their dementia.

150
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,370
Well, it sounds like a nice place.

151
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:43,840
But what about it?

152
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,179
It's about Ms. Choi.

153
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,480
I want to send her there.

154
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,179
It's Mr. Hwang's wish.

155
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:55,250
Her dementia is getting worse by the day.

156
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,490
What are you talking about?

157
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,490
- Ms. Choi has dementia? - Yes.

158
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,128
You couldn't have known unless you had known her for a long time.

159
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:12,268
Her memories are slowly being erased, little by little.

160
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:14,610
My gosh. I can't believe this.

161
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,240
This is nuts.

162
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,809
While I'm gone,

163
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,509
find out if Koreans can be admitted to the village too.

164
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,979
Also, find out how much it'd cost to live there...

165
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,779
and how much the flight will be.

166
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:28,289
First class, of course.

167
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,418
Oh, you're finally going to dig up those gold bars you stashed away?

168
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:32,419
I should.

169
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:34,690
It's not like I can take them when I die.

170
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:39,199
Okay.

171
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,600
Well, don't think about anything.

172
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,639
Put all your worries to rest.

173
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,909
Just focus on your treatment, okay?

174
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,969
Be optimistic.

175
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,739
Keep telling yourself that you can be cured.

176
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,080
Okay, I heard you. I'll be fine, you punk.

177
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,178
I want to leave quietly tomorrow morning.

178
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:00,120
If you don't see me, just know that I've left.

179
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,119
Don't make a fuss. Just let the elders know.

180
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,189
I told you that I'd take you there.

181
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,628
I want to go alone. I'll feel more comfortable that way, you punk.

182
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,929
Gosh, you're so stubborn.

183
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,000
Fine. Do whatever you want.

184
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,669
- One more thing. - What now?

185
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,600
While I'm gone,

186
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,279
take Yeon Joo out on just three more dates.

187
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,120
I told you not to waste your energy worrying about stupid things.

188
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,250
Why worry about our dates?

189
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,750
What's with you?

190
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,759
My goodness. So you'll take her out on a date, right?

191
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,620
Mr. Kang!

192
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,299
Gosh.

193
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,269
Darn it. Seriously?

194
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,980
(Jooyoung Hospital)

195
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,979
My gosh. Why does it feel so empty here today?

196
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,980
Is it because Mr. Kang isn't here?

197
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,759
- What's wrong with this? - Why won't it come out?

198
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,759
Is it stuck? This is...

199
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:23,730
Hey, what are you doing?

200
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:25,158
It won't come out.

201
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,460
It won't come out? Move aside.

202
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,399
Let's see. Which one? This one here?

203
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,970
- Yes. - Okay. Watch.

204
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,110
What just happened? It came out, right?

205
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:43,610
- Here. - Thank you.

206
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:46,279
You thanked me. Okay, then one more.

207
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,090
Which one? This one?

208
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,960
Here. Coffee.

209
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,229
That's so cool.

210
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,600
Right? I'm so cool.

211
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,899
I'm good. I can't drink coffee.

212
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,538
Really? Okay.

213
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:07,638
- Come here. - Why don't you start drinking it?

214
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,639
Thank you.

215
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:11,879
Hey, there's nothing cool about him.

216
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,320
Oh, about Mr. Kang...

217
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,220
He left in the morning to start his chemotherapy.

218
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:29,158
Gosh, that stubborn man.

219
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,359
He insisted on going alone.

220
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,500
He told me not to tell anyone, so I couldn't tell you.

221
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,500
Mr. Kang!

222
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,370
My gosh.

223
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,199
Ms. Yeom.

224
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,870
You asked me to pretend not to know about it,

225
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:46,379
so I was just going to let you go quietly, but...

226
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,190
You know,

227
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,590
I promise you that I'll come back, looking healthy and happy.

228
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:07,700
You have to come back, okay?

229
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,839
And about the room on the fourth floor...

230
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,609
Oh, Nurse Seo told me everything.

231
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,880
You have to look after Ms. Choi,

232
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,380
and Mr. Kang isn't here,

233
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:30,419
so I'll check and clean the room for the time being.

234
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,819
You don't need to worry about it.

235
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,259
That's great.

236
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,190
I was worried...

237
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,099
because Duk Ja's condition keeps getting worse.

238
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,130
I had a lot on my mind.

239
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,799
By the way,

240
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,569
the man in that room.

241
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,069
You're sure he's been unconscious this whole time, right?

242
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,210
Yes.

243
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,308
He's nothing but trouble,

244
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:56,549
whether he remains unconscious or wakes up.

245
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,318
You must've heard...

246
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,848
about how he harassed Mr. Kang...

247
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:02,890
and made him suffer for years.

248
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,890
He even caused a scene at the hospital a few times.

249
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,690
He is a scumbag.

250
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,730
He's a piece of garbage.

251
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,450
(Room 403)

252
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:49,970
So you did wake up that day.

253
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:52,440
You actually woke up.

254
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,410
But this is...

255
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,180
What are you doing?

256
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,650
It's cold outside.

257
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:07,779
It was cold, so I came...

258
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,049
to this place.

259
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,039
When you woke up that day... Do you remember that?

260
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,569
You don't remember?

261
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,539
Nothing at all?

262
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:34,910
You grabbed my hand.

263
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,980
You said you were sorry and asked me to spare you.

264
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,519
What did you do so wrong?

265
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,519
What?

266
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:49,359
What? What's your problem?

267
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:50,859
Why did you...

268
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,058
save me?

269
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,799
What are you talking about? I didn't save you.

270
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:00,798
Nurse Seo and the elders here saved you...

271
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,440
when you were on the verge of death.

272
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,279
You called me an evil scumbag...

273
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,109
and said I should be hung out to dry so I'd just die.

274
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,079
What? You heard everything?

275
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,690
Hey, do you remember everything?

276
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,449
Do you remember now?

277
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,119
I remembered after hearing what you said.

278
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,190
Is there anything else you remember?

279
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,359
How about Kang Tae Sik?

280
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:31,599
Do you remember him? You made him suffer badly.

281
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,970
Not sure.

282
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,509
But I suppose my memories of him will come back,

283
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,410
eventually.

284
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,980
No funny business.

285
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,990
Stay put.

286
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,589
I'm watching you.

287
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:02,799
Gosh, what should I do?

288
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,170
It'd be best if I sort it out on my end.

289
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,240
Hold on.

290
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,779
I've got you.

291
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,279
Oh, man. How refreshing.

292
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,349
It sure is refreshing.

293
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:25,589
Hey.

294
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,088
What's so refreshing? What do you think you're doing?

295
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:31,229
I was just... Sorry.

296
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,829
It said this was a bathhouse.

297
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,098
- No, it's okay. Keep bathing. - Okay.

298
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:42,339
And this isn't a bathhouse but a bathroom.

299
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,838
- Repeat after me. Bathroom. - "Bathroom."

300
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:45,940
Good.

301
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,480
There aren't any baths...

302
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,819
scheduled on Thursdays,

303
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,319
so go ahead. Have fun.

304
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:57,288
- Mister. - Yes?

305
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:58,788
Are you the boss of this place?

306
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:02,328
That's going too far. I'm the captain.

307
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,058
The little captain.

308
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:07,328
I see. Thank you, Boss.

309
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:08,700
I said captain.

310
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,470
By the way, where did you learn to say,

311
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,999
"That hits it?"

312
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,839
When I went to the bathhouse with my dad long ago,

313
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,779
the other men said it.

314
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:23,250
"Oh, that hits it."

315
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,980
- You did? - Yes.

316
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,049
So does it hit the spot right now?

317
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,450
Hey!

318
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,489
You scared me.

319
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,689
Mister. What do you think you're doing to my brother?

320
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,690
What did I do?

321
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:37,058
You can't let him roam around like this.

322
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,599
I searched for him for ages.

323
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,629
When did I let him roam around?

324
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,999
He was here all alone saying, "That hits it."

325
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,568
So I just joined the party.

326
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:46,639
How would he know "that hits it?"

327
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,268
- Hey. - I had fun. Boss.

328
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,980
- Let's go. - What? Hey.

329
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,009
He's no boss. Hurry.

330
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:58,819
Hey! Put on your clothes first, or you'll catch a cold.

331
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,329
Gosh. What's going on with her?

332
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,299
Hold on.

333
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,299
She's sleeping while walking. Goodness.

334
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,339
What?

335
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,139
- Hey. - Oh, hi.

336
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,768
Hi. Get in. I'll drive you home.

337
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:24,909
And I have something to tell you.

338
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,479
What? No, it's okay. Rest.

339
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,179
I only need to walk to the bus station.

340
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,349
Just get in the car.

341
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,049
- You look dead tired. - Gosh.

342
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,519
My two legs are working fine.

343
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,990
And I, Seo Yeon Joo, am strong as steel.

344
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,069
What the heck? She's sleeping like a baby.

345
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,769
Oh, man.

346
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,170
Hey. I have something to say.

347
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,819
Say that the man in the last room on the fourth floor wakes up.

348
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,220
- Yes? - Then...

349
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:10,618
If the man in the last room on the fourth floor wakes up,

350
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:11,960
tell me at once.

351
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,960
- What? - He's a very dangerous man.

352
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:19,500
You must tell me when he wakes up. Only then can I...

353
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,599
settle things.

354
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,269
Mr. Kang.

355
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,349
I need to protect my dad.

356
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,549
I, Seo Yeon Joo, need to protect Yoon Gyeo Rye too.

357
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:46,519
What? Then I was the only one who couldn't see him off.

358
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,930
So why didn't you wake up early?

359
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,190
Gosh.

360
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,959
But Mr. Kang told me...

361
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,129
not to see him off no matter what.

362
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,900
We didn't see him off either.

363
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,799
We were doing our own things.

364
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:11,380
(EMS Emergency Ambulance Service)

365
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,069
Goodness. For real?

366
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,400
I'll travel safely.

367
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:41,539
You're all so cheap. Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

368
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:45,149
Seriously. I feel betrayed.

369
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,349
What? You're hungry?

370
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,289
Are you?

371
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,390
No, I feel betrayed.

372
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,258
This is bad. Hold on a second.

373
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:54,789
Well, how about it?

374
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,460
Would you like some ramyeon?

375
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,930
Ramyeon?

376
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:09,569
The car's dirty. Get up.

377
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,319
For goodness' sake, what is this?

378
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,420
I can't drink because of my car, yet you're drinking all you want.

379
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:25,089
And I thought...

380
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:29,730
you'd cook ramyeon for me at your house.

381
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:34,200
You know, I'm...

382
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:37,170
- not going to call Mr. Kang. - Okay.

383
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,799
I will not.

384
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:40,670
If I do,

385
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:43,539
I...

386
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,140
might cry.

387
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,650
Once I hear his voice,

388
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,680
I'm definitely going to cry.

389
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:56,289
And that's going to make Mr. Kang upset.

390
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,619
It won't do him any good.

391
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,960
So...

392
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,700
I'm going to wait and not call him.

393
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,339
Goodness.

394
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,740
I didn't know you two were close enough to cry.

395
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,608
- Here. Stop crying. - I...

396
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:21,980
- It's just... - Stop crying. Come on.

397
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:25,348
Stop. It's not as if someone passed away.

398
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:26,979
Stop crying. It's okay.

399
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,250
Listen.

400
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,319
Chemotherapy...

401
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,130
is much more painful than you think.

402
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,730
People who haven't experienced it wouldn't know.

403
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,759
Stop. It's okay.

404
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,700
My mom...

405
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,700
and Ms. Yeom's daughter...

406
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,209
said they would rather die. It's that painful.

407
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,710
Got it?

408
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,210
But...

409
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,450
I bet he's waiting.

410
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,589
The only daughter he has is me.

411
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,819
So I think he's waiting for my call.

412
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,430
It's okay.

413
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,029
Don't worry. Mr. Kang's a strong person.

414
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,828
He'll endure it well.

415
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:17,329
He liked ramyeon.

416
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:22,769
Mr. Kang liked ramyeon.

417
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,130
Goodness. It's cold inside here.

418
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,170
How did he live here for years?

419
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,140
No wonder his cancer relapsed.

420
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:07,420
Mr. Kang.

421
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,960
Your daughter is having a really hard time.

422
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,190
So I'm going to take a part of that burden...

423
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,829
one way or the other.

424
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,740
(Name: Kang Tae Sik)

425
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,150
(Injection Room)

426
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:02,509
Excuse me. Can you hear my voice?

427
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,240
There doesn't seem to be any major abnormality.

428
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,450
He's not waking up on purpose, is he?

429
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,079
Does he have a reason to?

430
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,348
Isn't he waiting to grab Mr. Kang by the collar...

431
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:16,089
the moment he comes around?

432
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,150
So he has no reason to do that.

433
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,259
You're right.

434
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,529
(Room 403)

435
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,069
Mister.

436
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,799
What funny tricks are you pulling?

437
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,309
Why are you pretending you're still in a coma?

438
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,539
I remembered.

439
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,710
You did?

440
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:17,450
Did you remember what you did to Mr. Kang?

441
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,380
And what kind of a trashy life you lived?

442
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,190
A son.

443
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,519
I had one.

444
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,089
I can still remember...

445
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:31,758
crying in joy when he was born.

446
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,299
So what? I never asked about your family.

447
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:37,768
Apologize to others properly...

448
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:39,599
and leave this place quickly.

449
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,640
Until I remember everything,

450
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:47,440
can you keep it a secret that I woke up?

451
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,549
Please.

452
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,779
And...

453
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:54,549
once I remember everything,

454
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,460
I will...

455
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:02,660
correct...

456
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,500
my mistakes myself.

457
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,069
Mister.

458
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:18,170
You know, I...

459
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:23,049
don't trust anyone who smiles at me.

460
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:28,480
But since you promised to apologize,

461
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,750
do it sincerely once you recall everything.

462
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,890
Then leave quietly.

463
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,829
Don't try to pull any funny tricks. Got it?

464
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,529
I'll be watching you.

465
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,900
Hey.

466
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:46,369
Can I...

467
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:49,509
ask you another favour?

468
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,319
Please forgive me for my sins.

469
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:19,568
In the end, I was the only one who couldn't see you off.

470
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:21,339
Everyone else did.

471
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:23,369
That's not true.

472
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,609
They always wake up early, so I left early on purpose.

473
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,379
Even so, you broke my heart by leaving me out.

474
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,118
I'm the only one who had no idea.

475
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,450
Gosh, I'm sorry.

476
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,990
Hey.

477
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,519
Is everything okay at the hospital?

478
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,699
What could go wrong here? They've got me.

479
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,399
Don't worry, will you?

480
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,630
Life is the same everywhere you go.

481
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,670
Are you okay?

482
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:56,539
Mr. Kang. Answer me.

483
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:02,349
That's why I'm telling you...

484
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,108
not to skip any meals. Okay?

485
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,119
Okay, I'm hanging up.

486
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,570
Hey. I have a question.

487
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,940
Well, I saw this on the TV.

488
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,110
A person...

489
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:10,979
came back to life...

490
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,750
after they got into a car accident.

491
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,089
But they lost their memory, and their personality...

492
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:20,158
changed completely.

493
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,360
Is that really possible?

494
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:24,730
I think I heard it in a class in college...

495
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,529
that a penetrating wound on the conduction lobe...

496
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,699
changed a person's personality.

497
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,000
So it is possible.

498
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,039
Mr. Yoon.

499
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,650
Nurse Seo.

500
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,280
Be good to her.

501
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,650
Her bigger brother's muscles...

502
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,889
You've seen them, right?

503
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,150
Jae Yeon.

504
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,320
What?

505
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,489
Why is Grandma sleeping for so long?

506
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,288
She usually sleeps really little.

507
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:27,989
It's because she's tired.

508
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,130
Raising us has left her exhausted.

509
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,260
When will she wake up?

510
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,130
I don't know.

511
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:40,300
So we need to wait quietly without causing any trouble.

512
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,069
Don't wander off, okay?

513
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,509
I'm seven years old.

514
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,308
How can a seven-year-old sit still from morning till night?

515
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:49,009
Play games on Grandma's phone.

516
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,848
How can I do that all day long?

517
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:52,780
Then what am I supposed to do?

518
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,090
I don't know either, okay?

519
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:13,139
Are we going to be sent to an orphanage?

520
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,469
What?

521
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:18,170
We only have Grandma.

522
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,610
But if she keeps sleeping like that...

523
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,329
Keep playing games.

524
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:42,199
I'm going to use the toilet.

525
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,630
Okay.

526
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:21,369
(Sonny, I will never forget you.)

527
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:35,849
(Sonny, I will never forget you.)

528
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,190
Cute, isn't he?

529
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:50,969
He's my Sonny.

530
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,869
- Sonny? - Yes.

531
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,409
You must miss Sonny a lot too.

532
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:08,150
Of course, I do. I miss him every day.

533
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,059
(Sonny, I will never forget you.)

534
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,690
By the way, have you eaten?

535
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:37,579
Dig in.

536
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:44,519
Go ahead and eat.

537
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,260
How is it? Good, right?

538
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
Great.

539
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,239
Why are you nibbling at it? I poured my effort into it.

540
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,769
So dig into it now.

541
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,869
Mix it well and take big bites.

542
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,380
Is it good?

543
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:16,449
You two must have a really good relationship.

544
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,488
I'm on bad terms with my sister.

545
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:22,219
We are too.

546
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,559
Jae Yeon nags at me every day.

547
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,929
Hey, that's all out of love.

548
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:29,669
No, it isn't. He's nothing but trouble.

549
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,999
Stop lying. I know you like him and do not find him troublesome.

550
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,268
- That's not true. - That's not true.

551
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:36,709
See that? You two are on the same wavelength.

552
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,339
- Hurry up and eat. - Okay.

553
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,510
Enjoy it.

554
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,980
Ready, go!

555
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,460
I think we need to go to an orphanage.

556
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:04,530
We're left with no one once Grandma passes away.

557
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,869
Hey.

558
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:12,010
Do you have anything you want to do for your grandma?

559
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,980
Anything I want to do for her?

560
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,110
Yes. Go and ask your grandma...

561
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,079
if she has any wishes.

562
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,419
Why?

563
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,750
That's what I do. I grant wishes.

564
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:26,019
With Team Genie.

565
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:32,429
- I'll ask when she wakes up. - Okay.

566
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,530
And thank you for the spaghetti.

567
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,170
It was really good.

568
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:40,400
The octopus-shaped sausages were cute too.

569
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,610
It's not an octopus. It's a flower.

570
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:48,239
A flower? It's not a flower. It's an octopus.

571
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,579
You can leave now. Go.

572
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,589
The number you have dialled...

573
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,760
Why isn't she picking up?

574
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:09,300
(Women's Restroom)

575
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,299
Hello.

576
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,269
Is someone inside?

577
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:16,340
No, no one was inside.

578
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,420
You scared me.

579
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:32,518
- What are you doing here? - What?

580
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:35,519
Why are you drinking coffee here?

581
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,059
I always drink coffee here. What are you talking about?

582
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,199
Since last week,

583
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:44,869
the hospital made a lounge...

584
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:47,940
for you to enjoy coffee.

585
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,269
Did you forget?

586
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,739
They didn't...

587
00:42:55,179 --> 00:42:58,449
have to do that.

588
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,079
I prefer it here.

589
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,619
Oh, my.

590
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:11,260
Give it to me. Let me do it.

591
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
Why would you do it?

592
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,170
By the way,

593
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,739
what are you doing here?

594
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:25,980
You should look after Mother in the hospital.

595
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,780
I'll do it.

596
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,920
Leave it.

597
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,619
Don't let someone else do my job.

598
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:43,289
That's my principle as an expert janitor.

599
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:49,730
Just look after your mother.

600
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:53,039
I'm okay.

601
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,349
Do you have a boyfriend?

602
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,479
I told you already.

603
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,189
- What did you tell me? - Let me go.

604
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,420
Give me your number.

605
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,389
Stop it.

606
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,919
You have nice hands.

607
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,428
- What are you doing? - Do you want to get...

608
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:19,229
- Let me go please. - something delicious with me?

609
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,428
Come on.

610
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:23,730
I'm just having a good day today.

611
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:29,369
My goodness.

612
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,210
Is he dead?

613
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:32,939
Is he dead?

614
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,940
If he is, it's a success.

615
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,280
What?

616
00:44:37,949 --> 00:44:39,308
I was just practicing.

617
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,750
Why did he hit him?

618
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,590
My goodness.

619
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,389
Where's my phone?

620
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:51,889
I thought my wife took my son.

621
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:55,599
But now that I think about it, she didn't.

622
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,429
I don't know...

623
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,769
if I abandoned him...

624
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:02,969
or lost him.

625
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,510
Did you try to look for him?

626
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,449
A million times.

627
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,179
I went to every orphanage.

628
00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:19,250
Do you still miss your son?

629
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:22,289
Of course.

630
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,260
Instead of Mr. Kang,

631
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:31,429
you'll have to apologize to your son first.

632
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,769
Only if I can meet him,

633
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,039
I'll ask for his forgiveness.

634
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,579
I'm still...

635
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,280
his father.

636
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,179
He'd forgive me.

637
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,960
If I apologize sincerely,

638
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,090
the Lord would forgive me too.

639
00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:01,329
Sure. Keep praying.

640
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,199
And get your memory back.

641
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:06,840
And leave this place as soon as possible.

642
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:08,900
You...

643
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:12,340
don't...

644
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:17,579
belong here.

645
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,519
Okay.

646
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:25,949
I'm sorry.

647
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,328
Gosh.

648
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:36,058
Don't miss every corner.

649
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,670
Okay. I'm working on it.

650
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,369
It's so dusty.

651
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:45,510
What are you doing in here?

652
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,038
- We're volunteering. - Volunteering.

653
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,710
Who made you volunteer?

654
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,980
I did.

655
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:55,319
He said if we work hard, he'll let us join his team.

656
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,419
Team Aladdin.

657
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,690
No, Team Genie. The avengers of wishes.

658
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,558
Stop the nonsense.

659
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:03,089
Now, start cleaning. Go.

660
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:04,530
Okay.

661
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,599
That's right. There's dust.

662
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,130
Clean under the couch.

663
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:13,499
If you want to join my team,

664
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,599
you must be healthy and have a strong spirit. Understood?

665
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,039
Okay.

666
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:18,639
Hurry up. Faster.

667
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,840
Say hello.

668
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,379
- Hello. - Hello.

669
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,409
Hi.

670
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,808
Use them as my assistants?

671
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:27,949
Make them run errands for you.

672
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,519
But you're my assistant.

673
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:33,559
What do I call the assistant's assistant?

674
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,230
Sub assistant.

675
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,429
I like it.

676
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,399
Sub assistants. Let's remove the bean sprout roots.

677
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

678
00:47:43,401 --> 00:47:44,469
Have a seat.

679
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,769
You must...

680
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,739
do it right.

681
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,010
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

682
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:53,780
Hold the bean sprout,

683
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:57,010
and remove the root.

684
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,448
I like greens the best.

685
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:02,049
- Really? - Yes.

686
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:03,690
But you don't sound sincere.

687
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:18,300
Boss. How did I do?

688
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,510
That's great. Good job.

689
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,079
That's new.

690
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,719
Good job.

691
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,328
Here. It's cocoa.

692
00:48:43,329 --> 00:48:44,459
Thank you.

693
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,659
- You're welcome. - Thank you.

694
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:49,559
It's hot. Drink slowly.

695
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:52,570
So, did you ask Grandma her wish?

696
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:54,639
No.

697
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,709
She can't hear.

698
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,738
And she only sleeps. I couldn't ask her.

699
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:02,739
Right. Grandma usually doesn't sleep that much.

700
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:08,179
Hang on. Then...

701
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,820
shall we play the guessing game?

702
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,090
- The guessing game? - Yes.

703
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:17,558
You know her well because you lived with her for a long time.

704
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:18,729
You know what she likes...

705
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,730
and what she likes to do.

706
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,299
Mint candy. She likes mint candies.

707
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,499
- I see. - And plants.

708
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,300
She has more than 30 and 100 plants at home.

709
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,969
- Mint candies and plants? - Yes.

710
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,539
Then...

711
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,948
who wants to go to your house this Sunday?

712
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:38,909
- Me. - Me.

713
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,519
Play rock-paper-scissors.

714
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:42,579
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

715
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,989
Yes!

716
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,469
They're all dead.

717
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,210
Do you remember...

718
00:50:03,809 --> 00:50:06,110
Grandma's favourite?

719
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,219
This one. Alocasia.

720
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:15,848
And Swiss cheese plant.

721
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:17,920
And Bengal rubber tree.

722
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:21,589
But they're all dead.

723
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:24,329
Grandma will be sad.

724
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,300
Oh, right.

725
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:53,388
They're all the same colour.

726
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:54,389
Okay.

727
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:59,659
Here.

728
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:03,230
Use this colour.

729
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:06,670
This is alive.

730
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,610
- What's that? - That's lavender.

731
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,880
It symbolizes, "Answer me."

732
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,710
Are you a genius?

733
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,710
You're in good condition today.

734
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,150
Gyeo Rye. This is for you.

735
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:28,090
It's a gift.

736
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,360
- Thanks. - You're welcome.

737
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,599
Wait for me inside.

738
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,209
Don't forget to wash your hands.

739
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:45,269
- Okay. - Okay.

740
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,329
The money bag.

741
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:10,500
Where did it go?

742
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:14,670
Where is it?

743
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,480
The older one is Jae Yeon. The younger one is Ho Yeon.

744
00:52:25,449 --> 00:52:27,250
They're 11 and 7.

745
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,760
What's going on?

746
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:43,130
Who are you?

747
00:52:43,469 --> 00:52:45,070
She said she's my aunt.

748
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,639
I've never heard of one before.

749
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:52,840
(Da Hee Fried Chicken)

750
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,409
Are you really their aunt?

751
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,909
Yes.

752
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,519
Ms. Yoo Bok Rye is my grandma's sister.

753
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,719
My grandma passed away.

754
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:06,519
And it seems she'll pass away soon.

755
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,260
They need someone to look after them.

756
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:10,730
Yes.

757
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:14,659
First of all,

758
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,768
I need to talk to the staff here...

759
00:53:18,769 --> 00:53:20,670
and need to look into it.

760
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:24,169
You should leave for today and come back later.

761
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,539
Are you an employee here?

762
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,209
Yes, kind of.

763
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,780
What do you mean kind of?

764
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:32,779
He's our boss.

765
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,780
We're joining Team Genie.

766
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,788
What's Team Genie?

767
00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:38,750
You don't have to know.

768
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:41,158
We'll call you.

769
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:42,618
You should leave for today.

770
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,129
I should take them as soon as possible...

771
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,260
and provide them with a nice environment.

772
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,059
Look at them.

773
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,099
Where do you take a shower?

774
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,669
I'm happy not to take a shower.

775
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,199
What are you... You do take a shower.

776
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:58,569
Anyway, they're clean...

777
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:01,579
and well fed. Come back on another day.

778
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:04,678
I mean, can you make the flower...

779
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:07,980
Can you make them the octopus sausage pasta for every meal?

780
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,579
What are you talking about?

781
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:11,619
See? No.

782
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,960
Then come back on another day.

783
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:16,320
Give me your business card at least.

784
00:54:16,489 --> 00:54:18,659
How can I trust you with them?

785
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,499
Right now, I don't...

786
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,130
He works here.

787
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,329
He...

788
00:54:25,969 --> 00:54:28,598
deals with patients' guardians here.

789
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:31,309
Yes. I'm a captain.

790
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:34,340
So we'll give you a call later like he said.

791
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,579
Say goodbye and let's go meet Grandma.

792
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,980
- Say bye. - Bye.

793
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,550
- Let's go. - Go.

794
00:54:48,659 --> 00:54:49,960
- Let's go. - What?

795
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:51,760
- Come on. - Why?

796
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:01,738
I'm not sure about them.

797
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:04,639
Don't judge a book by its cover.

798
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:08,210
I know it from experience.

799
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,389
Ma'am.

800
00:55:28,329 --> 00:55:30,929
People who were here today.

801
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,400
Are they...

802
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:36,840
really your sister's children?

803
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:40,610
You've never seen them before, have you?

804
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:46,750
I'm worried sick.

805
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:51,150
They might...

806
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,320
abuse your grandchildren.

807
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,789
That must never happen.

808
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,329
Jae Yeon and Ho Yeon...

809
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,570
must not...

810
00:56:06,969 --> 00:56:08,300
end up like me.

811
00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:13,739
That should never happen.

812
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,280
Answer me.

813
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:35,558
That's what these flowers symbolize. "Answer me."

814
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,070
They're lavenders.

815
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,230
And these tiny flowers...

816
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,699
are very good at relieving your stress.

817
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:43,440
Thank you.

818
00:56:46,909 --> 00:56:51,380
If you're thankful, recover your memory as soon as possible.

819
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:54,119
Remember who you are.

820
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:08,030
You got a nice home.

821
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:41,900
Gosh. I said it's okay.

822
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,928
Stop interrupting me from going independent.

823
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:46,269
I can just take the bus.

824
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:04,219
Are you sleeping?

825
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:06,349
No.

826
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:08,690
No.

827
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:11,460
I'm listening.

828
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,530
What if...

829
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:19,868
my money bag disappears?

830
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:21,039
The money bag.

831
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:25,840
The money bag?

832
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:29,380
That was in this car.

833
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,980
- Did it disappear? - No.

834
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:34,948
Are you suspecting me?

835
00:58:34,949 --> 00:58:37,849
I'm not saying it disappeared. What if?

836
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:39,050
What if?

837
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,820
Gosh.

838
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:43,960
You scared me.

839
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:46,900
I thought you lost it.

840
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:48,730
Why would you worry about that?

841
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,969
The man...

842
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,698
in the last room on the fourth floor is most suspicious, right?

843
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,809
Yes.

844
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:03,110
What about the man in the last room on the fourth floor?

845
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:04,849
Is he up?

846
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:09,280
No. I'm just saying.

847
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:18,988
Anyway, if he wakes up, wake me up.

848
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:21,630
I mean,

849
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,130
let me know.

850
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,869
I must know.

851
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,579
(Room 403)

852
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,698
(First date with my son Gyeo Rye)

853
01:01:04,699 --> 01:01:06,969
First date...

854
01:01:07,469 --> 01:01:09,369
with my son Gyeo Rye.

855
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:13,309
(First date with my son Gyeo Rye)

856
01:01:36,429 --> 01:01:37,630
Hi.

857
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:53,679
(If You Wish Upon Me)

858
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,150
What are you doing here?

859
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:57,449
The day he left?

860
01:01:57,889 --> 01:01:59,289
Who are you?

861
01:01:59,489 --> 01:02:01,389
It's me.

862
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,760
Are you hiding something from me?

863
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,360
Don't you want to know my name?

864
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,599
You look like father and son.

865
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:10,730
What is she doing here?

866
01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:13,630
Who are we supposed to live with?

867
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,940
Have you met the detective?

868
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,840
I'll grant your wish.

869
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,440
Gyeo Rye.

870
01:02:21,139 --> 01:02:23,409
Don't say my name.
