(Episode 14)

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,750
Where are the kids?

9
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,109
What?

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,719
Where are the kids?

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,289
Hey, what's your problem?

12
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:48,950
You hit them, didn't you?

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,489
What are you talking about?

14
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,820
Did you hit them?

15
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:54,329
What are you doing?

16
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,299
You little...

17
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,239
Captain.

18
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,879
Gyeo Rye?

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,718
Gyeo Rye!

20
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:20,389
Hey, let me see. What happened to you guys?

21
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,590
Are you all right?

22
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,419
Are you hurt? Did they hit you?

23
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,560
Hit us? Why?

24
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:28,688
Who would hit us?

25
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,799
We're here to eat fried chicken.

26
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:34,870
Auntie said she made octopus-shaped sausages for us.

27
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,599
It's okay. You can be honest with me, okay?

28
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,339
I'm here, so you're safe now.

29
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,540
Are they being mean to you?

30
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:43,839
Let me see.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,439
Why would they be mean to us?

32
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,879
No, they're not mean to us.

33
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,079
What? Then why did you call me so many times?

34
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,420
Why did you keep calling me?

35
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,260
Because I missed you.

36
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,599
Me too. I missed you.

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,170
That's why I called you.

38
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,139
Can we only call you when something bad happens?

39
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,539
(Dahee Fried Chicken)

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,780
Gyeo Rye, where are you going?

41
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:26,050
Have some fried chicken with us!

42
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,490
(Dahee Fried Chicken)

43
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:42,469
Hey.

44
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,009
Take this.

45
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,280
I can fry up some more for the kids.

46
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:00,789
I may not be the best auntie,

47
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,590
but we didn't hit them.

48
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,620
Even the money from my great-aunt's life insurance.

49
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:09,229
I deposited the whole sum into a bank account in the kids' names.

50
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,128
We used to live in a studio apartment,

51
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:14,870
and it was too small for the four of us.

52
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,969
So at the moment, we're staying at my great-aunt's place.

53
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:19,900
We won't steal the house from them.

54
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,280
If they want us to leave, we can move out at any time.

55
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,310
You can keep checking.

56
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,650
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,719
I'm really sorry.

58
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:37,460
Don't be.

59
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,289
Thank you...

60
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,889
for looking out for them.

61
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,469
You see, I could've been mean to them.

62
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,229
But then, you'd come after me.

63
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:53,199
I kept being reminded of your threats.

64
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,479
I didn't do anything bad to them.

65
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,710
You did the right thing.

66
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,750
If it weren't for you,

67
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,150
I wouldn't be as attentive to them.

68
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,719
What you did was right.

69
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,759
Keep watching out for them.

70
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,670
For other kids too.

71
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,540
Bye.

72
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:44,989
Gyeo Rye! We can call you when we miss you, right?

73
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,420
We can call you, right?

74
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,660
Yes, feel free to call me.

75
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,000
- Okay! - Okay!

76
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,370
- Let's go inside. - Okay.

77
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,569
(Chicken)

78
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,680
You haven't eaten yet?

79
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,910
Should I make you something?

80
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,360
How did I turn out like this?

81
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,438
(Death doesn't end everything.)

82
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,680
"Death doesn't end everything."

83
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:46,639
Perhaps...

84
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,120
when I first met them,

85
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,949
I assumed they'd be bad people...

86
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,459
and kept believing it...

87
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,660
because I was so afraid that the kids would end up like me.

88
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,259
No.

89
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,300
Just like...

90
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:16,469
the young Yoon Gyeo Rye who was always alone...

91
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,379
needed Superman,

92
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,579
you just wanted to help them and keep them safe.

93
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:29,589
I really want to leave my past behind and move on already.

94
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,360
Gosh, I'm so sick of getting dragged back to my past.

95
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,959
Can I keep living like this?

96
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,600
Like I said to you a while back...

97
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,810
Life goes on, so just keep on living.

98
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,639
You're doing well.

99
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,610
You still don't seem to know that you're such a wonderful person.

100
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,350
- Me? - Yes.

101
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,949
So many people like you.

102
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,060
Who?

103
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,230
Team Genie.

104
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:09,860
Jae Yeon, Ho Yeon.

105
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,959
And everyone at the hospital.

106
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,029
And you, Seo Yeon Joo.

107
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Yes.

108
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,100
I like you the most.

109
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:15,389
(If You Wish Upon Me)

110
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,960
I want to let it happen naturally.

111
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,629
Where is she?

112
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,730
I need to sound natural too.

113
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,839
You must be swamped with work.

114
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,309
Take a quick break and drink this.

115
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,879
Perfect. I almost sound like a Seoul native.

116
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,519
What? My goodness. Sir.

117
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:41,149
Sir? Are you all right?

118
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:43,389
Sir. Are you okay?

119
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,289
Oh, no. I'll go get a doctor for you.

120
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,159
It's okay. I tripped and fell. That's all.

121
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:54,099
Would you take me back to my room?

122
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,970
Oh, don't. Try not to move so suddenly.

123
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:05,379
By the way, when were you admitted?

124
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,808
I haven't seen you before.

125
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:07,879
Oh, right.

126
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,408
Less than a week ago.

127
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,480
I see.

128
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,620
So it's only been a few days.

129
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,720
You're here.

130
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,070
It must've been heavy. Why did you bring so many things?

131
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,269
She only likes the side dishes that I make, you know.

132
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,809
She probably has no appetite right now.

133
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:10,070
Right.

134
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,679
She really hasn't been eating much.

135
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,279
You know, the person who did that to her hair.

136
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,250
I think it was Yoon Ki Chun.

137
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:24,190
He denied it,

138
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:26,019
but it's obvious.

139
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,860
Maybe we shouldn't have done what we did.

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,169
Not because of that jerk.

141
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,799
But I'm worried about Mr. Kang and Nurse Seo.

142
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,370
We're old anyway, so it's fine.

143
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:43,109
What if something happens to Nurse Seo?

144
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,110
I'm so worried.

145
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,179
- I'm worried too. - Anything could happen,

146
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:53,178
the two of you should hunker down at home for the time being.

147
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,049
You should be careful too.

148
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:05,600
Up until just a few days ago, we were so happy together.

149
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,970
It all feels like a dream.

150
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,110
Just like how life flies by before you even know it.

151
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,710
Deep in the valley

152
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,648
Deep in the valley

153
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:32,320
There is a sunny spot

154
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:35,929
Withstanding the rain and wind

155
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,799
For many years

156
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,840
Is a nameless

157
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,809
A nameless

158
00:12:56,049 --> 00:13:00,779
Wooden mound marker

159
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:08,789
My faraway hometown

160
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,559
My friend

161
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
The skies

162
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,279
I left behind

163
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,980
I miss it

164
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,919
Oh, boy.

165
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,559
Hello.

166
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:41,759
Have you eaten...

167
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:47,429
Hello.

168
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,649
Hello...

169
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:12,460
What's going on?

170
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,169
Hey, Gyeo Rye.

171
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,700
Where have you been?

172
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,070
What is going on?

173
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,250
Why is everyone avoiding me?

174
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,950
What happened?

175
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,750
Gyeo Rye.

176
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,320
What? Mr. Gu?

177
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,830
Yes. He was found like that this morning.

178
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:53,099
- My gosh. - What happened?

179
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,429
- Who did this? - Who hurt him?

180
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,168
There is someone I'm suspecting.

181
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:00,970
Okay, please tell me more.

182
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,779
- From what I've heard... - Yes.

183
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,649
He's being treated at a hospital nearby,

184
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:10,149
but he hasn't regained consciousness yet.

185
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,750
Only the cameras in that part of the building were broken.

186
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:18,419
The police said it had to be someone who knew the building's layout well.

187
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:22,490
But we couldn't reach you because you don't have a cell phone.

188
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,959
And you weren't at the hospital until this morning.

189
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,259
What? So are you saying I...

190
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,699
I got a cell phone.

191
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,139
And I had to step out to meet someone.

192
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,309
You see, rumours...

193
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,878
could save or kill you.

194
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,409
Rumours? What rumours?

195
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,580
In the past, you killed people...

196
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,720
I mean, before you went to jail,

197
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,519
you hurt people...

198
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,090
and did bad things.

199
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:57,089
Rumour has it that you came here...

200
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,600
to do community service because you had an ulterior motive.

201
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,570
Ulterior motive? Like what?

202
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,570
To steal the morphine in the safe.

203
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,149
Gosh.

204
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,649
Who is spreading such rumours?

205
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,620
We have no idea how the rumours began.

206
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,820
That's what it's like with most rumours.

207
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:31,159
All I heard was that...

208
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,299
someone who had known you for a long time visited the hospital.

209
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,440
- You know Yoon Gyeo Rye, right? - Yes.

210
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,740
Rumour has it that he came to this hospital...

211
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,579
to get morphine.

212
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,949
I heard Yoon Gyeo Rye came here to steal morphine.

213
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:56,289
I suppose that person wanted to deliberately get you into trouble.

214
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,889
Who would do such a thing? And why?

215
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:23,910
Gyeo Rye.

216
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,819
Did you hear about Mr. Gu?

217
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:27,890
Gyeo Rye!

218
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,349
What are you doing here?

219
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,349
Are you afraid that I'd call the cops on you?

220
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,180
I will pay for what I did.

221
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,220
You see,

222
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:10,390
I can call the cops on you too.

223
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,069
So...

224
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,700
you'd better stop now and leave quietly.

225
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:20,069
Okay?

226
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,910
He did nothing wrong. Why are you messing with him?

227
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,210
You know he has nothing to do with Mr. Kang!

228
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,180
If you...

229
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,589
care about your son even just a little bit,

230
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,589
stop this and leave.

231
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,390
Please leave, okay?

232
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,160
Gyeo Rye...

233
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,269
He's been through so much.

234
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,109
I suppose you really like my son.

235
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,950
My son, Yoon Gyeo Rye.

236
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,549
It looks like you love him very much.

237
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:11,859
Yes.

238
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:14,119
That's right.

239
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,660
I love him.

240
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,329
- So... - My goodness.

241
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,599
Why do you think Kang Tae Sik...

242
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,299
brought my son here?

243
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,670
Had he never brought him here,

244
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,240
he wouldn't have had to see me again or deal with this.

245
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,750
My son, Yoon Gyeo Rye.

246
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:40,420
And think about it.

247
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,890
I didn't look for Gyeo Rye.

248
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:47,319
Kang Tae Sik brought him here.

249
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,358
Kang Tae Sik nearly killed me,

250
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,799
then I met my son.

251
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:57,000
All of this is Kang Tae Sik's fault.

252
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,209
My gosh. Are you going to keep this up until the end?

253
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,839
The end?

254
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,339
We're only getting started.

255
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,779
Kang Tae Sik!

256
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,889
You used to sell pork soup for a living.

257
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,220
Thanks to me, you got the CEO title.

258
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:23,190
How dare you deceive me like this?

259
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,789
(Incoming Call: 010-4465-890)

260
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:03,869
Hello? Who is it?

261
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,000
It's me.

262
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:09,140
Hey, Gyeo Rye.

263
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,440
How are you feeling?

264
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,509
Are you okay?

265
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,048
Yes, I am.

266
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:18,579
I constantly eat, sleep, eat, and sleep.

267
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,450
It's comfortable here.

268
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,359
I see. That's a relief.

269
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,859
But you don't sound okay to me.

270
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,190
Did something happen?

271
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,660
No, not really.

272
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,500
Nothing big.

273
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:38,269
Then what is it?

274
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,799
You know...

275
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:48,079
It's the ghost staying in the room on the fourth floor.

276
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:52,618
It keeps wandering around the hospital...

277
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,420
and harassing the others.

278
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:57,690
Gyeo Rye.

279
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,890
I was only joking around...

280
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:07,900
since I don't have many happy memories of that room.

281
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,240
Well, anyway.

282
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,240
I need to go and catch that ghost.

283
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,940
I'll call you again.

284
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:25,250
That punk. He actually believed it.

285
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:28,750
(Gyeo Rye)

286
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,740
(Room 403)

287
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,970
Those who hesitate...

288
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,670
always lose.

289
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,950
You wouldn't be hesitating either if you had learned from me properly.

290
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,460
I told you...

291
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,359
to leave quickly without causing any trouble.

292
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,499
I can live like trash...

293
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,740
as you had wished.

294
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,249
Nobody wants this, Gyeo Rye.

295
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,949
You won't get better. Don't do it.

296
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,149
You've done well so far.

297
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,150
- Gyeo Rye. - Yoon Gyeo Rye. Don't do it.

298
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,730
What? You can't...

299
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,960
even kill me?

300
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,299
No.

301
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:37,309
I can't. Scratch that.

302
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,240
I won't kill you.

303
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,579
You know,

304
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,319
I...

305
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,890
won't live like you, scumbag.

306
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:52,160
The real scumbag is Kang Tae Sik.

307
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,960
I can't let him die as a good man.

308
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:00,900
That jerk tried to kill me.

309
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,970
It's clearly a crime.

310
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,970
But Kang Tae Sik's biggest crime...

311
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,809
is trying to steal someone else's son.

312
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:15,809
How dare he steal my son?

313
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,180
So he must be punished.

314
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,079
Who stole your son?

315
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,190
Mr. Kang?

316
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,160
No, he didn't.

317
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,519
You threw away your son.

318
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,890
No. That day.

319
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:34,460
The day I ran away from you,

320
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,869
your son died.

321
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,710
Whatever. Take this...

322
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:43,609
to the police.

323
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,279
Report Kang Tae Sik yourself.

324
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:48,710
Then, I will forgive him.

325
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,980
And even leave this place quietly.

326
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,420
Yoon Gyeo Rye!

327
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,230
Even if you don't do it,

328
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,599
it will be the end of Kang Tae Sik if I do.

329
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,299
But if you make the call,

330
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,769
the old folks...

331
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,700
and the nurse in this hospital...

332
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:18,880
will not be accused of confining me.

333
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,279
You hear me, Gyeo Rye?

334
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,809
Don't call my name.

335
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,980
Don't you dare call my name.

336
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,059
(Room 403)

337
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,039
He should repay my kindness of bringing him into this world.

338
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,259
Are you not eating?

339
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,730
Great timing.

340
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,240
I'm tired of hospital food. I want to eat...

341
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,769
something outside in secret.

342
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,940
At a restaurant.

343
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,029
To tell you the truth, ox bone soup is my favourite.

344
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,970
Now that hits it.

345
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,069
Was it Jun Kyung?

346
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,440
Yes.

347
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,740
Jun Kyung.

348
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,079
What's your wish?

349
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,720
Don't you only grant the wishes of those on the verge of death?

350
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,920
From what I see, you're living to die.

351
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,130
By any chance, is your wish...

352
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,768
to become a family with Gyeo Rye and live with him forever?

353
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:30,240
Or to be loved by him?

354
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:33,410
It's none of the two.

355
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,450
Then what is it?

356
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,150
To never get abandoned by my family again.

357
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,190
That's my real wish.

358
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,529
If I don't die.

00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:21,119
So Yoon Gyeo Rye...

363
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:23,759
shouldn't have left me.

364
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,329
Are you going after him?

365
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,099
Is that why you kept visiting me?

366
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:37,269
I wondered if I could become happy...

367
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:39,910
if I were with you.

368
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,920
Yoon Gyeo Rye.

369
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:51,750
I've never seen him like that.

370
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,759
Aren't you...

371
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,059
and that sharp-tempered nurse the ones who changed him?

372

Yes.

380

Your mother...

381
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,720
had passed away after hugging you so tightly...

382
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:05,960
in that blazing fire, leaving you without...

383

a single burn on your body.

384
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,470
The adults thought the truth would hurt you...

385
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,670
and give you a hard time once you grew up,

386
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,809
so they kept it from you.

387
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,578
Gosh. Why would anyone leave such a pretty girl?

388
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,518
So what if she's pretty? She's an orphan, anyway.

389
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:33,259
- She's pretty but an orphan. - Poor Jun Kyung.

390

Your family...

391

That's right. The kid never agreed to it.

The man in the last room on the fourth floor is me.

I almost died after you hit me with a rock...

on my head.

469
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:39,070
Then the nurses and elders here...

470
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:42,439
were afraid you'd become a murderer,

471
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,969
so they hid me here and saved me.

472

All that went to nothing.

Now, it's time to meet you, Mr... I mean, Captain Kang.

477
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,589
For smashing my head...

478
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,090
and taking my son away from me,

479
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:06,199

481
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,670
Don't you dare do anything to people in the hospital or Gyeo Rye.

482
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,440
If you do anything,

483
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:17,670
I'm going to kill you.

I'm his father.

He's my son.

How dare you? You've always been arrogant...

488

since the moment I met you.

489

Everyone is deceived.

Don't you dare do anything.

Get it, you jerk?

492
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,900

How dare you?

498
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,070
Do you know who I am?

499
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,800
Hey.

500
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,908
Please leave Tae Sik alone.

501
00:43:22,909 --> 00:43:25,408
Why do you keep bothering him?

502
00:43:25,409 --> 00:43:28,738
You brainwashed the innocent man...

503
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,249
and took advantage of him.

504
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,349
Took advantage of him?

505
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,420
We've known each other for 30 years.

506
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:38,249
- I'm here alone... - You should stay inside.

507
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,920
because I missed my friend.

508
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,459
Keep your trap closed if you don't know anything.

509
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,730
My goodness, sir.

510
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:48,529
How could you do this?

511
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,569
Stop it already.

512
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,098
How mean.

513
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:54,670
Leave before I call the police.

514
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:58,369
Captain Kang's out of town!

515
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,238
He doesn't want to see you again.

516
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,879
Leave for goodness' sake.

517
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,209
How strange.

518
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:08,550
Why is he never here every time I visit him?

519
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,690
Isn't he strange? People say they see him all the time here.

520
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,260
Everyone.

521
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:16,659
Don't fall for that pretentious man.

522
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,030
Mind your own business.

523
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:22,929
You don't even have much time left. Don't waste your time like this.

524
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:24,769
Oh, no.

525
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,340
Why...

526
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,710
Is this why you made me run errands?

527
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,538
Did you make me go out and run errands...

528
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:38,650
every time he made a fuss in here?

529
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:43,150
Why on earth did you do that?

530
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,489
For someone like me!

531
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,400
Yoon Ki Chun.

532
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,730
Why do you keep chasing me...

533
00:44:56,769 --> 00:44:59,738
and bothering me my whole life?

534
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:00,800
And...

535
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,869
why me?

536
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:08,940
When tigers and lions...

537
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,809
are hungry,

538
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,119
they look for a prey.

539
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:16,919
Sometimes they kill...

540
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,650
the one that is left behind or looks weak,

541
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,789
but sometimes they kill the one that's closest to them.

542
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,929
Do you know what we call that?

543
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,570
Ill-fated relationship.

544
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:39,579
This place is a jackpot.

545
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,110
They're all left behind...

546
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,609
- and look weak. - My goodness.

547
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:44,678
Come here!

548
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:46,150
- Let me go. - My goodness.

549
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,118
- Hey. - Come here, you jerk.

550
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,589
Tae Sik. What are you doing?

551
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,919
- Follow me, you jerk! - Hey.

552
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,189
Stop it. You're so scary!

553
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,460
- Come here! - Gosh.

554
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,558
What's wrong with you?

555
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:00,599
What? Are you embarrassed...

556
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,329
to lose to a weak cancer patient?

557
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,030
Did you really think people avoided you because you're scary?

558
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,170
If they get involved with you,

559
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:11,439
they were afraid they'd end up smelling like you too.

560
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,979
I thought we were friends. Watch your mouth.

561
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,380
Yes. I only stayed next to you...

562
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,979
because I wanted to be successful.

563
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,719
Did you think I was afraid of your power?

564
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:26,519
You scumbag!

565
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:30,030
Hey, Tae Sik. Stop it.

566
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:32,730
- Stop it now. - Crazy prick.

567
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:37,329
Hey. That hurts.

568
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,570
Hey. Stop.

569
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,969
Stop what?

570
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,369
You crazy prick.

571
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,139
I don't mind...

572
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,309
because I was a fool,

573
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:55,750
but don't bring in innocent people because of me.

574
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:58,619
Get it? For goodness' sake.

575
00:47:01,489 --> 00:47:02,519
Please.

576
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:04,760
Don't get other people involved...

577
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:07,400
because of me.

578
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,369
I won't forgive you for that.

579
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,570
Hey. Help.

580
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,710
Help me.

581
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:20,409
Hey! Kang Tae Sik.

582
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:31,050
That's why you can't be successful.

583
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,019
I bet you didn't know about this.

584
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,960
If he turns himself in with all the elders here,

585
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,530
who knows?

586
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,539
The video I just sent you is the proof.

587
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,618
Hey, Tae Sik. Stop it.

588
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:39,889
That knife won't do anything.

589
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:44,329
I only took it out to provoke him.

590
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:49,129
I recorded him...

591
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:50,969
going frantic.

592
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:52,530
So,

593
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,599
go turn yourself in.

594
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:00,110
Then I will leave quietly.

595
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:04,110
(Icheon Police Station Detective Park)

(Icheon Police Station Detective Park)

597
00:49:11,289 --> 00:49:12,389
Hello?

598
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:17,289
I'm almost there.

599
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,469
I've thought about it.

600
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:32,510
I think I'd need more concrete evidence.

601
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,340
I'll call you back.

602
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,750
Yes, I'm sorry.

603
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:50,059

(No photos or videos)

607

(Mr. Kang)

608
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:31,869
- Mr. Kang. - Yes, Nurse Seo.

609
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,768
Where are you? I'm...

610
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:38,369
I'm sorry I didn't visit you.

611
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,138
I tried to visit you...

612
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:43,849
So where are you right now?

613
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,250
Something came up in the hospital.

614
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,389
I'll visit you once this resolves.

615
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,090
Yoon Ki Chun.

616
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:58,289
He called me and told me.

617
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:01,960
Did he blackmail you?

618
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:07,539
He did.

619
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:10,110
Whatever he said,

620
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:12,639
don't be swayed. Understand?

621
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:14,780
He can even kill people...

622
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,750
with the things he says.

623
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,389
This is between me and him.

624
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:25,519
He's not trying to start a fight.

625
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,719
He just wants to play.

626
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:30,960
He's lonely.

627
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,699
He became a monster because he's lonely.

628
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,230
So...

629
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:39,469
Yeon Joo.

630
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,070
Yes, Father.

631
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:44,909
Don't do anything for me.

632
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,510
I'm begging you.

633
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,949
Understand?

634
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:23,110
(Death isn't the end to all.)

635
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:56,210
Gosh.

636
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,709
Gyeo Rye.

637
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:30,750
Yes. Where are you?

638
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:34,949
I'm on my way home.

639
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,289
Where are you?

640
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:38,920
Hospital.

641
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,559
It's late. Why are you still up?

642
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:48,760
Nothing.

643
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:08,880
Gyeo Rye.

644
00:54:09,849 --> 00:54:12,650
Yoon Ki Chun will leave tomorrow.

645
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:16,659
He wouldn't just leave quietly.

646
00:54:18,329 --> 00:54:19,488
I doubt it.

647
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:22,199
I don't know if he's leaving on his own or forced to leave,

648
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:24,699
but it seems something must've come up in Seoul.

649
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:26,570
I heard him talking on the phone.

650
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:37,849
So, Gyeo Rye.

651
00:54:39,179 --> 00:54:42,119
Don't do anything tonight.

652
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:46,150
Okay.

653
00:54:47,059 --> 00:54:50,260
Gyeo Rye. I'm begging you.

654
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:52,929
Okay?

655
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,030
Okay.

656
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,980
(Sonny, I will never forget you.)

657
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,760
Thank you for staying alive.

658
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,489
I knew you'd be here.

659
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:59,189
But Kang Tae Sik kept insisting.

660
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:02,159
It's true. He didn't know I was here.

661
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,768
The elders and the nurse were terrified...

662
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:07,940
something might happen to him, so they locked me up in here.

663
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,670
Let's go. It's a long story.

664
00:56:20,449 --> 00:56:21,449
Okay.

665
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,159
Chairman Yoon.

666
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,659
Will that morphine be good money?

667
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,630
It's not even hallucinatory.

668
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:34,760
You think that's for sale?

669
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:36,500
Then what is it for?

670
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:40,269
To kick someone out from here,

671
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:42,199
that needs to disappear.

672
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:49,440
(Room 403)

673
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:00,119
You should've...

674
00:57:00,219 --> 00:57:03,360
spread the rumour more actively.

675
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,260
Now, you will be...

676
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:11,199
my son's second victim.

677
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,789
(We won't let your hand go.)

678
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:45,499
Detective Park. This is Seo Yeon Joo...

679
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,070
from Woori Hospice Hospital. We were supposed to meet today.

680
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,570
I told you to turn yourself in. Why are you doing this?

681
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:51,670
Let me go.

682
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:56,039
You said you want my son to be happy.

683
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:00,780
I'm going to find a way for everyone to be happy.

684
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:03,178
That's what he really wants.

685
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:04,719
He's my blood.

686
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,749
I know what he really wants.

687
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:07,789
Didn't you know?

688
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,189
He said he got rid of all your blood when he donated his blood.

689
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:12,789
I knew...

690
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,158
talking won't work...

691
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:16,260
Get your hand off!

692
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,670
Mr. Kang.

693
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:25,369
You...

694
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:28,139
You're really out of your mind.

695
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,480
Mr. Kang.

696
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:39,119
Yes. Forget about everything,

697
00:58:40,389 --> 00:58:41,460
and let's have fun.

698
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,690
Let's have fun together after death.

699
00:58:46,829 --> 00:58:48,429
- Mr. Kang. - Stay out.

700
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:52,369
This is what you want from me.

701
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:54,340
- No. - Isn't it?

702
00:59:00,139 --> 00:59:01,710
Mr. Kang. Don't do this.

703
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:03,780
- Mr. Kang. - Stop it now.

704
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:07,880
Gyeo Rye.

705
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,150
Please stop now.

706
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,119
Will you?

707
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:16,320
Stop it!

708
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:21,900
Stop!

709
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,440
Stop it.

710
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:36,309
That's exactly what he wants from you.

711
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,279
Don't you know...

712
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,719
how many people tried to stop you from becoming a murderer?

713
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,849
So, stop it.

714
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,630
Yoon Gyeo Rye.

715
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:54,329
I couldn't find you anywhere.

716
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:56,400
- What are you doing here? - Gosh.

717
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:00,670
What are you doing here, you thugs?

718
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:09,110
Hey. What are you doing here?

719
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:20,420
Let me go. Gyeo Rye.

720
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:26,789
Crazy punk.

721
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,800
No.

722
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:47,579
(If You Wish Upon Me)

723
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:48,750
Do you know him?

724
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,989
Thank you for everything. Let's go on our separate ways now.

725
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:54,619
I'm here because Gyeo Rye asked.

726
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:57,360
Don't give up like this.

727
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:00,900
I think my wish came true.

728
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,500
You'll get quite a lot for insurance.

729
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,940
Can you give us a sneeze?

730
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:10,610
Do you want to be my family?

731
01:01:11,369 --> 01:01:13,210
I want to ask Team Genie...

732
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,210
my last wish.
