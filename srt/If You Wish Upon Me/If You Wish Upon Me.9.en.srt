(Episode 9)

8
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:42,810
Jun Kyung. You should wait for me somewhere.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,920
I'll finish up my job here,

10
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,820
say goodbye and catch up.

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,590
No.

12
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,459
Do it now. I'll wait here.

13
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,560
Ha Jun Kyung.

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,239
Do you want me to die here?

15
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,739
Jun Kyung. Don't do that.

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,578
It's a hospice hospital.

17
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:13,040
They're used to people dying.

18
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,620
Don't do that here.

19
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,818
This isn't the place for it.

20
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,349
It's only a matter of time.

21
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,920
Seok Jun saw the video of you fighting.

22
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,290
Jun Kyung, I'm...

23
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:33,260
more afraid of going back to my past with you...

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,200
than Seok Jun coming to killing me.

25
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,569
So,

26
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,439
can you just ignore me?

27
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,849
Jun Kyung. Please.

28
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:52,219
Since I moved here,

29
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,319
for the first time in my life,

30
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,389
I thought I could...

31
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,659
live an ordinary life.

32
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:04,400
No, I will soon be...

33
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:06,900
ordinary.

34
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,129
I'll learn...

35
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,400
what it means to be happy.

36
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,668
I'm begging you.

37
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,909
Can you cut me some slack?

38
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,550
I should die.

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,689
Get your stuff. The cab will be here soon.

40
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,000
(Will)

41
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:22,909
(Sonny, I will never forget you.)

42
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:25,439
Sonny.

43
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,349
I can't keep my promise.

44
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,490
Sorry.

45
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,870
Are you leaving?

46
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,800
Yes.

47
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,810
I have to.

48
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,680
Hey.

49
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,590
What about...

50
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,360
your precious money bag?

51
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:20,970
Aren't you taking it with you?

52
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,269
The money's...

53
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:28,170
under the Pride trunk.

54
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,639
Tell Mr. Kang to use it as he wishes.

55
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,518
Hurry up.

56
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,329
(Taxi)

57
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,339
Gyeo Rye. Gyeo...

58
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,149
Where's he going?

59
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,800
It's overflowing.

60
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,569
What are you thinking about?

61
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,769
Is something bothering you?

62
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:40,750
By the way, where's Gyeo Rye going at this hour?

63
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,019
And who's the girl next to him?

64
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:46,550
His girlfriend, apparently.

65
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,649
His girlfriend?

66
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,959
He had a girlfriend?

67
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,959
He packed up and left.

68
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:01,930
As if he'll never come back.

69
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,699
He must have a reason.

70
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,870
If he was really leaving,

71
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,579
he wouldn't just leave without saying goodbye.

72
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:15,449
He completed his volunteer hours anyway.

73
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,990
(Lounge)

74
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,189
(If You Wish Upon Me)

75
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:05,199
For the two of you?

76
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,099
You can only get a studio with that money.

77
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
It doesn't matter.

78
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,709
You must be very close.

79
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,269
Wait here.

80
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,980
Oh, you know I don't believe you lost the money bag.

81
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:28,889
I bet.

82
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,958
You always say you love me,

83
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,589
but you never trusted me for once.

84
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,160
I never trusted it when you said you'll never leave me.

85
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,230
In the end, I was right.

86
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,670
There is...

87
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,470
a place available for 1,000 dollars a month with a 3,000 dollar deposit.

88
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,669
- But for two people... - I'll sign it.

89
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,970
Without seeing the house?

90
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,740
Studios are all the same.

91
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,310
Still.

92
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:55,980
Then I'll call the landlord.

93
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,519
Sir. I'm going in.

94
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,759
Sir. Why is it so cold in here?

95
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,269
Stop turning the heat off to save money.

96
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,699
My goodness. Sir?

97
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,939
Sir?

98
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,809
Hello? I'm calling from 998-7 Yoowal-dong.

99
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,979
I have a terminal laryngeal cancer patient,

100
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,980
and he's having trouble breathing.

101
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,149
He had tracheotomy.

102
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,120
Okay. Sir.

103
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:38,960
It's painful.

104
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,960
I think my time is up.

105
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:45,929
There was something I wanted to say before I go.

106
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,700
Even though it was an ex-convict volunteer work,

107
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:54,470
how could he leave like that without saying goodbye?

108
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,179
We still spent months together.

109
00:08:58,309 --> 00:08:59,309
Right.

110
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,120
I know I'm old enough, but it's still disappointing.

111
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,919
He probably had a reason.

112
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,820
I'm sure Nurse Seo...

113
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:13,690
is most disappointed.

114
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,659
Seo Jin can't come often because she's becoming Grade 12.

115
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,929
Now that the two kids are gone,

116
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,899
the hospital feels empty.

117
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,109
Come here.

118
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,110
Did you like it?

119
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,950
Everyone here looks happy.

120
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,190
Except for one.

121
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,299
Let's go to the hospital.

122
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:02,970
This is good. You should try it.

123
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,240
Let's go to the hospital together.

124
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,339
We might as well...

125
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,710
try to live a new life,

126
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,249
so I'd feel like helping you.

127
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,250
Close your mouth.

128
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,789
Don't make me sound like a patient.

129
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:16,889
Why?

130
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,090
Are you embarrassed that you're sick?

131
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:24,629
I said, close your mouth.

132
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,929
Pain isn't something you endure.

133
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,970
It's something that must be shared and recognized.

134
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,240
Jun Kyung.

135
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,740
Pain...

136
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,750
isn't something you hide or endure.

137
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,250
You must say it when you're sick.

138
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,889
I'm sick.

139
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:52,019
I'm in so much pain.

140
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,830
My heart aches.

141
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,690
My head hurts!

142
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,730
Just like that.

143
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,499
Don't endure it and just say it.

144
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,840
Am I mental to love you?

145
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,200
Is love mental illness?

146
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,909
Yes, your love is.

147
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,519
Besides, we're family.

148
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,689
I'll be your family, I'll love you, and I'll sleep with you.

149
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,320
I'll do everything with you.

150
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,090
So stop treating me like I'm crazy and just eat.

151
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,029
So darn annoying.

152
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:55,120
Gyeo Rye.

153
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,190
Are you coming soon?

154
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:11,799
Gyeo Rye.

155
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,809
I shouldn't have been so mean to you earlier.

156
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,769
Are you still upset?

157
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,840
Do you want to do something fun? What do you want to do?

158
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,279
Tell me. Come on.

159
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,250
You want to get a lettering?

160
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,990
What about the phrase?

161
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,330
Death is not the end of life.

162
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:38,559
Pardon?

163
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,099
Death is not the end of life.

164
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,169
I'll write that in Korean.

165
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:47,970
Okay.

166
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,019
It's such a waste to pay for the tattoo every time.

167
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,159
- What? - I don't need to pay for it.

168
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:14,870
Happy? You think that's funny?

169
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,070
Isn't it?

170
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:21,970
I'll think about something that will make you laugh.

171
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,679
The more you do that, I'll never let you go.

172
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,039
Stop it. Stay here.

173
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,639
I was taking a left turn...

174
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,090
Was I too greedy?

175
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,169
Everything just...

176
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,870
went back to as it was.

177
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:37,940
But why am I so sad?

178
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,450
Still,

179
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,759
for now,

180
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,330
I'll pray for his health.

181
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:13,779
Do you want to get some late night snack?

182
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,250
I suddenly feel very hungry.

183
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:19,820
Oh, you're hungry.

184
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,389
I'm sorry, but I already had dinner.

185
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,990
I heard you didn't.

186
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,659
- Pardon? - Well,

187
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,860
the ladies said...

188
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:34,769
you've been eating less,

189
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,969
so they're worried about you nutritionally.

190
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,399
I got to... I mean, I happened to hear it.

191
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,580
Let's have late night snack together.

192
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,049
Come on.

193
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:54,950
It's this way.

194
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,460
It's a protein shake.

195
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,930
I thought you wouldn't feel like eating anything else.

196
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,769
Thank you for taking care of me every time.

197
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:14,338
Do you still exercise your upper body?

198
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,240
Yes, I'm working hard on it.

199
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,539
I must stay strong to look after the patients.

200
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:24,519
I feel like I should get ready...

201
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,750
to replace you when you get drained.

202
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,750
Like recent days.

203
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,990
I'm not drained.

204
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:38,059
That sounds like a patient saying she's not sick.

205
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:43,470
I really am okay.

206
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,140
Then it's a relief.

207
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:52,079
(Wedding Exhibition)

208
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,750
Hello.

209
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,709
Hello.

210
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,250
Hello.

211
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,920
Oh, my.

212
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,119
Long time no see.

213
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,460
How are you feeling?

214
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,390
I've gotten a lot better.

215
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,258
He wanted to get some fresh air, so I decided to bring him.

216
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,000
Yes, you made a good decision.

217
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:17,368
It's such a relief.

218
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:19,139
When I see a young man in pain,

219
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,839
I want to take that pain for him.

220
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,079
Is Gyeo Rye not here?

221
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,879
It seems like it.

222
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,450
- No calls? - No.

223
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:36,548
He probably knows when and where the wedding is taking place.

224
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,519
He made a fuss because this was his first Genie work.

225
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,839
Whatever.

226
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:56,170
This is all for Ms. Oh.

227
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,180
You should put a smile on your face. Even if you can't,

228
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:00,609
you should force yourself to smile...

229
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,980
and congratulate her. Okay?

230
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,549
I'll set off now.

231
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:23,798
Hello.

232
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:27,769
Ms. Oh. You look beautiful.

233
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,309
It's true. You look like an angel.

234
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,210
I don't know what I'm doing at this age.

235
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,749
About a dozen people will come from the hospital.

236
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,118
It won't be so empty.

237
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,150
Seo Jin even brought her ill boyfriend.

238
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,819
Thank you so much.

239
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,489
You'd do this for every patient...

240
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,630
without asking for anything in return.

241
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,959
You helped Se Hee too last time.

242
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,200
You're really amazing.

243
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,028
I want to follow you later...

244
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,170
and join you.

245
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:02,169
There are so many people who want to join us,

246
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,680
so you have to wait in line.

247
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,139
That's right.

248
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,710
Then I'll wait in line.

249
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,359
The wedding will begin soon.

250
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,659
I ask the guests...

251
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,430
to be seated. Thank you.

252
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:29,500
The wedding will begin soon.

253
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,769
Are you sure about this?

254
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,210
Yes.

255
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,039
Here's the groom!

256
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:19,819
Stand up.

257
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:22,119
What?

258
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,789
He's asking for the groom.

259
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,460
What are you saying?

260
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:39,099
No way.

261
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,769
Did you finally realize whose wedding this is?

262
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:00,190
Can you walk?

263
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,059
Yes. I'll try.

264
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,559
But please help me out.

265
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,069
I'll do it.

266
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,299
You're my first client.

267
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,279
Shall we?

268
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:56,650
You're almost there. Hang in there just a bit more.

269
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:13,160
Can you stand alone?

270
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,569
Okay.

271
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:23,640
Mr. Groom, please turn around.

272
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:26,410
Face the guests.

273
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,880
It's now time for the highlight and climax of today's wedding.

274
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,450
The star of the day!

275
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,519
The bride will walk down the aisle.

276
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:41,019
Ms. Bride, please enter.

277
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,000
Thank you, sir.

278
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,740
You even lent us the wedding hall for free.

279
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,609
I'm happy for you. I seriously am.

280
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,549
My gosh.

281
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:09,419
- She's so pretty. - Oh, dear.

282
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,119
Here's the bride!

283
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,599
You look gorgeous.

284
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:28,069
- She's pretty, isn't she? - Totally.

285
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,250
Congratulations!

286
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,329
You look stunning today, honey.

287
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,059
You too, Young Ok.

288
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,900
You look beautiful.

289
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,250
We never held a wedding ceremony.

290
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,490
Nor did we travel once.

291
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,289
"Let's save up a little bit more."

292
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,730
"Let's earn a little bit more." I always used to say that.

293
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,369
But later, I got sick. We couldn't do anything in the end.

294
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,210
I've sinned greatly to my wife, haven't I?

295
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:37,369
We must have been...

296
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:41,079
sworn enemies in our past life.

297
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,079
Everyone. Please stand closer to each other.

298
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,349
At the back, please get closer.

299
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:51,150
Great.

300
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:53,160
Look over here.

301
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,190
Smile, everyone.

302
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,029
On the count of three, please say "Cheese!"

303
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,098
Okay, nice. I'm taking the photo.

304
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:03,868
One, two, three.

305
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:05,839
- Cheese! - Cheese!

306
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,669
Thank you for the hard work.

307
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,839
- Thank you. - My dear.

308
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:14,039
Thank you very much.

309
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,980
Thank you.

310
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,480
Let's go.

311
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,990
Gyeo Rye.

312
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,430
I'm especially grateful to you.

313
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,700
And I'm terribly sorry.

314
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,200
I shouldn't have said such things to such a good man.

315
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,240
- I'm sorry. - Gosh.

316
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,579
Stop making me emotional.

317
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,279
It's all good.

318
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,819
I'm okay, got it?

319
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,420
You look cool.

320
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:03,960
You do.

321
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:16,670
Let's leave right away.

322
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,279
Hold on. I should say goodbye to them.

323
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,809
Hey. Wait.

324
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,349
Something urgent had come up.

325
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,959
So I had to leave without bidding everyone farewell. Sorry.

326
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
You should be.

327
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:40,129
You broke our hearts, and we almost shed tears.

328
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,529
She's right. That was really mean.

329
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:45,569
Don't worry about it.

330
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:48,839
It's okay as long as you're healthy and not sick.

331
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,639
Don't just eat anything.

332
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,240
Make a proper meal even if you get lazy, okay?

333
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,650
I don't know what's going on, but make sure she eats too.

334
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,200
It's past dinner time. So you should be hungry.

335
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,960
And we don't know when Gyeo Rye will return.

336
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,868
I don't eat these stuff.

337
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:17,528
You said you're Gyeo Rye's girlfriend.

338
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,869
So shouldn't you like curry too?

339
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,769
Give it a taste.

340
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,970
Yoon Gyeo Rye.

341
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:54,969
Did he eat this kind of food while he was here?

342
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,108
Yes.

343
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,410
He ate them and even made them himself.

344
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:01,038
He likes garnishing noodles, dumpling soup,

345
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,679
and bibimbap with colourful ingredients the most.

346
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,779
He's good at it too.

347
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,489
And once, he made persimmons and hung them...

348
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,250
on a naked persimmon tree.

349
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,690
It looked real.

350
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,460
How do you expect me to eat this?

351
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:21,798
If you don't know how to make a certain dish,

352
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,529
come by the hospital.

353
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,440
I'll whip it up for you any time.

354
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,239
Okay.

355
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,039
But he ran away without a word.

356
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,940
He doesn't deserve it.

357
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:34,640
- You heartless punk. - I agree. You're so cold-hearted.

358
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,278
I know we weren't that close,

359
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,779
but it still upsets me a little.

360
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,890
It did? My bad.

361
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:05,838
I should get going.

362
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,608
Even if you can't stop by the hospital,

363
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:09,149
eat with us before you leave.

364
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,180
I heard the food here was delicious.

365
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:14,119
I have someone waiting for me.

366
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,119
Gyeo Rye.

367
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,130
You should still bid farewell to Nurse Seo.

368
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:34,069
Let me just leave.

369
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,740
You...

370
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:41,539
can only live next to Nurse Seo.

371
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,420
Not her.

372
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:53,789
If I don't choose her,

373
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,200
she'll die.

374
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,029
Bye.

375
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,839
- Gyeo Rye. - Let's go, Jun Kyung.

376
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,578
Hey, why don't we...

377
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,249
all go eat?

378
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,289
Wasn't the buffet here good?

379
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,259
Mr. Kang.

380
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,690
Let's go.

381
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:34,130
(4th Lad Amor Big Wedding Fair)

382
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,209
I thought I hated seeing you smile for that worthless punk...

383
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,839
the most.

384
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,150
But seeing you like this is more painful.

385
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,450
Dragging him back by the collar seems like the best idea.

386
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,519
May I?

387
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,089
Not today.

388
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,559
Why not?

389
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:05,059
He looks frightened.

390
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,029
Frightened that I might approach him.

391
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,769
To me,

392
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,039
he looks like he'll run away at once if I take a step towards him.

393
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,849
Hurry up.

394
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,660
Come, take a seat, and eat right now.

395
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,130
It's your favourite curry.

396
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,259
I'll get you another.

397
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,140
Don't forget.

398
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,509
The one who approached me first and wanted us to become a family...

399
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,250
was you.

400
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:39,289
And the one who interfered with my only chance to become happy...

401
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,390
was also you.

402
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:54,268
Ju Won.

403
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:55,869
- Thank you. - Sure thing.

404
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:58,240
Oh, Jun Kyung.

405
00:33:58,779 --> 00:33:59,940
Here you go.

406
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,778
I heard a rich family from Gangnam was adopting you...

407
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:04,750
this Lunar New Year.

408
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,980
I knew your pretty face would get you adopted fast.

409
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:10,320
Gosh.

410
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:13,659
I can't believe someone even abandoned such a pretty girl.

411
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,089
I want something pretty too.

412
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,059
- Come here, Na Yeon. - I want to go first.

413
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,169
- I want mine first. - Thank you.

414
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,369
- I need to use the toilet. - I don't want that.

415
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,920
What about your parents?

416
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:45,860
Did they pass away?

417
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,389
I don't know. I never had one.

418
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
I don't...

419
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,469
have a family either.

420
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,510
Then...

421
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:06,309
why don't we become a family?

422
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,280
We'll be brother and sister.

423
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,880
A sibling.

424
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,789
What if the family that adopts you...

425
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,119
turn out to be evil?

426
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,860
What if they beat you up and harassed you?

427
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,230
It might be better...

428
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:27,730
if you stay behind and become my family.

429
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,909
Okay. I'll become your family.

430
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,309
But...

431
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,639
once we become a family, we have to be one forever.

432
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:44,949
We have to be together even through rough and happy times.

433
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,480
Can you do it?

434
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,949
It might be hard.

435
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:52,219
Yes, I can.

436
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,459
You can have both...

437
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,530
since I'm your older brother.

438
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:01,800
Thanks, Brother.

439
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,070
And I became your brother.

440
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,979
I worked really hard to become a good family to you.

441
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,309
I am even now, Jun Kyung. But...

442
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,920
you're the one who wanted beyond that.

443
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,050
Siblings aren't the only family.

444
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,320
So are married couples.

445
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,158
That was the kind of family I wanted from you, not siblings.

446
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,158
Yoon Gyeo Rye, my husband. Ha Jun Kyung, your wife.

447
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,198
Sonny's mom and dad. That was what I wanted.

448
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,300
Jun Kyung.

449
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,698
Please, Jun Kyung. Stop.

450
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:40,039
Why?

451
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:43,110
Why am I not pretty only to you, Gyeo Rye?

452
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,610
You know.

453
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,650
I want to date someone who can't see my true self.

454
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,619
And I want that person to comfort me.

455
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:54,948
"Only good things will happen."

456
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:58,218
"There will only be happy things ahead." That's what I want to hear,

457
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:00,789
not words of a joint suicide every single day.

458
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,190
Your ideal type?

459
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,360
I don't care about it at all.

460
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,530
So try to find a way to become happy with me.

461
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:14,900
Or just die with me.

462
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,510
We promised to live together...

463
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:19,539
and die together.

464
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,210
If that's what a family is,

465
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,109
I don't need it. I can't do it.

466
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,880
I could have become happy.

467
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:30,250
But you stopped that from happening.

468
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,460
So you should take responsibility until the end.

469
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,329
Don't you agree?

470
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,440
Darn it.

471
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,019
Yoon Gyeo Rye.

472
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:22,710
Excuse me.

473
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,710
Hey.

474
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,710
Can you call someone for me?

475
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,219
I'm sorry, Dr. Yang.

476
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:19,760
Please don't be sick.

477
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,429
You can do everything else.

478
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,269
But don't get sick.

479
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:38,849
Sir.

480
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:42,690
I heard you didn't even know the address...

481
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,889
of the person you wanted to meet and talk to.

482
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,999
"It happened a long time ago, so my memories are fuzzy."

483
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,199
"Can you really find them?"

484
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,170
Is it even possible?

485
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:02,940
We'll make it possible.

486
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:12,050
Gosh, sir.

487
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:15,049
You were amazing back in the day.

488
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:19,159
Of course. Mr. Song was on a roll, weren't you?

489
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:24,659
I'm the captain at the hospital I work.

490
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,058
Weren't you the captain of your detective squad?

491
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,098
We're the same.

492
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:30,130
He's right.

493
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,619
Let me.

494
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
You didn't have to.

495
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,030
This place is stunning.

496
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:02,800
You look pretty today, though you always do.

497
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:05,329
Thank you for coming.

498
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:08,239
You, too. You look dandy today.

499
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:12,469
I wanted to change my mood today.

500
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,880
I was dying to go outside after I got sick.

501
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,849
Thank you for taking care of me while I was bedridden.

502
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:22,078
Though you invited me today,

503
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,650
dinner will be on me.

504
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,718
I will never eat with you again if you stop me.

505
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:28,019
Okay. I will not stop you.

506
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,230
I'll have the most expensive dish.

507
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,829
(New Zealand Rack of Lamb with Couscous, 150 dollars)

508
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,230
I'll have pasta.

509
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:48,980
You could have ordered steak.

510
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,379
You should have some wine too.

511
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,449
I can afford this. Don't assume that I can't.

512
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,590
I'm a vegetarian.

513
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:58,789
I don't eat meat, and I do not drink alcohol.

514
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:01,420
There's beef in that pasta.

515
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:14,739
From a young age,

516
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,169
I always thought I'd go on a blind date, meet a woman...

517
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,139
who was like me in a lot of ways,

518
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,280
marry her,

519
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:27,049
have a conflict-free marriage with her,

520
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,980
and die quietly.

521
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:33,119
I want to see you live a peaceful, happy life like that.

522
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:35,260
You're a really good person.

523
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,400
Hearing that hurts my feelings.

524
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,800
Sorry?

525
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,369
Nurse Seo.

526
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:50,369
Yeon Joo.

527
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:56,250
I rarely get my feelings hurt.

528
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,809
I know that everyone has their own situation,

529
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:01,980
and I tend to be uninterested in other people's lives,

530
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:05,789
so I never once imagined I'd feel this way about someone.

531
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,090
For some reason,

532
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:13,130
you're the only person who keeps hurting my feelings.

533
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,800
Oh...

534
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:24,440
Sorry... If I said sorry,

535
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:27,280
would that hurt your feelings too?

536
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,909
Yes.

537
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:36,820
Every time you say something,

538
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:39,590
it excites me and makes my heart flutter.

539
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,329
It's amusing. It makes me laugh, and I enjoy listening to you.

540
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,960
So I can't wait to hear what you'll talk about next time.

541
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,559
That said,

542
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,099
I wish to always wonder what we'll talk about next...

543
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,940
and always...

544
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,179
stay by your side for the rest of my life.

545
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,949
Just don't rule me out completely.

546
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,789
Consider me a candidate, and I'll be happy.

547
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,559
I want you...

548
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:18,329
to make the safest choice that will not hurt you. I mean it.

549
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,329
Besides, I'm pretty sure...

550
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,800
I can win some points with your brother too.

551
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:01,369
My gosh, Dr. Yang.

552
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,070
As a candidate,

553
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:05,409
I should do something since you bought me dinner.

554
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:08,679
Still, this is... This is nice.

555
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:11,880
Thanks to you, I didn't have to walk up the stairs.

556
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,880
Sure thing. Your muscles are important.

557
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:17,718
I have high muscle mass.

558
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:19,960
I hope you weren't too exhausted after carrying me that day.

559
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:22,589
What are you talking about?

560
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,058
That day, when I fainted in the hallway,

561
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:26,059
you moved me to the night-duty room.

562
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,230
I went back because they called me from the night-duty room.

563
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,469
Oh, really?

564
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:36,039
I guess I was delirious from the drugs.

565
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:40,610
Anyway, thank you again for inviting me out today.

566
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:43,409
My pleasure. I had a great time today.

567
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,780
Good night.

568
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:26,489
Aren't you scared? Of death.

569
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,119
But you see,

570
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:32,929
life scares me even more.

571
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,659
You should've just cried and yelled.

572
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,130
You should've done whatever you could to make him stay, Yeon Joo.

573
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,739
This curry is good.

574
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,069
Right?

575
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:54,409
I knew you'd like it. I put in a lot of pork, and it tastes much better.

576
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,380
You don't like carrots, so I didn't put in any.

577
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,780
Thanks for that.

578
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,449
I need to use the bathroom.

579
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,368
(Jerk Seok Jun)

580
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:25,670
(Jerk Seok Jun)

581
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,849
It's me, Yoon Gyeo Rye.

582
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:34,480
Beomyun Apartments Unit 201, Naeju-ro 402-Gil, Wooni.

583
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,800
(Sonny, I will never forget you.)

584
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:55,800
Where's your dad?

585
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,639
I wonder if he's eating well.

586
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,550
He's probably doing well with his girlfriend.

587
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:11,889
I'm worried for nothing, right?

588
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:18,229
- Oh, you're here. - You're early.

589
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,860
- Would you like some coffee? - No, thanks.

590
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:23,299
I heard you were sick. You should take some time off.

591
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,670
Well, I wanted to be bedridden for a while,

592
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,869
but I recovered in no time thanks to all the exercise I do.

593
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,610
That day...

594
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,179
Why did you avoid him?

595
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,920
Who?

596
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:45,420
Gyeo Rye. On the day of Mr. Jang's wedding.

597
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:54,099
I got the impression that he wanted me to leave him alone.

598
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,729
To me, he looked like...

599
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,630
he was really hoping you'd make the first move.

600
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,239
He could've made the first move.

601
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:08,440
That'd be hard for him.

602
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,280
Why?

603
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,849
Because of his rough,

604
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:16,349
dark past,

605
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:19,250
he's worried he'd ruin you.

606
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,460
I think that's what he is afraid of.

607
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:24,659
I'm all messed up.

608
00:50:25,059 --> 00:50:26,900
She's pure as snow.

609
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,130
What if I mess her up?

610
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:36,269
That girl, Jun Kyung, and Gyeo Rye...

611
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:39,940
met in the orphanage. She's like his sister.

612
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,510
Gyeo Rye promised her that he'd always protect her...

613
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:47,349
and told her that he'd be her family.

614
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,619
But she kept getting obsessed with him...

615
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:54,789
to the point that he couldn't bear it anymore.

616
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,860
Even for your family, you shouldn't have to tolerate...

617
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,760
and put up with everything. That's just wrong.

618
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:11,670
Now, having said that, I think you should...

619
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:14,239
go talk to Gyeo Rye.

620
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,849
I think he's waiting for you.

621
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:27,119
I guess...

622
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:32,590
I was waiting for someone to tell me that I should go to him.

623
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,969
He's a bit of a coward, so he probably can't even escape.

624
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,210
I'll go get him.

625
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:49,039
I knew you would say that.

626
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,909
Hold on.

627
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:56,488
We don't know where he is. How are we going to find him?

628
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:57,820
He doesn't even have a cell phone now.

629
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,259
- Who am I? - Mr. Kang.

630
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,630
Come on. Not that.

631
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,329
Genie?

632
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:13,030
Whenever I see him on the rooftop, my heart sinks.

633
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,468
Should I lay some boxes down flat on the ground or something?

634
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:17,170
I'm so anxious.

635
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:22,808
About that girlfriend or sister of his. Whatever she is.

636
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:25,809
She's practically glued to him 24-7.

637
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:27,780
She follows him around like his shadow.

638
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,190
Hey, you should do something.

639
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,960
I'm worried something crazy would happen.

640
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:40,800
Hey, what are you doing?

641
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:44,268
Text me the address.

642
00:52:44,269 --> 00:52:47,739
Why are you taking those gloves? Nurse Seo!

643
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:17,800
Hey, what are you doing? Come and eat.

644
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,039
What are you staring at? You've been up here for hours.

645
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,469
Food is ready. Come down already.

646
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:46,730
Give me back my money.

647
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,629
That's all I have. Give it back.

648
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,800
That's my grant. Without that money, I can't go to college!

649
00:53:57,269 --> 00:53:58,340
College?

650
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:01,110
Why? Do you want to study art?

651
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,579
You're an orphan. Why bother going to college?

652
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:05,750
Just come and work for me.

653
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:09,719
I told you. I will not become a thug to earn money.

654
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:12,289
It's not like I want to be a thug.

655
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,090
People like us have no choice because we need to survive!

656
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,699
Seok Jun, stop talking like you and I are the same.

657
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,869
It's not like I wanted to turn out like this.

658
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,038
I'm nothing like you, you thug.

659
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:30,039
- Give me back my money. - You little...

660
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,709
How are we different?

661
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:37,780
How are you different from me?

662
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:40,849
How exactly are we different?

663
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,230
Seok Jun, you're here.

664
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:55,429
Let's put an end to this once and for all.

665
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,440
I'm really exhausted now.

666
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,309
Just...

667
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:12,179
- push me off the building. - Hey!

668
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,448
Hey, Seo Yeon Joo. What are you doing here?

669
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:19,849
Did you think I was a total weakling?

670
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,559
I can protect you, no problem.

671
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,760
If you ghosted me because you wanted to go back to your ex,

672
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:28,199
then I'll let you go.

673
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:29,630
But if that is not the case,

674
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,030
let's go home. Okay?

675
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,469
Seo Yeon Joo, how did you find me here...

676
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:44,348
Hey, where's your sister? Let me talk to her.

677
00:55:44,349 --> 00:55:46,718
Hey, Yeon Joo. You shouldn't be here now.

678
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:48,348
- What? - Come on. Get out of here.

679
00:55:48,349 --> 00:55:49,650
You can't be here.

680
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:53,489
Where do you think you're going? Do you really want to die?

681
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:56,359
- Or do you want me to die? - Hey, Ha Jun Kyung.

682
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,889
Hey. You're Gyeo Rye's sister, right?

683
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,630
I'm his sister, girlfriend, and wife. What's your problem?

684
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,469
- What the... - Hey, let me punch you once more.

685
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,069
- Hey! Stop. That's enough. - You crazy little...

686
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,538
- Stop. - What can you do?

687
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:12,738
I must let myself go crazy to deal with this crazy woman.

688
00:56:12,739 --> 00:56:15,408
- Come here. Get out of here. - Hey, let go!

689
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:16,949
Yoon Gyeo Rye!

690
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,719
If you leave now, I will really die!

691
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,050
Hey!

692
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,789
Hold on. One moment, Yeon Joo.

693
00:56:27,389 --> 00:56:30,389
Okay. Open the door now. Seo Yeon Joo!

694
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,130
- Hey. - You little...

695
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,199
You shouldn't talk about death so easily, okay?

696
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,768
And you should not harass your family like this.

697
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:41,940
- Open the door! - Hey, get up.

698
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:45,070
Punch me all you want.

699
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:47,509
But I'm taking Gyeo Rye with me.

700
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,980
Shut your mouth!

701
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:52,809
Die! You fake little...

702
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,319
How dare you? I won't let you take him.

703
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,849
I'm going to take my own life and kill you too.

704
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:00,119
You little...

705
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,829
Come here.

706
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,299
I will really kill you. Who do you think you are?

707
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,928
You can't take him. I won't let you take him!

708
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,070
I will never let you steal him from me!

709
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:19,210
Hey.

710
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:22,579
Hey.

711
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,749
What is this here? Answer me.

712
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,849
Why do you live like this?

713
00:57:28,349 --> 00:57:30,388
Do you think you have more than one life?

714
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:32,320
Is that why you're letting yourself be a total wreck?

715
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,259
So how was it? What do you think now that you've tried it?

716
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:40,360
- Get off of me! - It's not easy to kill yourself.

717
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:42,460
But you're still saying you'd take your own life?

718
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:45,570
- Is death a joke to you? - Shut it!

719
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:49,070
What do you know? What do you even know?

720
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:52,369
You have no idea what it's like to live a hard life.

721
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:56,480
Don't be such a know-it-all when you know nothing!

722
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:08,059
These gloves.

723
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,760
I really cherish them,

724
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,690
but you can have them.

725
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:15,699
Please use them to protect yourself.

726
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,070
Also,

727
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:22,500
if you're having a really hard time, just come to the hospital.

728
00:58:23,969 --> 00:58:25,809
I will help you.

729
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:28,538
I won't hate you just because you hit me a little.

730
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:30,308
Sportsmanship, you know?

731
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:31,409
I'm off.

732
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,849
Stop.

733
00:58:33,949 --> 00:58:35,320
Stop right there!

734
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:45,889
Let's go.

735
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:48,699
Let's go.

736
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,869
Darn it.

737
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:02,579
You crazy little...

738
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,119
You jerk!

739
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:23,730
Stop.

740
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:44,750
Hey.

741
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:49,018
Can you please just leave us alone?

742
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:51,489
How about 700,000 dollars? Can you do it?

743
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,300
Did you say 700,000 dollars?

744
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:57,900
Okay, 700,000 dollars. Sure.

745
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:00,638
I will pay you back in full even if it takes a lifetime.

746
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,670
Forget it.

747
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,110
Just stay with Jun Kyung for the rest of your life,

748
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:08,039
and I'll take care of the money for you.

749
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:12,409
This is nuts. No, I will not do that.

750
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:14,549
You evil jerk.

751
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:17,049
Why must you do this to Jun Kyung? Just why?

752
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:19,989
For once, let me live an ordinary life like others do.

753
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,889
Okay, Seok Jun? Please!

754
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:31,070
It's her. Jun Kyung is dying because of her.

755
01:00:53,389 --> 01:00:54,420
Yoon Gyeo Rye.

756
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:58,889
Hey!

757
01:01:10,539 --> 01:01:12,440
Jun Kyung. No!

758
01:01:31,659 --> 01:01:35,659
(Will)

759
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:45,039
(Sonny, I will never forget you.)

760
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:01,659
(If You Wish Upon Me)

761
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:05,130
Are you going to tell Yoon Gyeo Rye?

762
01:02:05,489 --> 01:02:07,500
I think my son is watching over me.

763
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,960
You're the first person who came to my rescue and saved me.

764
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:12,869
It could put you in danger too, Yeon Joo.

765
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,340
You're just doing your job as a nurse.

766
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,610
Don't tell Mr. Kang.

767
01:02:17,969 --> 01:02:19,909
Don't you want to meet your real family?

768
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,440
Kang Tae Sik!

769
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,710
He's the most hardworking person I know!

770
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:27,880
Someone saw it while passing by.

771
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,250
Producer Bae Jae Seok, right?

772
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:32,519
I won't run away again.
