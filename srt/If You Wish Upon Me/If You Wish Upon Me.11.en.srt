(Yoon Ki Chun)

10
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,689
It's me.

11
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,799
Now? But...

12
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:02,770
Now is not a good time.

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,500
Okay.

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,540
I'm suddenly scheduled for a meeting.

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,780
Can you take a cab home with Jun Il?

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,279
Are you meeting Yoon Ki Chun again? At this hour?

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,290
No, it's about business.

18
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:24,958
I need to meet someone.

19
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,790
What business?

20
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,529
It's all a fraud!

21
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,659
It's not!

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Whatever.

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,170
Jun Il.

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,439
Would you take a cab home with Mom?

25
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:45,480
Sorry.

26
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,150
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,079
- Jun Il. Hop off. - Bye, Jun Il.

28
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,519
Bye.

29
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,770
Come here.

30
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:12,900
Kang Tae Sik! Here.

31
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,479
Didn't your wife complain today?

32
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,408
She didn't say much.

33
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,620
Don't lie. It shows.

34
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,789
She's afraid.

35
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:30,919
What do you mean?

36
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,359
That you'll realize your potential...

37
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,759
and leave her.

38
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,430
I know it from experience.

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,029
You were born with an outstanding business ability.

40
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,699
I can tell from your eyes.

41
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,339
- That's true. - Right?

42
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,370
You think so?

43
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,030
(Unknown Number)

44
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,870
Hello?

45
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:25,840
Hello? I'm calling from Chungwoon Hospital ER.

46
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,479
What?

47
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,758
Why are you blaming me? You killed her.

48
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,258
I never told you to abandon them on the street.

49
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,269
Who knew you were driving them home?

50
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,039
All those idiots who blame their faults...

51
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:54,039
on others must die.

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,780
Dad.

53
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,650
Don't look.

54
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:14,530
Get a grip. Do you know who I am?

55
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:16,529
I'm Yoon Ki Chun!

56
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,680
Mister.

57
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,519
Are you okay?

58
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,199
Mr. Kang. Are you okay?

59
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,269
- Yes, I'm okay. - Are you okay?

60
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,839
- Mr. Kang. Are you okay? - Mr. Kang.

61
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,980
Are you okay?

62
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:11,720
- Oh, right. - What?

63
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,179
What about Mr. Song?

64
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,148
He's resting in another room.

65
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,220
I see. I feel bad for him.

66
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,888
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,159
Why are you sorry? That's not the point now.

68
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,268
You shouldn't have left when you're in that condition.

69
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,529
How can you be so stupid?

70
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,970
Stay here.

71
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,740
We'll go to Mokpo without you.

72
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,879
No.

73
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,980
Let me do it.

74
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,378
I want to.

75
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:48,219
Seriously. You're so stubborn.

76
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,920
You never listen.

77
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:55,129
Under one condition.

78
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:57,759
What?

79
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,129
When we come back to Seoul,

80
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,370
you must get chemo.

81
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,480
Gyeo Rye.

82
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,479
I'm working in the hospice...

83
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,279
Whatever. Just do as I say.

84
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,279
I...

85
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,319
just want you...

86
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,360
to get chemo...

87
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,800
for one last time.

88
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,199
I want you to...

89
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,899
I want you...

90
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,910
to grant...

91
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,709
as many wishes as you can...

92
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,110
before you go.

93
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,789
You said you messed up your life.

94
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,050
You want to live the rest of your life as a wonderful Genie.

95
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,929
Then get chemo for goodness' sake.

96
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,259
You never listen. It's so upsetting.

97
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,970
Okay.

98
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,139
You're right.

99
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,709
Because I can never trust my partner,

100
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,339
I better live a long life.

101
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,709
He's right.

102
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,680
You can't rely on him. He's useless.

103
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,849
Right. I'm useless.

104
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,589
What about me? You can't trust me.

105
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,688
I've never been reliable.

106
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:34,359
Right? You can't trust me.

107
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,398
He already looks unreliable.

108
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,759
What does it have to do with my looks?

109
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,129
You're too handsome.

111
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,699
I thought...

112
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,269
I quit the janitor job.

(Restroom)

114
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,360
Where am I?

115
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:38,679
Who are you?

116
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:42,090
Hi.

117
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,059
Hi.

118
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,480
What's taking her so long?

119
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,759
My goodness.

120
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,360
What on earth happened?

121
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,730
Honey.

122
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:33,870
What happened to your hair?

123
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,610
Is everything all right?

124
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:39,480
What about my hair? Does it look weird?

125
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,889
Nevermind.

126
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,119
Did you meet someone on the way?

127
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,028
No. Who would I meet?

128
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:58,860
What are you doing here?

129
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,429
Are you here to pick me up?

130
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,898
I could just take the last bus.

131
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:04,600
You've never done this before.

132
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,370
I just wanted to.

133
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:10,809
Let's go home.

134
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,419
Well done today.

135
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,490
You too.

136
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,519
I need to get changed.

137
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,788
Let's just go home today.

138
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:29,288
I can't go home like this. No way.

139
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,329
Don't worry.

140
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,299

Hop in.

144
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,360
I'm sorry.

145
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:02,528
I should've been helpful, but I'm only holding you back.

146
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:03,959
Don't say that.

147
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,600
Forget it. It's cold. Hop in.

148
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,100
Don't forget to keep your promise.

149
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,169
That you'll get chemo.

150
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,539
Sorry. We're behind schedule because of me.

151
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,679
It's okay.

(Jooyoung Hospital)

153

All right.

154
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,720
Isn't his son really cute?

155
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:36,230
All kids are cute when they're young.

156
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,960
- I wasn't. - I can tell.

157
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,168
I'll hang Sonny's photo too.

158
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:44,600
My goodness.

159
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,739
I'm the only one...

160
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,408
- without a son. - Here.

161
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:51,038
How am I supposed to carry on without one?

162
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,110
There.

(Ambulance)

164
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:30,879
Hey, honey.

165
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,320
My.

166
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:53,970
Do you remember your sister's number?

167
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:58,779
Why?

168
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,249
Are you telling me to call Jun Kyung?

169
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,610
You want to know how she's doing.

170
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,879
Well, that's...

171
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,620
Facing her...

172
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,220
will be better than being on your toes.

173
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:15,960
- Have you ever faced her? - What?

174
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,429
If you've faced her all your life,

175
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
you'd rather be on your toes.

176
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:38,820
I've faced her too. I have.

177
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,220
But sometimes...

178
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,159
putting in effort is never enough.

179
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,769
- What about the test? - It went well.

180
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,070
- Is this adalya tea? - Yes.

181
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:03,409
There are more things that don't need effort in this world.

182
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:08,980
Like how I fell in love with you when you never tried.

183
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,820
That was throbbing, wasn't it?

184
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,120
I'm so good at making punch lines.

185
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:25,399
Hope is coy.

186
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,970
It only visits people who believe in it.

187
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,570
What?

188
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,869
Maybe I should become a writer.

189
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,569
- I'll get going. - Let's go.

190
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,009
(Ambulance)

191
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,289
I'm sorry...

192
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,629
about getting ugly in front of you.

193
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,129
Though I'm not completely recovered,

194
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,070
I've been doing well...

195
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,840
like the time before I got sick.

196
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,480
Recently, the doctor said...

197
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,379
the cancer...

198
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,250
spread from the stomach to the liver.

199
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,360
So I wanted to leave alone in peace.

200
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,159
But those two impatient children...

201
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:34,970
I got by chance...

202
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,970
told me to get chemo again.

203
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,970
They have no idea...

204
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,840
how difficult and painful that is.

205
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,919
Still, I made a promise.

206
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,320
I should keep it, right?

207
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,529
Right.

208
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,940
(Unit 403)

209
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,200
Don't.

210
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,630
What are you doing?

211
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,740
Don't come.

212
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,390
(Unit 403)

213
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,329
How does this work?

214
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,000
Gosh. It's broken.

215
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,409
It'll be hard to walk up there.

216
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,710
Now that the wheelchair is broken.

217
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,680
Can we go instead...

218
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,348
and deliver his message?

219
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:45,089
He said he wants to talk to them in person.

220
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:53,359
But how is he going to get up there?

221
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,869
One.

222
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,470
- Two. - What are you doing?

223
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,569
Gosh. Don't be childish.

224
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,640
Am I three? What are you doing?

225
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:10,578
Mr. Song. The house is on top of the hill.

226
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:13,980
If it's too difficult to go...

227
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,150
Are you going?

228
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,690
What are you... Hey! Wait up!

229
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:39,140
Gosh. Are you okay?

230
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:52,589
Do you want to switch?

231
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,289
- Yes, let's switch. - Okay.

232
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,759
Here, switch.

233
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,929
Oh, we're almost there.

234
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,069
- Really? We're almost there. - What?

235
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,069
Weren't we switching?

236
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,740
Sir, we're almost there.

237
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:14,750
We are.

238
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,480
Excuse me.

239
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:25,119
She's a foreigner.

240
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,088
Nurse Seo, go talk to her.

241
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,329
- Me? - Yes.

242
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:34,869
Hello.

243
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:37,930
Well, we are...

244
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:40,970
Who are you?

245
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,509
She can speak Korean.

246
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,779
By any chance, is this Mr. Lee Gil Yong's house?

247
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,750
Yes, it is.

248
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,649
But who are you?

249
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,750
This is the place.

250
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,119
Is Mr. Lee Gil Yong inside?

251
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,200
My husband left for another place last year.

252
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,439
Where did he go?

253
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,339
Where did he go to?

254
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,220
Thank you.

255
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,329
What was your husband's life like?

256
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,068
He wants to know how your husband lived...

257
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,029
after being released...

258
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,640
from prison while he was still alive.

259
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,740
After...

260
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,750
he served 22 years in prison,

261
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:59,420
he papered places...

262
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,549
with a limp.

263
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:06,559
We got married 15 years ago.

264
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,089
I see.

265
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,058
A few years ago, the real criminal got arrested.

266
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,059
Yes.

267
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,470
Then you should've appealed to the court for injustice.

268
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,869
Why didn't you?

269
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:23,640
Nobody was willing to help us.

270
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,380
And that idea had never crossed his mind.

271
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,619
"Even if the pain was unbearable,"

272
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,019
"I should've endured it until the end."

273
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,460
That's what my dad said the most.

274
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:04,919
Gosh.

275
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
(Where my dad is)

276
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,189
All the way there.

277
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,690
(Construction Notice)

278
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:16,028
His unjust prison life must have been truly frustrating...

279
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:18,859
to have chosen the highest place even here.

280
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:22,869
One.

281
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:24,700
What's with that?

282
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:25,970
One.

283
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,920
"Don't sweat anymore because of me. Let's go back."

284
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,349
Yes, you're right.

285
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,559
Sir, good idea.

286
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,490
Twice is a no.

287
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,528
We shouldn't make him feel uneasy.

288
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:54,058
Let's go.

289
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,230
We came all the way here. So, no way.

290
00:24:56,869 --> 00:25:00,369
No. Our effort until now will go to waste. We must go.

291
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:03,410
Sir, don't worry.

292
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,278
I'm the Wonder Woman in our hospice.

293
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,950
Get on my back. Here we go.

294
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,750
- I'm okay, so come on. Here. - Hey...

295
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,029
You're all doing this on purpose...

296
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,490
- for me to hear it. - Let's go.

297
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:25,799
Stop it.

298
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,799
Listen. This is why...

299
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,670
people should use their bodies.

300
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,769
When you use your body,

301
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:41,650
you can't think about anything.

302
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:45,420
So there's no room to be depressed or whatever.

303
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,259
I'm not saying this for you to feel bad.

304
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:53,890
Using my body like this...

305
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:56,358
will help me get a good night's sleep today.

306
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,729
Yes, you'll sleep like a baby.

307
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,630
- Even the food will taste good. - Of course.

308
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,369
Sir.

309
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,200
When I just came to the hospice,

310
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:10,069
the first wish I fulfilled was for an old man.

311
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:15,180
But I made a slip of the tongue to him.

312
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,549
We have a patient at the back.

313
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,680
So be careful when you drive.

314
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,990
Darn it. Does it even matter?

315
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,660
He's about to croak anyway.

316
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,089
I couldn't apologize at the time.

317
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,259
And it keeps bothering me even now.

318
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,569
So I understand how you feel.

319
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,700
Yes. You should say what you want.

320
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:42,609
Even if it's tough,

321
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,309
we have to go.

322
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,078
- Let's go. - Let's go.

323
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,720
Sir, we're almost there.

324
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,819
Let's go.

325
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,058
(RIP Lee Gil Yong)

326
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:04,058
(Lived from April 8, 1948 to October 5, 2020)

327
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:06,400
(Please rest in peace now.)

328
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,849
I will lend you my voice starting now.

329
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,259
Here I go.

330
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,159
"I have lived cowardly..."

331
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,299
"for the past 46 years..."

332
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,460
"without facing the truth."

333
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,069
"My real wish..."

334
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,869
"is to turn back time."

335
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:49,740
"But that's impossible."

336
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,269
Song Chang Woo.

337
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,539
Hey, Chang Woo. So you saw...

338
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,940
this punk leave that house, didn't you?

339
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,249
Darn it. Earlier, you told me it was him.

340
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,019
So why are you changing your word now?

341
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,220
I told you I wasn't sure.

342
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,788
We were far away. So I couldn't distinguish his face.

343
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:44,930
- You little... - No, don't.

344
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,369
No. It wasn't me.

345
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,099
I swear it wasn't me.

346
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,500
It wasn't me. Please believe me.

347
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,970
I'm telling the truth.

348
00:28:57,309 --> 00:28:59,680
That punk is the criminal.

349
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,180
So you only need to nod your head.

350
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,119
Do you want to end up like him?

351
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,589
Why did you change your answer now?

352
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,859
I only answered as you asked.

353
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,390
I clearly told you I wasn't sure from...

354
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,798
This punk's an orphan, has a long criminal record,

355
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,999
and will end up in jail for the rest of his life,

356
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,299
even without your testimony.

357
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,369
By any chance,

358
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,240
aren't you the criminal?

359
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,049
I heard it wasn't your usual time to deliver the newspapers.

360
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,479
That was what the supply manager told me.

361
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,518
No, it's not me. I swear.

362
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,990
Tell me straight, jerk.

363
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:45,119
Is it you or him?

364
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,920
"Back then, I was too young."

365
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,160
"I was terrified and scared."

366
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,559
"So just like that detective had claimed,"

367
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:57,769
"I thought the culprit..."

368
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,200
"could be you."

369
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,940
Yes, it was this guy.

370
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,019
Good job, Chang Woo. You should've said so faster.

371
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,078
Then I wouldn't have beaten you up.

372
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,250
Why do punks always need a good beating to remember?

373
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,078
"You were imprisoned unjustly because of me."

374
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,710
"And yet, I never once came to see you or contacted you."

375
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,819
"I resent myself for that."

376
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,720
"I'm sorry."

377
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:56,390
I'm sorry.

378
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:01,160
The one word I spouted when I was young...

379
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:06,200
ruined...

380
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,309
your one and only life...

381
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,180
completely.

382
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,549
I'm sorry.

383
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,150
I'm terribly...

384
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,819
sorry.

385
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,250
"I'm terribly sorry."

386
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:05,130
Don't blame yourself too much.

387
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,559
The detectives...

388
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,599
who did wrong to those kids back then...

389
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,410
should have apologized first and not you.

390
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,789
I don't want to drive the car he's in.

391
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,460
(Transferring Patient)

392
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,899
You should've told me the content of the letter first.

393
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,299
- Hey, Yoon Gyeo Rye. - What?

394
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:42,769
If I had known it was such a wish,

395
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:45,199
I would not have driven all the way here...

396
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,470
nor worked my buttocks off.

397
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,868
You can't judge whether he has the right to a last wish or not.

398
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:53,210
Then what about the man who died after living his life in injustice?

399
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,710
Just because he was a powerless orphan,

400
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,250
he lived in injustice all his life.

401
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,420
What right did this man have to do that?

402
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:11,930
I want...

403
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,829
to be alone.

404
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:17,869
Hey, Gyeo Rye. Yoon Gyeo Rye!

405
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:19,569
Leave him be.

406
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,809
Darn it.

407
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:41,660
(Transferring Patient)

408
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:06,778
Are you okay?

409
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,480
Yes, I'm okay.

410
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,750
I took some medicine, and it soothed the pain.

411
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,090
I can drive. But let's take a short break.

412
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,130
Yoon Gyeo Rye, that punk.

413
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:22,769
I thought he had matured, but I was wrong. He's a bit...

414
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,769
Don't be too mean to Gyeo Rye.

415
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,940
I would have done the same.

416
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,840
What do you mean?

417
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,840
Yoon Ki Chun.

418
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,280
Imagine if you had helped out a man...

419
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,389
like Yoon Ki Chun.

420
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:47,019
That man.

421
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:50,690
How did you meet him for the first time?

422
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,800
Through a private loan.

423
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,139
After I graduated middle school,

424
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,710
I earned money by polishing shoes.

425
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:04,710
I invested all that money into a restaurant.

426
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:08,980
And that restaurant thrived.

427
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,409
So...

428
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,480
I was going to open branches...

429
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:17,119
but didn't have enough money.

430
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,119
Were you harassed because you couldn't pay back the money?

431
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,519
No.

432
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,800
Goodness, you're really something.

433
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:33,368
How did you make all this money in just one month and a half?

434
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:35,300
I only slept 2 to 3 hours a day...

435
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,610
and saved up tenaciously...

436
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,110
in fear you might drop by again.

437
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,319
From now on, why don't you try...

438
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,420
earning money in an ordinary way instead of like this?

439
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:54,920
I heard you had a son.

440
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:56,860
So do it for his sake.

441
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,629
And please stop by my gukbap place.

442
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,530
I'll treat you to a delicious bowl of gukbap.

443
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,669
Thank you for the coffee.

444
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,739
What do you mean...

445
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,340
by like this?

446
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:16,849
Excuse me?

447
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,960
I'm asking what an ordinary way is.

448
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:34,530
Loosen up, Mr. Kang.

449
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,199
Why don't we...

450
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,440
make some money in an ordinary way together?

451
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:54,519
I got blinded by my greed.

452
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:59,119
It would be nice if relationships that harm each other...

453
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,820
veer away.

454
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,059
But life...

455
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,530
never works how you want it.

456
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,880
I shouldn't have told you this story.

457
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:25,650
We have Mr. Song with us.

458
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:27,349
So let's go.

459
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,019
I guess this jerk's not coming.

460
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,969
Here. Dig in.

461
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,679
It's good.

462
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,750
You're the best, honey.

463
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:25,440
I want...

464
00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:27,679
to stop now.

465
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,050
What? Stop what?

466
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,090
This fling.

467
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,559
Frillice?

468
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,630
Do you want frillice?

469
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,030
Wait here.

470
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:54,840
There must be some in the fridge.

(Sooeun Express)

472
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,519
Right. It'll take a long time.

473
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:11,889
He said he'll even go to the US if he has to.

474
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:15,159
He's getting worse lately.

475
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:20,300
The house is on the top.

476
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:21,800
You're going?

477
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,710
"My real wish is to turn back time."

478
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:40,619
"But that's impossible."

479
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,138
Oh, I see. It's stuffy, isn't it?

480
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:00,840
Be quiet!

481
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,070
I'm sorry.

00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,969
Excuse me, ma'am.

Here.

486

You can take my seat. That way, it'll be more comfortable for you.

Thank you.

00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,119

- Let's go. - Hey, Gyeo Rye.

492
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:01,658
I got off the bus to buy some walnut cookies,

493
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,570
but they left without me.

494
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,969
I should just go with you guys.

495
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,380
My gosh. He's a terrible actor.

My goodness.

They say you're bound to cross paths with those you're meant to meet.

501

Right? I was thinking the same thing.

506
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,300
Have some.

507

Don't eat all of them, okay?

00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,050
Save some for Yeon Joo.

511
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,750
My gosh. So you won't even hide that you're looking out for her.

512
00:42:31,389 --> 00:42:32,619
Let's go!

513
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:49,769
So you're the one by my side?

514
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:52,809
I hate that.

515
00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:58,309
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

516
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,579
Do I look okay to you?

517
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,420
Clearly, you're okay.

518
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:05,849
Don't skip meals. I'm off.

519
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,920
Do you have a crush on me?

520
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,760
Be honest.

521
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:17,530
You love me, don't you?

522
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,599
Got a death wish?

523
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,268
I woke up,

524
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:24,739
so why won't you ask me where Gyeo Rye is and where I found him?

525
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,408
You should ask me right away and hit the road to go catch him.

526
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:28,409
Why are you still here...

527
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,510
I will go catch him when I want to.

528
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:38,949
Darn it.

529
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,460
I will really kill you.

530
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:44,960
Once I'm done sorting out my thoughts,

531
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:49,260
I'll text you and tell you where Gyeo Rye is.

532
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:21,760
Hey.

533
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,099
Watch where you're going.

534
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,619
Darn you.

535
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:44,320
Hey, you think I wasn't watching properly?

536
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:48,489
How dare you tell me to watch where I'm going?

537
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:51,089
How wide should I open my eyes then?

538
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,899
How wide?

539
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,030
How wide? Answer me!

540
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,829
We should've made sure...

541
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:27,460
that his wish was perfectly fulfilled.

542
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:30,130
I wish we could've taken him there as soon as he remembered it,

543
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,469
but time doesn't wait for anyone.

544
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:41,809
That's true.

545
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,150
But I know you did your best, Mr. Kang.

546
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,550
You tried. That alone must've comforted him a lot.

547
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,328
That room at the end of the hallway on the fourth floor.

548
00:46:01,329 --> 00:46:03,530
Is there that much to do in that room? I always see...

549
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,030
people going in and out of that room.

550
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:08,569
Yes, there is a lot to do.

551
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:09,609
Like what?

552
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:12,268
I'm a nurse, so I had to check things like...

553
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,509
his blood pressure and pulse.

554
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,578
I also had to change the IV bags and move him once in a while...

555
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:18,110
to prevent bedsores.

556
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,348
My gosh. I didn't work out so hard just to make sure...

557
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:23,190
that jerk wouldn't get bedsores.

558
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,689
As for Mr. Hwang,

559
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,259
he's the only man, so he helped him get changed.

560
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,558
And the ladies always made sure the room was sparkling clean.

561
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:32,529
Changing the water in the humidifier, letting fresh air in...

562
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,400
There's a lot of work to do.

563
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,559
Right.

564
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:38,670
That is a lot of work.

565
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,639
Hey, I am grateful for your help.

566
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:45,669
But if he wakes up,

567
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:48,440
don't talk to him. Just leave the room right away.

568
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,879
If he asks you about Mr. Kang, just say that you don't know him...

569
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,219
and tell him that you're new.

570
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,518
Actually, no. Keep your mouth shut and just leave the room right away.

571
00:46:56,519 --> 00:46:57,649
- Okay. - Don't say anything, okay?

572
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,959
All right, I heard you. I'll figure it out.

573
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,159
I'm not a kid. My goodness.

574
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:05,190
You and your nagging.

575
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:11,069
Well, can I just say one more thing while I'm at it?

576
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,268
No. I hate being nagged. Don't do it.

577
00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:15,638
- I'm still going to say it. - No, don't.

578
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:16,969
I'm going to do it.

579
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,468
What is it?

580
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:20,979
- Not this one. It looks messy. - Okay.

581
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,980
Here.

582
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,919
What? You want me to eat this?

583
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,849
No. Take it.

584
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:35,789
Sir, I should get going.

585
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,960
Why? What is this?

586
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,929
I want to donate the rest of my money.

587
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,510
The recipient's address is 39-2 Eulyang-ro,

588
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:54,880
Mokpo, South Jeolla Province.

589
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:06,789
Oh, boy.

590
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,659
Why are you getting out from that side?

591
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:18,730
Where did Gyeo Rye go?

592
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:22,300
I told him to go deliver something.

593
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,110
Deliver what?

594
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:26,980
Walnut cookies.

595
00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:30,409
I told him that he should go see his sister.

596
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,320
Hey, Ha Jun Kyung.

597
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:11,920
Jun Kyung.

598
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,988
- Let's have another great day. - Yes.

599
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:46,519
- Let's go! - Let's go!

600
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:50,859
- Hello. - There you are.

601
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,198
My gosh, I'm late. I apologize.

602
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:54,900
What? What's with you all of a sudden?

603
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,469
If you're not busy... I mean,

604
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:58,530
we're all busy.

605
00:49:58,531 --> 00:50:01,239
But how about we have some coffee before we get busier?

606
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,969
Oh, would you like some coffee?

607
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:08,409
What kind of coffee though?

608
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:11,550
Where should I go to make coffee?

609
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:18,449
Well, ma'am.

610
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,360
How long have you worked here?

611
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,500
Do they pay you on time?

612
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:31,630
My husband and I depend on my pay.

613
00:50:31,769 --> 00:50:34,969
Everything he makes goes into paying my in-laws' hospital bills.

614
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:39,539
Yes, they pay us on time.

615
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:43,280
They pay and feed us well.

616
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:46,750
I see. I'm so glad to hear that.

617
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,518
Someone cut her hair?

618
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:54,960
Are you sure she didn't do it herself?

619
00:50:56,789 --> 00:50:57,960
I'm not sure.

620
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,859
The last thing she remembers...

621
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,969
is going to the fourth floor to clean the restroom.

622
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:07,199
So I can't help but suspect that man.

623
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:08,670
But the thing is,

624
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:11,509
he's still unconscious.

625
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,509
Who else in this hospital...

626
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:15,210
would do such a thing to my wife?

627
00:51:15,809 --> 00:51:18,150
If he has really regained his consciousness...

628
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,949
What do we do now?

629
00:51:23,019 --> 00:51:26,889
Anyway, her condition is progressing quickly now.

630
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:31,559
I hope Mr. Kang can take her to the Netherlands soon.

631
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,030
My dear Duk Ja...

632
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,360
She'll be able to go there, right?

633
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:40,739
Yes. Of course, she can.

634
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:42,969
Mr. Kang...

635
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,269
Our Genie said he'd make sure she could go there.

636
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,389
Why won't you eat?

637
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,230
Do you really want to die?

638
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,969
Let's go out.

639
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:19,340
I'm craving gopchang. The food here is awful.

640
00:52:20,909 --> 00:52:23,750
And I want to go shopping too.

641
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,760
My gosh, this is so good.

642
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:41,960
Why aren't you eating? It's cooked. Eat up.

643
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:43,230
Is it that good?

644
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,230
Yes, it's so delicious.

645
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:49,268
Is gopchang your favorite food?

646
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:51,710
No. Curry, without carrots.

647
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:53,880
I see.

648
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,809
But you're devouring it as if it's your favorite dish.

649
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,320
Well, it's like my third favorite.

650
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,218
Anyway, it's really good.

651
00:53:03,219 --> 00:53:04,820
Have some. It's so tasty.

652
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,159
You know. That guy, Jin Gu. The vet.

653
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:16,769
He moved to Paju.

654
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:17,969
He went on a blind date,

655
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:19,699
fell in love at first sight, and got engaged.

656
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:20,900
Crazy, right?

657
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,639
She doesn't suit him. She's really pretty.

658
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,210
- How did you find out? - Social media.

659
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,980
He's been bragging about it nonstop.

660
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:30,750
Is there anything I can brag about?

661
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:34,780
Your face.

662
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,420
What?

663
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,820
Take a selfie, and you can brag about your face.

664
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:50,030
That's gross. What was that?

665
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:52,530
Well, you're right.

666
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,969
That said, how about we take a selfie together?

667
00:53:58,369 --> 00:53:59,408
Come closer.

668
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:01,178
Why? Just take it by yourself.

669
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:04,009
Come on. Come closer. And smile a little.

670
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:05,179
Are you at a funeral?

671
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,679
Okay, here we go. 1, 2, 3.

672
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:13,289
(Mr. Pyo)

673
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,289
(Mr. Pyo)

674
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:35,880
Hey! It's you, right?

675
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:39,010
This is Lee Yeon Bok, my college friend.

676
00:54:39,949 --> 00:54:41,149
Gosh, you're such a joker.

677
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:43,019
- Seok Jun. - Say hi.

678
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,489
What?

679
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:45,650
You know...

680
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,618
What is it?

681
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:48,889
Have you got some time?

682
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:50,760
What are you talking about?

683
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,460
If you have some time,

684
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:58,599
without me and Gyeo Rye knowing,

685
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,300
could you kill us both?

686
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:37,409
Hey, are you working the night shift today?

687
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:43,280
You can do it.

688
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:00,929
Enter the "I can hurt your feelings" contest.

689
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:03,599
You'll probably win the contest.

690
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:15,309
Dr. Yang.

691
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,559
I would probably win if such a contest really existed.

692
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:41,099
I won't say sorry.

693
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,409
This isn't something to be sorry about.

694
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:47,539
Because I know...

695
00:56:49,179 --> 00:56:52,010
that you'll meet an amazing person...

696
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:53,719
with a great sense of humor.

697
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:58,690
She'll make you laugh more than you thought you ever could,

698
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:00,889
and you two will live a happy life together.

699
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,429
I'll get going, then.

700
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,869
(Room 403)

701
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,070
And a man, who lived an evil life...

702
00:57:52,809 --> 00:57:56,280
No, an evil criminal, who committed all kinds of crimes,

703
00:57:57,409 --> 00:57:58,949
became the victim.

704
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:27,039
(Room 403)

705
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:34,550
Gosh, that scumbag.

706
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:37,420
I'm telling you.

707
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:41,190
If you messed with me,

708
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,360
you wouldn't be lying down so comfortably now.

709
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,429
How dare you do such a thing to Mr. Kang?

710
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,099
I'd punch you in a heartbeat if I could.

711
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,500
Darn you. You see,

712
00:58:56,670 --> 00:59:00,539
I'm not like Nurse Seo and the other elders.

713
00:59:00,739 --> 00:59:02,239
Shall I spare you or not?

714
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:09,179
Well, Nurse Seo sent me here,

715
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,789
so I should do my job.

716
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:15,059
Hold on. What did she tell me to do first?

717
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:18,058
First off... Let's see.

718
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:19,658
Hold on. This is...

719
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:21,559
I don't know how to use this.

720
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,900
Gosh, this scumbag.

721
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:27,569
Why should we keep him alive?

722
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:30,069
This jerk. You little...

723
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,570
Should I just take him off the ventilator?

724
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:33,570
He's an evil scumbag.

725
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,279
I'm sorry. I said, I'm sorry.

726
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,780
What the heck...

727
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,889
What...

728
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:21,190
(If You Wish Upon Me)

729
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:24,429
You're sure he was unconscious the whole time, right?

730
01:00:24,929 --> 01:00:26,360
Are you the captain here?

731
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:28,059
That's me.

732
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,260
You should check.

733
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,869
Thanks.

734
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:34,570
Do you want to come in for some ramyeon?

735
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:37,940
I want to send him there.

736
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:41,280
Don't tell anyone that I regained consciousness.

737
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,210
What are you doing here?

738
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:45,980
What? Where is he?

739
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,050
Do you still miss Sonny?

740
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:51,519
Who?
