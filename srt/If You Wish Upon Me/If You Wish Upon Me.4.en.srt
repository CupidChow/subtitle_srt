(If You Wish Upon Me)

7
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,039
Don't bother my sister!

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,339
She's not even your real sister.

9
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,509
You two don't even know what your parents look like.

10
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,980
You're two peas in a pod.

11
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:14,249
Hi, guys! It's been a while. Thank you.

12
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,048
Thanks for all your support.

13
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,079
What do you guys want? You want me to take this off?

14
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,218
Then how much will you give me?

15
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:21,290
Thanks for the stars. Thank you!

16
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,829
Don't be scared.

17
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,500
People like us...

18
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:36,500
are better off dead.

19
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,390
(Episode 4)

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,700
Gosh.

21
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:10,099
Sonny.

22
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,599
Did you sleep well?

23
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,789
Is this your bedroom now?

24
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,598
What is it? It's still so early.

25
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,500
Can you run an errand for me, Little Captain?

26
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:53,379
"Little Captain?" Seriously?

27
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,479
I never said I wanted the captain title.

28
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,448
Goodness. If they want to give me that title,

29
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:03,050
they should make it official.

30
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,819
Or pay me to do the job.

31
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,930
Right, Sonny?

32
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,729
Besides, I'm taller than Mr. Kang.

33
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,500
Why should I be the "Little Captain?"

34
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,210
(Premium Curry)

35
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,408
(Premium Curry)

36
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,620
It's 7.50 dollars.

37
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,889
Your mother?

38
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:35,919
Father?

39
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,219
- Grandmother? - Pardon me?

40
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,229
You must be visiting your family in the hospice hospital. Am I wrong?

41
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,929
I'm a volunteer worker.

42
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,969
I guess you're more compassionate than you seem.

43
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,439
Here.

44
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,509
Here.

45
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,750
Who pays for a gift?

46
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,389
(If You Wish Upon Me)

47
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:46,620
He will actually come here.

48
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,129
He contacted Mr. Kang first and said he'd be here.

49
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,969
We've had a few local singers visit us in the past,

50
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,439
but never such a famous celebrity.

51
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:02,069
Why did he suddenly change his mind?

52
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,370
Oh, here.

53
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,279
- What's this? Assault? - My gosh.

54
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,388
To Pyo Gyu Tae, this is like a golden opportunity.

55
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,060
This scandal just broke out, so why wouldn't he come here?

56
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,628
The CEO of his agency will come here to take photos and post them.

57
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,729
They'll ask some reporters they know to write articles about it,

58
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,799
which will say it was planned long ago.

59
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,159
You know?

60
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,230
My gosh.

61
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,398
How come you know everything?

62
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,769
I mean, you're only 13.

63
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,170
It's because she's always glued to her phone.

64
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,740
Anyway,

65
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,749
you said it'd be nothing strange if you died tomorrow from overwork.

66
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,319
Hey, Mr. Social Worker. Why are you back?

67
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,819
I want to see a celebrity before I work myself to death.

68
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,759
- My gosh. - Oh, no!

69
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:54,860
Gosh, that must've hurt.

70
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,629
Silly you.

71
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,068
- Here. - Thanks.

72
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:05,139
- Hi, Sonny! - My gosh.

73
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,670
- Here's your card. - Thanks.

74
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,409
- Bye. - Bye!

75
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,980
Is he the new guy doing community service?

76
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:13,778
Yes, that's right.

77
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:15,479
He's handsome. Unnecessarily handsome.

78
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,609
Why is it unnecessary?

79
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,250
He's here to do community service. Why does he need a handsome face?

80
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:20,949
Wait and see.

81
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,459
It'll definitely come in handy at least once.

82
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:27,088
Oh, my gosh!

83
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:30,430
You must be so nervous. You finally get to meet him in person.

84
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:31,930
I am nervous indeed.

85
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:34,569
But why do you fancy someone like him?

86
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,500
You have weird taste in men.

87
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,240
Why? What's wrong with him?

88
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,040
Well, I've heard some things. Seo Jin told me...

89
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,539
that he was a womaniser.

90
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,139
Apparently, he's very rude too.

91
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,509
And this time, he hit someone... Gosh.

92
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:48,779
Oh, boy.

93
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,679
Well, it's not like I have zero personality flaws.

94
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,189
My gosh. You know that about yourself?

95
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,420
Yes.

96
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,920
No one's perfect.

97
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,189
Still, I'd never fall for a guy like Pyo Gyu Tae.

98
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,258
Se Hee! He's here.

99
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,529
He's here? Pyo Gyu Tae? Oh, my goodness!

100
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,430
Right.

101
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,240
Even if he tests your patience,

102
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:14,670
don't fight at the hospital.

103
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,279
Okay, fine.

104
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,540
My gosh! He's here!

105
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,579
Are you ready? Shall we go see him too?

106
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,389
- My, look at that car. - That car consumes a lot of fuel.

107
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,389
- Shut it. - Gosh! Oh, my goodness!

108
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,328
This country has no oil reserves. Why must he drive such a huge car?

109
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:40,100
What's with all the fuss? He's no big deal.

110
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,869
This is a huge deal.

111
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,328
I've never seen a celebrity before in real life.

112
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,639
My gosh! This is so cool.

113
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,338
Who cares about celebrities? Don't be so lame.

114
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,170
Celebrities are human too, just like us.

115
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,938
What's your problem?

116
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:51,980
He's coming out.

117
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:53,980
He's coming out.

118
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:05,459
My gosh!

119
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,088
Gosh, it's so far.

120
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:09,088
Goodness. He's so arrogant.

121
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,128
Look how tall he is.

122
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:12,860
My gosh. Celebrities are a different species.

123
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,729
What are you talking about? He looks just like me.

124
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,439
Thank you for coming all the way here.

125
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,970
You know it's not because of you, right?

126
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:23,208
And it sure isn't because of the letter your friends delivered.

127
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,879
I didn't even read it.

128
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:44,759
Well, it doesn't matter why you decided to come here.

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,960
I'm counting on you.

130
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:55,470
Oh, there she is. That's Se Hee.

131
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,179
What's going on here?

132
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,850
What?

133
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,429
Where is Im Se Hee?

134
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,360
Where is she?

135
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,330
Right there.

136
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:22,870
That is Se Hee.

137
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:24,769
Yes, right here.

138
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,909
So you're...

139
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,279
Im Se Hee, the aspiring musical actress?

140
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:37,720
I've done an ensemble, a creative musical.

141
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,620
So I am a musical actress.

142
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,120
A rookie musical actress.

143
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,120
Sure, whatever.

144
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:49,659
So?

145
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,700
What do you want to do?

146
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,370
A musical. That's what I want to do.

147
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,139
Here at this hospital.

148
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,299
I see.

149
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,779
But can the audio equipment come in here?

150
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,279
Not to mention the lighting equipment.

151
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,110
Nothing can be done here. This place is so lame.

152
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,949
He can say that because we aren't paying him.

153
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,549
What's with the youngsters these days?

154
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,120
You little...

155
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,120
Why? What did I do?

156
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:21,059
- We used to be like that too. - Yes.

157
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:23,559
It's because they have a lot of energy.

158
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,499
I like it. It's cute.

159
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,669
My goodness. Cute, my foot.

160
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,298
All right. Team Genie has done its job.

161
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,269
We'll leave you two to talk.

162
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,340
I'm not done yet.

163
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,940
- What? - I said I wanted to do a musical,

164
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,509
but I never said it'd be a duet.

165
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,250
The script I wrote needs an ensemble.

166
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,059
At least...

167
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,230
seven people, I'd say?

168
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,809
What?

169
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,549
- What? - Seven.

170
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,749
- What is it? - Seven?

171
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,220
What are you talking about?

172
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,620
I'm doomed.

173
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,860
("The Miracle of Love")

174
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,000
Is this about me?

175
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,099
The ghost of an unknown actress...

176
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,769
and a top star. And their love story.

177
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:38,870
This story is...

178
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,409
It's too trite, don't you think?

179
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,440
Life is trite.

180
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,250
When people see a movie or drama about someone who's terminally ill,

181
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:51,450
they say it's unoriginal and too predictable.

182
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:53,919
But it's actually something...

183
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,159
that happens every day here at this hospital.

184
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,419
Besides,

185
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,589
no one in this world can avoid death.

186
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,158
- So you don't want to change it? - No, I don't.

187
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,570
- How about you forgo the ensemble? - No, I will not.

188
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:17,840
I'm already so worried.

189
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,279
By the way, what is a musical?

190
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,250
It's not a new type of perm, is it?

191
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,519
It's like a show, where the actors sing and dance.

192
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,518
I really hate dancing.

193
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,860
Come on. You need natural talent to do these things.

194
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,589
What? Why? I think it'll be fun.

195
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,999
Sure, it'll be fun for you, kiddo. But look at us.

196
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,229
She can barely walk because of her bad knees.

197
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,600
This makes no sense.

198
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:49,669
You're not saying you can't do it, right?

199
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,379
No. When did we say that? That's not what you meant, right?

200
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,350
Well, based on what Se Hee told us, I think it'll be really fun.

201
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,419
- Let's give it a shot. - Count me out.

202
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:03,789
This isn't what I'm here to do. You can't make me sing and dance.

203
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,190
I'd rather carry heavy things all day.

204
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:10,389
Am I playing Ms. Choi? And Gyeo Rye is Mr. Yoon?

205
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,159
Are they a couple?

206
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,899
Yes. They're supporting characters.

207
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,470
Why do I have to play a couple...

208
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,599
with that weird woman?

209
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,569
I'm weird? Says the man who is all messed up.

210
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,638
You're rotten, way past the expiration date.

211
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,440
Yes, I'm rotten to the core.

212
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,179
That's exactly what I wanted.

213
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,549
A woman who's a weirdo and a man who's messed up.

214
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,419
Se Hee, I am clearly not a weirdo.

215
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:40,018
- What's so funny? - Oh, right.

216
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,258
And we need a director.

217
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:44,860
Here's someone who's doing nothing.

218
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,429
Mr. Kang.

219
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,139
Nice.

220
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:53,299
(Multi-purpose Room)

221
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,139
Mr. Pyo.

222
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,709
You know...

223
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,379
- This is... - Everyone will do their best.

224
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,080
Gyeo Rye.

225
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,219
Hey, what's gotten into you?

226
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,720
Why are you suddenly calling me by my first name?

227
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,690
I'm sorry about the day we first met.

228
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,429
I never had a chance to apologize to you properly, so I felt bad.

229
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,299
Thank you...

230
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,139
for doing the musical with us.

231
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,620
Well...

232
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:42,689
I'm here to complete my community service hours.

233
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,219
But all of a sudden, you guys are telling me...

234
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,129
to do this musical called "The Miracle of Love."

235
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,199
I've never done such a thing before,

236
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,100
so I'm flustered.

237
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,600
So am I. I've never done a musical before either,

238
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,168
so I don't want to act love scenes with you in my first musical.

239
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:02,969
I have standards too.

240
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,038
Standards? What do you mean? What's wrong with me?

241
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,079
What about me?

242
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,808
I've never had anyone tell me that I'm ugly.

243
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,349
What's his problem?

244
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,179
You said I was rotten,

245
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,288
way past my expiration date.

246
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,548
How could you say such a mean thing to someone?

247
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,418
Who provoked me first?

248
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:20,289
You two look really cute together.

249
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,599
Se Hee, that's mean.

250
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,298
I like muscular men.

251
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:30,330
I've got muscles. I'm...

252
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,769
Sure.

253
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,970
He's full of himself.

254
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,209
Gosh, seriously. Everyone here is so weird.

255
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,679
- How cute. - What?

256
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,749
You two are cute. Must be nice!

257
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,209
Hey, kid. What do you even know?

258
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,649
What?

259
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,449
And you. Shouldn't you be at school?

260
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,620
- Shouldn't you be studying? - Gosh!

261
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:52,789
- I can't stand... - What?

262
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,960
a young man who talks like a boomer.

263
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Hey. Gosh, that little brat.

264
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,799
I talk like a boomer? Goodness.

265
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,870
Knowing that we will meet again

266
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,369
Makes me so happy

267
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,779
I will wait, wherever I am

268
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,249
I will wait, however long it may take

269
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,689
I will wait for the day

270
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,289
When we can be reunited

271
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:29,889
We will meet again

272
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:37,200
("Everyone's Miracle")

273
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,169
- Seriously. - It's so boring.

274
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,950
Hey, what's this? A script?

275
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,110
I guess you want to become an actress.

276
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,678
Seo Jin, you always hang out with grandmas,

277
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,350
so I thought you wanted to be a grandma.

278
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:55,720
You want to be an actress?

279
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,590
She's such an attention seeker.

280
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,460
Why do that here? She can practice at her parents' karaoke lounge.

281
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,858
Her parents run a karaoke lounge?

282
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,099
Hey, you didn't know?

283
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,630
Her parents hired some women to entertain male customers.

284
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,939
But her classmate happened to be one of the women's son.

285
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,469
He told everyone about it, so no one wants to be friends with her.

286
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,339
Oh, poor thing.

287
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,910
I'm tearing up.

288
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,979
But don't her parents own a few bars too?

289
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,778
- Really? - Maybe...

290
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:26,749
her dad is a gangster!

291
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,650
- Oh, no. - My gosh.

292
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:34,058
Love may be

293
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:39,529
Another name for a miracle

294
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,669
Perhaps, a miracle and love

295
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:49,170
Mean the same thing

296
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:51,279
True love

297
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,519
Aren't you going home?

298
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:00,849
What?

299
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,369
Do you want to become a musical actress?

300
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,740
No.

301
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,970
It's just for something I have to do.

302
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,309
But you're a good singer.

303
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,640
You should do it.

304
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:30,880
Well...

305
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,849
By the way,

306
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,150
you miss school so often. Is that okay?

307
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:38,390
What if you can't graduate?

308
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:43,690
Oh, I'll make sure I meet the graduation requirements.

309
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,799
By the way, how did you know...

310
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,339
that I missed school often?

311
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,269
You notice these things when you're paying attention.

312
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,109
I see.

313
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,910
Don't mind what your classmates say. Come to school.

314
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,349
It's not like they'll stay in your life forever.

315
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,380
It's your life.

316
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,420
If you waste your precious time because of them,

317
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
you'll regret it later.

318
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,789
Hey.

319
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,200
Yes?

320
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,099
Thanks.

321
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,970
For what?

322
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,769
For paying attention to me.

323
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,839
Oh, sure.

324
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,940
Right, I'm running late for my after-school class.

325
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,509
I have to go.

326
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:36,150
Bye.

327
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,079
Hey, wait. Practice hard.

328
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,119
You can become a musical actress. You got this.

329
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,778
This has to be powerful. Like this.

330
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:07,710
- Okay. - And this has to look cute.

331
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:09,049
- Then do a turn. - My gosh.

332
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:10,049
Wait, hold on.

333
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,149
You got it, right? Okay?

334
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,150
Okay!

335
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,190
A miracle will come

336
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:20,690
Love is

337
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,130
Love is for many

338
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,700
I will wait, however long it may take

339
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:36,869
Clap along.

340
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:47,849
Oh, my. I see that you're practicing hard.

341
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,758
Darn it. Seriously. For goodness' sake.

342
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,130
What is it?

343
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,159
You make me clean, cook,

344
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,000
drive, run errands,

345
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,029
and even sing and dance now.

346
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:06,440
How is this volunteer work?

347
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,339
So are you going to quit?

348
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,779
It's Se Hee's wish.

349
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,210
Stretch those arms out.

350
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,778
You two are strangely alike.

351
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,319
People would think that he's your son.

352
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,490
For real?

353
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,990
Goodness.

354
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,919
She's crazy.

355
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,990
Forget it.

356
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,730
My first answer.

357
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,028
What answer?

358
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:38,240
I told you I was going to guess the food you like.

359
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,508
My first guess is curry served at schools.

360
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,139
I chopped pork, carrots, potatoes, and onion,

361
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,709
boiled them for hours,

362
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,109
and let the natural flavours do their magic.

363
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,858
Hurry up and ladle it. You're so slow.

364
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:02,258
- Why are you only giving her meat? - Move faster.

365
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,389
I know, right?

366
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,390
Dig in, okay?

367
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,470
Maybe the third try might be a charm.

368
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,109
What a bummer.

369
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,349
I thought I could get it right on my second try.

370
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,719
I'm going to find...

371
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,819
your favourite dish at any cost.

372
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,589
You're quite competitive.

373
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,298
You're making me uncomfortable.

374
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,470
It's nice to see you dig in.

375
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:54,140
Stop it. It's making me hard to eat.

376
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,149
Hey. So I'm not considering this as volunteer hours,

377
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:07,559
but paying you back for the food.

378
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,259
Got it? For the curry.

379
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:12,500
Alright, thank you very much.

380
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:15,799
By the way, what is up with Mr. Kang?

381
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,828
Why won't he stop bothering me?

382
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,099
He's a pain in the neck. What did I do?

383
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,410
I saw a picture hanging from the rear view mirror.

384
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,409
Is he his son?

385
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,548
I think he has one.

386
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:30,649
But he barely talks about himself.

387
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,250
And we don't ask him either.

388
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,319
There's no need to be nosy.

389
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,990
Gosh, I'm swamped with work today.

390
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,490
I'm taking some ice.

391
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,699
- Nurse Seo. - Yes?

392
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,430
- Have a taste of this. - Okay.

393
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,420
Is it good? Or what?

394
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:11,789
It's bland.

395
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,029
So it's bland.

396
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:25,538
Why did you have to put the salt in like that?

397
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:26,839
A big lump went in.

398
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,069
That's it.

399
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,579
Yes, that's right.

400
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,980
Let's add some chilli.

401
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,650
- Hey. - Oh, my gosh!

402
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,518
You scared me!

403
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,249
Did you get caught stealing something?

404
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,259
- Why is your face beet red? - What?

405
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,559
- Is it? - Yes.

406
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:49,190
No, it's not.

407
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,759
It's the heat.

408
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:55,798
I feel super hot. What about you?

409
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,000
Why is it so hot today?

410
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,400
Oh, my.

411
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,969
Youth sure is nice.

412
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,469
She can even crunch on ice.

413
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,839
(Doctor's Office)

414
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,450
You're Sonny, right?

415
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,749
We have many patients here,

416
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,289
so don't wander around alone.

417
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:20,159
Okay?

418
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,889
- Oh. There you are, Sonny! - Goodness.

419
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,589
Gosh.

420
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:27,858
We took him out for a little walk, then lost him.

421
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:31,528
I see. Well then, excuse me.

422
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,569
I'm sorry.

423
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,639
You naughty boy, where have you been?

424
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,409
- Over here. - Push these back a bit more.

425
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,709
Okay. Like this?

426
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,439
- Yes, that's it. Looks good. - Great.

427
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,950
- Is the sofa in place? - Yes.

428
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:44,849
Take your place.

429
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,890
He really looks like a director like that.

430
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,919
He read books and watched videos all night long.

431
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,959
He's amazing.

432
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,259
- When you sing... - But honestly,

433
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,799
that hat kind of drives me mad.

434
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:00,358
- It drives me mad. - It really does.

435
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,469
- Gosh, my body is killing me. - He overdid it with the hat.

436
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,499
I might pass out from exhaustion before granting her wish.

437
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,970
If only I had experience in singing or dancing.

438
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,309
But still, isn't it fun?

439
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,778
I've been feeling good lately,

440
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,279
and it must be because of all this.

441
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,650
Of course. Dancing and singing make you feel happy.

442
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,319
By the way, shouldn't Mr. Hwang be on this side?

443
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,190
Oh, my gosh.

444
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,288
- He's driving me mad. - Hey.

445
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,588
Enough.

446
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:30,489
Now then. I'll assign your spots for "Everyone's Miracle."

447
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,598
Ms. Yeom. Your part is second to last,

448
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,230
- so move to the far left. - Okay.

449
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:38,199
Mr. Gu, please come to the middle.

450
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,899
Mr. Hwang. Come on, Mr. Hwang.

451
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,410
Please move to the end with Ms. Choi.

452
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:46,339
That's it. And Seo Jin, stand next to Mr. Gu.

453
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:51,079
Next is... What's going on with you two?

454
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:56,650
Nurse Seo, stand next to Ms. Yeom.

455
00:26:57,789 --> 00:26:59,189
Okay. Great.

456
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,828
And Gyeo Rye? You found your spot.

457
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:05,500
This is your spot for "Everyone's Miracle."

458
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:47,440
I love you.

459
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,940
Se Hee told me...

460
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,549
never to hold back on saying those words.

461
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,779
And to never put it off.

462
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:11,690
Right.

463
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,400
I...

464
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,170
love you a lot too.

465
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,970
I had a hard time holding it in.

466
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:26,980
But I won't hold back from now on.

467
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,049
Sorry.

468
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,318
I'm terribly sorry.

469
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,649
Oh, come on. I was so focused on it. Seriously.

470
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,319
- Gosh. - Hey, Yoon Gyeo Rye.

471
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,559
Have you never loved someone before?

472
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:46,229
Even if we're amateurs,

473
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,399
your acting sucks.

474
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,528
Sucks?

475
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:51,429
Hey. I was doing a great job, devoting myself to this role.

476
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,499
It was method acting.

477
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,940
It's because he never had a chance to love. Aren't I right?

478
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,838
No, he must have.

479
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:59,579
I don't think so. I doubt he had a chance.

480
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:02,508
- Gosh. - What? You were never in love?

481
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,650
That's ridiculous. I have...

482
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,920
been in love before. So what?

483
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,250
When?

484
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,190
It was great.

485
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,619
I have experience in love, okay?

486
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,088
- Was it good? - It moved my heart.

487
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,199
- Right? - Oh, my gosh.

488
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,729
Gosh.

489
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,028
- Good, my foot. - He's crying right now.

490
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,868
- I found it nice. - It was weird.

491
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:28,469
Pull yourself together and try it again.

492
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,808
- Let's do it. - Stop fooling around.

493
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,170
- Focus. - I can't do it.

494
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,380
Dr. Yang, hurry.

495
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,220
Are you okay?

496
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,490
Yes.

497
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:53,400
On September 17, 2021, 2:25am, Ms. Sun Gyo Sook...

498
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,170
has passed away.

499
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,140
(Room Adela)

500
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:04,410
You had it tough, Venerable.

501
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,410
Please rest in peace.

502
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,950
You will no longer be in pain.

503
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:17,549
May you stop suffering and rest well beside Buddha.

504
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,619
You really did go through a lot.

505
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,490
Thank you for calling me...

506
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,730
and letting me see her off, dear Sister.

507
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:27,730
Please. It's only right I called you.

508
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,730
The part...

509
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,899
of your mother's brain that controls hearing...

510
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,470
may still be active.

511
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:39,380
If you have anything to say, please say it now.

512
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,819
You have to do it now.

513
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:06,970
But she's still warm.

514
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,750
You don't have to hold back.

515
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,589
(Kang Soo Jin)

516
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,130
Let's go, Mr. Kang.

517
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,769
Nurse Seo, I don't think you need to come with us.

518
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,999
The funeral director will be there.

519
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,308
Her relatives have already arrived too.

520
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,710
But still.

521
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:22,048
Stay here and look after the other patients.

522
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:23,579
Plus, he's tagging along.

523
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,950
It's much far away than you think.

524
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,089
- Yes. - Let's go.

525
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
I'll be back.

526
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,400
It hurts.

527
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,950
Oh, right.

528
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:04,289
Here.

529
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,190
Earlier, didn't you sprain your ankle?

530
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,690
I know you won't put on...

531
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,028
a pain relief patch since the patients...

532
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:13,660
can notice it.

533
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:19,200
I'm really moved.

534
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:20,999
You're smart.

535
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,170
Thank you.

536
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,779
I apologize...

537
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,250
for nagging and disapproving of what you do.

538
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:33,819
You must be really upset.

539
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:36,220
What? No way.

540
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:39,460
I'm not upset at all.

541
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:43,890
In the end, everything you say is right.

542
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,500
Everyone has their own stance.

543
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,869
So...

544
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:58,269
how is Mr. Yoon Gyeo Rye doing?

545
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:00,680
Is he doing a good job?

546
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:02,779
Mr. Yoon?

547
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,650
Just so-so.

548
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:10,389
Actually...

549
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,119
To be honest...

550
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,829
Yes.

551
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,099
He's really reliable.

552
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,000
Physically, but also,

553
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,369
the elders find him cute,

554
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,639
like their grandson when he grumbles.

555
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,949
At first, I was also like,

556
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:39,619
"Why is a thug here?" And didn't like it.

557
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:43,150
But once I got to know him,

558
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,889
he turned out to be a thoughtful guy.

559
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,730
With a painful past.

560
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,829
And he does the job...

561
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,969
when he's told to do it.

562
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,440
Although he complains a lot.

563
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:04,869
I see.

564
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,780
- That's a relief. - Yes.

565
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,670
Great work today.

566
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:35,840
You're right. I worked my buttocks off because of someone.

567
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,210
Get some rest.

568
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:49,549
Seriously. How many hours...

569
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,519
did I drive?

570
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:00,699
Oh, Dr. Yang. Are you going home now?

571
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:04,669
Yes. It must have been tough, moving around in clutches.

572
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,099
No, it was alright.

573
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,570
By the way, Dr. Yang,

574
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:12,139
it's hard to see you around these days.

575
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,949
You haven't been coming by to the lounge...

576
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,289
since Mr. Yoon passed away.

577
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,420
Work has been keeping me busy.

578
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:28,190
You don't like what we do, do you?

579
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,690
Well...

580
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,530
Right. I understand.

581
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,739
I know that you had the fourth floor...

582
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:43,539
storage renovated for me to rest in...

583
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,908
when I first came here as a patient,

584
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:47,840
even though you knew...

585
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,710
I was a homeless man without any money.

586
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,219
(Room 403)

587
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:56,289
And you even treated me for free.

588
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,750
I only want to share...

589
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:02,659
that gratefulness I felt with others,

590
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:07,960
so I hope you don't hate what we do.

591
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:15,610
Yes. Frankly, I'm not a big fan of it.

592
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,179
You keep reminding the patients their end is nearing.

593
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,280
But it's not as if I have any right to stop you.

594
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,679
And you won't stop even if I tell you to.

595
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,489
- Please excuse me. - Okay.

596
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,329
Bye.

597
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:54,179
What? It's already night?

598
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,610
Why did no one wake me up?

599
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,219
My neck hurts.

600
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:05,050
What the heck is...

601
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,590
Goodness. Why did he put this over me?

602
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,460
He should've just told me to sleep someplace else.

603
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,300
Gosh.

604
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,349
Oh, dear. My back hurts so much.

605
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,449
(Room 401)

606
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:08,780
Excuse me?

607
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,519
Hello?

608
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,230
This is weird.

609
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,960
What?

610
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:22,829
It's weird.

611
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,280
Hey, Nurse Seo. I was on...

612
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,789
Oh, my goodness.

613
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,519
Wow, her neck is about to snap.

614
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,659
Is she that tired?

615
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,130
Gosh.

616
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:03,469
If I look closely,

617
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:05,940
she's not that pretty.

618
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,058
What are you doing? Tell me why.

619
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:23,130
Why were you grabbing the hair of someone sleeping?

620
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,929
Are you a pervert or something?

621
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,500
I always carry around a pair of scissors with me.

622
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:31,269
Gosh. You scared me. Why did you do that?

623
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,299
- Listen. Your neck was... - What a weirdo.

624
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,309
Darn it.

625
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:38,710
Forget about it.

626
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:45,210
You know the last room on the fourth floor?

627
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:47,619
- Fourth floor? - Yes.

628
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:50,519
Room 403.

629
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,960
- Room 403? - Yes, Room 403.

630
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,730
Why does that one particular room have a door lock?

631
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:00,559
It's strange.

632
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,400
What's strange about it?

633
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:06,868
It's a storage room.

634
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:09,269
What? I heard it was a patient's room.

635
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,309
- From who? - Mr. Kang.

636
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,610
Is that so?

637
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,679
It used to be a storage.

638
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,049
But since we were short on rooms,

639
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,949
we renovated it as one.

640
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,689
Now, it's back to a storage with important things...

641
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:28,019
inside like medical devices and sorts.

642
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:33,900
But listen.

643
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,230
In that room...

644
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:39,500
What is it? What?

645
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,070
It's kind of ridiculous, but...

646
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,139
He said there's a ghost.

647
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,379
That's what he said.

648
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,280
A ghost lives there.

649
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,289
A ghost that eats humans. It's not true, is it?

650
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:58,549
There's no ghost in the world.

651
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,590
I...

652
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,320
saw it.

653
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:06,400
The ghost.

654
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,130
It had...

655
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,269
It's hair down like this.

656
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:17,739
The mouth was covered with blood.

657
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:20,179
Help me.

658
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:22,179
Help...

659
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:25,449
- What are you talking about? - Gosh.

660
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:28,218
There are all kinds of stuff and medical devices.

661
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:29,549
A ghost isn't impossible.

662
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:32,250
It's got all kinds of ghosts.

663
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,760
- Oh, gosh. - There's no such thing as a ghost.

664
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:37,259
I'm going to the restroom. I need to poo.

665
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,260
Disgusting.

666
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:41,699
By the way,

667
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,038
you're paying more attention to the hospital.

668
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:47,070
What if you feel attached?

669
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,439
I'd never get attached.

670
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,769
What if you get attached...

671
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:53,238
that even after you complete your volunteer hours,

672
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:56,479
you want to stay here...

673
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,109
- like a ghost? - You should get one more flick.

674
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,379
- My goodness. You scared me. - Get a grip.

675
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,150
I have scissors.

676
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,119
I can stab you.

677
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,420
Go to bed already.

678
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:11,159
Seriously,

679
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,329
she's crazy.

680
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,098
- Is it not working? - No.

681
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:19,099
Let me try.

682
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,179
Thank you.

683
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:29,510
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

684
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,650
Do you have to hit the vending machine?

685
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,690
Hey. Thank you for getting me the blanket...

686
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:41,090
last night when I was sleeping in the car.

687
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:45,329
That's what you should say.

688
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:47,130
But...

689
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,499
If you found me sleeping in the car,

690
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,299
you should've woken me up and told me to come inside.

691
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,039
I almost cracked my neck.

692
00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:56,269
You think I didn't try?

693
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,639
Oh, you did?

694
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:03,679
I saw a photo in the rear view mirror.

695
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,079
Is he your son?

696
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,119
Son?

697
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,989
Did you think you're the only one with a son?

698
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,920
One more.

699
00:44:14,921 --> 00:44:16,928
The room at the end of the hall on the fourth floor.

700
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:19,530
There's no ghost, right?

701
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,899
I saw that the light was on in that room last night.

702
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,428
What light?

703
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:26,039
Mind your own business.

704
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,940
Practice for the performance like everyone else.

705
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,269
What was...

706
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,079
that for a young man?

707
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,280
Practice hard.

708
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,679
Was there a dance like that?

709
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:43,948
Come on.

710
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:45,649
I'm sorry. I don't want to be late.

711
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:48,360
Whatever. Drive slow.

712
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,729
They can wait.

713
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,529
You have a run through today. Did you memorize all your lines?

714
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,959
(To Have a Run: To rehearse a performance)

715
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,968
Hey. What run?

716
00:44:57,969 --> 00:45:00,070
You think they even know what that means?

717
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,440
What if they suddenly start running?

718
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:05,539
That was funny.

719
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,710
Hey. Have you contacted the assistant director?

720
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,980
Not yet.

721
00:45:11,981 --> 00:45:13,178
Have you talked to him about settlement?

722
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:14,280
His phone is off.

723
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,389
Seriously. What does he want?

724
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:21,960
("Miracle of Love")

725
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:31,299
(Inside Se Hee's parents' cart bar at night)

726
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,729
(In front of Se Hee's parents' cart bar at night)

727
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,440
(Yoon Gyeo Rye!)

728
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:55,389
He's sleeping again.

729
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,860
It's Se Hee's part.

730
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,069
I'll leave after this part.

731
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,968
When the song ends,

732
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:08,369
- you should come... - Okay.

733
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,639
For this part, how about this?

734
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,609
When I sing,

735
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,980
- you should come behind... - It's up to you.

736
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:24,989
Let's try.

737
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:26,988
I said okay. Try what?

738
00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:28,288
Seriously!

739
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:30,529
- Hey. - Hey.

740
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,928
Listen to her for goodness' sake.

741
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:34,198
Even old people like us are working hard.

742
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:36,968
If you don't cooperate with us, we're going to disclose it...

743
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:40,198
that you're only here to make up for the trouble you caused.

744
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:42,800
You never promised anything.

745
00:46:45,909 --> 00:46:48,539
Hey. What are you recording?

746
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,980
The rehearsal.

747
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,218
All right. Se Hee.

748
00:46:57,219 --> 00:47:00,159
It's best to cross each other.

749
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,260
It gives the sense...

750
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,090
we pass each other...

751
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,800
without recognizing.

752
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,768
When I raise my hand...

753
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:15,039
like this,

754
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:17,840
you should raise your hand too. Go.

755
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:21,340
That's right. Good job.

756
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:44,230
Then I'll go behind you.

757
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,949
When we first met...

758
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,320
When we...

759
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,129
- Will you keep your distance? - Why?

760
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,698
You're getting too close.

761
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:22,098
It tells me to get close.

762
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,940
I'm only following the script.

763
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:27,639
My goodness. Oh, dear.

764
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:30,379
That was the first time you saw me?

765
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,949
My goodness. I had no idea. How? Why?

766
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,579
That's crazy.

767
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:38,549
You're not good enough...

768
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,159
to comment on my acting.

769
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,518
- Why? What's wrong with me? - You think that's right?

770
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,289
- Her acting? - That was...

771
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,129
a musical right there.

772
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,130
I liked it.

773
00:48:47,131 --> 00:48:48,759
Right?

774
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,800
Amazing.

775
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:51,599
Good job.

776
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,340
You're good.

777
00:48:57,110 --> 00:49:00,780
How cute.

778
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,150
My.

779
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,320
I'm jealous.

780
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:08,119
A fling.

781
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,579
What?

782
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,920
- A fling. - A fight?

783
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:16,389
You want to fight?

784
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,690
That's out of nowhere.

785
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:24,000
I'm so darn tired.

786
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,000
- It'll take forever to get home. - Gyu Tae.

787
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,510
It's my gratitude.

788
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,309
What is it?

789
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,130
You didn't have to.

790
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:00,469
We still have lots of time left until winter.

791
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:05,139
I don't.

792
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:09,809
I'll look forward to the performance.

793
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:13,750
Thank you, once again.

794
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,690
Bye.

795
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,039
What's wrong with you?

796
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,739
Stop overreacting.

797
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:40,210
I said, stop.

798
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,638
I didn't do anything.

799
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,750
- Not you. - Okay.

800
00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:06,599
I don't.

801
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:14,409
You think she made them?

802
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:16,679
I can see the price tag from here.

803
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,920
She still put effort to order them.

804
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:27,820
I'm just saying.

805
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:30,759
- Min Soo. - I'm Cheol Min.

806
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,789
Cheol Min.

807
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:34,900
If you were me,

808
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:37,699
would you start...

809
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:41,699
a love that you know...

810
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,038
how it ends?

811
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:46,579
- Are you in love again? - What do you mean again?

812
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,610
I meant it every time.

813
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,578
I think it's different this time.

814
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:55,949
Stop thinking and give it a try.

815
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:57,889
Like the musical lyrics.

816
00:51:58,519 --> 00:51:59,519
Love.

817
00:52:00,289 --> 00:52:02,219
Don't delay it or suppress it.

818
00:52:02,659 --> 00:52:03,690
Because it's a miracle.

819
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,559
Don't worry about the end.

820
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,139
Dr. Yang.

821
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,909
You skipped dinner. Why are you having ramyeon?

822
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,480
I was hungry.

823
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,489
- Stay here. - You don't have to.

824
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:40,630
How did you make an omelet in just ten minutes?

825
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,229
Eight minutes. I'm famous for a reason.

826
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:45,730
Thank you.

827
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:55,078
It's really good.

828
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:58,379
I'd like to make it for you more often since you work hard every day.

829
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,078
But you never come for a visit,

830
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,449
and you don't spend time with us anymore.

831
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:04,388
I'm sorry.

832
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:07,019
Don't be.

833
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:11,159
It's just that I missed you. We all miss you.

834
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:24,210
It's hard to love a man...

835
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,440
who doesn't take her side, right?

836
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:32,309
Even if he's right...

837
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,519
or it's just another opinion?

838
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:39,550
She wouldn't like that for her boyfriend, right?

839
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:44,429
If it's someone she loves,

840
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,559
she would rather be disappointed.

841
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,969
Why would I be disappointed? Not at all.

842
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:59,510
That's what I think.

843
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,980
I'm starting to get disappointed.

844
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,750
Eat up. It doesn't taste good when it's cold.

845
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,380
Okay.

846
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,218
(Musical stage)

847
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:19,129
What should I do with that?

848
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,959
- Move that too. - To where? Move that to the back.

849
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,069
That must be tight.

850
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:26,799
Pull it hard.

851
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,940
Don't worry about the flowers. Just paint the grass around them.

852
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:31,368
That goes in the back.

853
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:32,710
- Here? - Further back.

854
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,940
- Good job. - Have some coffee.

855
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,579
Gather around.

856
00:54:40,449 --> 00:54:44,550
Move the ladder. It's dangerous.

857
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,499
Thank you.

858
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,939
Gyeo Rye. Sit down.

859
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,639
Enjoy.

860
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,150
My.

861
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,379
- Oh, my. - It always tastes the same.

862
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,119
- It's too sweet. - Are you having candy?

863
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,940
Excuse me, nurse.

864
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:39,969
Yes?

865
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,380
Why do you exercise so much?

866
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:46,050
Now you're using the heater to exercise.

867
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,050
When I see the patients, I want to be strong.

868
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,449
Why?

869
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,389
So you can live strong forever?

870
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,429
No, I want to be strong,

871
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:02,860
so I can help them.

872
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:09,099
You worry about others so much.

873
00:56:13,909 --> 00:56:15,739
My mom had cancer too.

874
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:20,579
One night, her pain was so great.

875
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:22,780
I tried to take her to a hospital.

876
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,320
My brother was in the army.

877
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,159
The ambulance couldn't come up...

878
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:31,929
due to heavy snow.

879
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,659
My mom couldn't stand up due to pain.

880
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:38,929
Gosh.

881
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,239
So I had no choice but to carry her down.

882
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,239
My limbs felt weak in no time.

883
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,320
Mom. Keep your arm up.

884
00:56:57,989 --> 00:56:59,719
I hated myself...

885
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:03,089
for not being able to protect my mom...

886
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,360
who didn't even weigh 40kg.

887
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,199
- It's okay. - Keep your arm up.

888
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,300
I always tell myself...

889
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:16,869
it was a good idea to exercise.

890
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:23,848
That's how I'm able to be there for my patients' last moment.

891
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:24,949
And...

892
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:31,449
And you might say I'm arrogant for saying this,

893
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,050
but if I become strong,

894
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,920
I can help someone...

895
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:41,559
who's not only physically ill, but ill at heart as well.

896
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,579
I saw that you have...

897
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:00,979
a tattoo here. What does it mean?

898
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,519
- This? - Yes.

899
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:04,420
- That's Latin. - Latin?

900
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,719
Death isn't the end.

901
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:30,280
Hello?

902
00:58:31,949 --> 00:58:32,980
What?

903
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:37,289
Please, Dr. Yang.

904
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,749
No.

905
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:41,489
It'll pressure your body too much.

906
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:46,230
Right. He's just worried about you.

907
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:48,760
Let me choose...

908
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:52,469
my last moment myself.

909
00:58:52,969 --> 00:58:54,070
Please.

910
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:59,909
Even if I collapse on the stage...

911
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:01,739
No,

912
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:05,179
even if I die there, I don't care.

913
00:59:06,449 --> 00:59:07,750
Ms. Se Hee.

914
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,219
No means no.

915
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:17,089
You know how precious every second is.

916
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:21,699
Please. I want to perform.

917
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:25,869
I'm sorry.

918
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,869
Dr. Yang.

919
00:59:31,269 --> 00:59:33,110
Se Hee.

920
00:59:33,809 --> 00:59:35,110
Se Hee.

921
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,349
Dr. Yang.

922
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:42,619
Dr. Yang. You see...

923
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:46,319
Se Hee put so much effort into it. Is there a way?

924
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,488
Stop it.

925
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:49,718
Dr. Yang. You don't know how happy she was...

926
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,229
while she was preparing the play.

927
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:52,659
Stop!

928
00:59:56,329 --> 00:59:58,400
Are you a nurse or a volunteer?

929
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,899
You're supposed to stop her from pushing her body,

930
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,570
but you keep encouraging her.

931
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:09,109
From now on, you can't do what you're doing with Mr. Kang...

932
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,578
without my permission. Do you understand?

933
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:13,079
Wait.

934
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:17,090
How can you be so mean?

935
01:00:17,789 --> 01:00:18,889
Gyeo Rye.

936
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:24,489
What makes you okay to yell at her in front of the crowd?

937
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:26,590
Is the doctor a king here?

938
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,400
Is this right?

939
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,268
Are you kidding me?

940
01:00:32,269 --> 01:00:33,468
You think I am?

941
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:35,699
I mean it. I'm not joking.

942
01:00:36,139 --> 01:00:37,669
It's true.

943
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:40,269
We're only granting their wish for a good reason.

944
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:44,079
We're all working hard.

945
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:47,179
Do we have to get permission for that?

946
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:51,689
Gosh. That's crazy. It's getting on my nerves.

947
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,988
- It's nothing like that. - But it's true.

948
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:55,320
Getting on your nerves?

949
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:59,429
That's what I want to say.

950
01:00:59,929 --> 01:01:02,730
Mr. Yoon. If you're going to act like this,

951
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:06,530
leave this hospital now.

952
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:10,469
If I leave this hospital, I have to go to prison.

953
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:13,539
Are you telling me to go back to prison?

954
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:15,079
Are you going to take responsibility for that?

955
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:20,380
What are you?

956
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:31,929
I'm Team Genie.

957
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,730
I grant patients' wishes.

958
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:58,190
(If You Wish Upon Me)

959
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:00,219
Can we talk?

960
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:03,019
What's your dream?

961
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:07,760
It wouldn't be so hard to make money. Why did you do that?

962
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:10,159
You should learn how to stop the bleeding.

963
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:12,699
Instead of wasting your time.

964
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:13,900
Here.

965
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,300
I bet you've done this before.

966
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:19,940
I could get you what you want.

967
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:23,409
You didn't only focus on granting their last wish.

968
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,079
Why do you carry a crutch when your leg is fine?
