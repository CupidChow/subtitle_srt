(Final Episode)

8
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:42,810
I mean...

9
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,380
There are many other rooms here. Why of all rooms...

10
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:49,718
Why does it have to be this room on the fourth floor?

11
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:52,460
I just don't get it.

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,159
In this room,

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,099
I was born again.

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,640
And there are many memories attached to this room.

15
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:11,739
Okay, fine. As long as you're comfortable here.

16
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:15,480
- Gyeo Rye. - Yes.

17
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,780
Sit down.

18
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,789
Why? What now?

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,620
Oh, boy. What are you going to nag me about this time?

20
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,530
About your late father...

21
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:33,969
What? Will you...

22
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:38,200
tell me to forgive him...

23
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:42,109
or that I should put everything behind me and move on?

24
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,540
No.

25
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,980
Your father...

26
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,719
must've been very lonely too.

27
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:57,890
I know.

28
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,790
I know that too. Yes, he must've been.

29
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,669
But what goes around comes around.

30
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,669
You see, I learned something from him.

31
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,240
He taught me not to live like he did.

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,780
If I do,

33
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,250
I'll be all alone and lonely...

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,319
when I breathe my last.

35
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:33,360
Yes.

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,729
Now,

37
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,269
you learn 10 things on your own when I try to teach you 1 thing.

38
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,370
Oh, stop.

39
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,139
You're right. No matter where you are,

40
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,610
if you are...

41
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,780
with someone you love...

42
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,649
and don't feel lonely,

43
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,849
where you are can become your Hogeweyk Village.

44
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:04,590
Right?

45
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,900
You don't have to go all the way to the Netherlands.

(If You Wish Upon Me)

47
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,419
Where are we going? Why won't you tell me?

48
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:40,188
You woke me up so early and made me pack lunch.

49
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:41,189
Where are we going?

50
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,598
Come on. Do we have to have a destination?

51
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,629
Why can't we just go for a drive?

52
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,529
It's nice to be out on a date. It's been too long.

53
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,169
A date? This is a date?

54
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,938
Are you just calling it a date...

55
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:54,069
when you're going to make me do some weird training again?

56
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,408
I'm not doing it.

57
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:56,409
What?

58
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,639
Rock-paper-scissors!

59
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:00,610
I can't believe you lost.

60
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,509
What is this?

61
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,179
- Let's do it again. - Do you want to?

62
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,180
- Yes. - Sure.

63
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:06,250
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

64
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:10,050
I guess today is not your day.

65
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,090
Gosh.

66
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,459
Let's go!

67
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,028
Stop swinging your legs back and forth! You're so heavy.

68
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,969
My gosh. Pick up the pace, will you?

69
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,739
Move it. Let's go!

70
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,708
But why do I have to give everyone a piggyback ride?

71
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,508
We played rock-paper-scissors, and you lost.

72
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:32,008
If I had lost, I would've given you a piggyback right away.

73
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:33,849
Well, I didn't know it was for this.

74
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,810
Stop wobbling!

75
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,878
The food will get thrown upside down.

76
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,819
(Kim Mi Sun, Rest in Peace)

77
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,689
Hi, Mom. I'm here.

78
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:50,660
Thanks to my driver here, I had a comfortable ride.

79
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,769
Hello, I'm her driver.

80
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,300
Mom. He looks skinny, but he's quite brave.

81
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:02,568
What? I'm not skinny.

82
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,709
I've been working out very hard these days.

83
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,009
Look at this, Mom. He made all this food for you.

84
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,120
Ma'am, I am...

85
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,790
Well, how should I put this?

86
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,519
I'm a great cook.

87
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:21,629
Well...

88
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:26,600
Your daughter...

89
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,199
chose a good guy.

90
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,369
Had I known we were coming here,

91
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,209
I would've prepared a feast for you...

92
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,579
with many different dishes.

93
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,910
Too bad I didn't know.

94
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,529
Gosh.

95
00:05:58,699 --> 00:05:59,759
Mom.

96
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,300
So many things happened in the past year.

97
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:08,240
There were times...

98
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,980
when I thought, "My gosh, I really can't handle this."

99
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,309
The only thing I could rely on was knowing that...

100
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,850
everything eventually passes with time.

101
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,319
But...

102
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,259
I now have someone I can rely on, Mom.

103
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,269
When you're carrying...

104
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:42,439
a bucket of water with one hand, it feels very heavy.

105
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,879
But it feels lighter if you carry it on your back and have...

106
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,040
both shoulders support the weight.

107
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:52,180
Mom, I...

108
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,449
I mean...

109
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,259
Us.

110
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,860
We'll be fine.

111
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,339
Hey.

112
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,410
- Here. - What's this?

113
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,879
It's you.

114
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,850
- Hey. - Yes?

115
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,089
You're always with old people, so you think I look like a granny too?

116
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,060
And this is me.

117
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:42,370
Can we grow old together...

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,199
until we see this?

119
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:54,879
Well, I'm not sure.

120
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,949
We'll see.

121
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,018
My gosh, I look so beautiful.

122
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,259
I did a good job, right?

123
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,860
Mom, look. He can even draw well.

124
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,209
Everything that has happened feels like a dream.

125
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,450
I feel like I'm back exactly where I was four years ago.

126
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,559
You've been through a lot.

127
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,799
If you feel pain, just call me.

128
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,409
Don't expect any special treatment from me.

129
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,580
Pay your hospital bills on time and...

130
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,730
Thank you.

131
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,190
- Gyeo Rye. - Yes.

132
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,289
Here.

133
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,659
Give it to the director.

134
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,230
- What is this? - Just give it to the director.

135
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,139
Don't open it and look.

136
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,639
Okay, all right.

137
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,110
Oh, hold on.

138
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:06,340
Did our hospital have a director?

139
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,120
Every hospital has one, you silly goose.

140
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,090
Oh, that's true.

141
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,259
But I don't think I've seen the director's office.

142
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:23,129
It's right by the chapel.

143
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,799
Go find it.

144
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,169
Okay, all right. Get some rest.

145
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,940
What's in this? Oh, get some rest.

146
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,970
Don't open it.

147
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,309
Okay, I heard you. My goodness.

148
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,110
Gosh. Hello.

149
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,450
What is this?

150
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,620
Telling me not to open it will only make me want to do it more.

151
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:47,450
Shall I just open it and see?

152
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,190
Forget it. I won't.

(Assistant Director Lee Jin Young Julia)

155
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,079
Most directors' offices are big...

156
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,479
and fancy. Am I wrong?

157
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,850
This office is...

158
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,619
This is the biggest and nicest office here.

159
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,620
- That's right. - I see.

160
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,589
Oh, right. About that man who hurt Mr. Gu...

161
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,429
and threatened the chief nurse.

Did everything go well?

164
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:37,500
Right, I'm sorry about what happened.

165
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,768
I apologize.

166
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:41,870
What? Why are you apologizing?

167
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,639
That man...

168
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,080
will be judged for what he did now that he's up there.

169
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,919
But you know, Gyeo Rye,

170
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,250
when you're ready to let it all go,

171
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,220
just forgive him...

172
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,059
even if you don't really want to.

173
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,990
Not for him. Do it for your own sake.

174
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,399
Okay. I will try to forgive him.

175
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:12,899
Oh, here.

176
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:15,269
Mr. Kang told me to give it to you.

177
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,950
What does it say?

178
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,149
What is it?

179
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,590
Well...

180
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,460
It's Mr. Kang's will.

181
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,570
Well, I wrote one too when I first...

182
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,570
got here.

183
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,340
Anyway, I'm off.

184
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,639
Directors. The titles suit you.

185
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,210
You look...

186
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,279
very cool.

187
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:03,450
He's so fond of Mr. Kang.

188
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,220
I wish Mr. Kang could stick around for longer.

189
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,059
Yes, I know.

190
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,209
You're invited.

191
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,469
(You're invited.)

192
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,909
(Invitation)

193
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,019
I want to formally ask Team Genie...

194
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,190
to grant my last wish.

195
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,559
Do you want another lettering tattoo?

196
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,700
No. Today...

197
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:50,299
Here, I brought this photo.

198
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,600
It's my dog. He was like my son. I want to get this tattooed on me.

199
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,669
I have a scar here.

200
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,039
That's where I want the tattoo. Can you do it?

201
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,210
Yes, sure thing.

202
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,179
You can cover the scar, right?

203
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,149
- Yes, I'll cover the scar. - Good.

204
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:15,029
The other day, I had a customer around your age...

205
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,758
who got a tattoo over a scar on his ankle...

206
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,898
from a burn he got when he was little.

207
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,070
I see. What kind of tattoo?

208
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,600
He got a tattoo of Taekwon V, the robot we used to play with as kids.

209
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,299
I see, Taekwon V.

210
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,070
Taekwon V. That's nuts.

211
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,690
What?

212
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,159
You've gained some weight.

213
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,889
The food must be good.

214
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,730
I eat better here.

215
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,240
Before I came here, I barely ate one proper meal a day.

216
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,610
Me too.

217
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,710
I eat better these days.

218
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:09,049
I'm doing much better.

219
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,379
It's good to see you.

220
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,750
But...

221
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
don't visit me again.

222
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:23,090
I said we should go to the gopchang place together.

223
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,730
I take it back.

224
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,029
I can do whatever I want.

225
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,700
Besides, since when did I listen to you?

226
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:32,899
Right, you never did.

227
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,139
But this time, you should listen to me.

228
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,009
I have nowhere else to go.

229
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,850
Do you know how empty you feel when you have nowhere to go?

230
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,480
You think I wouldn't know?

231
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:56,690
Don't visit me again, Jun Kyung.

232
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,399
Thanks a lot for coming all the way here to see me.

233
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:04,299
But live your life now.

234
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,440
As if you've been reborn.

235
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:13,279
You survived the fall from the rooftop,

236
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,980
which means you're destined to live.

237
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:30,059
The same goes for you.

238
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,269
You survived that accident too.

239
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,740
We're so much alike.

240
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,980
Gosh.

241
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:56,850
You never listen to me.

242
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,519
Whatever. I'll come back next week.

243
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:01,929
I'll earn lots of money and bring an expensive lawyer.

244
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,500
I'm off.

245
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,640
Oh, right.

246
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,240
I got you a gift.

247
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:16,539
But...

248
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,640
I'll tell you about it next time.

249
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:44,170
Other girls also recorded videos of what Pyo Cheol Woo did.

250
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:55,279
Did you record something too?

251
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,920
If you do, let's report him together.

252
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,420
I do have a video.

253
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,890
But I didn't record it myself.

254
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,460
It's a video of him stealing drugs.

255
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,299
A friend of mine sent it to me.

256
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:21,410
(In Mourning)

257
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,420
It's a video of Pyo Cheol Woo stealing morphine from a hospital.

258
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,019
We're planning to go to the police office tomorrow.

259
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,960
I can tell them to contact you for an interview, right?

260
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,259
I'm sure you have a lot to say too.

261
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,170
I want to be there too.

262
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,779
But how did you even think to record a video...

263
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,109
at that moment?

264
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,880
You must've been terrified.

265
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,450
Because I wanted to live.

266
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,920
I wanted to live. That's why.

267
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:32,609
Hi, guys. It's Anger here.

268
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:34,749
But from now on,

269
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,119
please call me YouTuber Hazoneburr.

270
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,690
Starting today, I'm going to upload my daily exercise videos.

271
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:43,389
To tell you the truth,

272
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,289
I've never really exercised in my life.

273
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,190
But I met a cool lady who is like a fitness pro.

274
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:53,430
I want to be like her, so I'm going to give this a shot.

275
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:55,798
I still need to discipline myself mentally.

276
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,538
But I want to be healthy and strong physically at least.

277
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:00,598
(You already look so pretty and healthy.)

278
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,608
(Me too! Let's be healthy!)

279
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:04,139
(I'm going to work out too, starting today!)

280
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,479
I'll try harder. Bye, guys.

281
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,539
(Like the video and subscribe!)

282
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,348
- You can't go in there. - Step aside.

283
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:15,450
Hey, Pyo Cheol Woo!

284
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,319
Come out.

285
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,858
- Let go of me. - Stop it.

286
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:22,558
- Seriously. - We're the police.

287
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,960
- Take him in. - Let go, punk.

288
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:26,559
Come out at once.

289
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,170
Gosh, how many times must I repeat myself to leave this here?

290
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,699
But somebody keeps...

291
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,508
Please give Mr. Cho in Room 201 a massage.

292
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:36,509
Okay.

293
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,039
And can I get a foot massage tonight?

294
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,410
You really...

295
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:44,979
- Hey. Mr. Yoon. - Yes?

296
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,190
I went on a blind date during the weekend.

297
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:52,288
I see. Congratulations.

298
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:53,890
She was 100 percent.

299
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,730
No, 1000 percent my ideal type.

300
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,259
I'm going to make it work.

301
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,269
Like that.

302
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,839
Seriously.

303
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,539
A fling.

304
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,269
What a handsome man.

305
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:13,909
Love is good.

306
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,750
- And you're so pretty. - Gosh, stop it.

307
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:21,490
Right. But it sure feels weird.

308
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:24,859
Why are you telling me this?

309
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,720
You can be...

310
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,690
lovey-dovey with Nurse Seo.

311
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:31,960
Is that so?

312
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:35,799
Returning to the subject,

313
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,740
Chief Nurse?

314
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:47,180
Hey, Mr. Yoon.

315
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,279
Sorry.

316
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,680
I got the wrong idea and doubted you.

317
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,390
Oh, come on.

318
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,689
Forget it. It's all in the past.

319
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,519
Well, I forgive you.

320
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:02,358
What?

321
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:05,630
It's okay. It happened in the past. There's no need to bring it up now.

322
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,369
You had it rough with Room 403.

323
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:13,399
In a way, you suffered because of me.

324
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,969
No. Everyone in this hospital knows...

325
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,140
it wasn't because of you.

326
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,880
- So I'm sorry. - Gosh, stop it. Alright?

327
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,519
What is it this time?

328
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,589
You see,

329
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,960
I nagged a lot about what Team Genie did.

330
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:40,400
So I wasn't sure if I should shamelessly bring this up or not.

331
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,740
But Dr. Yang told me to ask at the least.

332
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,400
What is it?

333
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:50,710
Does Team Genie only grant...

334
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,880
the wishes of people?

335
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,950
Can you also grant...

336
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,990
the wish of an object in its final moments?

337
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,519
An object?

338
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,929
(A Joyful Day)

339
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,328
There was something my father was doing...

340
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:14,769
until a week before he died.

341
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,369
He passed away suddenly without finishing it.

342
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,608
He wanted to give a letter and gift of appreciation in person...

343
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,670
to 43 subscribers who read the first issue...

344
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,039
to the last for more than 20 years.

345
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:33,049
He believed "A Joyful Day" would want to bid farewell...

346
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,119
to the subscribers.

347
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:37,990
I tried to do it alone...

348
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:40,289
but found it impossible.

349
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:41,960
It was too much for one person.

350
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,659
And two more patients suddenly got admitted,

351
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,299
so I couldn't leave the hospital.

352
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:51,400
Separate from my father's death,

353
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,769
the magazine was going to discontinue.

354
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:58,980
Nobody was purchasing it anymore...

355
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,079
aside from the 43 subscribers.

356
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:04,849
(Yours)

357
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:12,818
Magazines and newspapers in paper form will soon disappear...

358
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,119
from the world, won't they?

359
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,730
Children born later than me...

360
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,099
might not even know these existed.

361
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:25,339
Well, you can't stop time from passing by.

362
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,670
Do you two know this magazine?

363
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:31,609
I remember seeing it when I was little.

364
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,839
Often at my grandma's place.

365
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:37,250
But I rarely saw it these days.

366
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,690
It was really nice. You know, "A Joyful Day."

367
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:45,018
I especially enjoyed it when I had to travel long by train.

368
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:46,059
It helped kill the time.

369
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,460
The stories of each person...

370
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,959
were fun, bantering,

371
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,700
and relatable.

372
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,598
I read a few when I was young.

373
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,338
- Really? - Yes. The ones you had.

374
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:00,868
- I see. - It was fun.

375
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:02,369
You're still young.

376
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,809
I'm glad there are people who will be with this magazine's...

377
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,349
final moment.

378
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,779
And a total of 43 subscribers, to boot.

379
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,578
Ms. Oh will soon bring more helpers.

380
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,818
- Let's wrap it up before that. - Okay.

381
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:18,189
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

382
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,460
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

383
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:33,899
I'm here to deliver the last issue...

384
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,210
of "A Joyful Day."

385
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:38,108
Before the president passed away, he wanted it...

386
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:40,538
- to be handed out... - Before the president passed away,

387
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,449
he wanted it to be handed out in person to the dear subscribers.

388
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,949
"For subscribing to the end..."

389
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,618
"even though times have changed..."

390
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:51,890
- "Thank you very much." - "Thank you very much."

391
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,028
I continued reading...

392
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:57,189
what my late mom was reading until the end.

393
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,098
- Thank you. - Thank you.

394
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,900
- Thank you. - Right.

395
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,170
"The journey of A Joyful Day ends here,"

396
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:09,309
"but I hope you spend a joyful day until your last moment."

397
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,509
That is what...

398
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,579
my father left in his will.

399
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:21,380
Once again, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

400
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,249
("Yours", "A Joyful Day")

401
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,220
Time really flew by.

402
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,559
It has already been 24 years.

403
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,400
The stories in this magazine were fun to read.

404
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,470
You're right.

405
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,410
Please don't cry.

406
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:49,578
I had no idea the subscribers would love it that much.

407
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:51,579
But they really did.

408
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,880
Right.

409
00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:00,920
The fact that people aren't the only ones...

410
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,029
with the last moment got me thinking a lot.

411
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,240
Gyeo Rye.

412
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,940
What is it?

413
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,809
It's about time...

414
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,250
I say it.

415
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:30,849
Say what? What is it? Spill it.

416
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,720
My...

417
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,960
last wish.

418
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,500
Last wish, my foot.

419
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,699
Team Genie only grants...

420
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,440
real last wishes, for goodness' sake.

421
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,339
Wishes of those who are about to die. You're still fine.

422
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,848
Final wishes shouldn't be said so recklessly.

423
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:56,950
Gyeo Rye.

424
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,349
Whatever. I'm too busy right now. Let's talk later.

425
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,589
Rest, okay?

426
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,359
He may have made the team, but he can't change the rule.

427
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:15,970
We only grant last wishes. How annoying.

428
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,740
It's something you like, right?

429
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,710
Oh. My heart skipped a beat.

430
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,549
Gosh. I love how it rests in my hand.

431
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,890
If I had a sense of shame and conscience,

432
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,289
I wouldn't have been able to ask your team to grant the wish.

433
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,130
It's okay.

434
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,269
Nobody can live a perfect life.

435
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:53,140
Let's loosen up, okay?

436
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,539
Living a perfect life only wears you out.

437
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:58,680
You can do it.

438
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,308
You forgot your chart.

439
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:03,450
See? Not being perfect is charming.

440
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,700
Hello.

441
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,869
Hi.

442
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,569
It's been a while since you were outside.

443
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,809
I'm the little captain. Do you remember?

444
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,980
Yes, of course.

445
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,990
You're our hospital's little volunteer captain.

446
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:47,789
That's right.

447
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,730
How are you today?

448
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:56,970
How do you feel?

449
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,039
Are you able to clean today?

450
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,240
Of course.

451
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:07,880
Both my body and mind are going strong today.

452
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:18,690
You know,

453
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:23,430
I don't feel that happy today.

454
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,960
Despite the amazing weather.

455
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:31,130
My close friend keeps trying to give up.

456
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:36,910
He should think about how many wishes he has granted.

457
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:29,329
You are invited to Kang Tae Sik's early funeral.

458
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,140
(You are invited to Kang Tae Sik's early funeral. From Kang Tae Sik)

459
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,710
Seriously, he just does as he pleases.

460
00:31:49,349 --> 00:31:51,109
Amor fati

461
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:54,548
- Amor fati - I need to get going, ma'am.

462
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:56,919
Amor fati

463
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,420
What are you going to tell him?

464
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,859
Amor fati

465
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,960
Oh.

466
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:07,460
What does "amor fati" mean?

467
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:13,139
Come on. Amor fati.

468
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,799
Love...

469
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:17,670
your fate.

470
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,150
"Love your fate?"

471
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,250
Why don't you let...

472
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,150
Mr. Kang love his fate, Gyeo Rye?

473
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:37,089
Amor fati.

474
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:43,799
Love your fate.

475
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,710
What are you doing?

476
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:55,140
("The End of the World")

477
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:00,619
Darn it.

478
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:03,920
Did you get the text message?

479
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,890
Yes, I did.

480
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,659
What do you think?

481
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,960
What do you mean? I think it's a good idea.

482
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,599
How is it a good idea?

483
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
I think it's the worst idea ever.

484
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,170
Holding your funeral early makes no sense, does it?

485
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,440
He's been so selfish,

486
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,740
ever since we first met until now.

487
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,180
I seriously don't want to grant his wish.

488
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,450
Hey.

489
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,518
There are no good or bad wishes.

490
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,390
Wishes are just wishes.

491
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,420
And...

492
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:44,890
he's none other than our captain.

493
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,970
It's his last wish. We should grant it.

494
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,799
You should, Little Captain. What do you say?

495
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,940
No, I don't want to.

496
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:01,410
Smile.

497
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,869
Stop being ridiculous, will you?

498
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,138
I'd be willing to grant your wish...

499
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,869
if it was a reasonable one.

500
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,779
How can you hold your funeral early...

501
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,579
and even invite people to it?

502
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,579
Do you think it makes sense?

503
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,389
Gyeo Rye.

504
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,730
What is it?

505
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,800
You're even bathing me.

506
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,570
Thanks.

507
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,510
Don't thank me. Forget it.

508
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,679
If I bathe you...

509
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,019
for ten more years...

510
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,420
How annoying.

511
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,679
Room 403.

512
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,519
Thank you for having me until now.

513
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,659
Are you ready?

514
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,599
Yes.

515
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:36,969
Shall we go?

516
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,039
Yes, let's go.

517
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,010
Here we go.

518
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,440
(Ambulance, Patient Transfer)

519
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:55,309
Gyeo Rye.

520
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,118
Don't go over the speed limit.

521
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,650
Okay, I won't.

522
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,949
Stop nagging.

523
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:08,690
I'm closing the door.

524
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,999
Do I have to go too?

525
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,359
Cut that nonsense.

526
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,328
- Of course, you do. Get in. - Right. Yes, I do.

527
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,329
You're my friend.

528
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,468
Okay. See you later.

529
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:21,070
- Hi. - Oh, my.

530
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:22,969
- Hi. - Welcome.

531
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,510
Hey.

532
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:25,780
Drive safely.

533
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:28,139
Okay, I will. Don't worry.

534
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,079
Are we really going to the sea?

535
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,118
That's right.

536
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:36,249
Yes, we're going to the sea. Aren't you excited?

537
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,320
I'm psyched!

538
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,419
I'm starting the car.

539
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,059
- Yes. - Let's go.

540
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,328
See you later.

541
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:46,559
- Bye. - Have a safe trip.

542
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,800
- Bye. - Come back safely.

543
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,949
Here. Pass it to the back.

544
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:04,380
Thank you.

545
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:07,079
- Dig in. - Thank you.

546
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,719
- Thank you for the food. - Sure.

547
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,249
It's one per person...

548
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,988
and not two, Mr. Gu.

549
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:13,519
I know. Why are you saying that to me?

550
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,030
- Who didn't get one? - Me.

551
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:19,799
- I got two. - Me too.

552
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,098
Okay. I must have missed you.

553
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:25,229
- Everyone, please enjoy. - Thank you.

554
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,339
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

555
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,698
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

556
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,538
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

557
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:31,609
Thank you for the food.

558
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,980
Amor fati.

559
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,848
I love everyone's fate.

560
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:41,149
I love my wife.

561
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,280
Oh, come on.

562
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,489
You have a wife, Mr. Hwang?

563
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,420
He has a wife.

564
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:51,389
What is wrong with you? Stop it.

565
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,730
Go do it to your wife.

566
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,989
Gyeo Rye.

567
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,360
- Yes. - Promise me one thing.

568
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:58,659
Not to cry?

569
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:01,329
No, that's up to you.

570
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,969
But let's keep a smile on in front of Mr. Kang.

571
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:08,138
I can't control it.

572
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:10,969
I'm getting so upset.

573
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:13,579
Still.

574
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,280
Promise me.

575
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,579
Hurry. Promise me.

576
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,579
Let's smile. Like this.

577
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,849
Good job.

578
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,059
It's the sea.

579
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,429
You're right.

580
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,429
It's been so long. Has it been ten years?

581
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:37,000
- Twelve. - What?

582
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,300
- It's been 16 years for me. - What?

583
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,069
Now that you have a girlfriend, you shouldn't work so much.

584
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,308
You're not the one to say that.

585
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:49,809
That's true.

586
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,320
My.

587
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,900
We don't have to go to the sea on our own, right?

588
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:08,459
I know. It's so nice.

589
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,328
We should go to the mountains together.

590
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:11,499
I love the mountains.

591
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,969
This country is surrounded by the sea.

592
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:14,969
But you never had a chance to go?

593
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,769
Everyone. Today, I will...

594
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,380
drive slowly. Enjoy your time.

595
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,380
- Yes. - Thank you.

596
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:20,670
Sonny. Should we stop now?

597
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,219
Gyeo Rye.

598
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,360
What's this?

599
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:23,829
Your birthday gift.

600
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:28,469
My time...

601
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:31,469
stops here.

602
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,110
From now on,

603
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,949
it's yours.

604
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:46,090
What stops here?

605
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,989
Besides, you don't know my real birthday.

606
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:58,099
Gather here please.

607
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,079
- Is everyone here? - Yes.

608
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:19,789
Now, let's begin Gyeo Rye's first birthday party.

609
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,718
What?

610
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,730
There wasn't much to choose from for five dollars.

611
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,699
We're not here...

612
00:45:29,969 --> 00:45:32,670
for Mr. Kang's last trip,

613
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,670
but for your birthday party.

614
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:39,110
It's also Team Genie's first trip.

615
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:42,809
We're all here for you.

616
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,320
For Gyeo Rye who's reborn.

617
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,989
Gyeo Rye.

618
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,860
Spring is perfect for your birthday.

619
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,690
Throwing you a birthday party...

620
00:45:59,429 --> 00:46:01,260
is Mr. Kang's last wish.

621
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,340
(You're invited.)

622
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:14,839
(Invitation)

623
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,679
You're invited to Yoon Gyeo Rye's first birthday party.

624
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:23,389
(You're invited to Yoon Gyeo Rye's first birthday party.)

625
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:28,719
"Invitation."

626
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:33,530
"You're invited to Yoon Gyeo Rye's first birthday party."

627
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,030
Does that mean he's one year old?

628
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:37,599
What?

629
00:46:56,789 --> 00:47:00,819
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

630
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:04,558
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

631
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,559
- Dear Gyeo Rye - Dear Gyeo Rye

632
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:12,369
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

633
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,948
- Happy birthday. - Happy birthday.

634
00:47:23,949 --> 00:47:27,050
- Happy birthday. - Happy birthday, captain.

635
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:31,118
- Happy birthday. - He's crying.

636
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,819
- He's crying. - He's getting tearful.

637
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:36,359
- Don't cry. - Don't cry.

638
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,959
- Don't cry. - Cry.

639
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,828
Cry.

640
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:41,859
- Don't cry. - We should leave them alone.

641
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,969
Let's go check out the sea.

642
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:45,400
Let's go.

643
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:49,538
- Wait. - What are you doing?

644
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:52,369
Come on.

645
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:13,559
If there's a deity,

646
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,500
he...

647
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:19,869
probably led me here.

648
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,840
Though they cannot save everyone,

649
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:31,079
thanks to Mr. Kang and the hospital family's...

650
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:34,019
will to save me at least,

651
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,119
I was saved...

652
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:39,889
just before falling into a swamp.

653
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,480
What is all this?

654
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:15,219
Happy birthday.

655
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,829
My son.

656
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,510
Hence, Yoon Gyeo Rye's real life...

657
00:50:10,909 --> 00:50:12,449
begins now.

658
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,170
(A year later)

659
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,719
What time is it?

660
00:50:54,789 --> 00:50:55,889
Oh, I've got to go.

661
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:17,380
Gosh.

662
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:19,820
It's crazy.

663
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,780
The weather is crazy.

664
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,349
Let's go.

665
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:31,059
I told you to put it back.

666
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,360
Hello.

667
00:51:36,329 --> 00:51:37,368
Hello.

668
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:38,429
- Morning. - Morning.

669
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:43,309
Hello, ma'am.

670
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:48,078
No octopus spaghetti today.

671
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,678
- Why not? - Not three times a week.

672
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:50,879
- But... - No.

673
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,309
- But... - I told you.

674
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,920
Hello.

675
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:19,239
As Kang Tae Sik Narses wished,

676
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,510
a site was arranged here...

677
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,280
to establish Make a Wish Foundation and the Angel Village.

678
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:27,948
His entire fortune was also donated.

679
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:28,949
(Late Kang Tae Sik)

680
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,960
Hi, little captain.

681
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,030
Hello.

682
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,309
You look pretty.

683
00:52:57,579 --> 00:52:58,980
You're done.

684
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:02,250
You're amazing.

685
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:07,489
You're very good for your age.

686
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:09,690
I'm sure you'll own...

687
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:14,829
many salons in the future.

688
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:16,699
I hope so.

689
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:19,800
- How much is it? - It's 15 dollars.

690
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,239
Can you give me a dollar discount?

691
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:26,808
I can't do that.

692
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:28,079
One, two, three...

693
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:31,549
Four. I don't have enough.

694
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,249
Okay.

695
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,549
Thank you.

696
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:37,119
- Bye. - Bye.

697
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:46,829
She just left.

698
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,559
(Genie Bank)

699
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,510
(Genie Bank)

700
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:04,179
(Genie Bank)

701
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:08,420
My husband must be starving.

702
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,389
Hello.

703
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:12,489
- Hello. - Hello.

704
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,820
Hello.

705
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,829
She just headed to the bus stop.

706
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,420
Where are you going, ma'am?

707
00:54:48,659 --> 00:54:50,959
Where else?

708
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,058
I'm going home after work.

709
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:54,059
I see.

710
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,799
My husband is waiting.

711
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,029
That's nice.

712
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,929
I suppose you're having something delicious at home.

713
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,469
- Yes. I'm hungry. - I see.

714
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:04,038
The bus is here.

715
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:05,908
Hi.

716
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:07,308
(Bus)

717
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:08,879
Bye.

718
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,809
- Take care. - Bye.

719
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,250
Hello.

720
00:55:13,949 --> 00:55:16,519
Bye.

721
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:47,678
(Bus)

722
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:49,618
Have a good day.

723
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:51,489
Bye.

724
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:53,018
Have a good day.

725
00:55:53,019 --> 00:55:56,789
I will. I always have a good day.

726
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,269
She's going in.

727
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,869
Okay.

728
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:26,788
I'm home.

729
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:28,488
Welcome home.

730
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:30,558
Did you have a good day?

731
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:33,499
Same old.

732
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,529
Give it to me.

733
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:37,070
Labour for Choi Duk Ja. Choi Duk Ja for labour.

734
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:42,138
The food looks so good.

735
00:56:42,139 --> 00:56:45,408
It's your favourite beef brisket doenjang jjigae.

736
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:46,979
I love it.

737
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,739
Come on in. Let's eat.

738
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,509
Come in. Hurry.

739
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:52,849
- That looks good. - Come in.

740
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,819
That looks good.

741
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,919
What did you do today?

742
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,089
Have a seat.

743
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,690
Enjoy.

744
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:01,959
- Let's eat. - Yes.

745
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,729
- Thank you. - It looks good.

746
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:04,730
You're welcome.

747
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,530
Enjoy.

748
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,059
- It's so good. - It's good.

749
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,030
- Here. - Thank you.

750
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:18,070
Wherever you are, if you're with...

751
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:21,840
the people you love and are not lonely,

752
00:57:23,179 --> 00:57:24,210
that will be...

753
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:29,050
Hogeweyk Village.

754
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,119
(Angel Village)

755
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:39,530
You're always late just like your dad.

756
00:57:39,929 --> 00:57:42,058
Preparing a meal twice is...

757
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:44,629
I know it's a hassle. It's such a hassle.

758
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,170
What's this?

759
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:49,670
Brachycarpa?

760
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:52,409
This is shepherd's purse.

761
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:58,409
Spring greens are good enough with plain rice.

762
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,750
You changed the topic just like your dad.

763
00:58:05,389 --> 00:58:08,059
Oh, right. We're getting a new volunteer today.

764
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,320
Yes.

765
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:11,690
Good luck.

766
00:58:11,929 --> 00:58:14,230
He needs to learn from one to ten just like you.

767
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:17,199
Don't worry. Who am I?

768
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,070
Captain Yoon of Team Genie. Yoon Genie.

769
00:58:21,369 --> 00:58:22,769
Sure. Why not?

770
00:58:23,369 --> 00:58:25,609
Enjoy your meal, Captain Yoon.

771
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:27,739
Thank you. It's so good.

772
00:58:38,019 --> 00:58:40,760
What's taking her so long?

773
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,389
Look at the time.

774
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,750
Gosh. This place is so lame.

775
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,190
A turtle?

776
00:59:16,889 --> 00:59:19,559
This is crazy.

777
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:45,190
(Thank you for watching If You Wish Upon Me.)

778
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,090
(Thanks to Lee You Mi and Kim Shin Rock for special appearance.)

779
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:08,940
