(Nurses' Lounge)

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,520
I saw it all.

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,320
Saw what?

10
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:55,289
I saw everything.

11
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:58,258
What did you see?

12
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,030
You can never fool me.

13
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,200
What did you catch this time?

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
You got caught.

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,409
Room 403.

16
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,609
What about it?

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,779
Someone was lying in that room.

18
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,189
I happened to see it.

19
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:21,890
Who's that?

20
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:23,589
Who else? A patient, obviously.

21
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,659
A patient?

22
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:27,729
You said it was a storage to keep medical equipments.

23
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,730
- Yes. - Why did you lie to me?

24
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,158
You were going to get caught anyway.

25
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,429
Besides, Mr. Kang said there's a ghost living in there.

26
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,499
He keeps changing the subject.

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
It's not a lie.

28
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,140
From now on, it's a VIP room.

29
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,639
But we're worried about other patients.

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,908
It might make them feel uncomfortable.

31
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:45,979
Why do I have to explain this to you?

32
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,980
You're clearly flustered.

33
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:49,979
- You're obviously flustered. - Not at all.

34
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,419
- You stuttered a lot. - Stop.

35
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,549
Okay then...

36
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:55,619
let's say it's the VIP room.

37
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,019
But it's strange. Why does Mr. Hwang go in there?

38
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,290
Because it's Mr. Hwang's acquaintance.

39
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,030
Happy now?

40
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,530
Stop asking. I'm busy.

41
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,599
Wait. You don't look that busy.

42
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:10,438
Even if it's his acquaintance,

43
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,339
he's not a nurse or a doctor.

44
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,039
There's even a lock.

45
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:18,779
You're paying way too much attention to it.

46
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,509
You're leaving soon anyway.

47
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,680
Mind your own business.

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,679
So, you're changing the subject?

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,049
Fine.

50
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,990
Mr. Kang promised me to tell the truth.

51
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,459
He said he wants to talk to me about something serious.

52
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,460
Then ask him yourself.

53
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:35,729
Stop asking me.

54
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:39,500
Don't forget the CPR training. Darn it.

55
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:40,669
Gosh.

56
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:43,900
Gotcha.

57
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,240
Mr. Kang promised me to tell the truth.

Ms. Yeom. Have you seen Mr. Kang?

61
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,900
Mr. Kang? No.

62
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:16,300
That reminds me, I haven't seen him all day.

63
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,469
Okay.

64
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,639
Where did he go?

66
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,759
What is he going to say to him?

No.

Mr. Kang said...

71
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,960
he's going hiking.

72
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:15,930
Okay.

73
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
Hiking?

74
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,470
To the hill behind the hospital?

75
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,399
Why, all of a sudden?

76
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,870
Why are you surprised?

77
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,709
People are worried because of the boar.

78
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,980
He said he'll set traps.

79
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,980

80
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:36,350
Mr. Cha Yong Po got a bedsore.

81
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,779
You should check on him.

82
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,949
Okay.

It's rated R.

94
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,509
Isn't this a pornographic novel?

95
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,778
Why did you tell me to read it?

96
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:43,579
Pornographic? It's art.

97
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,079
She's right.

98

You'll know what I mean.

102

It's obvious to us who are old.

103

You wouldn't even imagine.

104
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,299
What? The nuns here are weird.

105
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,439
Is that suitable for this situation?

106
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,670
What are you talking about?

107
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,079
"And..."

108

It's raining all of a sudden.

109
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,949
I know.

110
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,550
No wonder my knees were aching this morning.

111
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,959
It seems it'll stop soon.

112

It's still sunny.

113
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,729
The cab driver was on alert.

114
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,268
He kept glancing at me through the rearview mirror.

115
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,768
He kept asking me again and again...

116
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:39,470
if someone really was waiting to pay for the cab.

117
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,670
I'd ask the same question.

118
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:43,938
I heard coin laundries are common these days,

119
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:45,778
but I couldn't find one...

120
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,879
in the area we were staying.

121
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,849
Thank you.

00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,679
- Enjoy. - Oh, that's an expensive dish.

123
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,818
That looks good.

124
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,490
Anyway, thank you for coming here.

125
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,889
Thanks to you,

That's why I'm dining you.

128
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,299
So enjoy it as much as you want.

129

Cheers.

130
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,970
- Cheers. - Cheers.

131
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,138
Nice.

132
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:19,810
Enjoy.

Hey!

How could you eat the octopus all alone?

135
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,648
You're eating a lot.

136
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:25,919
I was saving it for later.

137
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,850
I didn't even chew it.

138
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,589
Gosh. It's...

139
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:47,939
Hello.

00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,879
No.

142
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,679
You're reading?

143
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,249
It's not mine. It's the lady...

144
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,088
Is this Fifty Shades of Yoon Grey?

145
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:04,059
Stop it.

146
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,120
I understand.

147
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,019
Oh, right. Have you seen Nurse Seo?

148
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,659
I don't know. Just call her.

149
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,500
She left her phone here. I don't know where she went.

150
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,429
I'm worried because a boar appeared in the hill behind.

151
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,500
Hello.

152
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:19,369
She was looking for Mr. Kang,

153
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,069
so I told her he went to set traps...

154
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:23,938
in the hill behind.

155
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,009
What?

156
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:29,550
Could she have gone to the hill?

157
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,220
- What? - That's not good.

158
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,620
Nurse Seo? Seo Yeon Joo!

159
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,460
Seo Yeon Joo!

160
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,830
Nurse Seo?

161
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,200
Thank you for the food.

162
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,399
Wait.

163
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,139
What?

164
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:57,109
- You're not rich. - It's for the cab.

165
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,179
My goodness.

166
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,450
Don't let someone disregard you like last time.

167
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:06,320
And don't spend that money on drinking.

168
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,820
- Bye. - Let's go.

169
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,629
- Bye, Tae Sik. - Bye.

170

Nurse Seo!

171
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,210
Where did she go?

172
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,610
She should know better.

173
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,949
Why would she go to the mountain when it's raining?

174
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,250
There's even a boar.

175
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,850
Where is she?

176
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,289
Oh, gosh!

177
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,059
Oh, no.

178
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:57,970
What's that?

179
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:00,470
A boar.

180
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,139
A boar.

181
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:07,080
Yoon Gyeo Rye?

182
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,610
Yoon Gyeo Rye!

183
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:13,649
Seriously.

184
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:15,549
Over here.

185
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:21,490
Seriously!

186
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:23,129
What?

187
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,459
Seriously.

188
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,100
What's wrong? Is everything all right?

189
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:31,039
What could possibly happen?

190
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,239
Why would you go to the mountain when it's raining? It's dangerous.

191
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,808
There's a boar.

192
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:38,739
It wasn't raining when I got here.

193
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,840
Gosh.

194
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,418
My gym is up there.

195
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:47,719
I came here to exercise, then I fell asleep.

196
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,149
Why would you make a gym here...

197
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,589
Stop exercising! How strong are you trying to be?

198
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,758
Seriously. That was torture.

199
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,559
I thought you were attacked by the boar.

200
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,970
You don't have to get mad.

201
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:04,200
You're acting like my mom reincarnated.

202
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,298
I don't know what is wrong with the people here.

203
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,369
- They always worry me. - My goodness.

204
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,908
It's driving me crazy.

205
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:12,778
You're so annoying.

206
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,250
Who told you to worry about us?

207
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,250
Hang on.

208
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,379
- What? - Did you cry?

209
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,548
Why would I cry?

210
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:25,289
It's the rain.

211
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,888
You cried.

212
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:28,860
I didn't.

213
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,429
I was worried for nothing.

214
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,768
You didn't get attacked by the boar. You attacked the boar.

215
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:38,138
You literally beat it to death.

216
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:41,470
I didn't beat anything to death. I was just feeling bad...

217
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,479
- You cried. - I didn't.

218
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,979
- Your eyes are red. - Stop it.

219
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,678
They're red...

220
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,580
because the rain keeps going in my eyes.

221
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,949
Did you cry because you thought I was attacked by the boar?

222
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,849
I never cried!

223
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,388
It's the rain!

224
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,289
You're so ugly.

225
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,620
I can't believe you.

226
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:02,929
I didn't cry.

227
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,029
Why would he go to the mountain too?

228
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,230
He should've called the police.

229
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,969
Why does he always act first and think later?

230
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,740
I doubt he called the police.

231
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,079
He's fierce for no reason.

232
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,809
He should be careful like me.

233
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,509
Fierce?

234
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,120
- A fling. - A fling?

235
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,589
What's going on between Yoon Gyeo Rye and Nurse Seo?

236
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,720
Don't you dare relate them.

237
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,459
I worked so hard to connect...

238
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,059
Nurse Seo and Dr. Yang.

239
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,299
I'm going to make Yeon Joo marry someone nice.

240
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,669
Yeon Joo went through so much.

241
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:50,610
There should only be happiness in her future.

242
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:56,379
Nurse and doctor. They're perfect.

243
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,549
Right?

244
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,219
He doesn't like it because you're badmouthing his dad.

245
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,190
Here you are.

246
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:04,919
I thought you went to the hill.

247
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,928
The hill? Why would I go there when it's raining?

248
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:11,758
When Gyeo Rye heard that Nurse Seo went to the hill...

249
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,599
to find you,

250
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,629
he followed her.

251
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,700
My goodness.

252
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,870
Dr. Yang.

253
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,980
Have you seen Nurse Seo and Gyeo Rye?

254
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:29,750
She'll come down soon.

255
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,980
- With Gyeo Rye. - I see.

256
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:36,149
Bye now.

257
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,019
Bye.

258
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,370
(Doctor Yang Chi Hoon)

259
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,950
Do we have to make a stone grave?

260
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,389
They only cause humans harm.

261
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,120
He's just a baby that starved to death.

262
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,730
Besides,

263
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,960
you shouldn't accuse him of what his parents did.

264
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:20,129
That's true.

265
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,200
He didn't do anything wrong. It's all his parents.

266
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,409
When I first found him, he was still breathing.

267
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:33,210
I was going to take him to your friend's clinic.

268
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,879
He was desperate to survive.

269
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,019
I saw his eyes.

270
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:47,389
I couldn't ignore him.

271
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:51,330
You're too nosy, you know that?

272
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,369
Right.

273
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,899
If you get paid for being nosy, you'd be rich by now.

274
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:00,069
You need to know that you and Mr. Kang are...

275
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,740
high maintenance.

276
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,539
I can't believe I'm doing this here.

277
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,679
Thanks.

278
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,990
He's probably thanking you from up there.

279
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,720
Don't be childish. Up there?

280
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:37,539
Mr. Kang.

281
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,210
Mr. Kang.

282
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,909
Where is he?

283
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,590
No wonder he's sick after getting so wet in the rain.

284
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,619
Nurse Seo is fine.

285
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,658
She's an exception.

286
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:30,960
You can't compare her to an ordinary man.

287
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,159
Right. She's incomparable.

288
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,570
By the way, Nurse Seo is off work.

289
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,109
She must be tired of taking care of Gyeo Rye.

290
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,639
Of course.

291
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:44,909
Oh, hello.

292
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,579
You were off a while ago. Why are you still here?

293
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,679
I should separate work from home,

294
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,549
but I feel more comfortable at work.

295
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,189
Even if I go home,

296
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,288
all that's waiting for me is the dust...

297
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:04,559
and TV that only plays the same shows every day.

298
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:07,029
What would make me want to go home?

299
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:08,970
You're right.

300
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,499
We'd miss the bus.

301
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,768
- Right. - Let's hurry up.

302
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:14,639
- Bye. - Goodnight.

303
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,339
Bye. Have a good night.

304
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,579
My goodness.

305
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,390
You were in the rain longer than I was.

306
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:31,559
But why is it just me?

307
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,630
Even if I stay in the rain for longer, I never catch a cold.

308
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,259
That's what exercise does to you.

309
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,200
I may look weak,

310
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,129
but I'm usually very strong.

311
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,368
Really?

312
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:47,639
If I'd seen the boar in the hill,

313
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,740
I would've beat it to death with bare hands.

314
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,779
So, you're originally very strong.

315
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,049
I guess...

316
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,619
my heart was wounded lately.

317
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,220
Some patient...

318
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,660
asked me to kill him.

319
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,970
He said since I'm a social worker...

320
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,669
and an ex-con,

321
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,440
I probably would've done it before.

322
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:27,880
He said his wife would die before he does.

323
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,220
So he asked me to kill him first.

324
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,349
It upsets me.

325
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:44,430
Why would he do that? It's driving me crazy.

326
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,700
Let me see.

327
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:51,970
My goodness. It's so high.

328
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,480
I'll apologize instead...

329
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:04,150
for what that patient said.

330
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:05,920
I'm sorry.

331
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,690
Some patients...

332
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,660
don't consider other people's feelings...

333
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,960
because they're in so much pain.

334
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:22,869
Sometimes they bug their guardians or the medical team.

335
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:26,369
It's okay. I understand too, but...

336
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,210
I just...

337
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,680
wanted to complain for once.

338
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,609
I've never done complaining before.

339
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,390
Nurse Seo.

340
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
Yes?

341
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,589
- Can you show me? - What?

342
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,460
Death isn't the end of everything.

343
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,299
Death...

344
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:05,309
isn't the end of everything.

345
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:20,960
Death isn't the end of everything.

346
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,900
So,

347
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,970
stop paying so much attention to death, will you?

348
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,470
You're not there yet.

349
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,568
- What do you know? - What?

350
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,509
Yes, what do you know?

351
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:43,910
I'll let you slide only for today because you're sick.

352
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:47,990
Sonny.

353
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,950
Your daddy's sick.

354
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,890
Hey, Seo Yeon Joo.

355
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,490
"Seo Yeon Joo?" Fine.

356
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,930
I promised to let things slide today, after all.

357
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
I like you.

358
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,009
And you'll just fall asleep like that?

359
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,589
You must be joking.

360
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,710
Sweet dreams, Yoon Gyeo Rye.

(Bus 6411)

362
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:18,240
My gosh. Hello, ma'am.

363
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,939
It's been ages since I last saw you.

364
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,950
What?

365
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,578
Who are you?

366
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:27,079
It's me, Director Seo from the hair salon.

367
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,990
You haven't dropped by in so long, so I was getting curious.

368
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,588
Where are you coming from?

369
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:33,660
Oh, me?

370
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,288
I'm always going to work.

371
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,930
You know, cleaning the hospital.

372
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,069
I have never once taken a day off in my life.

373
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,200
I'm nothing without work, and work is nothing without me.

374
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:47,200
That's weird.

375
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:50,670
The last time you came to the salon,

376
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,608
you were so upset...

377
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:55,680
because you couldn't work at the hospital anymore.

378
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,450
You told me that taking a day off would make you more painful.

379
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,750
What?

380
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,518
When did I say that? You got the wrong person.

381
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:03,650
No, it was you.

382
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,289
You clearly said those back then.

383
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,589
Well, I'm going home first.

384
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:33,980
Why are you here, Mr. Hwang?

385
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,450
How did you get in?

386
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:44,450
What is it?

387
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,519
Mr. Hwang?

388
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,699
What's wrong with you, Mr. Hwang?

389
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,130
Gosh. What is it? Let go of me.

390
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,099
Let go. Why are you doing this to me?

Are you my husband?

Are you...

405
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:31,160
telling me this...

406
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,599
every day?

407
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:46,680
Will I...

408
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:49,609
forget about it again tomorrow?

409

But how could I forget about you?

413
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,390
I...

414
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,759
Then...

415
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:37,789
are we not...

416
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:40,259
going to the hospital...

417
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,630
to work tomorrow?

418
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:46,400
Earlier,

419
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:51,269
that was what the director of the salon told me.

00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,279

424

was not working...

425
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:22,539
but volunteering.

426
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,839
Thank you.

Totally.

437

439

Get in.

440
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,670
You got fat.

441
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:35,910
How much did you gain in the cell?

442
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,710
- About 4kg. - Right, 4kg.

443
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:42,210
Lose about 3kg on top of that.

444

Then I'll give you the deposit.

445

Don't put it like that.

It was my money from the start.

447
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,190
I earned it by smiling and stripping.

00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,380
So isn't it weirder for me to be scared of things?

454
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:29,859
Lose 7kg, got it?

455

- It's cold. - Right, it is.

00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:01,220
- It's just... - Yes?

474
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,319
I'm wondering...

475
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:09,989
if I made any mistakes when I was drowsy not long ago.

476
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,359
Like what?

477
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:15,130
The medicines had kicked in.

478
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,969
So did I blurt out anything ridiculous?

479
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,440
- Ridiculous? - Yes.

480
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,670
Ridiculous.

481
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:24,769
No, you didn't. Why?

482
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,180
No reason. The weather.

483
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,949
It's nice today, but I feel as if I forgot something.

484
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:39,019
I see. I wonder why you feel like that.

485
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,689
Did you not get any sleep?

486
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,329
Well, it's cold. I better go inside.

487
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,190
Let's go, Sonny.

488
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
Really?

489
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,730
There's something I realized for the first time today.

490
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,200
I like chilly weather.

491
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:59,339
I love the coldness. My cartilage is trembling.

492
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,079
I love to eat cartilage too.

493
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,719
- I like them, okay? - I see. So she likes them.

494
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,650
Let's go inside, Sonny.

495
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,460
Get up.

496
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,969
Hey, Mister. Get a grip.

497
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,800
It's dangerous. You're causing trouble to others.

498
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:01,699
Pull yourself together. Seriously.

499
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,610
Do you want to talk?

500
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,010
I'm not happy...

501
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,050
about the time I have left.

502
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,388
I should leave this world as soon as possible...

503
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:17,920
for the sake of my wife.

504
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:21,289
Because I couldn't get insurance on time,

505
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,889
I lost all my wealth during my four-year medical treatment.

506
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,058
As I had no money for a caregiver,

507
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,670
my wife took care of me all the time.

508
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,039
Though even if we had money, she would still have stayed with me.

509
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:38,070
My wife.

510
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:42,309
She was never the type to get into fights.

511
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:47,579
She was like an innocent girl, not knowing how to fight.

512
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:53,019
But when I saw her fight my roommate lady,

513
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,989
I realized...

514
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,699
she was breaking down because of me.

515
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:06,199
I swear this is much more painful than dying.

516
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:09,510
To be honest, when you first asked me that favor,

517
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,309
I flipped out.

518
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,979
I may have repeatedly spent time in juvenile halls and prison,

519
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,750
but I was always the victim.

520
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,519
I never harmed anyone.

521
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,989
Sorry.

522
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:32,928
I was too desperate and wasn't thinking straight.

523
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:35,730
Don't worry about it. It's all in the past now.

524
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,099
But...

525
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,840
did you really think it through?

526
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:45,840
What?

527
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,280
Your last wish. Did you think hard about it?

528
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,349
Be honest with me. Think about it.

529
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,719
Isn't your wife...

530
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:58,550
living an easy and happy life...

531
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:00,860
without worrying about money...

532
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:04,130
your real last wish?

533
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,400
And not you dying right now?

534
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:09,599
You're right.

535
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:14,138
In that case, she won't suffer whether I die or not.

536
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:16,340
Then why don't we introduce...

537
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,340
a nice guy to Ms. Oh?

538
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,178
Mr. Kang. You should've told us if you were here...

539
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:24,979
and not eavesdropped on us.

540
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,380
Mr. Jang.

541
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,578
Instead of killing him,

542
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,219
why don't you introduce Ms. Oh to a capable...

543
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,860
and kind man?

544
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,230
As a matter of fact,

545
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:43,000
my wish was for my wife to meet and remarry a kind and rich man...

546
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,170
after I died.

547
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,269
Really? That's great, then.

548
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,440
Once Ms. Oh falls head over heels in love...

549
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,578
with a man, she'll be able to eat steak...

550
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,449
and see the flowers in spring.

551
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,389
Just the thought of it...

552
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,888
is enough to make me happy.

553
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:09,429
Because of you, Ms. Oh...

554
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,590
had it tough until now.

555
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,670
So let her have a comfortable...

556
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,969
and happy life from now on.

557
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,070
You won't be...

558
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,239
in this world for long anyway.

559
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,210
For goodness' sake.

560
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,328
What is it?

561
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:47,360
"Anyway?" Really?

562
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,369
"Anyway?" I'm losing it.

563
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:53,069
Who was it that grabbed me by the collar...

564
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,599
because of that one word?

565
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,408
And why did you suddenly butt into his wish?

566
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:59,109
You're going to leave this place anyway.

567
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,480
And I have my work to do, punk.

568
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:02,979
Well, I'm going to...

569
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,949
Right? Your community service hours are almost over.

570
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,980
Gosh.

571
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,388
You're right. I've completed my hours.

572
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:13,059
Yes, I'm done now.

573
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,530
Fine. If you want to make Mr. Jang's wish come true,

574
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:24,599
you can stay here longer.

575
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,340
What? Stay here longer? My hours are over.

576
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:33,139
I've got tons to do once I get out of here.

577
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:38,309
Oh, I forgot to harvest the sweet potatoes.

578
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,349
Wash my cup too, okay?

579
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,889
That jerk's playing hard to get.

580
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,429
(Team Genie Yoon Gyeo Rye)

581
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:00,739
Yes?

582
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:08,210
Come in.

583
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,488
What is this?

584
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:19,619
- Oh, I got it as a free gift. - I see.

585
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,090
I heard you were looking for me.

586
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,630
Oh, right. Here.

587
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,269
What is this?

588
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,610
It's nothing grand.

589
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:39,809
It's your belated birthday gift. Back then, I couldn't get around...

590
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,710
to give it to you.

591
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,679
Dr. Yang.

592
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:51,519
After the incident with Ms. Im Se Hee,

593
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,619
I couldn't apologize to you properly.

594
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,829
Even if I'm a doctor,

595
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,360
I shouldn't have said that so recklessly.

596
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,968
I always think about the best option for the patients,

597
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:05,869
hence why I put it like that.

598
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,239
I couldn't accept the difference of opinion.

599
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:11,769
I'm sorry.

600
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,579
I totally understand why you said that.

601
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,719
I'm more sorry.

602
00:41:21,449 --> 00:41:23,190
Taking care of the patients is great,

603
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,659
but at times, you should take care of yourself too.

604
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,690
Even if you workout a lot,

605
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:32,030
you'll end up tiring both your body and heart...

606
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,960
if you don't look after yourself.

607
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:39,940
I wanted to say this more than what I said earlier.

608
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,340
Okay.

609
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,010
Thank you.

610
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,280
But as for this gym membership,

611
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,949
I don't think I can accept it.

612
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,989
Why not?

613
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:08,760
Hold on.

614
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:17,909
Hey. Excuse me.

615
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,539
Where is Seo Yeon Joo?

616
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:27,519
What?

617
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,119
Nurse Seo Yeon Joo? Why are you looking for her?

618
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,260
What's with this reaction?

619
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:38,328
What's your problem?

620
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:40,260
Who are you? Identify yourself first.

621
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,400
Why are you looking for Nurse Seo?

622
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,329
She's very busy.

623
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,440
What about you?

624
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,969
Where are you from?

625
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,780
Me? I was working in the vegetable garden out front...

626
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:59,079
In any case, I take care of various things for this hospital.

627
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:01,619
Okay? So who sent you? Why are you here?

628
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,989
Why are you looking for Nurse Seo?

629
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,488
We're here to do some volunteer work.

630
00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:07,219
Volunteer work? What kind?

631
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,829
You mean, community service?

632
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,558
Hold on. Then I'm your senior.

633
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:14,730
What the...

634
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,129
What did you do? Assault?

635
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,300
- What? - Theft?

636
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:21,698
You don't look like the con artist type.

637
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,509
Assault? It's probably assault.

638
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,339
What the heck are you talking about?

639
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,980
- Hey! - Hey, Yeon Joo.

640
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:32,408
- Where were you? This guy here... - Oh, they're fitness trainers...

641
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:35,579
from YJS Gym. They're here to volunteer.

642
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,249
This is my brother.

643
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,690
Oh, hello.

644
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,119
Isn't he so cute?

645
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,030
This is why I can't work out at a different gym.

646
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,059
Where is he going? Come and meet my brother...

647
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:50,098
You look very cheerful and handsome.

648
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:51,969
Yes, I hear that a lot.

649
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,239
You two look so much alike.

650
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:55,039
Welcome.

651
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,768
- We don't really look alike... - Everyone says we look like twins.

652
00:43:57,769 --> 00:44:00,840
Oh, my. That feels so nice.

653
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,110
My gosh, thank you.

654
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,610
- Does it feel nice? - Yes.

655
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,820
We're busy right now. Why must you do this?

656
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,190
Come on. Just 5 minutes. It won't take more than 5 minutes.

657
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:15,859
You're a doctor, right?

658
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,730
Yes, I am. As you can see.

659
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,429
After meeting you earlier,

660
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:26,039
I wanted to talk to you about something.

661
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:27,769
Goodness. He's really getting on my nerves.

662
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,038
Hey, mister. What do you do here?

663
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:32,809
Why would you ask him such a question?

664
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:35,139
He keeps getting on my nerves.

665
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:38,980
Well, I'm...

666
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,619
How should I put this?

667
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,989
I maintain order, organize things, and protect peace in this hospital.

668
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,019
That's what I do.

669
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:51,030
Well...

670
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,400
Enjoy your conversation.

671
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,300
See you around.

672
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,699
Bye.

673
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,210
What's with him?

674
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,840
Anyway, Doctor.

675
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,139
My gosh, you didn't have to.

676
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,079
My sister is tactless.

677
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,719
Working with her probably isn't easy. Thank you.

678
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:22,158
Right, Nurse Seo can be quite tactless at times.

679
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:24,059
She works out at the hospital...

680
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,889
because I told her to.

681
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:29,768
She's always been very skinny and weak since she was little,

682
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,170
so I always worry about her.

683
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:34,499
You must truly care for her as if she's your daughter.

684
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,538
I'm only a year older.

685
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:37,110
I'll pay more attention to her.

686
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,578
Thank you so much.

687
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:41,908
By any chance, are you married?

688
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:44,280
No! I'm not married.

689
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,578
I've never been married.

690
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:49,380
- Don't mind him. - I'm divorced.

691
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,589
- Don't bring up such a sad topic. - My apologies.

692
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,658
Well, why can't I talk about it? Anyway...

693
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:56,489
Do you work out?

694
00:45:56,889 --> 00:45:58,229
If you want to exercise... Hold on.

695
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,730
Oh, my! He's got muscles.

696
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:02,159
I've been working out.

697
00:46:03,269 --> 00:46:04,769
- Keep it up. - Okay.

698
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:09,670
This part too. You should try it.

699
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,079
Again?

700
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:19,178
Kids, I'm sorry. We don't have space for more animals here.

701
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:20,718
But it's just a tiny kitten.

702
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:23,550
This cat is tiny, so it won't take up a lot of space.

703
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,389
And it will get adopted very quickly since it's a kitten.

704
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,768
Okay, you can leave the cat with me.

705
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:39,399
- Thank you. - Thank you.

706
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,598
You guys are so sweet.

707
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:42,699
Here, take one each.

708
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,479
- Take care. - Take care.

709
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,510
All right. Next time, don't bring another kitten.

710
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:58,289
I've come to the right place.

711
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,360
Hi, it's been a while.

712
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,530
I jumped through hoops to find this place.

713
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:15,070
My, you're the most successful one out of everyone from the orphanage.

714
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,139
But then again,

715
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:20,809
you were different from the rest of us to begin with.

716
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,579
Well, what brings you here?

717
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:29,550
Where is Gyeo Rye?

718
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:34,059
I told you. I really don't know. How many times must I tell you?

719
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,489
Sonny was here, right?

720
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:42,659
Gyeo Rye told me that Sonny was my baby too.

721
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,469
He said someone from the orphanage studied veterinary medicine...

722
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,099
and that he'd visit him.

723
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:50,109
I'm two years older than Gyeo Rye.

724
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,609
He was probably talking about someone his age.

725
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,409
Gyeo Rye always treated you as if you were his age.

726
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,750
I can't tell you anything even if I know where he is.

727
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,320
Why can't you tell me?

728
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:04,550
You know what kind of relationship he and I have.

729
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:07,090
Why are you being like this?

730
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,389
What is your relationship?

731
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,559
I mean, accurately speaking. Tell me. I really don't know.

732
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:19,900
Can't you tell? We love each other.

733
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,170
We love each other like family.

734
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:25,170
We are like family,

735
00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:27,510
and we will become a real family soon.

736
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:30,409
If that is the case, why are you here?

737
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,678
If he loved you and thought of you as his family,

738
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:34,419
he would call you first.

739
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,980
And he would've already told you where he was.

740
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,500
The volunteers at the orphanage who saw me all said,

741
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,239
"Who abandoned this pretty girl?"

742
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,809
They kept saying that.

743
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:02,139
So when someone tells me that I'm pretty,

744
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,710
it makes me sick.

745
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,789
But I wouldn't feel that way if Gyeo Rye said it.

746
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:16,789
If I heard him say that, I wouldn't want to die.

747
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,530
But he never once said it.

748
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:25,070
Couldn't he have just said it even if he didn't mean it?

749
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:29,469
It's not easy to say something you don't mean.

750
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:35,039
- You're annoying. - Okay, sorry.

751
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,110
- I'll be back. - All right, bye.

752
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:42,980
Jun Kyung was here.

753
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,150
Oh, I'm sorry you had to deal with that.

754
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,829
But if she comes back,

755
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,129
just tell her the same thing.

756
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:55,800
Well... Okay. That's nothing hard.

757
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,630
But why don't you find her pretty?

758
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:00,599
What?

759
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,538
I mean, she's really pretty.

760
00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:05,909
Everyone thinks she's pretty. How come you don't think that?

761
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,340
You don't think she's pretty, and she's devastated by that.

762
00:50:09,949 --> 00:50:11,809
I really don't get it. What's with you?

763
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:14,980
Hey, I have to go.

764
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,118
Let's talk another time.

765
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,320
Wait, don't hang up...

766
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,070
All right. 4, 3, 2, 1.

767
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:35,440
Done! Congratulations!

768
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:37,369
Mr. Yoon. You've completed your community service.

769
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:38,710
Blow out the candle.

770
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,340
- I'm done. - Yes.

771
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,440
Nice.

772
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:45,178
Come on, people. I'm sad too.

773
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:46,678
But we should congratulate him.

774
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:49,250
Say something.

775
00:50:49,949 --> 00:50:51,590
Congratulations, Gyeo Rye.

776
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:54,190
Well, congratulations.

777
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,828
But was this cake really necessary?

778
00:50:56,829 --> 00:50:58,829
Of course, we should congratulate him properly.

779
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,860
Yes.

780
00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:04,429
Gyeo Rye.

781
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,639
I picked you and made you come here...

782
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:10,110
because I wanted you...

783
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:13,139
to forget your past and find happiness...

784
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:16,139
while working here, just like I did.

785
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:19,920
I know you like to poke your nose into other people's business.

786
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,679
But why me?

787
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:23,820
You didn't even know me.

788
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,530
Maybe I knew you in the past.

789
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,940
Yes, who knows? You might have crossed paths in the past.

790
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,210
You know, it happens.

791
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,710
It's a small world.

792
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:48,039
It's such a small world. It never ceases to amaze me.

793
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:50,179
Also,

794
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:52,980
I need someone...

795
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:55,949
to be my successor and take over my job...

796
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,219
as the captain of Team Genie.

797
00:52:00,289 --> 00:52:03,190
Why? Is something going on with you?

798
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:06,599
What is it?

799
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:09,360
No.

800
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:12,029
I'm getting old too, you know.

801
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,968
My knees are getting weak, just like yours.

802
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:16,638
My eyesight is getting worse too, so I find it hard...

803
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:18,440
to drive at night.

804
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:21,109
Don't say that in front of us. You're much younger than us.

805
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:23,750
Anyway, whatever.

806
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,349
I'm done.

807
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,420
Thanks, everyone. I'm off.

808
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,219
I'm leaving.

809
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,559
I'm really leaving!

810
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,969
- He won't leave, right? - Of course, he won't.

811
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,070
He can't.

812
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:50,070
We made this cake for him, but he didn't even eat it.

813
00:52:50,739 --> 00:52:54,210
It's his cake. Why are you eating it?

814
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,110
Don't spit it out!

815
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:05,090
Do they expect me to be grateful?

816
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:10,059
They called me here because they needed me.

817
00:53:10,289 --> 00:53:11,590
But now...

818
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:15,230
Gosh. Why did I bring all these clothes?

819
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,900
I'm so annoyed.

820
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:30,710
Hey, Sonny.

821
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:32,980
We're done.

822
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:34,880
We have to leave.

823
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:39,250
Hold on.

824
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,559
I mean, I know I have to leave,

825
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,429
but I don't want to leave like this.

826
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:06,679
What's this?

827
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:08,719
Hey.

828
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:10,789
Mr. Crook.

829
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:14,159
Oh, boy.

830
00:54:16,789 --> 00:54:18,360
Let's have a cup of coffee.

831
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:26,969
Oh, my. This is so good.

832
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:33,139
How am I going to leave this happiness behind...

833
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:35,409
and leave?

834
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,349
I'm sad.

835
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:42,280
What? Are you really leaving?

836
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:45,989
Are you moving to a different place or something?

837
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:49,658
Is that why you used the crutches when your legs were totally fine?

838
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:51,360
Was it all part of your plan?

839
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,960
To make me stay here for good?

840
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:56,230
Is that it?

841
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:01,800
I should leave.

842
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:06,639
They're calling me home, so I should leave.

843
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,210
I can't stay.

844
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:21,190
When I was homeless,

845
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:24,659
I was diagnosed with lung cancer.

846
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:31,230
Someone told me to go to this hospital, so I came here.

847
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,469
But on my way here,

848
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:39,769
I couldn't help but laugh at myself.

849
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:44,349
I wanted to punish myself, and that was why...

850
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:46,550
I decided to become homeless.

851
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:51,090
And there I was, hoping to die without pain.

852
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:53,619
I thought it was laughable.

853
00:55:55,989 --> 00:55:57,090
I was contradicting myself.

854
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:04,670
So I...

855
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,090
(Orim-dong)

856
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:38,599
I saw a bridge on my way here,

857
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,139
and I jumped off the bridge.

858
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,610
Gosh, please...

859
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:54,179
- My gosh! - Excuse me.

860
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:56,320
- He's alive. - Sir!

861
00:56:56,849 --> 00:56:57,988
Are you okay?

862
00:56:57,989 --> 00:57:00,190
It looks like he was on his way to our hospital.

863
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,289
But the ladies, Mr. Hwang,

864
00:57:03,389 --> 00:57:05,189
and Nurse Seo...

865
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:09,099
dragged me out of the water and saved me.

866
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,219
Anyway, I came here...

867
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,320
and lived here as a patient.

868
00:57:34,489 --> 00:57:35,690
Then by some kind of miracle,

869
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,530
I recovered.

870
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:41,199
I mean, I wasn't fully cured of cancer,

871
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:44,469
but the cancer cells didn't spread to other areas.

872
00:57:46,969 --> 00:57:50,469
I earned a new life as a bonus, so I didn't want to waste it.

873
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,349
I decided to become everyone's Genie.

874
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:13,900
So until I fully recovered,

875
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,570
I stayed...

876
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,869
in the room on the fourth floor, which you're so curious about.

877
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,440
I didn't want the others to find out that I had cancer,

878
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:34,679
so I put a lock on the door.

879
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,650
I was in that room for quite a while.

880
00:58:40,659 --> 00:58:42,119
But recently,

881
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:46,690
my cancer came back.

882
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,199
That's why I needed you to come here...

883
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:54,570
and take over my position in Team Genie.

884
00:59:04,849 --> 00:59:06,110
That's it.

885
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,820
Then...

886
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:52,360
Who is the person that's staying in the room...

887
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,159
on the fourth floor now?

888
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,530
Who?

889
00:59:58,099 --> 00:59:59,530
Who's in that room?

890
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:08,980
(Kang Tae Sik)

891
01:00:10,909 --> 01:00:14,480
But recently, my cancer came back.

892
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:17,090
That's why I needed you to come here...

893
01:00:17,889 --> 01:00:19,389
and take over my position in Team Genie.

894
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,900
(Kang Tae Sik)

895
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,889
Did the door code change?

896
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:01,159
- Why? Is it not working? - It's not working.

897
01:01:04,429 --> 01:01:05,469
What's going on?

898
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,900
(My dear daughter Nurse Seo)

899
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:11,269
Nurse Seo is calling. I should ask her.

900
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,538
Hey, Nurse Seo.

901
01:01:14,539 --> 01:01:17,678
Mr. Kang. Yoon Gyeo Rye... Where is he now?

902
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:19,809
Gyeo Rye? He's with me now.

903
01:01:19,949 --> 01:01:22,619
Sonny... Sonny is...

904
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,789
Sonny? What about him?

905
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,989
Gyeo Rye and I will be right there.

906
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,880
(If You Wish Upon Me)

907
01:01:58,789 --> 01:02:01,360
It's something Mr. Kang has been preparing.

908
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,489
Maybe I should live a little longer.

909
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,489
Yoon Gyeo Rye. You met him, right?

910
01:02:07,329 --> 01:02:10,360
They should get married.

911
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,070
Have you asked Nurse Seo?

912
01:02:12,269 --> 01:02:15,900
You don't need to impress me, do you?

913
01:02:16,369 --> 01:02:18,210
Why didn't I know...

914
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:20,309
that it was more than enough?

915
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,909
I like you more now.

916
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:26,449
Gyeo Rye, your girlfriend is here.
