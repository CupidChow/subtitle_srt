Oh, you don't need to fake it.

00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,390
I know you can walk.

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,429
Why did you accept money from Se Hee's parents?

10
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,960
You said you were doing this for free!

11
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:56,829
What is this?

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,369
How come you have so much money when you used to be homeless?

13
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,369
Your leg is fine. What's with the crutches?

14
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,969
Did you really kill someone?

15
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,939
Report me to the police if you'd like.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,980

No, thanks.

20
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,959
Don't talk to me unless you're going to explain what happened yesterday.

21
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,260
I'm not trying to talk to you. I just brought you a cup of coffee.

22
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,129
Are you kidding me? It's the same thing.

23
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,500
Look, you see...

24
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:39,768
I don't want to talk to someone who I know nothing about,

25
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:42,169
so go away. I don't want coffee.

26
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,980
I'm working. Stop bothering me. Go away.

27
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,280
Go ahead and judge me...

28
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,980
based on the things you saw and heard.

29
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,789
Here, drink it. My arm is getting tired.

30
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,749
I told you. I don't want coffee.

31
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,859
Fine. Don't drink it, then.

32
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:11,038
A monkey's butt is red

33
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,799
If it's red, it's an apple

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,568
Apples are delicious

35
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,638
Bananas are delicious and long

36
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,710
Forget it.

37
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:21,810
Darn it. I don't want to do this.

Where could Yoon Gyeo Rye be right now?

42
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:37,659
That is what I really wanted to ask you.

43
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:38,960
You still haven't found him?

44
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,389
I have to find him soon too.

45
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:48,870
If that jerk contacts you, you must call me at once.

46
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,638
Or you're both dead.

47
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,340
Yes, we'll both die.

48
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,169
But not at your hands.

49
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,479
We'll die at my hands.

50
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,979
Do you think I'm a joke?

51
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,650
Of course, I do.

52
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,860
You swear all the time, work out to bulk up,

53
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,490
and get tattoos all over your body. But for what?

54
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,860
You're so weak mentally.

55
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,870
You're a softie. As soft as expired tofu.

56
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,209
Go to the hotel. What are you doing at this stupid place?

57
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:32,509
My gosh.

58
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:35,209
Can I take this card and go on a shopping spree?

59
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,250
You see,

60
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,220
Gyeo Rye and I lived at this stupid place for eight months.

61
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:47,060
This was our home, so don't speak disrespectfully.

62
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,160
I'll let you get away with this, but be careful in front of Cheol Woo.

63
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,170
If you keep acting up, he'll knock all your teeth out.

64
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,370
He won't hold back to punch a woman...

65
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,970
- to knock her jaw and teeth out. - Losers.

66
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,879
You losers brag about hitting women.

67
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,869
What is it? What happened?

68
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,500
I could've crossed, but the light just turned red.

69
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,439
That's a bummer. It's not your lucky day. The light changed just now?

70
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,480
If you feel bad for me, sing something for me.

71
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,910
- All of a sudden? - Yes.

72
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,878
What do you want to hear?

73
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,689
You know, that song. The song you sang in the musical.

74
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,689
The one you sang in the music room to seduce me.

75
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,629
I never sang anything to seduce you.

76
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,889
You did.

77
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,100
Well, then...

78
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,740
I'll sing a short snippet.

79
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:06,069
Sure.

80
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,750
A miracle in my life

81
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:21,819
I didn't know love would come to me

82
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,050
The last

83
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,970
Hello?

84
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,579
Hello?

85
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,480
Hello? Hey, are you all right?

86
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,850
Hello?

87
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,188
Honey, Hyung Jun will be okay.

88
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:00,529
Don't worry too much.

89
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,559
Honey. Hyung Jun will be okay, right?

90
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,929
Yes, of course. Calm down.

91
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,269
Oh, Doctor! How is Hyung Jun?

92
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,068
How is my son?

93
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:15,838
Ma'am, we did our best.

94
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,778
- We did everything we could... - Just a comment, Doctor.

95
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:20,138
How is Hyung Jun?

96
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,479
We heard he was in critical condition...

97
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,979
as they took him to two trauma centers and missed the golden time.

98
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,518
Do you think he'll recover?

99
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,948
At the moment, all I can say is that we'll do our best to treat him.

100
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:29,989
Please excuse me.

101
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,088
- One more question, Doctor. - Doctor!

102
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,219
- Doctor! - Wait, Doctor!

103
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,929
The driver, who was most likely drunk while driving,

104
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,299
hasn't even been given any summons even though his injury is mild.

105
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,799
He's being treated in a private room.

106
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,469
Did you know that the driver was a famous news anchor?

107
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,969
What are you talking about?

108
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,039
- Just a comment, please. - Say a few words.

109
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,169
Get out. Leave, all of you! I can't believe this.

110
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,138
- Sir, just a comment. - Honey!

111
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,839
- One comment, sir. - Honey!

112
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:51,708
Please leave at once.

113
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:52,878
You must all leave now.

114
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,249
- Nurse! - Is she okay?

115
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,948
Leave. Get out!

116
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:59,079
- Over here! - Just a comment, please.

117
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,949
Please leave.

118
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,929
I'll be sure...

119
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,929
to make your wish come true.

120
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,580
You have to grant his wish.

121
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,519
Is he in critical condition?

122
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,759
He's badly hurt,

123
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:13,690
but I know he'll live.

124
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,590
If that's the case,

125
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,559
we don't have to grant his wish, right?

126
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,600
It may not be his last wish.

127
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,340
It won't be his last wish,

128
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,080
but just in case.

129
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,079
What's your friend's wish?

130
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,648
Promise me that you'll grant his wish.

131
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:44,059
I can't promise you that until you tell me what it is.

132
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,129
Revenge.

133
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,070
Revenge?

134
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:07,809
All right. What kind of revenge?

135
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,080
Something that can tear his heart into pieces.

136
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,389
That kind of revenge.

(Jungmo General Hospital)

138
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,230
I'm still trying to work out the details.

139
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:27,128
It won't be easy...

140
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:28,970
because they're powerful people.

141
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,599
Don't say anything, Ji Woo.

142
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,298
How is Mr. Han Dong Wook?

143
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,008
How much did he drink?

144
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,069
He left the scene immediately after the accident and went back,

145
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,339
so he's been accused of a hit-and-run.

146
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,678
Ma'am, you're a lawyer at a big law firm.

147
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,949
Are you helping your husband buy time to get out of this?

148
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,979
- Just a comment, ma'am! - Say a few words!

But if a crucial witness starts talking,

151
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,559
won't the situation change?

152
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,409
Who are you here to see?

153
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,709
Mr. Han Dong Wook.

154
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,579
What's your relationship with him?

155

His family just went in.

00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,519
May I see your ID?

157
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,469
Father knows too, right?

158
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,129
Of course, he knows.

159
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,370
It's been all over the news.

160
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,809
Unfortunately, it looks like...

161
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,278
public opinion will demand that more trauma centers be built.

00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,250
Would you like to speak to Ji Woo's mother?

168
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,220
All right, then. We'll be in touch.

169
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,028
My mom is too much.

170
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:05,758
I was going to call her. Why did she call you knowing you aren't well?

171
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,259
Come on. It's just a phone call.

172
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,139
My sweetheart. Did you come here straight from school?

173
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:13,299
Have you eaten yet?

174
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,878
You won't even give me a hug now that you're all grown up.

175
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,979
My gosh, I'm upset.

176
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,649
She's just a little thrown off right now.

177
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,549
Gosh, the reporters keep showing up. They're driving me nuts.

178
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:30,990
I'm sorry. Let's hang in there just a little longer.

179
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,889
Yes, come in!

180
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:39,199
(Park and Jang Law Firm)

181
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,899
Oh, you can put it there.

182
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,570
Hello, sir.

183
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,399
You didn't have to send this.

184
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,538
Yes. We're taking it to trial.

185
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:52,408
I'll prepare everything.

186
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:54,679
Mr. Choi will handle the trial for me.

187
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:57,378
As for his letter of apology, we hired an expert.

188
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,250
I'm sure the ghostwriter will do a good job.

189
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:04,289
Right. My husband is okay.

190
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,759
My gosh. Thank you so much for your concern.

191
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,360
Yes, I'll let you know.

192
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,559
Okay, have a good day.

193
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:23,908
My gosh. You said you could draw well.

194
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,279
You can draw portraits too?

195
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,750
Don't talk to me unless you're going to explain what that was about.

196
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,049
Oh, my. She looks so beautiful.

197
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,289
She has no wrinkles.

198
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:46,099
Ma'am, he's drawing you in a beautiful hanbok dress.

199
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,230
- Go away, will you? - You're awfully slow-witted.

200
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,529
Ma'am.

201
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:19,860
I'll finish the rest later.

202
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,279
Gosh, I'm so tired.

203
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,600
Dad!

204
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,370
Help me.

205
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,370
I'm not dead!

206
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,250
Ji Woo, help me.

207
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,559
- Mom! - What's wrong, Ji Woo?

208
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,730
Ji Woo, are you okay?

209
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,570
Did you have a nightmare?

210
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,139
Do you want to take a day off school today? You don't have to go.

211
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:12,580
No.

212
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,649
I'm okay.

213
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,758
She thinks she's a tragic heroine.

214
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,029
For real. And what's with that hairstyle?

215
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:29,758
- Right? - It looks like kimchi.

216
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,928
Kimchi! Hey.

217
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:33,399
- Kimchi will be offended. Shut it. - Exactly.

218
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,330
Oh, I feel like throwing up.

219
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,469
- She looks like she'd stink. - I know, right?

220
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,299
- Hey, Yoo Seo Jin! - What's with her?

221
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,769
Hey.

222
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:43,409
Gosh, she's so gross.

223
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,879
Hey.

224
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,750
You look like you have no energy. Did you not eat anything?

225
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,580
- How annoying. Why is she here? - No wonder she has no friends.

226
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,950
She's really annoying.

227
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:58,690
Hey, what's going on? Are you being bullied?

228
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,258
Why do those girls hate you so much?

229
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,330
Forget it.

230
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,500
Are you here to see me?

231
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,829
Well, I was just in the area.

232
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:12,200
Did Mr. Kang send you?

233
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,569
Why would he send me here?

234
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,808
Then why are you here?

235
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:19,410
I told you. I was just in the area and saw your school...

236
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,710
Well, I was a little worried about you.

237
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,160
Since you came all the way here anyway,

238
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,960
why don't you drive me home?

239
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:50,210
Did your friend really say that was his wish?

240
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,779
Why?

241
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,349
Do you think it's bad? Getting his revenge.

242
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,078
There's no such thing as a bad wish.

243
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,789
A wish is a wish.

244
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,720
In any case, Mr. Kang doesn't want to grant that wish.

245
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:08,759
Okay.

246
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,170
That day... I shouldn't have called him.

247
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,200
I shouldn't have sung.

248
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:21,809
It's all my fault.

249
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,940
Hey, stop. Why is it your fault?

250
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,049
Hey, don't think like that. Okay?

251
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,719
It's that jerk's fault for drinking and driving...

252
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,380
and ignoring the red light.

253
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,250
That scumbag.

254
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,329
But I think it's a good idea.

255
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,759
Revenge. I support that.

256
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:05,349
Call me when you've made up your mind.

257
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:27,798
Turn off the TV before bed.

258
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,069
It racks up the electricity bill. Why do you always say you're scared?

259
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:55,890
Goodnight.

260
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,920
The kids at school think my mom and dad run a hostess bar,

261
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,660
a karaoke, or something.

262
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,160
They only run a slightly big karaoke.

263
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,460
But back in middle school,

264
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:35,299
they hired a hostess for a short time.

265
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,069
That rumour spread like fire in the school.

266
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,910
The kids thought my dad was a pimp or a thug.

267
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:43,769
Anyway, that became a topic of gossip.

268
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,539
And since then, I've been an outcast.

269
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:49,349
Why would they do that?

270
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,279
You did nothing wrong. It was your parents.

271
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,789
But they can't outcast my parents.

272
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,089
Well...

273
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:01,119
But still. Darn it.

274
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,230
Do you know who made that rumour?

275
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,670
The son of the hostess. We were in the same class.

276
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:18,380
But maybe...

277
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,740
he felt the same way as I do now.

278
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,579
What could he have done?

279
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,390
Against those adults.

280
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,529
"Against those adults."

281
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,630
Don't lay a finger on my sister.

282
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,939
She's not even your sister by blood.

283
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,339
You are the only ones who don't know your parents' faces, right?

284
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,939
So birds of a feather flock together.

285
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,039
Shut it!

286
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,048
Hey, stop.

287
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,480
- Let go of me! - Stop it.

288
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,889
I'm dying to know who your parents are.

289
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,089
Director, listen.

290
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,629
Never mind. It's obvious, isn't it?

291
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,329
You came here on your own two feet, after all.

292
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,670
Hey. Over here.

293
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:20,539
Hey. Put this back at home.

294
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,940
Okay.

295
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,680
Where did you get this?

296
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:29,910
Darn it.

297
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:31,849
Are you okay?

298
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,920
You little thief.

299
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,390
- Where did that gang go? - What do you mean?

300
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,858
Where are the jerks who stole my wallet and bag?

301
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:43,630
- It wasn't me. - Bollocks.

302
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,058
Guys like you need to serve time.

303
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:47,660
But it really wasn't me.

304
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,469
I told you never to cause any accidents.

305
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,069
Weren't you confident in driving?

306
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,069
- I'm sorry. - Will you take responsibility?

307
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,640
Will you? Tell me.

308
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,109
Sir.

309
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,179
Can't you give me my salary?

310
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,318
It's already been five months.

311
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,859
Just leave when I'm still being nice to you.

312
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,390
- Give me my money. - You jerk!

313
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,369
What could he have done?

314
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,539
Against those adults.

315
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,369
Aren't you going home?

316
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,869
I'm working the night shift today.

317
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,309
Here.

318
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:10,150
What about you? Why aren't you going home?

319
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:13,819
Thanks.

320
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,450
I don't have a home.

321
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,119
What? You don't?

322
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,359
Oh, do you prefer the hotel suite?

323
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:26,759
After I left the orphanage,

324
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,699
I slept and live in a motel-run room, subdivided flat,

325
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,799
sauna, and places like that.

326
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,509
I see.

327
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,539
I had no idea.

328
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,480
Sonny.

329
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,890
This is the only place he's doing well.

330
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,890
He barely slept or ate elsewhere.

331
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,430
How strange.

332

Does he feel at ease here?

333
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,940
Sonny must know that this is a hospice hospital.

Oh, well...

335
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,950
I heard from your vet friend.

336
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,549
That Sonny doesn't have much time left.

337
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,589
Hey.

338
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,970
What's your joy in life?

339
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,299
- Joy? - Yes, joy.

340
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:40,999
What the heck? You sound old.

341
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,739
Who asks that?

342
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,970
I'm just curious.

343
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,809
Let's see. Joy?

344
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,650
There are so many I might spend the night listing them.

345
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,750
Then tell me three of them.

346
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:54,079
Three?

347
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,588
Okay. The first one is...

348
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:59,220
- Working out. - Correct.

349
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,960
The second one is...

350
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,989
working as a nurse...

351
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,259
at a hospice hospital.

352
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,029
And the third one is...

353
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,670
eating delicious food and chatting with others at the lounge.

354
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,739
And another joy I just discovered is...

355
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,769
Enough.

356
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,140
I only asked for three.

357
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,119

358

I see.

359
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:38,089
So...

360
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:42,269
I'm wondering what could make him laugh more.

361
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:47,740
And I got the motivation to become stronger.

362
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,539
Because his smile...

363
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,950
is really beautiful.

Yes.

Right.

369

Don't you think acting coy is better at times like this?

370

I don't know. I never learned how to do it.

But not today of all times.

Seo Jin is probably really upset with me right now.

Why would a teenager get upset by a 50-year-old?

You're not her dad or teacher.

Oh, right.

397

But why did she ask you to grant his wish?

398
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,989

If you thought dearly of your child,

500
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,530
you shouldn't have done that to another parent's child.

501
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:41,158
If you have the time to come here, go to the police first.

502
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,899
You should've apologized first,

503
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,070
not tried to get away with the trial.

504
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,800
Don't you think so, Ji Woo?

505
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,138
Don't you, guys?

506
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:53,238
Hey! Stop!

507
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,439
What are you going to do, honey?

508
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,349
I'll go to the police right away...

509
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,750
and tell them everything. I won't stand on trial either.

510
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,589
So please.

511
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,118
You made me leave a permanent wound...

512
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,559
in Ji Woo's heart.

513
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,029
It's not because I came here,

514
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,730
but because you weren't acting adult-like. Understood?

515
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:23,769
(Hyung Jun)

516
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:26,940
- She hung up. - Who are you guys?

517
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,079
- You scumbags! - Honey, stop.

518
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,150
Don't do it.

519
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,750
Ji Woo!

520
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:38,050
Honey!

521
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,900
(Women's Bathroom)

522
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,079
I'm sorry.

523
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,610
We should have apologized...

524
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:40,349
to Kwak Hyung Jun first,

525
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:45,989
not to grandpa or to my mom's company CEO.

526
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:50,659
What my dad did was wrong.

527
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,530
And it was wrong of him to drive under the influence.

528
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,630
I apologize...

529
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,369
on behalf of my dad.

530
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:03,539
And I'm sorry too.

531
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,610
I couldn't say it because he was my dad.

532
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:09,610
It happened when he picked me up after my academy.

533
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,719
We'll tell the police everything.

534
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:18,150
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

535
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:22,190
Why are you...

536
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,900
You should hit and yell at me for doing this to your dad.

537
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,269
Why are you apologizing to me?

538
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,239
What I did to you is wrong too.

539
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,909
You're only making me feel worse.

540
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:39,880
I'm sorry.

541
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,440
I'm so sorry.

542
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,349
I'm sorry.

543
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,860
None of you are at fault. It's okay.

544
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,570
It's okay.

545
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,570
What are you doing?

546
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:10,039
Who are you?

547
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,139
Oh, well.

548
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,610
They're my family.

549
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,049
That's the girl I let in.

550
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,579
Let's go in.

551
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,820
I'm sorry.

552
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:26,860
I'm sorry.

553
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,000
Hello?

554
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:38,300
The memo with the school address.

555
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:40,400
Did you leave it in the ambulance on purpose?

556
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,340
Me?

557
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,849
(Sungyoung Elementary School)

558
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:58,420
I don't think that was me.

559
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,860
Hey. What if...

560
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,630
I stopped and interrupted them?

561
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:06,829
You saw them. There was nothing to stop.

562
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,329
She was...

563
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:10,530
different from me.

564
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,539
Gosh.

565
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:16,139
If I were her, I would've...

566
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,269
taken revenge on them.

567
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,980
I can never take that.

568
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,750
But she said...

569
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,980
she wants to do it her way.

570
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,079
Look, Gyeo Rye.

571
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,420
You would've been like her.

572
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:38,190
It's my fault for misunderstanding when you wanted a copy.

573
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,900
At least you know.

574
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,699
Anyway, thank you...

575
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:45,199
for staying next to Seo Jin when she was struggling.

576
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:48,639
See you at the hospital.

577
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,920
I...

578
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:22,809
Ji Woo.

579
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,209
Ji Woo.

580
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,809
Ji Woo. Are you okay?

581
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,308
Are you hurt?

582
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:30,379
What happened?

583
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,980
What is going on?

584
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,619
Dad.

585
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:36,788
Mom.

586
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:37,849
- Yes. - Yes.

587
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:41,889
I want to be...

588
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,190
a good grown-up.

589
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,440
I'm sorry, Ji Woo.

590
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,980
Mommy's sorry.

591
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,179
Daddy's sorry.

592
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:07,719
I'm sorry.

593
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,179
(Intensive Care Unit)

594
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,889
Revenge wasn't Hyung Jun's wish.

595
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,860
That was my wish.

596
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,000
When he woke up,

597
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:58,670
all he said was...

598
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:02,670
The other people...

599
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,170
Are they okay?

600
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,590
I knew it.

601
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,630
I knew it wasn't his wish.

602
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,159
How?

603
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:29,000
He didn't think...

604
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,769
he was dying.

605
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,110
He knew he was going to get up again.

606
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:54,389
Are you Hyung Jun's parents?

607
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,730
I'm very sorry.

608
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:05,500
I'll get punished properly for what I did.

609
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,408
- Kwak Hyung Jun's guardian? - Yes.

610
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:19,348
He's awake.

611
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:21,779
Really? Hyung Jun is up.

612
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,590
Hyung Jun.

613
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:25,920
Hyung Jun.

614
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:28,558
- Hyung Jun. - Hyung Jun.

615
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:30,190
Mommy's here.

616
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,869
Mommy's here, Hyung Jun.

617
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:42,340
Hyung Jun. My son.

618
00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:46,539
Mommy's right here.

619
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,050
Don't forget.

620
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:00,389
What we do is grant the last wish.

621
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:18,670
Thank you for today.

622
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,619
Why are you touching my stuff?

623
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:34,059
But...

624
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,829
It's not exactly clean for Sonny, so I washed it.

625
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,428
It's not dry yet.

626
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:42,730
I never asked you. Don't touch my stuff.

627
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:46,030
If it's dangerous money,

628
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:48,400
can't you just give it back?

629
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:51,368
You wouldn't need that much here.

630
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,510
I'll take care of it.

631
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:55,039
There isn't much left anyway.

632
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,980
- What? - My volunteer hours are almost up.

633
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,090
Mind your own business.

634
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,440
Did I do something wrong?

635
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:26,610
Still, I'm disappointed.

636
00:48:43,889 --> 00:48:46,630
Gosh.

637
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:49,629
Was I too mean?

638
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,570
Gosh.

639
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,719
If I die before using all the money I have,

640
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,760
I'll donate the money...

641
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:18,559
inside this backpack to Team Genie.

642
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,199
I hope they use this money to grant wishes.

643
00:49:22,929 --> 00:49:24,800
However, if Sonny is alive,

644
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:27,300
take care of him until he dies.

645
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:38,250
(In the trunk of this Genie car...)

646
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:51,260
P.S. My life was lame.

647
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:01,900
(Was lame...)

648
00:50:11,179 --> 00:50:12,280
Nice shot.

649
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:16,519
What's the total after the interest up to date?

650
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,949
It's 390,000 dollars.

651
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,429
The more he resists, the better for me.

652
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:28,059
Find him when it reaches 500,000 dollars.

653
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,500
If you still don't catch him by then,

654
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:39,840
I'll let you and Yoon Gyeo Rye go.

655
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,880
To where?

656
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,050
Over there.

657
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:18,179
(Yoghurt)

658
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:26,150
Am I constipated?

659
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:28,820
I see.

660
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,389
I didn't know I was constipated.

661
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,198
Apple taste.

662
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:38,829
(For Seo Yeon Joo's constipation)

663
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:42,840
Not bad.

664
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:47,440
Hold on.

665
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:49,980
Already?

666
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:04,059
Do you only draw portraits of patients?

667
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:05,659
It doesn't matter.

668
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,900
Then can you put me in tomorrow?

669
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:10,929
I'm busy tomorrow.

670
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,599
Next Monday or Tuesday...

671
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:20,739
Oh, right. My volunteer hours will be done.

672
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,380
Pardon?

673
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,250
For now...

674
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,190
Let me use one.

675
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:36,190
Write your name and phone number here.

676
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,689
Last time you said someone got attacked...

677
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,099
by a boar in the hill behind the hospital.

678
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,169
Did he die or survive?

679
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:46,269
I'm not sure.

680
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,209
I don't know if he was attacked or tried to avoid something.

681
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:53,110
Oh, he survived.

682
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,078
It was an urgent situation.

683
00:52:57,079 --> 00:52:58,848
I received that patient.

684
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:01,150
He was bleeding so much.

685
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,219
I struggled so much to stop the bleeding.

686
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,558
I saved him. Don't worry.

687
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,960
Still, we should be careful. It's dangerous.

688
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:13,460
- Here you are. - Okay.

689
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,719
Ma'am. I'll finish up later.

690
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:39,750
Bye.

691
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,760
Excuse me. Last time...

692
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,530
Wait.

693
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:03,948
Long time no see.

694
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,009
(21 star candies from Yongwani)

695
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,919
It's been so long.

696
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,078
I was away for a while.

697
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,718
(Streamer Anger)

698
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:12,249
(She got plastic surgery.)

699
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,320
Plastic surgery?

700
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:15,559
No. It wasn't plastic surgery this time.

701
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,558
I really want to go abroad.

702
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:21,359
But that's also wrong.

703
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,899
(Europe's fun to go.)

704
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,268
(European girls are pretty.)

705
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:25,369
Do you want to know?

706
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,840
Actually, I went to school.

707
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:34,078
No. Not university or grad school.

708
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,780
You know, we call it "school."

709
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,309
Prison.

710
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,250
I mean it.

711
00:54:40,949 --> 00:54:42,119
For what?

712
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,889
Arson.

713
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:46,889
I didn't start the fire on purpose, but it was still arson.

714
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,999
Thank you for saying I'm pretty.

715
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,828
(I don't like beans.)

716
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,239
(When did you get out?)

717
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,670
Why am I poor?

718
00:55:04,909 --> 00:55:07,639
Right. I'd make a lot from streaming.

719
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,578
You send me so much money,

720
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:12,510
but why am I still poor?

721
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:22,089
(999 star candies from Kyunghooni)

722
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,189
(50 star candies from Injikin)

723
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,429
Should I take this off?

724
00:55:24,929 --> 00:55:26,289
How much will you pay me for that?

725
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,139
You couldn't trust me

726
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:42,710
You got me close to that

727
00:55:42,909 --> 00:55:45,679
All I did wrong was

728
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,050
What's the matter?

729
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:10,469
You raised your daughter so well.

730
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,980
I feel guilty to say we raised her.

731
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:15,780
She grew up on her own.

732
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,610
Can you tell her to stop going to the hospital and start studying?

733
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:21,380
She's becoming Grade 12 soon.

734
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,219
You know for whom we work this hard.

735
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,159
Okay. I'll talk to her.

736
00:56:39,269 --> 00:56:40,300
Seo Jin.

737
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:45,169
You should say bye to your parents before you leave.

738
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:46,538
That was rude.

739
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:48,139
Yes, whatever.

740
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:52,050
Don't change the subject.

741
00:56:57,489 --> 00:56:58,550
Thank you...

742
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,288
for coming to school the other day.

743
00:57:01,289 --> 00:57:02,860
Look at you.

744
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,230
I didn't go there.

745
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,300
In fact, Yoon Gyeo Rye sent me.

746
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:15,139
By the way, since when was your leg okay?

747
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:16,500
What?

748
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:19,639
This?

749
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:22,380
Well, from the start.

750
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:24,750
Awesome.

751
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:28,420
Why did you fake it? It must have been a hassle.

752
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,920
Well...

753
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,888
Because I want Gyeo Rye to stay...

754
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:38,289
even after completing all his volunteer hours.

755
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,480
To make him stay after completing his volunteer hours,

756
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,219
we need a reason.

757
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:49,559
Where did she go?

758
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,050
Then should I tell him the truth?

759
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:08,820
What truth?

760
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,599
(Room 403)

761
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,239
I recognized him from the start.

762
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:38,280
That's why...

763
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,619
I made him come to this hospital.

764
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:46,618
Because that was my last wish.

765
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:48,118
(Room 403)

766
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,559
So I could...

767
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,650
(Room 403)

768
01:00:32,969 --> 01:00:34,000
What?

769
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,940
Someone's in here.

770
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,500
(If You Wish Upon Me)

771
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,199
Have you seen Mr. Kang?

772
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:07,099
He said he was going hiking.

773
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,539
Are Yoon Gyeo Rye and Nurse Seo dating?

774
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:12,469
- A fling. - A fling?

775
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:16,309
She said she was sad that she can't work in the hospital anymore.

776
01:01:16,909 --> 01:01:18,449
Did you find it?

777
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:20,780
Here.

778
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:22,179
Dr. Yang.

779
01:01:23,449 --> 01:01:25,349
Excuse me, Mr. Crook.

780
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,190
Did you think about it carefully?

781
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,590
Where's Seo Yeon Joo?

782
01:01:31,489 --> 01:01:33,130
Mr. Kang. Is everything all right?
