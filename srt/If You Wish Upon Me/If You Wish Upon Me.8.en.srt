00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,150
Hey, you need to eat.

10
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,889
They feel no guilt. Otherwise, they would not have abandoned you.

11
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,590
So eat. You need to eat to survive!

12
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,959

(Episode 8)

15
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,450
I told you Sonny looked familiar.

16
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,719
I was right.

17
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,120
I found the video creator couple who abandoned Sonny.

18
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,790
Sonny.

19
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,129
This is your last wish.

20
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,359
Right?

21
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,469
I'll grant your wish.

22
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,538
You're going to buy me a new purse, right?

23
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,669
- Yes. - I'm so excited!

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,110
Dr. Wang.

25
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:06,419
What the...

26
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,430
This is nuts.

27
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,559
My gosh, how adorable.

28
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,129
Hey, how did you even meet such horrible people?

29
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,468
Humans aren't the only ones...

30
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:20,969
whose lives could be ruined by horrible parents.

31
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,039
It's the same for you guys.

32
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,280
Horrible owners...

33
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,750
could make your life...

34
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,949
a pure misery. Did you know that?

35
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,659
Hey, Sonny. Do you feel that it's unfair?

36
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,229
Of course, you would. You just can't say it.

37
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:50,699
You didn't choose this.

38
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:56,508
How adorable!

39
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:59,378
Babe, let's get this one. This will draw so much attention.

40
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:02,008
My gosh, we'll get so many views.

41
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,749
Actually, no. Let's just get the small one.

42
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,718
The smaller one would be easier to take care of.

43
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,349
A small dog is easier to abandon too.

44
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,249
Why don't we get one more?

45
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,688
Another small one. We'll get 1 white and 1 brown.

46
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:14,758
- Sure. - Excuse me. How much is this one?

47
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,289
Sorry? Which one?

48
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,459
This one right here.

49
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,099
- Don't sell them to these people. - Pardon me?

50
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,269
Don't sell the dogs to them. They'll abandon them.

51
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,438
Hey, what's with you? You've been getting on my nerves.

52
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,338
Hey, we picked them first.

53
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,009
You picked them? What did you "pick?"

54
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,039
Are you buying a watermelon at a grocery store or something?

55
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,148
Why don't you knock on its head with your knuckles?

56
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,709
What? He must be crazy. What is the matter with him?

57
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,850
Hey! You little...

58
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,648
Who are you? What's your problem?

59
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:43,958
You'll abandon them anyway. Am I wrong?

60
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,620
How will you abandon them this time?

61
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,489
While you're out for a walk?

62
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,828
Or will you leave them on the road while driving?

63
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:54,068
Or will you throw them out in a garbage bag?

64
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,599
How will you throw them out this time?

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,099
Do something.

66
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,240
Hey!

67
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,970
What's your problem? Who are you?

68
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,339
I'm Genie. I make people's last wishes come true.

69
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,949
What? Genie? Did I ask you what your name was?

70
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,519
What's your problem? Why are you trying to pick a fight with me?

71
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,959
Watch me. I'll show you.

72
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,889
That little... Watch what?

73
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:47,888
You psycho! Are you insane? Hey! Stop.

74
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,119
Hey, come here. I'll smash your head flat.

75
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,888
You jerk! Do you know how much this car is?

76
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:53,359
- Come here. - No, please...

77
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,329
- Hey, let go! - Hey.

78
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,660
Take a good look. Do you recognize the dog?

79
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:01,029
- What is this? - Do you recognize the dog?

80
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,269
I'm going to ask you a question.

81
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,709
You'd better answer truthfully. Okay?

82
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,379
Did this dog run away on its own?

83
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,490
Or did you abandon the dog?

84
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:25,819
You two. Have you even tried to look for this dog?

85
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,529
- Have you? - Please! It ran away.

86
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,958
We looked everywhere for this dog.

87
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,458
Right, honey? Come on. Say something.

88
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,430
Yes, that's right. She ran away.

89
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:40,300
My baby girl. Where have you been?

90
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,709
He's a boy.

91
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,839
Wait! Stop!

92
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,449
Wait. Hold on!

93
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,420
No! Stop!

94
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,889
I will... Darn it!

95
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,519
I'll give you one last chance.

96
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:03,229
- What's his name? - How would we know?

97
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,759
Who would know his name if you didn't?

98
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:07,898
Stop! Hey, don't.

99
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:08,930
Hey! Stop!

100
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:13,540
His name is Doldol.

101
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,409
Doldol?

102
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,970
- Hey! - No!

103
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,939
This isn't Sonny's last wish.

104
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,649
So put that down.

105
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,779
Yoon Gyeo Rye! This is wrong!

106
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,990
- Hey, put that down! - Drop it.

107
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,290
Let it go. Gyeo Rye!

108
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,089
Gyeo Rye.

109
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:37,629
What is this?

110
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,560
What are you doing?

111
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:41,399
This is not who you are.

112
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,730
Sonny's last wish...

113
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,009
There's no way it's something like this, you know?

114
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,610
Then...

115
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:54,610
Then...

116
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,480
What is Sonny's last wish?

117
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,279
We don't have time.

118
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,689
You know we don't have time. Let's talk on the way.

119
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,959
Call the police. Hurry, quick!

120
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,689
You can call the police after we leave.

121
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,529
We'll turn ourselves in anyway.

122
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,200
So where are we going?

123
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,409
You'll find out.

124
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,480
Sonny, hang in there.

125
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:07,419
We're almost there.

126
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,600
(Closed Today)

127
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,250
What's going on?

128
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,549
Go sit in the chair over there.

129
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,559
Hey, come on.

130
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:57,299
What is this about?

131
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,940
What is this?

132
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,279
It's something Mr. Kang has been preparing.

133
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:12,980
A while back, you said...

134
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,389
you wanted Sonny to run around all he wanted...

135
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,289
and see this vast world before he died.

136
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,529
Breathing his last in the arms of his loving family.

137
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:32,440
Wouldn't it be the happiest way for him to remember his final moments?

138
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:36,710
Here.

139
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,019
Sit down.

140
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,799
Sonny!

141
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:32,519
Sonny, I'm really...

142
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,419
I'm really sorry.

143
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,929
And thanks so much for everything.

144
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,899
We'll meet again.

145
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,178
Check the security footage, okay?

146
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:32,979
Watch the footage!

147
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,008
Please calm down.

148
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,609
That jerk smashed my car with a baseball bat.

149
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,119
Hey! Come out!

150
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,689
That jerk shoved his head in my face and pushed me!

151
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,120
This is nuts.

152
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,658
This woman isn't any better.

153
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:45,888
She threw my phone on the ground.

154
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:48,559
My girlfriend was terrified. She's in the hospital now, okay?

155
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,690
Darn it.

156
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:57,029
If I see you again, you're dead meat. Okay?

157
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:02,570
Darn it!

158
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:15,590
I'm sure Sonny was very grateful to you too.

159
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,960
Had he never met you, he would have died without knowing...

160
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,090
that the world isn't such a bad place after all.

161
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,059
The same goes for me.

162
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,830
It would've been the same for me...

163
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,100
if I had never met you.

164
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
(Sonny, I will never forget you.)

165
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,759
Hey, Sonny.

166
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,189
Are you in a good place now?

167
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,629
(Sonny, I will never forget you.)

168
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,899
Because we came here,

169
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,039
things weren't so bad...

170
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,610
in your final days. You were happy, right?

171
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,149
Here, you met many people who truly loved you.

172
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:56,820
Right?

173
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:07,559
Sonny, I...

174
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,900
Maybe I should live a little longer.

175
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,569
When I'm here...

176
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,980
Well, I feel like I might be able to live like ordinary people...

177
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,990
and find happiness and joy...

178
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,690
if I stayed here.

179
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,589
Gosh, why am I crying?

180
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,200
I'm happy now.

181
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,940
It's all thanks to you.

182
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,740
Thanks a lot.

183
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,480
(Sonny, I will never forget you.)

184
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,079
Goodbye, Sonny.

185
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,789
Someday,

186
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,789
we will meet again.

187
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,029
You really were...

188
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:15,329
my best friend.

189
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,279
Hey, you won't die even if you can't breathe for a few moments.

190
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,150
Wait, will he?

191
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,019
Okay, wrap it up well.

192
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,889
Oh, right. Seok Jun.

193
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,890
Yes, boss.

194
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,119
You need to whack him. Yoon Gyeo Rye.

195
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,028
It reached 500,000 dollars, right?

196
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:44,930
Right. I'll find him and bring him to you soon.

197
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
I'm sorry.

198
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,929
I will... Darn it!

199
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,700
- No, stop! - Oh, this punk is...

200
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:55,839
Seok Jun!

201
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:59,809
Yoon Gyeo Rye. It's Yoon Gyeo Rye.

202
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,059
Sir. Normally, this isn't allowed.

203
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,930
But your junior zoo keepers worked hard to make this happen.

204
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,599
Bonggu is well. He's doing very well.

205
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:21,829
Don't worry.

206
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,400
Thank you.

207
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,400
I'm glad to hear that.

208
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:31,009
How long did you work here?

209
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
I think...

210
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:36,950
I worked here for about 30 years.

211
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:39,319
Bonggu's mother...

212
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,490
I watched her being born and took care of her too.

213
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,359
It really isn't easy to stay in one job for so long.

214
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,390
I have...

215
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,730
big respect for you.

216
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,170
You wanted to say goodbye to Bonggu in person?

217
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:03,569
Yes, because he's my only family.

218
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:09,880
Oh, there he is.

219
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:12,920
Sir, Bonggu is here.

220
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,259
Bonggu.

221
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,829
Bonggu.

222
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,740
Bonggu.

223
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,660
Bonggu.

224
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,390
Don't hang out by yourself.

225
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,230
Why don't you step closer...

226
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:05,400
to your friends first?

227
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,180
Daddy's leaving first.

228
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,150
Goodbye.

229
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,890
My Bonggu.

230
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:51,819
(Kimbo Fodder CEO)

231
00:21:55,589 --> 00:22:00,119
Bonggu, you met a great dad too.

232
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,499
You were hungry, weren't you?

233
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,529
Not really.

234
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,700
Being hungry is one thing.

235
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,509
But food has been delicious these days. Am I gaining weight?

236
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,649
Really? Then while you're gaining weight,

237
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,480
grow some muscles too.

238
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,450
Nurse Seo. You like healthy guys, right?

239
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,190
- Healthy guys? - Yes.

240
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,459
Muscular guys with veins popping out...

241
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,930
of their forearms who grow beards too.

242
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,759
I laughed out too much.

243
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,959
I need to use the toilet.

244
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,869
- All of a sudden? - I need to poop.

245
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,999
I see.

246
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,539
She really loves healthy guys, doesn't she?

247
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:51,640
Hey, my daughter.

248
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:55,180
Oh. Nurse Seo...

249
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:58,079
- decided to become my daughter. - Right.

250
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,079
Doesn't she look like a cute girl?

251
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:03,349
Girl? Which part?

252
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,759
- Everything. - Gosh, you're a lost cause.

253
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,159
Goodness gracious.

254
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,359
By the way,

255
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:14,099
I wasn't in my right mind after Sonny passed away and forgot.

256
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,670
Did you ask Nurse Seo?

257
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,069
About what?

258
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:20,038
The room at the end on the fourth floor.

259
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,910
It totally slipped my mind.

260
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,409
I'll ask her tomorrow.

261
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,640
Okay. I bet it's nothing.

262
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,579
Hey, Nurse Seo.

263
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,990
Yes?

264
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,650
You know, the room I used on the fourth floor?

265
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:40,690
The door password has changed.

266
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,599
Why do you ask?

267
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,858
After you got discharged,

268
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,969
it was used as a warehouse for our medical devices.

269
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,500
But we're preparing to change it back to a hospital room now.

270
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,069
Really? But...

271
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:59,680
Gyeo Rye told me it was already being used by someone.

272
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,849
And it seemed like the elders were coming in and out of there too.

273
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,220
Oh, right.

274
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,890
Actually,

275
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,460
- in that room... - Yes?

276
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:21,630
lives a ghost who cries all the time.

277
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,470
Gosh. Ghost, my foot.

278
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,670
Do you really want to know?

279
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,309
Should I tell you...

280
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,450
who's staying in that room?

281
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,319
No. It was Gyeo Rye who was curious.

282
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:51,859
You seem a lot closer to him now.

283
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,069
Oh, really?

284
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,769
I'm getting jealous. I'm your only daughter, aren't I?

285
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,170
Gosh. I like you more.

286
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:04,670
Right?

287
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,759
So let's stop wondering what's in there.

288
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,929
- What do you mean? - The room on the fourth floor.

289
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,598
It didn't seem like she wanted to talk about it.

290
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,999
So let's not make things awkward for each other.

291
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,900
How is that awkward?

292
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,700
I clearly saw a man inside that room.

293
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,068
Isn't this stranger?

294
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:36,869
Gosh, you're a bunch of weirdos.

295
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,409
Oh, Mr. Kang. Come to the cafeteria later.

296
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:44,480
I'll cook up the best cabbage soup.

297
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:49,319
Hey, did you move on to a cook from an artist?

298
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,789
Well, it became one of my hobbies.

299
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,328
Are you going to settle down here?

300
00:25:55,329 --> 00:25:57,258
Just until I earn my deposit.

301
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,459
Aren't you rich?

302
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,559
But that's not my money.

303
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,429
You must come later, okay?

304
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,940
My cabbage soup is going to be the bomb.

305
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,569
The sun hasn't gone down yet.

306
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:42,309
So is this daytime drinking...

307
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,240
or night time drinking?

308
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:47,309
It's such a vague hour. Don't you agree?

309
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:51,410
Gosh, you're gorgeous.

310
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,048
I work in that kind of industry,

311
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:56,220
so I've seen lots of pretty ladies.

312
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,049
But you're a real beauty.

313
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,358
So what if anyone...

314
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,359
gets a makeover through plastic surgery?

315
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:06,259
They're still ugly.

316
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:12,799
But you, on the other hand, are overwhelmingly pretty.

317
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,539
- Hey. - Yes?

318
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:18,380
Do you find me pretty even with these?

319
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,720
Hello? Yes, Mom.

320
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:29,890
I'm going home now. Yes, okay.

321
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,400
You won't die from drinking that much.

322
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:48,240
I might.

323
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:51,369
I could die from binge drinking,

324
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,579
getting run over by a car while jaywalking,

325
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:59,380
or losing my footing and falling from a rooftop.

326
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,950
Strange.

327
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,720
You've been drinking buckets these past few days.

328
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:07,489
Mind your own business.

329
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,490
You met Yoon Gyeo Rye, didn't you?

330
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,329
No.

331
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,970
What did you see?

332
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:21,140
What was it for you...

333
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:23,369
to drink like this every day?

334
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:29,049
Did he get himself a girlfriend?

335
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,549
Was he doing her things...

336
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,549
that he didn't do for you?

337
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,589
Did he smile in front of her?

338
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,559
You scumbag.

339
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,758
- Are you trying to flip me out? - I'm here to tell you.

340
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:45,759
Tell me what?

341
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,329
I found him.

342
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:50,369
Yoon Gyeo Rye.

343
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,170
What's his name?

344
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:56,639
His name is Doldol.

345
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,309
It's only a matter of time before we meet again.

346
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,880
So go ahead and warn him to run away.

347
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:06,380
What?

348
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,619
Are you scared...

349
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:13,390
he might not run away with you?

350
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,690
Then why were you never pretty to Gyeo Rye?

351
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,630
Shut your mouth.

352
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,299
Shut it.

353
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,900
Shut it!

354
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:27,839
Shut your darn mouth!

355
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,670
Shut it.

356
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,980
Shut it, you hear me?

357
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,049
Shut it.

358
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:42,549
Ha Jun Kyung, what the heck is this?

359
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,420
What is this? Do you actually want to die?

360
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:50,858
No, right? You don't want to die, do you?

361
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:53,359
Doesn't failing all the time mean you want to live?

362
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,500
Gyeo Rye.

363
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,410
Let's leave this world together.

364
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,839
What's the use of living longer?

365
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,980
We will forever be used and live in pain.

366
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,180
I heard death is peaceful. We'll be at peace.

367
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,220
Stop it.

368
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,519
Seriously, stop.

369
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:20,788
I'm sick and tired of this.

370
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:22,789
Remember what you told me?

371
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,559
"Whether we live or die, we'll do it together."

372
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:28,059
Aren't we family, Gyeo Rye?

373
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,700
We are, right?

374
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:32,299
Let's die together.

375
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,740
If I die,

376
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,549
will you be happy?

377
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:15,909
- Hello. - Hi.

378
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,479
- How are you today? - Great.

379
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,079
You're always great.

380
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,049
Are you busy?

381
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:25,858
Of course. I've got tons of work to do.

382
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:28,018
I need to change Mr. Jang's clothes too.

383
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,828
His wife went out today.

384
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:31,859
I wonder why Ms. Oh went out. It's unusual.

385
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Beats me.

386
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:35,369
By the way, are you okay?

387
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,700
With what?

388
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,740
Mr. Jang had said some harsh things to you.

389
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Oh, that?

390
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,109
I forgot about them all. I mean, did he?

391
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:49,549
This and that can happen in life, after all.

392
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,380
- I'm off. - Okay.

393
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:55,348
And Seo Yeon Joo. Good luck today.

394
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:56,349
Right, thanks.

395
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:03,089
He doesn't remember at all.

396
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,460
He forgot that he confessed to me.

397
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,730
Was that just gibberish?

398
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,608
My wife also wanted me...

399
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:22,049
to hang out with my friends...

400
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,410
and have fun outside...

401
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:27,619
when I didn't do anything...

402
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,049
but nursing her.

403
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:34,819
She told me it was more painful to see me...

404
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,059
stuck by her side.

405
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,430
So you lost your wife.

406
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,230
It was three years ago.

407
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,680
Oh, but it's nice to spend time outside like this.

408
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,950
You're right.

409
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:00,779
I can't remember the last time I was outside of the hospital.

410
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:05,119
It sure is nice to be here.

411
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,920
Now then, please dig into the cakes.

412
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,559
Gosh. They're too pretty to eat.

413
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,200
So? Did she meet up with him?

414
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,869
Yes. They seem to be enjoying their time.

415
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:24,338
Stop scanning through, and take a closer look.

416
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:26,740
Is she having fun?

417
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,180
Is she fancying him?

418
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,578
Please dig in.

419
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:32,618
Yes, she's having fun. You're asking all sorts of questions.

420
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:35,818
This is my first wish request. I should be there right now.

421
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:37,548
I really want to do a good job.

422
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,289
Okay, don't worry.

423
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,759
I'll keep my eyes on them. I'm hanging up.

424
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:44,390
Look at them closely. And don't do anything...

425
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:29,639
(RIP Choi Jung Hee, RIP Kang Jun Il)

426
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,409
Jun Il.

427
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,079
Honey. I'm here.

428
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,619
It's been a while, right?

429
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,420
I suddenly...

430
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:50,460
missed you two.

431
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,800
Here, gifts.

432
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,828
Did you meet that jerk again?

433
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:58,730
Stop nagging.

434
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,409
If you're not going to, just give all of those back to me.

435
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:07,409
That person isn't good.

436
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,909
No. That person...

437
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:13,578
will definitely destroy you, let alone extort money from you.

438
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:16,448
It will mess you up, though you already are.

439
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:19,590
But that person is seriously smart.

440
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,920
They know how to do business well...

441
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:25,029
and have a lot of connections.

442
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,969
You won't have to work anymore. Nice, right?

443
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:32,769
And aren't you sick and tired of the smell of pork?

444
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,070
But I have a bad feeling about them.

445
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:37,908
Since you met that person,

446
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:39,939
you started to drink every day which you never have,

447
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,650
and visit hostess bars like it's your house.

448
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,219
You weren't this kind of person.

449
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,988
You were a proper human being.

450
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:52,488
They said this is what business is like.

451
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:56,190
And what would you know? You're just a housewife.

452
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,539
For goodness' sake.

453
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,499
In other households,

454
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,210
when the husband gives such nice gifts to his wife,

455
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,639
she would be...

456
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:21,920
Come here, Son.

457
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,949
Come on.

458
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,090
I'm...

459
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,360
having a really hard time these days.

460
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,500
I really am.

461
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:41,539
Sorry.

462
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,340
I'm sorry.

463
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:49,980
I'm sorry.

464
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,058
Why aren't you cleaning?

465
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,559
Hurry up.

466
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,670
Honey.

467
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,179
Have you gone senile?

468
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,150
How embarrassing.

469
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:29,420
Gosh.

470
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,149
You should say that...

471
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,989
to your wife at home.

472
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,760
Goodness. What has gotten into you?

473
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,980
It's really strange.

474
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,949
How did she only lose memories of you?

475
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:05,050
The same goes for how she thinks she still works here.

476
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:08,519
But she spends her everyday life without trouble, right?

477
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,630
She still remembers the bus number and her home.

478
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,929
Well, that's good as it is.

479
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,840
At least Ms. Choi looks happy when she works.

480
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,139
You're right.

481
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:31,150
I heard your back was giving you problems again.

482
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,419
You don't have to go that far.

483
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,820
Mr. Kang will still make her last wish come true.

484
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:38,989
The Netherlands?

485
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,289
Correct. The Dementia Village in the Netherlands.

486
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,059
She can live her life...

487
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,659
without being locked up.

488
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,300
She can work,

489
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,369
go grocery shopping, and go to the hair salon.

490
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,570
Stuffy places like hospitals will kill her quickly.

491
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,840
Especially with her personality.

492
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,750
It's been so long since you last talked so much.

493
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:12,420
But why don't you talk like that normally?

494
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,989
In fear that she might recognize me.

495
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,329
Don't you tell her who you are at home?

496
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:21,230
That's not to scare her when I'm at home.

497
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,139
You know, I like it now, too.

498
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,969
I think she has feelings for me.

499
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,909
Oh, a fling?

500
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:38,349
Yes, a fling.

501
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:42,320
I'm rooting for you until the day you go to the Netherlands.

502
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:46,519
I love you, Choi Duk Ja!

503
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:02,730
Are you waiting for someone here?

504
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:03,929
No.

505
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:08,570
Do you want to have a look?

506
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,509
What do you think?

507
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:15,610
Ms. Oh looks a lot brighter, right?

508
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,280
Nice, right?

509
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:18,980
Yes.

510
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,920
I can't make her smile, after all.

511
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:25,860
Right.

512
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,389
Since we're on the topic,

513
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,730
why don't we have Ms. Oh...

514
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:38,129
marry this guy...

515
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:41,199
while you're still alive?

516
00:41:42,809 --> 00:41:44,210
Then...

517
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:47,539
you'll probably feel at peace when you pass away.

518
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:48,679
Aren't I right?

519
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,510
That's a good idea.

520
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,119
Right?

521
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,819
He owns a building,

522
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:02,190
and he was very nice to his wife when she was alive.

523
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,530
Stop it.

524
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,059
If Ms. Oh marries him,

525
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:10,530
you'll be able to leave...

526
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:13,738
worry free.

527
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,599
Stop it! Stop!

528
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:18,968
Why did you lie?

529
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,879
To kill you, so your wife will be happy.

530
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,880
Why did you wish for something you didn't even want?

531
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,249
You know that's not what's best for Ms. Oh.

532
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,649
Why? You can't even do it on your own.

533
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:33,889
Why did you ask such a thing to that young boy and hurt him?

534
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,119
(My dear daughter Nurse Seo)

535
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:42,959
Nurse Seo.

536
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,159
Mr. Kang. It's me. Can you get me some scallions from the garden?

537
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,729
I'm making ramyeon, but there's no scallion.

538
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,569
I'll keep cooking. Come before it gets soggy.

539
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:53,239
- Hurry up. I'm waiting. - Hey...

540
00:43:56,909 --> 00:43:58,210
That punk.

541
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:03,449
He's such a pain in the neck.

542
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,849
I brought scallion...

543
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,760
Why are the lights off?

544
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:20,960
Happy birthday to you

545
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,269
Happy birthday to you

546
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,269
Dear Mr. Kang

547
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:34,139
Happy birthday to you

548
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:41,348
Make a wish.

549
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:42,619
Right.

550
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,558
- Okay. - Blow the candles.

551
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:51,929
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

552
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,839
I only made the cake.

553
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,769
Gyeo Rye made the rest.

554
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,440
Yes.

555
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:08,738
He told me to prepare a gift that costs under five dollars.

556
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,110
It was so hard to pick one.

557
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:13,579
- Here's a gift. - Here.

558
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:15,779
- Here's one from me. - Me too.

559
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,788
The prices have gone up so high.

560
00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:19,218
I couldn't buy anything under five dollars.

561
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:21,289
- I totally agree. - I got the call late.

562
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:26,129
I'm not sure if I deserve gifts from you.

563
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,299
- Of course you do. - Why worry about that?

564
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,899
Just accept it.

565
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,730
You deserve it more than enough.

566
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:36,139
Enjoy the food I prepared.

567
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:37,808
Especially...

568
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:40,739
Ms. Yeom who works hard for guardians.

569
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,110
Eat as much as you want.

570
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:44,280
Thank you.

571
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:47,018
I couldn't be happier.

572
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:49,519
You must be so happy.

573
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:52,718
- Thank you. - Thank you.

574
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:54,558
- It looks good. - Enjoy the food.

575
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,129
It's good.

576
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,159
It's really good.

577
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,429
- Gyeo Rye. - Do you like it?

578
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,598
- You are talented. - Is it good?

579
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:05,869
It's better than Ms. Yeom's food.

580
00:46:08,539 --> 00:46:11,139
Happy birthday to you

581
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:13,840
Happy birthday to you

582
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,849
Dear Dad

583
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,979
Happy birthday to you

584
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,849
Happy birthday, Dad.

585
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:23,789
Thank you.

586
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,219
Why are you crying on a happy day?

587
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,860
I don't know.

588
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,360
Perhaps because I'm so happy.

589
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,179
- It was really hard to make. - You had to cut it one by one.

590
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,690
Why are you out?

591
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:14,300
Ms. Yeom.

592
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,110
Why didn't I know...

593
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,349
that it was good enough?

594
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:25,949
Why do I always...

595
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:30,219
realize after losing it?

596
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:36,760
Back then,

597
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,960
I thought I did it for my family,

598
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:49,639
but I was wrong.

599
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:54,408
I wanted to look successful...

600
00:47:54,409 --> 00:47:57,849
in front of others.

601
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,090
I didn't know what mattered the most.

602
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,219
I...

603
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:12,789
I regret that the most.

604
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,369
It's not just you.

605
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:25,639
Everyone realizes it after it's passed.

606
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:31,380
When you're young,

607
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,980
you don't see it.

608
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,889
But there are still nice things...

609
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,360
about ageing.

610
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:00,808
(Cafeteria)

611
00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:03,849
You're as clean as Ms. Choi.

612
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:07,880
I don't like leaving traces.

613
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,150
I have to erase everything.

614
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,550
You're actually good at everything.

615
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:14,959
You're good at drawing, cleaning,

616
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,629
and smashing an expensive imported car.

617
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:19,090
You're good at smashing expensive cars too.

618
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:22,929
If I have to, I have no choice.

619
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:27,869
I shouldn't have done that to someone...

620
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,869
by using Sonny as an excuse.

621
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:35,679
I'm sorry.

622
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:41,119
I should've known better. It's embarrassing.

623
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:47,460
So what if you didn't know any better?

624
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,960
You have no reason to win my favour.

625
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,960
I told you. I like you.

626
00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:08,440
Why don't we...

627
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,510
go on a date?

628
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,250
Are you asking me?

629
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:17,050
No, I'm talking to the pot.

630
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:20,219
I see. You're talking to the pot.

631
00:50:20,889 --> 00:50:23,489
- I thought you were talking to me. - Oh, come on!

632
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:27,860
What's wrong with you?

633
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:31,368
I plucked up my courage because we're alone here.

634
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:32,629
Let's go on a date.

635
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,738
I want to go on a date with you. Let's go on a date.

636
00:50:35,739 --> 00:50:37,639
I thought...

637
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:40,238
you were talking gibberish...

638
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:42,309
due to medicine.

639
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,480
I got rejected.

640
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,920
Wait.

641
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:55,590
Can I decide where to go?

642
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:58,829
Yes.

643
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:14,638
Good job.

644
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:17,808
Straighten your elbows and be strong and precise.

645
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:19,710
Don't push too deep.

646
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:23,888
- Okay. - He's alive.

647
00:51:23,889 --> 00:51:25,949
He's dead. Don't stop. Keep going.

648
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,420
Okay.

649
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:32,230
You said we were going on a date.

650
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,599
You said I can decide where to go.

651
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:37,130
This isn't a date.

652
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:40,699
If I was going to do this, I wouldn't have worn this.

653
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,469
Oh, gosh.

654
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,739
This isn't what Sonny wanted.

655
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:49,079
Sonny?

656
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,210
Sonny.

657
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,550
Here.

658
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:56,819
This isn't what I wore this for.

659
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,419
It's supposed to be a date.

660
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,960
What you're wearing doesn't matter. What matters is your heart.

661
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,090
Be careful not to rip your pants.

662
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,170
How did she lift this?

663
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:16,769
Wait up.

664
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:25,750
This is nice when I think about Sonny.

665
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,379
But don't you think you're being too mean...

666
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,920
to someone who wants to go on a date?

667
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:32,988
I'm always doing volunteer work,

668
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:35,959
and I'm volunteering here again.

669
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,329
Okay, I get it. Then...

670
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,230
let's go on a date.

671
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:42,730
A date?

672
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:45,929
A real date?

673
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,339
What is this? This isn't a date.

674
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,238
I volunteered all this morning.

675
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:57,409
Why did you make me wear this?

676
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,518
You said you wanted to go on a date instead of volunteering.

677
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:02,178
This is a very fun and healthy date.

678
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,320
How is this a date?

679
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:05,948
Let's do something else.

680
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:08,519
Ten flicks if you're late.

681
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:12,789
- Can we go watch a movie? - A movie?

682
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:16,099
I can never stay in the theatre. It's stuffy.

683
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:19,368
How about a café?

684
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:20,369
Café?

685
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:22,268
There are boxes of coffee in our lounge.

686
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:23,638
Why waste money?

687
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:25,309
Still, how can you climb a wall?

688
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,638
I carried the kibble bags all this morning...

689
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:29,979
and kept cleaning.

690
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,049
This is very healthy...

691
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:34,349
Watch out.

692
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,750
See that? Stop acting up.

693
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:39,190
You'll end up hurting yourself.

694
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:41,190
Okay.

695
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:45,559
- Look. - Yes?

696
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:51,969
What?

697
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,078
- Gosh. - Nine more to go.

698
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,909
Seriously.

699
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:05,908
Do you really want me to go up?

700
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,348
Hurry up already.

701
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:08,949
I want to get flicked.

702
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,219
How do I put this on? Is this right?

703
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:29,369
Are you pedalling?

704
00:54:29,539 --> 00:54:30,869
Yes.

705
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:33,578
Why isn't this moving? Why is it so slow?

706
00:54:33,579 --> 00:54:34,809
Gosh.

707
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,578
I'm so tired.

708
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:38,679
My goodness.

709
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,279
I give up.

710
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,750
No more date!

711
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,349
Oh, brake.

712
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:48,460
(We're closing early today. Sorry for the inconvenience.)

713
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,760
Sorry.

714
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,460
I told you we should just get coffee...

715
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:58,569
in the nearby café.

716
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:02,070
They're closing early just for today.

717
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,709
Sorry.

718
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:05,808
Next time, let's meet early...

719
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:07,339
and do what you want.

720
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,408
When? When's that going to be?

721
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:11,809
Anytime. We have all the time in the world.

722
00:55:17,789 --> 00:55:21,820
How can they turn the lights off when we're still here?

723
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:29,429
It's strange.

724
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,869
What is?

725
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,969
How did we...

726
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,440
get to walk together?

727
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:50,989
You seduced me.

728
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,320
Don't be ridiculous. You seduced me first.

729
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:57,030
When did I? Me?

730
00:55:57,329 --> 00:56:00,259
You kissed me during the musical.

731
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:03,329
Someone pushed me.

732
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:05,569
I told you so many times already.

733
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,239
Just joking. I seduced you first.

734
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:09,968
That's why I asked you out first.

735
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:10,969
Whatever.

736
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,380
I like you.

737
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,909
I...

738
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:22,679
like you more now.

739
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:02,760
Did someone...

740
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:05,329
push you again?

741
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,429
I did it because I wanted to.

742
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:13,699
Then this is what you should've done.

743
00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:10,789
Did someone...

744
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,360
push you?

745
00:58:17,969 --> 00:58:19,670
You pulled me.

746
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,300
Oh, I did?

747
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,309
Did I do that?

748
00:58:43,789 --> 00:58:45,689
- You were pretty good. - Stop it.

749
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,299
- What? - Seriously.

750
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,759
What's so funny?

751
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,230
Ms. Yeom. Nurse Seo keeps...

752
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:55,300
Your girlfriend is here.

753
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,510
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

754
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:02,239
Hi, Gyeo Rye.

755
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,380
Hey.

756
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:14,690
How did you find me here?

757
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,000
You didn't answer your phone.

758
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:24,599
So I found you first.

759
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,869
You know it too.

760
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,670
You look the best when with me.

761
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:40,719
Jun Kyung.

762
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:43,178
Let me go.

763
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:45,789
If you leave, I'm going to kill myself.

764
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:48,690
I'm going to jump off of a building!

765
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:51,630
Don't.

766
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,159
Don't do this. This isn't how you should live.

767
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,030
Stop saying you're going to die!

768
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:06,670
I'm...

769
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:11,809
not happy.

770
01:00:15,219 --> 01:00:16,249
What?

771
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:18,420
I'm not happy when I'm with you.

772
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:21,089
Let me be happy!

773
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:23,089
I think I'm going to die.

774
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:26,159
My life is already doomed. I at least deserve this much!

775
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:29,460
Jun Kyung.

776
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:31,829
For the last time,

777
01:00:32,969 --> 01:00:35,070
I'm begging you.

778
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,170
Please let me go.

779
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,190
Find a way to be happy next to me.

780
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:54,820
There's no other way.

781
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,059
That's what families do.

782
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:59,159
If you really are my family,

783
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,529
you must endure pain and torture...

784
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:04,130
again and again.

785
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,070
That's what everyone does.

786
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:09,800
Being a family isn't always nice.

787
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:14,610
Don't forget.

788
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:17,079
If you're ever happy somewhere by yourself,

789
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:20,420
I'm going to kill us both.

790
01:01:58,989 --> 01:02:01,659
(If You Wish Upon Me)

791
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,860
Can you just ignore me and be on your way?

792
01:02:04,389 --> 01:02:07,030
That night, why did you avoid him?

793
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,960
Am I crazy for loving you?

794
01:02:10,699 --> 01:02:12,070
Just don't be sick.

795
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:14,840
Will you be okay?

796
01:02:15,739 --> 01:02:17,209
You said you're Gyeo Rye's girlfriend,

797
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:18,670
but you don't like curry?

798
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,880
Is it possible?

799
01:02:21,579 --> 01:02:24,250
You're the only person who disappoints me.

800
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,650
It seemed Gyeo Rye was waiting for you.

801
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:30,420
Let's end it.
