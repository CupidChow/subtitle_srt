Excuse me. Do you need help?

11
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,390

Gosh.

15
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,730
Watch your mouth. Can't you see the no smoking sign?

16
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,738
In fact, you can't smoke in the hospital.

17
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,310
Why do you care?

18
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,040
So annoying.

20

22
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:24,978
- Only two. - My goodness. Poor thing.

23
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,219
Excuse me.

24
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,050
Do you have a minute?

25
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:31,889
Well...

26
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,030
She jumped off from a building.

27
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,669
Really?

28
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,639
I think she tried to commit suicide.

29
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,669
Her boyfriend visits her often.

30
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,138
She asked him to kill her.

31
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:51,479
She should just die on her own.

32
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,710
How can she say that to her boyfriend? That'll break his heart.

33
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:57,580
But it's not just her.

34
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,889
She wanted him to kill someone else too.

35
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,848
She's still so young.

36
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,219

Well...

40
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,719
I have a place to visit.

41
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,060
Wait.

42
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:48,330
Are you...

43
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,400
hiding anything from me?

44
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,740
All of a sudden?

45
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,340
No, I thought...

46
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:57,810
you've been acting strange.

47
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,650
No.

48
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,219
There's nothing.

49
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,349
See you.

50
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,330
You have nice writing.

Join us.

54
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,170
Right. Help your assistants. Where are you going?

55
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,839
I need to visit home.

56
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,409
- Home? - I thought this was your home.

57
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,350
Right. This is your home, Captain.

58
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,519
It won't take long. See you later.

59

Hey, do a good job. Have fun.

60
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,730

What brings you here?

67
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,120
I had a few questions.

68
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,060
Why was I so mean to you?

69
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,430
Well...

70
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:06,360
That wasn't what I wanted to know.

71
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:10,600
But now that I heard it, I do want to know. Why?

72
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,139
Every child who visits...

73
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,709
asked the same question.

74
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,980
You know what I say?

75
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,050
I only treated you fairly.

76
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,689
That's my answer.

77
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,199
Since you all have the same memory,

78
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,970
I did treat you fairly.

79
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,839
When I say I'm a director of an orphanage,

80
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,439
people expected altruism like a religious person.

81
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,180
But I'm not interested in that.

82
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:56,448
When children come in, I get aids.

83
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:59,278
I feed them, give them a blanket, and that's it.

84
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,649

85
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:07,930
By the way,

86
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,959
has my father ever visited me?

87

No.

88
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,370
How can you answer without hesitation?

89
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,639
You didn't even take a second to think about it.

90
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,480
Parents or relatives...

91
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:29,579
or even neighbors or teachers.

92
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,879

93
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,419
Not a single visitor.

How come?

95
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,490
Because I ran away on my own and no one knew I was here?

96
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,289
Why do you think other children had visitors?

97
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,629
It was all because of their parents.

98
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,330
If your parents were nice, you would have visitors.

99
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,039
If your parents were trash, you have no visitors.

100
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:59,110
If your parents don't visit you,

101
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,750
it means you were abandoned before you ran away.

That's your name.

177
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:51,820
You're...

178
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,529

(Yoon Ki Chun)

180
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,039
Were you trying to fool yourself?

181
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,970
(Room 403)

182
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,580
First date with my son Gyeo Rye.

183
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,039
Or...

184
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,639
is this all a lie too?

185
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,980
Gyeo Rye.

186
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,609
Don't touch me.

187
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,179
Don't you dare touch me.

188
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:51,620
- Don't touch me. - No.

189
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,980
I didn't know.

190
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,350
At first, I was still stunned.

191
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:01,659
I wasn't sure if I was dead...

192
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:03,590
or still alive.

193
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,230
I didn't know who I was.

194
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,769
Then my memories started to come back.

195
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,369
When did you find out...

196
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:18,039
that you are my son?

197
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,880
Well...

198
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:25,079
I'm not sure. Maybe...

199
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,549
I knew it all along.

200
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,390
When you begged me for mercy,

201
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:35,890
something felt weird. It was crazy.

202
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:39,930
Is this...

203
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,269
what you call an instinct?

204
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,970
How useless.

205

(Will)

210
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:40,660
If I die before spending all my money,

211
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:43,160
I will donate the money...

212
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,630
in Team Genie's car trunk to Team Genie.

213
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:52,769
I should be the one who means the most to you.

214
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,809
Not the people in this hospital.

215
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,450
You can do it...

216
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,089
by yourself.

217
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,200
Also, my life was lame.

218
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:21,029
Your life was lame...

219
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:25,369
because you ran away from me.

220
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:29,940
I might as well stop the show and have some fun...

221
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,910
with my son.

222
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,789
I thought we were going to die.

223
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,190
The hospital was in complete chaos without you.

224
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,890
The hospital couldn't run.

225
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,900
It's true.

226
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,700
Stop flattering.

227
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,569
I'm not.

228
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,740
Where's Nurse Seo?

229
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,509
She was too busy to eat, so...

230
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,879
Because she's spending her time...

231
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,380
on patients' wishes.

232
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,380
I can't believe her.

233
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,589
You know it's all for the better.

234
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,630
Get a grip before she influences you.

235

I don't know if I'm dead...

who should we have to live with?

272
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,700
Can you leave after telling us that?

Don't cry, Jae Yeon.

274

Just tell us that.

We'll do as you say, Grandma.

I'm a small Genie.

I grant wishes too.

284

- Grandma. - It's okay.

00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,380
Didn't I tell you to catch Yoon Gyeo Rye?

296
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,220
You're way past the deadline.

297
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,759
Did you just grab the golf club?

298
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,240
What the heck?

299
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,369
You knew, and yet you didn't catch him?

300
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:26,079
You really knew? But didn't catch him?

301
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,209
You knew!

302
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,819
You knew all along!

303
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:37,420
It's exactly 632,860 dollars.

304
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:41,319
He can use 60 dollars as taxi fare, but nothing more than that.

305
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,329
- If he doesn't have the money... - Can't I...

306
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,359
kill him?

307
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,970
What?

308
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,309
I'm going to kill him.

309
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,349
Fine. That's up to you.

310
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:06,019
But I doubt he has 600,000 dollars.

311
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:09,249
Collect the principal...

312
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,589
before you kill him or whatever.

313
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,359
Don't cause trouble for me.

314
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,529
And call me first if you're going to kill him for sure.

315
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:18,799
I have to get the organ harvesters ready.

If...

317
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:22,869
I can't collect the principal,

318
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:25,769
consider that as payment...

319
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,640
for Yoon Gyeo Rye, Ha Jun Kyung,

320

and my hard work until now.

What do you think he meant?

322
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:53,558
Was he insulting me,

323
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,069
persuading me, or threatening me?

324
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,029
I'm confused.

325
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,569
I think he insulted you.

00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,589
You're making it awkward.

330
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,400
I did some research on the internet...

331
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,569
and found something called a guardian system.

332
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:14,440
Should I apply for that?

333
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,839
I bet the legal process is tricky.

334

Hey.

337
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,660
Did you eat? Are you hungry?

338
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,329
How about some anchovy?

339
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,160
You two really look like father and son.

You got yourself another son, Yoon Gyeo Rye.

342
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:44,798
How jealous.

343
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,170
Come here. Let me pinch those cheeks.

00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,910
Goodness. The son is good-looking, just like his mom.

346
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,240
What a good-looking mom.

347
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,750
I'm quite good-looking, aren't I?

348
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:01,250
We will now dress the deceased.

349
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,089
Family members, come to the first-floor basement.

350
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,519
And bring the money for the deceased to use on her way to paradise.

351
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,980
Gosh, you scared me.

352
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
Hi.

353
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,450
Who are you?

354
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,829
Don't you...

355
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:46,460
remember me?

356
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,670
I came here a few times.

357
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,550
What brings you here?

358
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:14,090
You see, my son is here.

359
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,329
And I had that punk do something for me.

360
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,019
Darn it.

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,869
Hey. What about dinner?

363
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:01,639
Yes. There weren't many condolers.

364
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:05,070
Well, it wasn't bad.

365
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,679
See you soon.

366
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,479
- What is it? - You scumbag.

367
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,679
Tell me what you did wrong.

368
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,719
Why are you doing this to me?

369
00:35:17,789 --> 00:35:20,388
What's this? Tell me.

370
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:21,860
I just found it.

371
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,558
- Do you know what money this is? - No.

372
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,960
This is money the kids...

373
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,759
collected for their grandma to enjoy good food in paradise.

374
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,829
How dare you steal this?

375
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,800
- You piece of trash. - Please don't hit me.

376
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:39,279
Please don't hit me. I'm sorry. I really am.

377
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,139
- For goodness' sake. - I'm sorry.

378
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,800
I'm different.

379
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,599
I'm...

380
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,940
different from you.

381
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,840
I'm different.

382
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,769
Hey, Mister.

383
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:48,269
Are you okay?

384
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,320
Excuse me! Over here!

385
00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:54,368
If anything happens to the kids...

386
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:55,869
or you move houses,

387
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:57,809
please call the hospital.

388
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,238
Okay.

389
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,340
Oh, And...

390
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:03,709
please take good care of the kids.

391
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,578
The people at the hospital worry and care for them a lot.

392
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:08,049
Alright, okay? Enough...

393
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,420
Will you listen when someone's talking?

394
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,959
I will watch how you treat the kids...

395
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,230
until my last breath, got it?

396
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,389
Say goodbye and get on the bus.

(Funeral Home)

398
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,070
Gyeo Rye, can't we just live at the hospital?

399
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,639
She's right. I want to live here.

400
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,239
For now,

401
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,840
you have to live...

402
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,779
with your aunt and that guy.

403
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,420
That's how the law works or something like that. Anyway.

404

00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,820
or you get sick, look here.

406
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,988
- This is Nurse Seo's number. - Okay.

407
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:50,259
And this is the captain's number. The one you couldn't meet.

408
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,828
Remember Ms. Yeom? This one's hers.

409
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:54,129
The last one is the sister's number.

410
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,500
Call right away, okay?

411
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,328
And do you recall what I told you to do...

412
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,269
when you're in pain instead of holding it in?

413
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:01,670
Tell others.

414
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,768
That's it. You have to tell others.

415
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,510
That way, the adults can help you.

416
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,940
- Okay. - Okay.

417
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,510
Get on already.

418
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:12,149
Call us the moment anything happens.

419
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,150
- Okay. - Good.

You must be tired too, Mr. Gu.

00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,489

Grandma!

430
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,840
Did you eat?

431
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,980
Oh, my gosh. You're so thin.

432
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,078
Let's get some fresh air.

433
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:18,550
Love is blooming everywhere.

434
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:22,049
What do you mean blooming? You know nothing.

435
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,789
Weren't you the one who teased me first?

436
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:26,989
You look pretty.

437
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,888
Either ask her out first...

438
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,959
or go on a blind date.

439
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,129
No. I want to let it happen naturally.

440
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,130
I see.

441
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:40,768
- Let it happen naturally? - That's right.

442
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:43,609
But for that to happen, you need to be good-looking.

443
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,840
My goodness.

444
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,839
You think you got a boyfriend because you're good-looking?

445
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,678
- Yes, that's right. - I don't think so.

446
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:53,249
- Whatever, I can't see you. - How about this?

447
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:56,150
- I can't hear you. - Whatever!

448
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,459
Hello?

449
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,059
Hi. It's me, Little Captain.

450
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,659
Is everything okay? Nothing happened, right?

451
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,269
Yes, everything's fine.

452
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,968
We parted ways just a few hours ago.

453
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:12,840
Well, that's right.

454
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:16,739
I got a phone. This is my number. Save it.

455
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,639
Actually, just memorize my number.

456
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,209

457
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,380
All right, bye.

00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,059
You must eat if you want to live.

460
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:08,090
Hey.

461
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:14,229
A while back, someone's personality completely changed...

462
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,130
after suffering a penetrating injury in the frontal lobe.

463
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:21,738
A penetrating injury happens...

464
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:23,768
when a foreign object pierces the skin and enters the body,

465
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:25,840
causing more than one blood vessel to rupture.

466
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:29,179
It's most commonly caused by gunshot wounds or stabbing.

467
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,619
I've never heard of a case where it was caused by blunt trauma.

468
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,960
In other words, people don't change that easily.

469
00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:27,699
Eat more.

470
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:30,539
You need energy to go through chemotherapy or even to die.

471
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,579
I feel like I'm chewing sand.

472
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:39,179
Do you know what it feels like?

473
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:42,119
Why should I know what it feels like?

474
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,190
Suit yourself. I don't care if you want to starve yourself.

475
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:53,030
Why are you being like this to me all of a sudden?

476
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,630
Do you know who I am?

477
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,269
At first, I didn't recognize you.

478
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,300
But then, I remembered.

479
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:05,739
Even so,

480
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:08,139
I'm still on Gyeo Rye's side.

481
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:11,480
I never asked you to take my side.

482
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,050
Then what? Do you want me to try...

483
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,519
to change his mind?

484
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,630
It's just that I have no where to go.

485
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:36,469
I'm just bored. That's all.

486
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,920
Hey, you're here.

487
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,719
Come on in. I'm leaving.

488
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,289
Oh, am I mistaken?

489
00:45:57,489 --> 00:45:59,090
What's she doing here?

490
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,070
Everyone can't help but be attracted to me.

I'm Kang Tae Sik, you know.

492
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,550
It's okay.

493
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,659
Oh, right. Did you meet the private detective?

494
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:31,159
What? Yes.

495
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,860
He said he didn't have to do any digging.

496
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,829
He found it so easily.

497
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:40,400
That private detective made this for you.

No. I want to say "Bye," not "Hi."

Gyeo Rye.

512
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:56,139
Yoon Gyeo Rye.

513
00:48:57,469 --> 00:48:59,809
Darn you... Do not call my name.

514
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,940
Don't you dare call my name.

515
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:07,219
Gosh. This is your last warning, okay?

516
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,630
He sure is...

517
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,269
my son.

518
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:37,150
Hey, nurse. Breathe.

519
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,609
If someone saw us now,

520
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,019
they'd think I was about to kill you or something.

521
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:07,309
You...

522
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:14,579
What's that man doing? Why is he walking around?

523
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:17,349
You said you'd tell me first if he woke up.

524
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,159
Right.

525
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:26,829
I'm sorry. I...

526
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:29,829
I wanted to get it sorted out...

527
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:34,369
on my own, but I'm having a hard time.

528
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:42,239
What is going on? That man...

529
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,550
He is your father?

530
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:55,360
Yes. I think so.

531
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:57,559
What?

532
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,659
I mean... Yes, he is. He is my father.

533
00:51:05,269 --> 00:51:06,400
Darn it.

534
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,639
Had I known he was the one in that room...

535
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:14,340
Gosh. I would've never gone into that room.

536
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:17,710
Hey.

537
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:21,980
Are you okay?

538
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,150
Why wouldn't I be okay?

539
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,420
Well, he and I...

540
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,929
have been estranged for over 20 years.

541
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,960
I never even saw him. We're practically strangers.

542
00:51:36,929 --> 00:51:38,130
I'm sorry. I...

543
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
I shouldn't have asked you to help me with that room.

544
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,110
No, don't be sorry. It's fine.

545
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,340
But that man...

546
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:53,110
Why wouldn't he leave? Why is he staying at the hospital?

547
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,619
He will leave.

548
00:51:59,889 --> 00:52:01,059
If he doesn't,

549
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:05,860
I will make him leave.

550
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,380
(Medicine Storage Room)

551
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,329
Hey, Cheol Woo. It's me.

552
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,099
We found our boss.

553
00:52:47,739 --> 00:52:50,239
He'll call you guys separately, so keep a watchful eye on them.

554
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:52,510
About Yoon Gyeo Rye and the money.

555
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:55,980
You'd better bring it to me this week.

556
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:17,699
Get out.

557
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:22,170
I told you to get out!

558
00:53:24,469 --> 00:53:26,110
- What's going on? - What happened?

559
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,510
- Who is he? - What's with him?

560
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:29,079
- Darn it. - What's his problem?

561
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:31,409
Are you deaf?

562
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,210
I said, get out!

563
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:34,618
Let's go.

564
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:37,719
Get out, all of you. Go wherever you want!

565
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:20,300
Drink this.

566
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,400
Mom.

567
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,530
Mom.

568
00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:00,170
Mom, please wake up.

569
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:03,610
Mom...

570
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:05,369
Mom!

571
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:08,840
Mom!

572
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,380
Mom!

573
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:14,150
Mom...

574
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,849
Mom!

575
00:55:58,190 --> 00:55:59,530
Why did he do this?

576
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,130
I think...

577
00:56:05,769 --> 00:56:08,300
What? Do you know something?

578
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,440
Seok Jun wasn't much different...

579
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,840
from Yoon Gyeo Rye or Ha Jun Kyung.

580
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,750
Although he tried hard to act like he was different.

581
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,920
You noticed that too?

582
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:30,090
I thought I was the only one who thought that.

583
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:33,800
Those weak idiots.

584
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:37,099
This world isn't an easy place.

585
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:59,949
(Always with love, care, and joy, Woori Hospice Hospital)

586
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:07,960
Oh, boy. I want to...

587
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:11,170
sit down too.

588
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,139
You know...

589
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:19,670
The youngest nurse. What do you think of her?

590
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:23,679
Who?

591
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,750
You know, the cute nurse. The youngest one.

592
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,190
Well, I don't know. She's...

593
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,320
Hey, come on.

594
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,558
You and Nurse Seo are close,

595
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:40,658
so you must know what kind of man...

596
00:57:40,659 --> 00:57:42,259
nurses tend to like.

597
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,530
Sorry, I have to take care of something.

598
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:50,710
I pray that all handsome men may disappear from this planet.

599
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,939
Amen. Gosh.

600
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:56,610
(Mr. Pyo)

601
00:58:07,289 --> 00:58:08,289
Excuse me, sir.

602
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:15,199
Wasn't there a fire here? Senam Apartments used to be here.

603
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,900
That's right.

604
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:20,599
When did this new building go up?

605
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:22,139
Right after that fire.

606
00:58:22,539 --> 00:58:23,739
That quickly?

607
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,909
As if nothing ever happened?

608
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:29,079
That's how it is, you know.

609
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,349
By the way, who are you?

610
00:58:31,449 --> 00:58:32,449
One of the people...

611
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,889
who died in the fire that day.

612
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:04,550
I'm exhausted.

613
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,250
I want to quit everything too.

614
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:12,650
That wish of yours.

615
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,289
I'll do it.

616
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:20,760
See you up there.

617
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,469
In that place,

618
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,699
I'll make you smile.

619
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,550
(Ha Jun Kyung)

620
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,229
What? A missed call?

621
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,730
(Jae Yeon)

622
00:59:59,369 --> 01:00:00,400
What?

623
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:01,769
(Jae Yeon)

624
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,309
Darn it.

625
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:31,730
Hey!

626
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:33,800
- Stop! - No!

(Fried Chicken is always right.)

629
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,320
Where are the kids?

630
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:53,690
What?

631
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,288
Where are the kids?

632
01:00:56,289 --> 01:00:57,730
Hey, what's your problem?

633
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:59,230
You hit them, didn't you?

634
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:00,859
What are you talking about?

635
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,159
Did you hit them?

636
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:04,730
What are you doing?

01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:40,369
(If You Wish Upon Me)

638
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:43,340
Maybe we shouldn't have done that.

639
01:01:43,869 --> 01:01:44,969
You have been chosen...

640
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:48,610
as the second victim.

641
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,980
What is your wish?

642
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,219
You still don't seem to know that you're such a wonderful person.

643
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,320
Why me?

644
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,150
It's ill-fated.

645
01:01:59,889 --> 01:02:02,019
It all feels like a dream.

646
01:02:03,159 --> 01:02:04,230
Stop, that's enough.

647
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:07,159
We're only getting started.
