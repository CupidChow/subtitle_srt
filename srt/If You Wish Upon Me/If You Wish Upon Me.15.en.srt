Let's have fun together...

after death.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,850
- Mr. Kang. - Stay out.

10
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,450
This is what you want from me.

11
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:47,850
- No. - Isn't it?

12
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,659
Mr. Kang.

13
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:52,820
Stop it now.

14
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,929
Gyeo Rye.

15
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,130
Please stop now.

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,060
Will you?

17
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,600
Stop it!

18
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,069
Stop!

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,040
Stop it.

20
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,950
Stop it.

21
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,689
That's exactly what he wants from you.

22
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,619
Don't you know...

23
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,959
how many people tried to stop you from becoming a murderer?

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,200
So, stop it.

25

Yoon Gyeo Rye.

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,739
I couldn't find you anywhere.

27
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,739
- What are you doing here? - Gosh.

28
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,109
What are you doing here, you thugs?

29
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,450
Hey.

30
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,229
Gyeo Rye.

31
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,269
- Gyeo Rye! - Crazy punk.

32
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,270
Wait.

33
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:25,978
Do you know him?

34
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,889
Yes. He used to work for me, but he caused some trouble.

35
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,960
Don't worry about him.

36
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:36,960
Let him go. Release him!

37
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,969
Are you deaf?

38
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,269
Chairman Yoon. What's the matter?

39
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,669
He's my son.

40
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,479
- Pardon? - He's my boy.

41
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,580
I didn't know you had a son. I'm sorry.

42
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,479
I didn't know...

43
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,949
until I got here.

44
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,949
Let me go.

45
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,388
Keep your word.

46
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:05,418
What word?

47
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,490
If I turn Mr. Kang in to the police, you said you'll leave.

48
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,099
So keep your word. I called the police.

49
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,969
You called the police on him?

50
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,539
And hey.

51
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,569
You thugs.

52
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,139
Take it.

53
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,509
What's that? Morphine?

54
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,550
Leave the morphine.

55
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:37,389
Come with me now.

56
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,219
With you?

57
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,189
Yes, with me.

58
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:43,330
Gyeo Rye.

59
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,960
No.

60
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,629
You must not leave this place.

61
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,439
Don't get involved in the family matter.

62
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,340
It's none of your business.

63
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,508
How dare you try to steal my son?

64
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,449
Forget it. Let's go.

65
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:05,479
Gyeo Rye.

66
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,219
Gyeo Rye!

67
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,899
Gyeo Rye.

68
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,909
You don't have to do this for me.

69
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,579
Who said I'm doing this for you?

70
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,310
Says who?

71
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,420
I might as well...

72
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:44,660
benefit from a powerful parent.

73
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:47,829
Gyeo Rye.

74
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,060
See?

75
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,258
Back in the days, I couldn't even dare to...

76
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,069
make eye contact with him.

77
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,839
Right?

78
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,068
Now that I'm Yoon Ki Chun's son,

79
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,079
he can't even say a word.

80
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,509
This isn't...

81
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,779
who you are.

82
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,160
Kang Tae Sik.

83
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:26,899
Thank you for everything. Let's go on our separate ways now.

84
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:29,870
You should get punished for what you did.

85
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,810
And let me enjoy my life...

86
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,610
under my wealthy parent.

87
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,250
Let's go, Dad.

88
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,750
Gyeo Rye.

89
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,420
Gyeo Rye.

90
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,790
Gyeo Rye. Look at me.

91
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,490
What are you doing?

92
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,629
We can...

93
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,730
protect the hospital ourselves.

94
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,600
- You don't have to do this... - Hey, Seo Yeon Joo.

95
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:12,709
To be honest, the wish thing.

96
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:16,378
Anyone can do that other than me.

97
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:18,319
And this hospital...

98
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,189
I mean, you and me.

99
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,230
We don't make a good couple.

100
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,040
It's nice to have a son.

101
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:49,509
This is why everyone wants a son.

102
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,350
Right?

103
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,420
Tae Sik.

104
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,399
Son?

105
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,310
Son.

106
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,389
Gyeo Rye.

107
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,459
Dying alone and lonely...

108
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,328
isn't me, but Kang Tae Sik.

109
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,560
I don't care about that.

110
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,170
Just keep your word.

111
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,170
You'll never visit...

112
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,810
this hospital or Mr. Kang again.

113
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:49,509
Sure.

114
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,810
If that's what my son wants,

115
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,149
why not?

116
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,930
Back in the days, I wouldn't be sitting here.

117
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,600
How fun.

118
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:18,899
It's suffocating here.

119
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,670
I'm going for a walk.

120
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,220
Are you okay?

121
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,729
You know Yoon Gyeo Rye and Kang Tae Sik...

122
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,730
- are putting on a show. - Go.

123
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,730
As long as Kang Tae Sik is alive,

124
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,869
whether he's in Busan or Tokyo...

125
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,100
or in the States,

126
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:57,610
I can always find him if I want.

127
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:00,679
We have an ill-fated relationship.

128
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,079
What about Yoon Gyeo Rye?

129
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,350
Let him be.

130
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,590
I'm enjoying the show.

131
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,070
I'm here because Gyeo Rye asked.

132
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,269
What's going on?

133
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,870
I know. What on earth is going on?

134
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,950
Anyway, he told me to drive around and drop you off.

135
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,220
He told us to kill some time.

136
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,319
Whatever. Just follow that car.

137
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,350
No.

138
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:46,219
Tae Sik. Just stay here.

139
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,389
Follow them!

140
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,129
Mr. Kang.

141
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,460
Let's do what Gyeo Rye said.

(If You Wish Upon Me)

143
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
Gyeo Rye.

144
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:49,019
Because of us... No.

145
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,220
I know you're leaving to protect the hospital.

146
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:57,230
But this is your home.

147
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,559
Don't give up like this.

148
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,729
Don't do this alone. Let's fight together...

149
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,799
Fight?

150
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,899
I'm sick of fighting now.

151
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:08,669
I want to stop.

152
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:15,409
Seo Yeon Joo.

153
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,179
My wish.

154
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,679
Remember my wish?

155
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,189
That I want to be happy...

156
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,960
even for a moment before I die?

157
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,029
My wish came true...

158
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,370
in this hospital.

159
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,110
So I have no regrets.

160
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:46,909
I was really happy.

161
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,059
(Team Genie Yoon Gyeo Rye)

162
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,990
Thank you.

163
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,230
Thanks to you,

164
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,200
I was way happier than I expected.

165

Hey.

166

If you go with them,

167
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,450
you have to keep fighting again.

168
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,480
No, that won't happen anymore.

169

170
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,059
sorry.

Chase him.

00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,179
It's me, Yoon Gyeo Rye.

176
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,019
Wait for me. I'll be there soon.

177
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:10,490
Kill me.

178
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,220
You prick.

179
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,700
What? Are you going to punch me?

180
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,159
Hit me.

181
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:21,970
You're just a thug who butters up to my dad.

182
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,440
You crazy prick.

183
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,769
- Hit me. - Hit him.

184
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,049
You should get hit if you deserve it.

185
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:15,919
That's the true lesson.

186
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,019
Don't you think so, Gyeo Rye?

187
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:44,919
Dad. Help me.

188
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,789
Dad. Look after me.

189
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,019
Spare my life please.

190
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,960
I'm not trying to kill you.

191
00:15:57,929 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm only teaching you a lesson.

192
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,470
Back then and now.

193
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:16,809
What are you doing?

194
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,990
Hey.

195
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,689
Then teach me.

196
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,089
Hey. Let me go.

197
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,428
This will be your last moment.

198
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:30,190
Hey.

199
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,710
Mr. Kang.

200
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:26,119
Mr. Kang. Are you okay?

201
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,690
How did this happen? Mr. Kang.

202
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,400
Hello? I'm in front of Woori Hospice Hospital.

203
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,730
There's been a car accident.

204
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,440
A man is hurt.

205
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,640
It's a car accident.

206
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:52,410
No.

207
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,589
Seok Jun.

208
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,819
Seok Jun.

209
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,259
Seok Jun.

210
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,960
I never told you to die.

211
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:19,099
But why the heck are you dying?

212
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:24,039
Seok Jun.

213
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:26,740
Seok Jun. Wake up.

214
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,180
Mr. Kang. Are you okay?

215
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,819
Mr. Kang.

216
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:34,079
Mr. Kang.

217
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
You...

218
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:56,108
Darn it. I went through so much...

219
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:57,670
to find this.

220
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,308
Pick your target carefully...

221
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:03,578
When trying to blackmail and take advantage of someone.

222
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:05,549
You shouldn't have done that to me.

223
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:09,289
(Move to trash)

224
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,220
What did you say to me in prison?

225
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:14,088
You said I was your son.

226
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:16,189
But what was it that you said when your real son showed up?

227
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,960
I worked for you like a dog.

228
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:22,230
Your words are never worth a thing.

229
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:26,670
In the end, what you gave me killed you.

230
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,048
(Ambulance)

231
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,089
Mr. Kang?

232
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,630
Mr. Kang.

233
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:54,230
- Mr. Kang. Wake up. - I told him not to go.

234
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:56,970
How could this happen?

235
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,740
- Mr. Kang. - My son.

236
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,980
Wake up. Mr. Kang.

237
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,380
Yoon Gyeo Rye.

238
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,500
Gyeo Rye.

239
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:50,250
(Soyang Hospital)

240
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,410
Wake up already.

241
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,950
Let's eat delicious food,

242
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,309
go to coffee shops,

243
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,980
and visit nice places together.

244
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,289
Seriously, you...

245
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:34,329
made me lose my temper since we were young.

246
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,779
I told you. I will not become a thug to earn money.

247
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,380
It's not like I want to be a thug.

248
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,119
People like us have no choice because we need to survive!

249
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,849
Just stay with Jun Kyung for the rest of your life,

250
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,489
and I'll take care of the money for you.

251
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,519
No, I will not do that.

252
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,429
You evil jerk.

253
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,099
Why must you do this to Jun Kyung? Just why?

254
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,869
(Kang Tae Sik)

255
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,410
(Yoon Ki Chun)

256
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,190
(Twenty years ago)

257
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,160
How did you know where to come?

258
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,500
I know everything about you,

259
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,230
even without you telling me.

260
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:52,940
Hey, I...

261
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,169
came up with this brilliant business idea.

262
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,709
- It's... - Why don't you tell me later?

263
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,710
What?

264
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:02,650
Help yourself to some food first.

265
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,750
Oh, right. Okay. I was being hasty, wasn't I?

266
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,019
Sorry.

267
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,089
Please cheer up, ma'am.

268
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:16,460
Cheer up, okay?

269
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:38,250
So they passed away together in a car accident.

270
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,549
And they were such a lovey-dovey couple. Gosh.

271
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:49,029
If you put it like that, they passed away peacefully.

272
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,299
These days, nothing can be more unfortunate than being sick.

273
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,229
- You're right. - Why?

274
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,170
Because it causes trouble for your kids.

275
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,169
And nothing can be more painful than being left alone...

276
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,240
after living with your loved one for years.

277
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,509
I heard they were getting quite a bit of insurance money.

278
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,579
Apparently, his parents had taken out five insurances.

279
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,779
I know, right?

280
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,549
How is Tae Sik in such great luck?

281
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,960
I mean, the price of the land he bought is on the rise.

282
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,089
And now, he's receiving his parents' insurance money.

283
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:31,499
- Let's have a smoke. - Sure. Gosh.

284
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,169
What is it? Are you leaving?

285
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,740
- No way. We're going for a smoke. - I see.

286
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,539
- We'll be back. - Okay.

287
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,509
Tae Sik. Sit down.

288
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,649
You have it tough.

289
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,220
Have a glass.

290
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:50,849
I know it's not the right time to say this,

291
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:56,288
but the world sure is endlessly kind to you, Kang Tae Sik.

292
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,930
Who would've thought that small land...

293
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,769
you bought with a loan would skyrocket and make you rich?

294
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,700
And who would've thought your parents...

295
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:07,970
took out several insurances...

296
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,369
amid their hardship so as not to cause...

297
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,909
any harm to you and make you richer?

298
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,579
Gosh, I'm jealous. I really am.

299
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,279
Even if you're drunk,

300
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,848
you shouldn't talk about my dead parents.

301
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:21,450
No, listen.

302
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:25,018
It's unfair for people like me.

303
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:27,959
Even if we only sleep three hours a day and work our buttocks off,

304
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,189
we can't save any money.

305
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,959
Saving money is like asking for the moon.

306
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,598
But I don't know if this guy was blessed by the deity...

307
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,729
or got on the good side of Buddha,

308
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,199
but he gets rained on with money...

309
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,469
regardless of what he does without even trying.

310
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,569
Rained on, you hear me?

311
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,339
I worked really hard too.

312
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,150
You weren't the only one.

313
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,250
Not everyone who tries hard becomes rich, darn it.

314
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,460
Are you having difficulties these days?

315
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,089
Difficulties, my foot.

316
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:06,559
It's just that cash isn't flowing at the moment.

317
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:10,900
Here. Bottoms up.

318
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,069
Right.

319
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,910
You're not in the situation to make a toast. Just drink.

320
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,980
Come on.

321
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,359
This man here is Chief Prosecutor Choi Young Ho.

322
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,390
Yes.

323
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:35,058
Next to him is an attorney...

324
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:37,190
in Korea's largest law firm, Kang Shin Joong.

325
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:39,660
- His wife is an anchor. - Gosh.

326
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,969
On the opposite is Reporter Han Se Woong...

327
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,470
from Moonyoung Daily News.

328
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,670
That man over there is Lohan Bank's...

329
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:49,709
- deputy chairman. - Seriously.

330
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,479
They will help with our entertainment business. Greet them.

331
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,509
Okay. My name is Kang Tae Sik.

332
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,509
Please take good care of me.

333
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:01,618
This guy right here has never been unlucky for the last 20 years.

334
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:03,149
He's got great luck with money.

335
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,558
One sneeze is enough to make money fall down like rain.

336
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,788
- I'm telling you. - Gosh, stop it.

337
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:12,598
Then can you give us a sneeze?

338
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,700
Yes, why don't you show them?

339
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,099
Alright. Then I'll sneeze loud and clear.

340
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,750
Achoo!

341
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,059
- Achoo! - Here!

342
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:44,329
Nice one.

343
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,329
Here.

344
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,569
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

345
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,509
(Four years ago)

346
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:04,048
Chairman, I'm here.

347
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:05,078
(CEO Yoon Ki Chun)

348
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,380
Hey, welcome.

349
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,630
You know,

350
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,829
back in middle school,

351
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,700
I was what kids these days call an outcast.

352
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:26,569
An outcast.

353
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:28,609
You were one?

354
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:34,680
I was often stepped on, beaten up, and used.

355
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,450
It was painful.

356
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,220
I wanted to die so badly.

357
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,589
So as soon as I entered high school,

358
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,920
I intentionally picked a fight with the toughest guy...

359
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,529
and fought for my life.

360
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:54,559
It didn't matter if I really died back then.

361
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,500
Maybe it was because of that mindset,

362
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:58,400
but I had easily won.

363
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,970
I did.

364
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:03,509
I won.

365
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,880
So my past got forgotten completely.

366
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,349
And since then,

367
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:13,079
I have become the scariest guy in the school.

368
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,490
No, in the whole region.

369
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,259
But I kind of regret it now.

370
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:22,130
How come?

371
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:26,529
That incident might have led me to this path.

372
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,970
I always...

373
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,299
had a weak body.

374
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,940
And I loved reading, so I wanted to become an artist.

375
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,740
Either a poet,

376
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,240
writer, or painter.

377
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,049
I wanted to work in peace.

378
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,450
How about you start it now?

379
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,579
They say life really starts at 60.

380
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,690
Really? Should I give it a shot?

381
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,960
Yes.

382
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:55,289
That's why I'm happy right now.

383
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,529
I feel as if this is what people call happiness.

384
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:01,160
That's a relief.

385
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:03,799
Thanks.

386
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:08,910
It's all thanks to you.

387
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,508
After my wife had left me,

388
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:14,180
even my son did. So I was dead lonely.

389
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,079
If you weren't with me, I would have already taken my life.

390
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,420
Thanks for being with me.

391
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:23,490
You weren't having it easy either.

392
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:27,519
Just like me, you had lost your wife and son.

393
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,430
That made me open up to you more.

394
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,230
You must miss your son a lot.

395
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:40,799
Of course, I do.

396
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:44,809
He was the only existence I loved in my life.

397
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,049
Then...

398
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,849
why did you do such a thing to him?

399
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:56,150
What do you mean?

400
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,990
Those bruises on his body.

401
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,930
And that burnt mark on the back of his neck.

402
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:07,460
Oh, that iron mark?

403
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:09,630
I had flipped out.

404
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:13,098
After his mom had left,

405
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:15,609
he threw a tantrum that he wanted to go after her.

406
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,240
That ticked me off.

407
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,639
He forgot how good of a father I was.

408
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,650
It was me who took him to the park and bought him delicious food.

409
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:24,380
Not his mom who was in depression.

410
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,950
Talk about being ungrateful.

411
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,349
Whatever. Forget about him. He has already left.

412
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:33,890
That son.

413
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,259
Don't you want to see him?

414
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:41,859
Not at all.

415
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:46,740
I made a son in prison. Cheol Woo.

416
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,170
He's the spitting image of me.

417
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,240
I'll raise him well.

418
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,529
What?

419
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:16,098
Please don't kill me. Let me go home.

420
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:18,868
I don't need the money. So please spare me.

421
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:21,000
- Let me go home. - Okay.

422
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,410
- No. - Isn't this enough?

423
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,439
Do you know...

424
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,749
how much I spent on you to maintain the views?

425
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,150
The best computer, webcam, and lighting.

426
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,319
And don't get me started on how expensive the room rent is.

427
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,288
Hey. Go home.

428
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:39,319
- No, please. - This is your home, wench.

429
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:40,890
You little...

430
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:42,529
What were you doing?

431
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,059
Come here, Seok Jun.

432
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,059
(P Entertainment Vice President Kang Tae Sik)

433
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,869
Goodness.

434
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,320
Who are you?

435
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,059
- Oh, hello. - Hey.

436
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,730
What brings you here?

437
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,730
I must have had too much to drink with the president.

438
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,829
I lost my way.

439
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,699
Excuse me.

440
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,539
Yes?

441
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,710
The keys, please.

442
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,280
Oh, right. The keys.

443
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,448
It was left under the table.

444
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:55,449
I see.

445
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,050
Bye.

446
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,429
Hello?

447
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,730
I want to file a report.

448
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,139
Everything started from loneliness.

449
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:52,110
In the end, I even got cast aside by my son.

450
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,840
Hey, Kang Tae Sik.

451
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,820
Am I a bad guy? Or a guy to be pitied?

452
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,159
We both lost our families.

453
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,289
But thankfully, I was saved...

454
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:15,360
by a new family I met in the last moments of my life.

455
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,110
Ki Chun.

456
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:36,449
When we're both up there, let's become good friends...

457
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,090
and not sworn enemies.

458
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,229
Can we open that club you mentioned?

459
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,099
Of course, we can.

460
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,339
Do you know how much money I spent on the detectives?

461
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,339
They still get half of my income.

462
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,909
I knew it. You're as generous as ever.

463
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,808
A real tough man you are.

464
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:03,579
(CEO Pyo Cheol Woo)

465
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,179
By the way.

466
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,690
I heard rumors that Chairman Yoon had passed away.

467
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:16,760
That can't be true.

468
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,559
If he had, it wouldn't be this quiet.

469
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:25,230
Didn't you start a new business recently?

470
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:27,499
Count me in if there's anything interesting.

471
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,808
Don't worry about a thing and follow me.

472
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:31,670
Yes, sir. I will.

473
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,679
(RIP Yoon Ki Chun)

474
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,670
Run.

475
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:03,869
If you're in pain and scared, don't endure it.

476
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,340
Just run away. You have to live.

477
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:40,110
Even the son...

478
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,510
of the most vicious...

479
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:46,119
and evil man I've met...

480
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:49,619
was a kind, warmhearted boy.

481
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,440
Are you okay?

482
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,750
Yes.

483
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,489
Well...

484
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,429
Mr. Kang will live, you know.

485
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:50,880
- You're here. - Yes.

486
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:12,570
We're here to see you, Gyeo Rye.

487
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,300
Not him.

488
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,739
Thank you for coming anyway.

489
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:24,848
You're holding out well.

490
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:25,949
Hi.

491
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:40,130
The world she's living in now...

492
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:43,630
must be a lot more fun than the one where we live in.

493
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,340
Hi.

494
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:12,860
In any case, thank goodness Mr. Gu woke up.

495
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,130
I know. I'm so relieved too. Gyeo Rye was really worried.

496
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,539
Only good things await him now.

497
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,769
Take good care of Gyeo Rye, Nurse Seo.

498
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,679
I will.

499
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:28,139
Make two deep bows. Then we'll bow to each other.

500
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,000
Gyeo Rye.

501
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,369
You stayed by my side because of your guilt, didn't you?

502
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,780
I could've been adopted by a good family.

503
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,420
I could've been happy.

504
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,550
You think it's your fault that I wasn't adopted.

505
00:45:58,059 --> 00:45:59,360
For the past few days,

506
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,899
I felt like I couldn't breathe because my guilt...

507
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,940
was smothering me.

508
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:13,409
But you lived in that state for 20 long years.

509
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:15,280
Right?

510
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:17,650
Well...

511
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:21,719
That wasn't the only reason.

512
00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:26,559
I...

513
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,360
really hoped...

514
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,400
that you wouldn't turn out like me.

515
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,440
I really wanted to protect you. I mean it.

516
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:58,820
Thanks...

517
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:01,489
for saving me.

518
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,300
Had I not had you in my life,

519
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:12,130
I would've checked out long ago.

520
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,679
I knew that...

521
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,210
you were struggling and falling apart.

522
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,219
But I did it because I wanted to live.

523
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,389
And I've now learned that I can survive.

524
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:39,829
So I won't die.

525
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:54,840
Hey, thanks for saying that.

526
00:47:58,849 --> 00:48:00,820
Hearing this...

527
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,719
It took me so long to hear this, right?

528
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:20,840
What do you want me to do from now on?

529
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:23,869
I'll do as you say.

530
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:27,980
I'll never show up again if that's what you want me to do.

531
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:31,849
If you want me to move to a different country, I will.

532
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,980
If there's anything you want, just tell me.

533
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,190
Anything I want?

534
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,659
What I want...

535
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:55,769
Hey, then...

536
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:00,079
would you be...

537
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,079
my real family?

538
00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:08,280
Would you be my family?

539
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:11,420
I'll be your brother, and you'll be my little sister.

540
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,320
Yes, sure.

541
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,019
Yes?

542
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,030
Yes.

543
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,340
Just don't regret your decision later.

544
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,940
I'll become such a good catch.

545
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,679
- Oh, Gyeo Rye. - Yes.

546
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,420
Don't ever let Nurse Seo go.

547
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:49,019
Although I'm not sure if she's prettier than me.

548
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,199
She's much prettier than you.

549
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:56,968
- Don't lie. - For real. She's much prettier.

550
00:49:56,969 --> 00:50:00,070
Nurse Seo is much prettier than you.

551
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,599
- Liar. - Brat.

552
00:50:09,579 --> 00:50:10,780
Gyeo Rye is...

553
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:14,780
worried about Mr. Kang even in front of your funeral portrait,

554
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:20,320
not knowing that it's the biggest revenge he could pull on you.

555
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:24,889
You're a bad person, so I hoped you'd be punished for what you did.

556
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:29,329
But I never wished this on you.

557
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:33,699
I hope you can please...

558
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,769
free yourself from greed and desire and rest in peace.

559
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,419
(Kang Tae Sik)

560
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,949
He was already not doing too well,

561
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,590
and his condition worsened because of the accident.

562
00:50:54,789 --> 00:50:56,860
I don't think he has a lot of time left.

563
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:00,199
I'm really sorry.

564
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,199
Then...

565
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,960
Mr. Kang.

566
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,239
What are you waiting for?

567
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:44,610
Take me home.

568
00:51:56,219 --> 00:51:57,250
Seok Jun!

569
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:14,900
When I'm out,

570
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,909
let's go to that gopchang place again.

571
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,119
Get in the car.

572
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,039
Do you want this?

573
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,900
- Hello, there. - Mr. Gu!

574
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:24,269
How are you feeling?

575
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,909
I haven't seen you in so long.

576
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,139
I like you.

577
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,980
All of a sudden?

578
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,549
Why do you think you were the first person I thought of...

579
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,420
the moment I opened my eyes?

580
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:39,119
I'm just going to be honest with you.

581
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,320
You know, you only live once.

582
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:43,960
I'm done worrying about what other people might think...

583
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:46,698
and wasting my precious time, feeling lonely while at it.

584
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:49,799
So I want to at least tell you how I feel about you.

585
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,428
I mean, even if we don't end up dating...

586
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,429
I'd like that.

587
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:53,869
What? That was so quick.

588
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:56,239
Yes.

589
00:53:57,409 --> 00:53:59,710
Like you said, we only live once.

590
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,510
What's wrong with going on a date with someone I like?

591
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,250
Why not?

592
00:54:07,449 --> 00:54:08,880
My gosh.

593
00:54:10,949 --> 00:54:13,960
The thing is, I have a confession to make.

594
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:17,090
Goodness. Must you make so many confessions at once?

595
00:54:17,429 --> 00:54:18,989
- My gosh. - To tell you the truth,

596
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:21,460
I'm not from Seoul.

597
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,969
Don't get the wrong idea.

598
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:25,300
Oh.

599
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,840
I thought you were.

600
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:33,940
I see. You're not originally from Seoul.

601
00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:41,320
Of course, my boyfriend got in on the first try.

602
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:44,789
Anyway, now that he got into college,

603
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:46,860
he has to move into his dorm room.

604
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:51,190
What if all the girls at his school fall for him?

605
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,400
My gosh, I'm really worried.

606
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:55,730
Seo Jin.

607
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,170
You silly goose. You need to be confident.

608
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,039
That way, you can protect your boyfriend.

609
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:06,039
Like Nurse Seo.

610
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,449
Besides, I'm sure that the girls at his school...

611
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,750
are no match for you, Seo Jin.

612
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:14,820
Oh, come on.

613
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,519
Mr. Kang, how come you always...

614
00:55:18,289 --> 00:55:19,449
speak the truth?

615
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:24,788
Seo Jin, don't make Mr. Kang talk too much.

616
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:27,158
What are you talking about? I'm a quiet person.

617
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:29,459
My gosh. Really?

618
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,800
I didn't know. Sorry.

619
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:35,239
Anyway, what is Gyeo Rye doing?

620
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,840
I'm starving.

621
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:39,439
What did you think I was doing?

622
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,840
Goodness. I'm so busy, but I made this for you.

623
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,039
- Here's your food. - Yes.

624
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:47,719
- Oh, my. - I made this special spaghetti.

625
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,250
Try it.

626
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:02,000
I get to taste this spaghetti that Gyeo Rye made.

627
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,829
This is the only dish he can make.

628
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:06,069
What are you talking about? I know how to make many dishes.

629
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:08,840
- That's not true. - Mix it well with the sauce.

630
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,679
How is it? It's good, right?

631
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:19,750
Yes, it's good.

632
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,549
I want some too. It looks tasty.

633
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,619
What? You can eat in the cafeteria.

634
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:27,259
Don't steal his food.

635
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,488
Whatever. Mr. Kang is my best friend.

636
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:30,658
He is my best friend.

637
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:31,859
There's dessert too.

638
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,630
- Wow. - It's cinnamon punch.

639
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:36,699
I heard you guys chatting away. What were you talking about?

640
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:40,099
Right? They were so loud.

641
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:48,479
What is it?

642
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,579
You two, do me a favor.

643
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:55,980
Please go out on a date, will you?

644
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:01,460
You two have been stuck in the hospital for days.

645
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:03,789
I feel like it's because of me,

646
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:07,098
- and it makes me uncomfortable. - Gosh, no.

647
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:09,359
We'll figure it out.

648
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,569
Don't be so nosy, okay?

649
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:14,268
Look after yourself first. Eat well.

650
00:57:14,269 --> 00:57:15,900
And this is our home.

651
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:18,138
This is like a stay-at-home date.

652
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:20,839
That's right. And I'm here to work.

653
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,809
That's right. We're here to date and work.

654
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:27,050
Come on.

655
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:32,289
Go out on a date, you two.

656
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,460
It's my wish.

657
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:39,760
Grant his wish.

658
00:57:40,059 --> 00:57:42,158
- Grant his wish. - Grant his wish! Date!

659
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:43,199
Grant his wish!

660
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,530
What?

661
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:48,440
- Finish your food first. - Okay.

662
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,309
Hello.

663
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,849
You see,

664
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,989
I'm not trying to play hard to get,

665
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,420
but I'm very busy these days.

666
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,800
I'll do this when you play hard to get.

667
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:18,800
Okay?

668
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,070
Like this.

669
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,510
You can do it.

670
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,050
Hey.

671
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,849
We should go out on a date.

672
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,219
Mr. Kang told us to do it, you know.

673
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:50,868
What are you all looking at?

674
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:52,929
Have you never seen anyone going on a date?

675
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:00,280
I'm off.

676
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,510
- Seo Jin. - Yes?

677
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,179
I want...

678
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,219
to formally ask Team Genie...

679
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:12,820
to grant...

680
00:59:14,619 --> 00:59:17,030
my last wish.

681
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:21,800
Could you tell them?

682
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:36,039
Sure.

683
00:59:37,309 --> 00:59:40,079
Of course, that's no problem at all.

684
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,489
Thanks.

685
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,550
(If You Wish Upon Me)

686
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:13,110
Mom, I now have someone I can rely on.

687
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:16,949
Can you grant that kind of wish too?

688
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,989
Did our hospital have a director?

689
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:22,090
Just forgive them.

690
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,989
Please invite me too.

691
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,300
Thank you.

692
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:31,329
Now, I should really tell you.

693
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,269
I heard a new volunteer was coming today.

694
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,670
Thank you for everything.
