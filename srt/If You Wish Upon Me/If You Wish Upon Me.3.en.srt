(Sung Dong Il)

(Choi Soo Young)

(Won Ji An, Nam Tae Hoon, Yang Hee Kyung)

(Kil Hae Yeon, Yu Soon Woong, Jeon Chae Eun, Shin Ju Hwan)

6
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,969
(If You Wish Upon Me)

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
Don't go in.

8
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,520
Why can't I go in?

9
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,289
Why is this locked?

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,170
There is...

11
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,180
a ghost in this room.

12
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:20,390
Funny.

13
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,260
Fine. Let's say the ghost is sick.

14
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,700
By the way, are you good?

15
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,170
Are you really a good person?

16
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,999
When something comes up,

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,370
everyone looks for you.

18
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,980
So, are you a good person?

19
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:49,750
I'm not sure.

20
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,949
Are you saying you are or not?

21
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,489
He doesn't have much time left.

22
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,420
Right?

23
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:12,599
(If You Wish Upon Me)

24
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,770
Over here.

25
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,009
My.

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,348
The King of Joseon's meal is...

27
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,419
nothing compared to this.

28
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,819
It would've been nice if you could join us.

29
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:36,729
You're here.

30
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,000
You should help me and place the spoons.

31
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,829
I just got here.

32
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,039
How could you make me work right away?

33
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,180
I've never seen anyone smile like that before.

34
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,590
I should take a photo of it and see it every time I'm depressed.

35
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,159
What are you doing? Hurry.

36
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:10,400
Come on.

37
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,840
But...

38
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:23,639
Is this really necessary in front of a patient?

39
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,280
How fun.

40
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,680
He asked us.

41
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,449
Besides, you're not eating anyway.

42
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,989
Right. I don't eat this kind of stuff.

43
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,250
It's not to my liking.

44
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:43,330
It doesn't even look that delicious.

45
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,180
He's talking gibberish because he's hungry.

46
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,249
There's so much food.

47
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,580
How did you make all this?

48
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,620
Hey!

49
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,129
Why would you sneak into your own house?

50
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,899
I'm just here to get the charger.

51
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,958
If you're busy, I'll come back later.

52
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,069
Young man, we're having lunch.

53
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,039
Did you have lunch?

54
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,169
I'm not that hungry.

55
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,638
- Come in. - What?

56
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,040
Come in and join us.

57
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,250
I'm not hungry.

58
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,079
I told you.

59
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,550
I'll let you eat food that you can't stop eating...

60
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:43,149
even if you're not hungry.

61
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,699
I'm hungry. How long are they going to take?

62
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,970
I know. It's about time.

63
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,768
They're here.

64
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:58,938
- Hello. - Hello.

65
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,610
- Welcome. - I'm glad you're here.

66
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,338
Hee Sook...

67
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:04,379
Dad.

68
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:09,579
Hee Sook.

69
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,850
Dad. Why didn't you tell me?

70
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,759
You were mad at me.

71
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:25,259
That was a long time ago.

72
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,699
You couldn't come because you had to pay for Mom's surgery.

73
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:34,339
Back then, I was upset. I blamed you for that.

74
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:40,579
Dad.

75
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,319
Sorry...

76
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,620
I took so long.

77
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,389
No, it's okay.

78
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,529
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

79
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,480
Now, let's eat.

80
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,419
We granted your last wish...

81
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,720
to have a nice hearty meal in this house...

82
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,189
with your daughter and people you want to thank.

83
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,129
Thank you.

84
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,028
How can I ever thank you?

85
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:36,300
You can thank us later.

86
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,439
Now, come here and eat.

87
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,470
Sit down over here.

88
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,149
Do you like Korean food?

89
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,508
I'll enjoy it.

90
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,420
You're fluent in Korean.

91
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,588
I'm better. I want to show Grandpa how much I practiced.

92
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,120
Yes. Show him.

93
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,290
My.

94
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,759
Grandpa. I'll start.

95
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,199
It's still a flower in the mountain

96
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,300
It's still a flower in the field

97
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,739
It's still a flower in the street

98
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,870
They're all a flower

99
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,980
Wherever it blooms

100
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,550
Whatever it looks like

101
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,490
Even without a name

102
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,889
They're all a flower

103
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,529
It's still a flower in spring

104
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:40,129
It's still a flower in summer

105
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,100
It's still a flower even if it blooms in secret

106
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,339
They're all a flower

107
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,279
Wherever it blooms

108
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,810
Whatever it looks like

109
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:58,619
Even without a name

110
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,920
They're all a flower

111
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:05,818
Good job.

112
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,289
You're very good.

113
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,458
You're so cute.

114
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,329
I know. You're so adorable.

115
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:15,800
Here.

116
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,638
Did he say he wants kimchi Jeon?

117
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,138
That's what I mean. Of all this food.

118
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,850
It must be his favourite.

119
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,980
Kimchi Jeon...

120
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,490
was my mom's favourite.

121
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,259
Tell Mom...

122
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,399
how good this is when you meet her.

123
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,340
Let's eat.

124
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,008
- Enjoy. - Enjoy your meal.

125
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:04,279
Do you know how to use chopsticks?

126
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:08,190
Let's eat.

127
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,590
It's delicious.

128
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:18,759
Enjoy.

129
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:25,269
It's the unworldly taste.

130
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,909
Once you try it...

131
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,148
Are you going to get something fancy just for yourself again?

132
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,378
You don't know what's real good.

133
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,080
You only like instant food.

134
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:43,419
He doesn't know because he never had what's real good.

135
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,889
It seems he never had a chance before.

136
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,199
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

137
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,768
Enjoy your meal.

138
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:58,299
Enjoy.

139
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,870
I'll eat on my own.

140
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,070
Try this.

141
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:08,450
- Do you want soy sauce? Enjoy. - It's good.

142
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,219
What should I eat first?

143
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,918
- You're fluent in Korean. - Try some japchae.

144
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,889
- It's amazing. - It's really good.

145
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,960
This tastes terrible.

146
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:33,070
Your son will go home soon. Don't worry.

147
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,279
(My eldest son)

148
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,179
Son.

149
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,909
Mommy used to be very good at chin-up bars too.

150
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:56,649
I heard that grandpa wanted to spend his last moment...

151
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:00,929
in that shabby house I hate so much.

152
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,100
It felt so weird.

153
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,460
I see.

154
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,500
I was thinking the same.

155
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,500
I always wanted to get out of that house...

156
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,509
and go back to our old house.

157
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,610
The money they gave us.

158
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,980
Let's give it back to them.

159
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:32,789
Did you change your mind for the money?

160
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,159
No.

161
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,629
Someone...

162
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:44,570
scolded me so much.

163
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:53,279
He told me to get a grip.

164
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,409
Ever since we moved here,

165
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:01,419
I wanted someone to scold me, swear at me,

166
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,220
and yell at me.

167
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,690
It was too quiet.

168
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:10,789
Too quiet.

169
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,259
Stop it.

170
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,370
Are you out of your mind?

171
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,340
Get in the car.

172
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,320
Lady.

173
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:36,620
Dying.

174
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,960
Isn't that hard?

175
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,359
I've tried it too.

176
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,429
But...

177
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,269
it wasn't as easy as I thought it would be.

178
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,969
I won't tell you something stupid...

179
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,240
like have courage to live on if you have courage to die, but...

180
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,870
Gosh. I don't know.

181
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,210
Don't die.

182
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:11,159
Honestly, you don't want to die.

183
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,490
You don't want to do that.

184
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,919
The man with the tattoo did that for me.

185
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,990
He looked like a jerk on the outside.

186
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,159
Right?

187
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,330
Dong Ho.

188
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,799
Yes?

189
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,399
Let's go home.

190
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:01,610
Yes. Let's go.

191
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,539
By the way, can you make me bibimbap again?

192
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,480
Of course.

193
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,919
I tried the food the old lady made.

194
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,879
I could eat it again if you make it.

195
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:15,990
I'll make it delicious.

196
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,889
Grandpa.

197
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:00,490
Here.

198
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,490
Give it to your wife.

199
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:31,660
Grandpa?

200
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,490
Grandpa?

201
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,940
Dying...

202
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
That's...

203
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,880
not all bad, right?

204
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,390
Right?

205
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,190
Grandpa.

206
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,140
You can let him go.

207
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,980
He probably took it with him.

208
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,519
But I...

209
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:39,890
But I haven't apologized to him yet.

210
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,299
He probably knows how you feel.

211
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:05,619
Dad.

212
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,650
You'd gone through a lot.

213
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:16,359
I love you.

215
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,900
Thank you.

216
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:58,769
I'm glad he left soundly.

217
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:00,640
Well done.

218
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,210
It wasn't me.

219
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,839
It was Team Genie.

220
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:10,450
By the way, where's Gyeo Rye?

221
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,180
I guess it's tough for him because it's his first time.

222
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:21,589
You're drunk.

223
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:25,029
Hey, buddy. Sit down.

224
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,900
Why did you call me? You know I don't drink.

225
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:30,029
I just wanted...

226
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,869
kimchi Jeon today.

227
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,680
I'm just saying it out of concern,

228
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:41,880
but you don't think we're friends or anything, right?

229
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,150
You're not a friend.

230
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,079
You're Jin Gu.

231
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,250
Wang Jin Gu.

232
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:53,619
How funny.

233
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,630
Seriously.

234
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,369
Hey, Jin Gu.

235
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,608
You know that when it comes to people,

236
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:11,579
I don't even trust any kinds of deities.

237
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,180
But do you know why I trusted you...

238
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,549
and left my big sum of money and Sonny to you?

239
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,390
No, I don't.

240
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,759
You, punk,

241
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,990
didn't laugh at me at first sight.

(New Hope Orphanage)

243
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,450
You know, the guys who laughed at me at first sight.

244
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,980
All those jerks...

245
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:59,289
either beat me up, took money from me,

246
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,230
scammed me, or pinned a blame on me.

247
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,769
Especially...

248
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,809
the person I called my father.

249
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,308
By chance, I saw a picture of him...

250
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:23,880
smiling brightly with me in his arms.

251
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,460
If that had happened for real,

252
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,890
wouldn't it be totally disgusting?

253
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,730
He doesn't even have an ounce of humanity in him.

254
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:53,109
Why do you keep passing out in front of me?

Teacher!

257
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,989
Ma'am, the kimchi Jeon is amazing. Another portion, please.

258
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,259
Sure.

259
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,268
- Get up. You punk. - Gosh.

260
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:25,180
- Where are we? - Tell me where you live already.

261
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:26,579
Hey, Gyeo Rye.

262
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,609
Yes, this is the place.

263
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,778
Are you his friend?

264
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,049
- No, I'm not. - No.

265
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,619
He's not my friend but Jin Gu. Wang Jin Gu.

266
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,759
I told you it wasn't funny.

267
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:42,089
I'm two years older than him.

268

- I see. - Gosh.

269
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,929
Hey, I feel awful.

270
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,599
By any chance, did you laugh at him when you first met him?

271
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,099
When I first met him?

272
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,940
Gosh, I had the biggest frown on my face.

273
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:56,209
- Lay me down, will you? - Great, okay.

274
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,239
Let's go. Is this where you live?

275
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,639
Why are you... No, this isn't his place.

276
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,449
- I think it is. - Hey.

277
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,979
- I'm off. - Where are you going?

278
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,049
- Place him inside. - Goodbye, sir.

279
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:08,220
- Hey! - Can't you take him inside?

280
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,319
Thank you.

281
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:14,558
Gosh, Jin Gu. Couldn't you have taken him inside?

282
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,460
- Man, it's cold. - Hey.

283
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,230
Why did you let yourself get plastered?

284
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,969
Why don't you go inside instead of...

285
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,500
Don't think about...

286
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,539
Alright, open up. Hey.

287
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:28,910
This is my place.

288
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,940
Hey, this is my room! Gyeo Rye!

289
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,079
Oh, I see.

290
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,619
He's throwing up.

291
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,069
Goodness.

292
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,670
Darn it. Where am I?

293
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:01,640
My head.

294
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:10,680
Where's Sonny? Oh, goodness.

295
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:14,849
Hey. I can give him sweet potatoes, right?

296
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,789
He's loving it.

297
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,660
I got that from the house with the persimmon tree.

298
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,359
Sonny will feel stuffy inside the bag, so let him stay in there.

299
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,470
I have already told the elders about it.

300
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:31,299
I even painted it yellow.

301
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,410
Sonny, why don't we go inside this house?

302
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:38,779
Look.

303
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,380
It's nice, isn't it?

304
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,119
Sonny, this is a hospital.

305
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:48,450
So try not to wander around, okay?

306
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,960
Do you like it, Sonny?

307
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,990
Listen. I already had...

308
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:58,529
an online shopping cart full of goodies for you...

309
00:25:58,930 --> 00:25:59,960
from luxurious brands.

310
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,369
Hey, Sonny.

311
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,900
If you find this place comfy,

312
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:11,410
do you mind sharing a corner with me?

313
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,879
I put the house on the market,

314
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,910
so I'm going to become homeless soon.

315
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,180
I already sold my car.

316
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:24,749
Then how should I give you the repair fee?

317
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,358
It's somewhat hard now.

318
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:28,289
What do you mean how? Just give it to me.

319
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:32,059
The repair fee and me selling my car are two different things.

320
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,759
Fine.

321
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:37,369
I put my house on the market.

322
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,799
It won't take long until I find a new tenant,

323
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,470
so wait just a bit longer.

324
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,740
I'll just go live in the mountains.

325
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:46,779
Gosh, why don't I make a living growing sweet potatoes?

326
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,949
- Oh, Mr. Kang. - Were you on break?

327
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,150
Yes, have some sweet potatoes. I didn't harvest them though.

328
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,920
Gosh, Sonny. What a pretty new house you have.

329
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:58,589
Hey.

330
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:01,930
Gyeo Rye, you punk. If you puked inside the ambulance...

331
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,660
Forget it.

332
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,259
You're hung over, right?

333
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:10,799
Come here. I'll give you some sweet rice punch.

334
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:18,210
This cup right here...

335
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,209
belongs to Seo Jin.

336
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,609
Wash it after you're done drinking, okay?

337
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,319
And get a cup for yourself when you have the time.

338
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,819
We try not to use disposable cups.

339
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,518
I won't be here for long,

340
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,660
so what's the point of leaving my cup here?

341
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:35,529
Jerk. Drink it.

342
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:41,970
(Seo Yeon Joo)

343
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:49,108
That reminds me,

344
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:50,940
the ghost in the last room on the fourth floor.

345
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,140
Is it true?

346
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,048
Of course. A ghost lives there.

347
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,480
And that ghost...

348
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,220
is a man-eating one.

349
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,890
It's a man-eating ghost that devours...

350
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:07,319
innocent people's health and happiness,

351
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,558
grows its body,

352
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:12,160
then moves on to the next...

353
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,829
innocent people.

354
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:22,539
That's why we locked it up inside that room.

355
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,439
And that actually stops the ghost from escaping...

356
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,980
- that room? - Seems like it.

357
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,519
So crazy.

358
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,089
Even the ghost in this town is crazy.

359
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,889
- Where are you going? - You told me to get trained.

360
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,460
So here I go.

361
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,659
Now then. You can't volunteer...

362
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,859
at a hospice hospital just because you want to.

363
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,700
You need training for a certain period of time.

364
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,400
And to start this training, there's something you must do first.

365
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:57,440
That is to write a will.

366
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:00,910
Write the last thing you want to say.

367
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,700
(Experiencing Death: Write a Will In Advance)

368
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:29,670
(Diagnosis)

369
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,480
It hurts!

370
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,450
I'm in pain.

371
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,549
Nurse Seo!

372
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,288
Se Hee.

373
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:44,789
Look at me. I'm here.

374
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:49,289
Please inject some painkillers. Quickly.

375
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,199
You already had a lot of injections today.

376
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,329
- So please endure it... - I don't want to!

377
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,099
I came here because I didn't have to be in pain.

378
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,739
And you told me to call you whenever it hurts...

379
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,140
so that you can help me right away.

380
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,338
So I'm telling you it hurts,

381
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:06,479
so why aren't you giving me the painkillers?

382
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,979
- I'll talk with Dr. Yang... - If you're not going to save me,

383
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,579
the least you can do is put me at ease.

384
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,220
Keep your promise, you witch!

385
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,049
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. How can I help?

386
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,690
Save me, please.

387
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:20,490
Save me.

388
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,690
Save me, Yeon Joo.

389
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,500
- Please save me. - Se Hee, calm down.

390
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,669
- I'll help you right away. - It hurts, you jerks!

391
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,769
Get me the medicine.

392
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,009
Hang in there just a bit more.

393
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,109
You'll feel better once the painkillers are in.

394
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,529
What's wrong with me?

395
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,679
(If you have a dream, you can start over.)

396
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,880
(If you have a dream, you can start over.)

397
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:50,609
You gained weight.

398
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,549
Is the pen food good?

399
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,960
Why? Are you scared I might not sell because I got fat?

400
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,190
Jun Kyung.

401
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,059
Where could Yoon Gyeo Rye be?

402
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:12,869
He's outside, so why do you keep asking me who's stuck in here?

403
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,069
What about the money? Where is it?

404
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,509
I already told you.

405
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,008
All of it went into flames...

406
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:24,680
when Yoon Gyeo Rye and I tried to kill ourselves...

407
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:26,880
with carbon monoxide.

408
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,490
And thanks to that, I got locked up for arson.

409
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:36,759
- Listen, you nut job. - What?

410
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:38,700
Can't you come up...

411
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,130
with a more believable lie?

412
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,799
Oh, I see.

413
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:48,740
But if you want me to, shouldn't you pay me first?

414
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,779
Wasn't that the basis of capitalism you taught me?

415
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,308
My internet viewers paid...

416
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,519
millions of dollars to see me smile on camera, you jerk.

417
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:04,390
And that was the money you stole.

418
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,829
I earned over two million dollars back then.

419
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,098
So stop asking about him...

420
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:15,900
over 300,000 dollars. It's annoying.

421
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,220
Welcome back, Boss.

422
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,720
What is it?

423
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,150
Did I do something wrong?

424
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,390
Gosh.

425
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,019
My bad.

426
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,730
I took it out on you.

427
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,700
I'm just quite hurt.

428
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,919
Why did it come to me

429
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:15,190
Only now of all times?

430
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,259
Yes, I resented it

431
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,530
But I've been waiting for it dearly

432
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:28,599
My last miracle

433
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:39,349
What miracle do you want?

434
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:50,789
I never knew you'd give me the chance.

435
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:54,260
I'm still young.

436
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:58,030
And compared to the other patients,

437
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,769
I have a little more time.

438
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,869
Well, people like us...

439
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,880
can pass away at any time.

440
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:11,849
But in return, promise me you won't fight with others...

441
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,449
and make peace with them.

442
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,590
It's not like I want to fight.

443
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,329
But when I'm in extreme pain,

444
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:25,800
I can't control...

445
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:28,929
my frustration and anger.

446
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
By the way,

447
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,340
how did you come up with such an idea?

448
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,409
Granting people's last wish.

449
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,559
The first man who started this said,

450
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:56,389
"When humans are born,"

451
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:01,328
"their mothers, fathers, and sometimes their siblings..."

452
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:03,699
"bless them."

453
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:05,400
"But we all pass away..."

454
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:08,139
"alone."

455
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,570
"Isn't that too lonely?"

456
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:15,510
"It's the last moment..."

457
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:18,809
"when people need each other."

458
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:24,050
So we started this...

459
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:26,960
to comfort each other's last moment.

460
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,300
But Pyo Gyu Tae...

461
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:37,630
is the biggest celebrity with the most selling tickets.

462
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:41,170
Is it really possible?

463
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:45,210
Do you have a plan?

464
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,710
Wait and see.

465
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,250
And...

466
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,849
trust Genie.

467
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,590
I don't remember...

468
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:34,320
cutting his nails recently.

469
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,159
Sorry.

470
00:37:55,909 --> 00:37:58,949
Nurse Seo, cheer up

471
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,519
I'm always on your side

472
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,019
Nurse Seo, please cheer up

473
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:09,460
Remember I'm always on your side

474
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,199
Come on, Nurse Seo.

475
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,369
I'm really sorry about last time.

476
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:22,710
I never had a friendly personality...

477
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:27,079
but wasn't the type to say such harsh things either.

478
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,250
But it hurt so much...

479
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,880
that I couldn't stop myself.

480
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:44,489
I was really upset.

481
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,800
Because Se Hee was in so much pain, I was really upset.

482
00:38:55,469 --> 00:38:58,739
You scared me, Nurse Seo.

483
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,519
Sit. Come on, sit.

484
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,750
Se Hee, putting up with the pain isn't always good.

485
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,129
No matter how many times we teach patients about pain,

486
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,199
they think enduring it is the best.

487
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,969
They try to bear it until the end.

488
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:26,300
Life scares me even more.

489
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,400
What should I do?

490
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,710
I can't hold back even if I try.

491
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,979
You did a good job. Yes, you did.

492
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,550
That is why I like you.

493
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:46,960
If you're in pain, scream. Otherwise, no one will know.

494
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,260
There's no need to endure it here.

495
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:54,999
I wonder who's telling others...

496
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,730
to suck it up and live with the pain.

497
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:01,500
I will never...

498
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:04,070
leave anyone to suffer.

499
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,179
You need to let others know,

500
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:11,309
and others need to be aware of your pain.

501
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:16,219
I knew it. You're the best hospice hospital nurse.

502
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:18,050
- Do you agree? - Yes, I do.

503
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:20,460
- "Pyo Gyu Tae." - Yes?

504
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:22,218
"Currently 37 years old, born in Busan,"

505
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,190

510
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,369
Is that so?

511
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,010
Let's see.

512
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:38,768
There's a rumour he's easily lovestruck.

513
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,808
What a show-off.

514
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:40,940
Did you send him the message?

515
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,880
I did.

516
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:45,249
But he gets hundreds of messages every day,

517
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,579
so I doubt he'll read mine.

518
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:47,719
This man.

519
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,190
It won't be easy to meet him in person, right?

520
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,658
- Of course. - And performing on the same stage?

521
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,360
It can never happen.

522
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:59,460
But shouldn't we still meet him in person and ask?

523
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:01,059
Let's give it a shot!

524
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:03,170
Alright.

525
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,440
You need to let others know,

526
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,670
and others need to be aware of your pain.

527
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,558
Oh, gosh.

528
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:28,019
You scared me.

529
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,730
It suits you. That Genie badge.

530
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:33,699
- What? - Over there.

531
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,029
Darn it. What the heck?

532
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,868
Who put it on here? Seriously.

533
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:41,069
What do you mean by who? Wasn't it you?

534
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,440
It suits you.

535
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,269
Take this.

536
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:48,780
- What is this? - Follow me.

537
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:52,279
Where do we have to go this time?

538
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,119
Gosh, I can't even sit down and relax for a moment.

539
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,250
Se Hee's last wish...

540
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,190
is to perform with Pyo Gyu Tae,

541
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:03,860
the musical star whom she admires the most.

542
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,260
She wishes to present a touching performance...

543
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,269
that can make people smile at least once before she dies.

544
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,070
She said it'd help her overcome any kind of pain.

545
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:18,909
(The Ultimate Touching Story, "Returns" Starring Pyo Gyu Tae)

546
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,940
Hey, Gyeo Rye.

547
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,849
I think I'll be too nervous to talk in front of a celebrity.

548
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:27,419
You can do it, right?

549
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,250
No, I can't. It's not like I've met him before.

550
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,960
Do I really have to do stuff like this? Seriously.

551
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,659
Knock three hours off, then.

552
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,559
How dare you try to cut a deal with me?

553
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,058
Fine. This counts as an hour of community service.

554
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:41,800
Just an hour? Come on. I came all the way here.

555
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:43,230
Three hours.

556
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,869
- Okay, one hour. - Come on.

557
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,170
Three hours. Deal?

558
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:51,170
Deal, end of discussion.

559
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,578
(Gyu Tae's voice is crazy good.)

560
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:53,579
Thanks.

561
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:59,210
Excuse me. That restroom over there.

562
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,519
Look, that one over there.

563
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,988
Was it the second stall?

564
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:08,158
I think the toilet is clogged.

565
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,730
It was overflowing.

566
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,328
That can't be.

567
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:14,059
Oh, really?

568
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:18,369
Hello.

569
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,500
Hello.

570
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,649
Pyo Gyu Tae is at it again.

571
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,109
- He does that all the time. - I know. He's such a weirdo.

572
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,420
Must you keep the flash on during the performance?

573
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,190
It's so distracting when I'm trying to focus on the emotions.

574
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,619
I'm sorry.

575
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:41,460
Do you even know why you're apologizing?

576
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,630
- Do you understand artists? - I'm sorry.

577
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,429
As an artist, it is my job to make sure my emotions...

578
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,429
can teach the audience. And to do that,

579
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:53,170
setting the right ambiance is key.

580
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:56,939
I can only do it if I'm in an environment where I can focus,

581
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,440
you idiot.

582
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,340
Gosh.

583
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:04,110
Oh, dear. He's got quite the temper.

584
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,650
Darn you.

585
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,519
(Dressing Room)

586
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,320
Mr. Pyo Gyu Tae.

587
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,058
- Here. - Oh, thank you.

588
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:20,558
Great job on the show, by the way. I was so touched.

589
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:24,400
You're such an amazing singer and dancer.

590
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,598
- Right? - Yes.

591
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,269
The finale song, "Happy Country". Wasn't it incredible?

592
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:32,239
Oh, yes! It was fantastic.

593
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,480
I didn't sing "Happy Country".

594
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:39,519
What I meant was, it would've been fantastic if you'd sung it.

595
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:41,250
In any case, thanks for this.

596
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,389
Wait, Mr. Pyo.

597
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:46,019
To tell you the truth,

598
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,230
I work at a hospice hospital.

599
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,500
We have a young patient,

600
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,069
and she's your die-hard fan.

601
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,500
I see. Thank you. Next time, make sure you watch my show.

602
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,439
Wait, Mr. Pyo Gyu Tae!

603
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,238
- Gyu Tae! - Mr. Pyo!

604
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:07,939
- Please meet her just once! - Gyu Tae!

605
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,879
- Wait, Mr. Pyo. - Go away, mister!

606
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,480
My goodness. You're such a handful.

607
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,618
Mr. Pyo! Let's talk.

608
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:20,920
She's a rookie musical actress. Please meet her just once.

609
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,460
Mr. Pyo! Wait!

610
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,030
He can't hear you now.

611
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,630
It really is so hard to sit down and talk to him.

612
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,130
This is crazy.

613
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,339
You did such a good job making those persimmons. You're good at this too.

614
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,879
I have a good eye,

615
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,280
so I'm good at stuff like this.

616
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,480
I wanted to study art in college.

617
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,989
Hello, Dr. Yang!

618
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,789
Sesame seeds.

619
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:00,800
Sesame seeds.

620
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:03,670
Sesame seeds.

621
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,238
Don't just stand there and look. Help me out, will you?

622
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:10,768
Gosh. Why am I doing all the work?

623
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:12,840
You should try doing it on your own.

624
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,780
Sesame seeds.

625
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:24,349
I see that there are some guardians that I haven't met before.

626
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:32,760
All of you must be having such a hard time.

627
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:36,300
You want to save them no matter what,

628
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:38,929
and you want to believe that you can save them.

629
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:41,469
But at times,

630
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:44,570
it stresses them out,

631
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,639
so you feel bad and helpless at the same time.

632
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:53,019
When my daughter first came to this hospital,

633
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:56,719
I felt the same way.

634
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,489
I don't want to do this anymore.

635
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:08,459
- Please... - My daughter told me...

636
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,099
that she didn't want to die in pain...

637
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,570
while undergoing chemotherapy at a regular hospital.

638
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,239
She made it clear to me.

639
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:30,750
So I got my daughter admitted to this hospital...

640
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:34,988
and started cooking for my daughter...

641
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:37,388
- You need to eat a lot. - and other patients.

642
00:47:37,389 --> 00:47:38,489
How does it taste?

643
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,610
Just before my daughter died,

644
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:53,239
she asked me...

645
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,840
to make delicious foods for others...

646
00:47:57,179 --> 00:47:59,210
even after she died.

647
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,090
So please enjoy the food, and I hope it cheers you up.

648
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,789
You must cheer up and stay strong...

649
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,260
so you can give the patients the strength to hold out.

650
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,070
Please...

651
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,610
don't waste your precious time.

652
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:27,980
Enjoy the food.

653
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,610
Thank you.

654
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:37,449
What?

655
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,690
Did everyone leave already?

656
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,900
What's wrong? Are you crying?

657
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:01,639
What's wrong?

658
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:05,769
Do you really not like the foods that I make?

659
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:09,079
Well, I'm just like that.

660
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,579
I'm a picky eater, and I normally don't have much of an appetite.

661
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:16,219
You've tried my food, so I can't believe you still have no appetite.

662
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,889
Are there specific dishes that you like?

663
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:20,919
No, there aren't.

664
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,460
I just eat to live. I don't like food.

665
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,760
The joy of eating is one of life's greatest pleasures.

666
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,299
Life's greatest pleasures?

667
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,300
That's what they say when they have nothing to worry about.

668
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:34,840
Whatever. Should I put this away?

669
00:50:36,809 --> 00:50:39,739

Can I keep wearing the bandages?

685
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,440
Why? It must be uncomfortable.

There's this young man I'd like to work with,

Who can sleep here?

810
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:24,670
It's like a staff lounge where people come and go.

Gosh, the floor is rock-hard.

812

This is so uncomfortable.

00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:36,880
I get yelled at and fight with them all the time.

814
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:41,079
But we always make up somehow. Oh, boy.

815
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,519
Then why bother fighting?

816
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:45,250
And when I don't eat,

817
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:49,289
I get nagged like crazy.

818
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:53,059
I'm sick of it. Seriously, I'm sick and tired of it.

819

This peaceful feeling...

829
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,880
really doesn't suit my life, which has been...

830
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:52,219
nothing like my amazing name, Yoon Gyeo Rye. Right?

(If You Wish Upon Me)

837
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:55,780
- He's here. - Did you see?

838
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:00,519
I saw the picture hanging from the rear view mirror.

839
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:01,920
Is he your son?

840
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:04,190
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

841
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,400
A woman who's a weirdo and a man who's messed up.

842
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,500
I'm sorry.

843
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,429
Thanks for paying attention to me.

844
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,570
People would think that he's your son.

845
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,070
I love you.

846
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,439
Mr. Yoon Gyeo Rye. It bothers you?

847
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,039
That's what I want to say.
