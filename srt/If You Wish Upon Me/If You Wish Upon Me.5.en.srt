00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,810
What are you?

8
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,359
I'm Team Genie.

9
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,060
I grant patients' wishes.

10
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:02,969
Stop.

11
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,069
Stop it, both of you.

12
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,909
We're in a hospital.

13
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:11,579
Shall we talk in private?

14
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:23,790
Wait...

15
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,959
Gosh.

16
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,500
We weren't fighting.

17
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,640
It was just...

18
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:42,769
It was nothing.

19
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,519
(Episode 5)

20
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,989
If you...

21
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,859
hadn't stirred her up...

22
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,790
and said you'll grant her last wish,

23
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,629
her condition wouldn't have gotten this bad.

24
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:07,200
I just wanted to...

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,740
let her to...

26
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:14,740
what she wanted for at least one day.

27
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,379
Nurse Seo.

28
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,149
You know how precious every minute is...

29
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,818
to patients.

30
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:25,819
Yes.

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,289
It's nice if they could live longer.

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,619
Isn't it our job to reduce the pain...

33
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,029
in their remaining time?

34
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,229
That's what I mean.

35
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:38,199
Each day means so much to them.

36
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:42,199
Some patients want their dreams to come true in that one day.

37
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,169
You joined us...

38
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,870
because you know how they feel.

39
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,409
Anyway,

40
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:55,650
it's distracting other patients in the hospital.

41
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,979
It's a lot of pressure on me...

42
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,120
to give unnecessary treatments.

43
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
And it bugs me...

44
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:06,719
that it keeps reminding them that they're dying.

45
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,909
Nurse Seo.

46
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:27,310
I invited people I love today.

47
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,419
I really want this play to happen.

48
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Dr. Yang.

49
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,930
Can we talk?

50
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,879
(If You Wish Upon Me)

51
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,389
Dr. Yang.

52
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,889
No cigarettes.

53
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,629
I only suggested it to persuade you.

54
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,329
But I shouldn't, right?

55
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,439
Of course not. You went through so much to recover.

56
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,040
It occurred again.

57
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,220
Cancer spread to the liver.

58
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,220
Thank you for everything.

59
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,490
I was told I have six months max,

60
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:51,529
but I lived for two more years.

61
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,170
Did you tell everyone else?

62
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,899
Are you sure you don't want to get treated?

63
00:04:58,069 --> 00:04:59,100
Yes.

64
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,540
My life was a series of regrets.

65
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,579
I'm spending...

66
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,379
the best time...

67
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,180
of my life in here.

68
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,889
Are you telling me to not stop you?

69
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,259
Yes.

70
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,360
Dr. Yang.

71
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,600
Please...

72
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,040
let me...

73
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,509
grant...

74
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,810
the patients' last wishes...

75
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,579
for my remaining time.

76
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,279
Will you?

77
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:49,290
I'm...

78
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:51,959
Team Genie.

79
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,209
Sometimes...

80
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,709
human relationships feel heavier...

81
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,680
than looking after patients...

82
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,050
and lifting weights.

83
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,790
Well...

84
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,089
I agree with you on that.

85
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,730
When I first came here,

86
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,360
Dr. Yang...

87
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,129
helped me and waited for me quietly.

88
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,040
I was originally in the ER.

89
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,138
There, I did everything I could...

90
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,939
to save people.

91
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,449
Then I couldn't get used to it here.

92
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:55,519
I have no choice but to watch people dying.

93
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:03,490
He waited until I could get used to it.

94
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,069
What happened to us?

95
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,708
Nurse Seo. There you are.

96
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:18,779
Yes.

97
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,009
We got approval to open the safe.

98
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,949
(Medicine Storage)

99
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:30,149
Dr. Yang isn't wrong.

100
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:33,519
Reminding patients that they're dying...

101
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,490
might be too much for them.

102
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,399
I know it depends on the person,

103
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,769
but what I'm saying is, I don't think this is worth it.

104
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,269
There are also other patients.

105
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,980
He said this will be his last time helping a patient as a doctor.

106
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:58,949
(Station of the Cross)

107
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,449
Hello.

108
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,149
Are you okay?

109
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:08,129
Tell me if you're cold.

110
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,560
Is this comfortable?

111
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,399
Sir. Do you feel comfortable?

112
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:21,269
Excuse me.

113
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,339
Are you Se Hee's parents?

114
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,079
- Yes. - Yes. Well...

115
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,810
Where's Se Hee?

116
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,279
She'll be here soon.

117
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,519
Is she okay?

118
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,548
So far, yes.

119
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,788
She said she was going to a gig outside the city.

120
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,519
How could this happen?

121
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:44,928
We prepared seats for you over there.

122
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:46,959
You should take a seat there.

123
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,370
- Please. - Let's go.

124
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:11,320
Gyu Tae. I think they're ready.

125
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,059
Okay.

126
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,259
Here's what you asked.

127
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:20,159
Later. When I give you the sign.

128
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:21,470
Okay.

129
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,870
The love which you know how it ends. What you mentioned last time.

130
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,240
Was that Se Hee?

131
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:30,809
But she's...

132
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,149
Let's go.

133
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:38,220
Let's go.

134
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,388
Don't be so nervous. You're making me nervous.

135
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:48,690
Here.

136
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,399
Thank you.

137
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,799
Is half of it still effective?

138
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,169
You know, the plabo or placebo or something.

139
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,870
Think what you think.

140
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,980
You're very smart.

141
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,779
Good luck with your play.

142
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:10,879
I'm sorry I couldn't be there. I miss you.

143
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,220
Gosh. "I miss you."

144
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,849
Love is blooming everywhere.

145
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,389
What the heck?

146
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,620
Old bachelor.

147
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:21,559
Oh, my blood pressure...

148
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:28,269
You should stop spending so much time looking after elders...

149
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,599
and go on blind dates.

150
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,369
She's right.

151
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,039
Or you'll end up living alone like me.

152
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,308
Born single.

153
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:40,009
I wish I could go on blind dates,

154
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:42,409
but then I'll have to quit this job.

155
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,149
I don't think I have a chance in this lifetime.

156
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,189
- My handsome look is wasted... - She's here.

157
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,190
She's here?

158
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,690
Amazing.

159
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,989
Great.

160
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,129
Se Hee.

161
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,528
You look so pretty.

162
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:01,269
- You look so pretty. - So pretty.

163
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,199
Doesn't she look like a musical actress?

164
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,509
I'm so embarrassed.

165
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:12,809
You look pretty.

166
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,820
You look wonderful today.

167
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:22,120
- What? - Awesome.

168
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,889
Gyeo Rye looks wonderful too.

169
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,099
I told you.

170
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,529
His good-looking face will come in handy at least once.

171
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:36,200
My.

172
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:38,169
My goodness.

173
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,740
This wasn't necessary.

174
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,679
Shall we?

175
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,580
Yes.

176
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,000
Se Hee.

177
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,190
Thank you for coming here.

178
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,960
Now, we'll begin.

179
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,169
("The Miracle of Love")

180
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,149
I know I can't go back

181
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:08,259
This is such a shame

182
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:16,169
But I'm thankful

183
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,299
To be with you

184
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,980
Love

185
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:33,980
It may be another word for a miracle

186
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,549
Miracle

187
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:44,230
It may be another word for love

188
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:47,970
Excuse me.

189
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:54,539
Se Hee.

190
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:02,048
Has true love come for me?

191
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,049
Se Hee.

192
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,149
Is that you, Se Hee?

193
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,179
This is intriguing.

194
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,789
Is it the morphine?

195
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,090
She doesn't look like a patient at all.

196
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,659
Maybe...

197
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,129
she looks healthy because her dream came true.

198
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,059
That's cool.

199
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,830
Having a wish come true.

200
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,870
- What's your dream? - It's my first time...

201
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:28,210
Me?

202
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:33,209
Isn't that too grand?

203
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,309
- This is fascinating. - I've never thought about it.

204
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:40,450
- A dream doesn't have to be grand. - I was waiting.

205
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:42,648
- For example, my dream is... - Always... Right here.

206
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,789
to increase my muscle by 1kg every year.

207
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:48,028
Gosh. I'm so sick of it.

208
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,230
Always muscles.

209
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:05,079
We're meant to be

210
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:10,149
Together forever

211
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,990
I never expected a miracle

212
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:25,659
I never expected love in my life

213
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,969
- The last moment - Why did it have to be in the end

214
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,710
Why did I find you now

215
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,408
I regretted it

216
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:46,919
But I still waited for my last miracle

217
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:49,989
Why in the end

218
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:57,090
Why now

219
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:59,428
I regretted it

220
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:07,399
But I still waited for my last miracle

221
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,409
("Reset" audition)

222
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,409
("Everyone's Miracle")

223
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:20,980
If the deity grants my wish

224
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:26,150
My wish will be to meet you again

225
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:31,390
Wherever whenever it will be

226
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,890
Se Hee's boyfriend...

227
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:38,599
gave up on becoming a musical actor due to vocal fold nodules.

228
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,799
That's why this play means a lot to them.

229
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,309
This could be their first and last performance.

230
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,410
Thank you.

231
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:57,650
Once again

232
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,819
The miracle created by everyone

233
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:10,390
It was achieved in the end

234
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:19,939
If we meet again

235
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,940
My wish is

236
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:29,509
I want to meet you again

237
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:39,519
If you wish upon me

238
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:44,160
I will wait

239
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:47,199
My everything

240
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,470
The day we meet again

241
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,240
I will be there for you

242
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,740
Let's meet again

243
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:01,848
Go.

244
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:06,019
I'll wait for you wherever that is

245
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:10,789
I'll wait for you to the end

246
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:18,000
I'll wait for the day we meet again

247
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:21,569
Let's

248
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:27,799
Meet again

249
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,589
("The Miracle of Love")

250
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,660
That's why she waited.

251
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,358
I know.

252
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,430
- Such a cute couple. - This is great.

253
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:57,099
They're the best couple I've ever seen.

254
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,369
They... They...

255
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:02,609
My.

256
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:05,140
Oh, my goodness.

257
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:07,539
What's going on?

258
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:10,109
What do we do?

259
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:14,049
They make such a great couple.

260
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,660
Do you even understand artists?

261
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:29,329
Please come to the performance today.

262
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,670
I'll wait for you.

263
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:33,799
Se Hee...

264
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,769
told me never to hold back on saying these words.

265
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:41,710
I love you.

266
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:56,789
Oh, right.

267
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,200
Me too. I...

268
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:03,829
love you...

269
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,269
dearly.

270
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,529
- Oh, my gosh. - That was cute.

271
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:23,250
Hang in there until we meet again as I will be waiting

272
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,519
Promise me

273
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,660
Let's meet again

274
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,869
Everyone.

275
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,269
For my final moment,

276
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,380
I'm going home tonight.

277
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,819
Please consider the stage just now as my farewell.

278
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,660
I apologize for everything until now...

279
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,059
and thank you.

280
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,559
Especially...

281
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,400
Ms. Oh from the bed next to mine.

282
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,069
Sleep at peace from now on.

283
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,519
Thank you.

284
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,289
Thank you.

285
00:23:58,609 --> 00:23:59,839
It's me.

286
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:02,509
Please drop the lawsuit.

287
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,720
Gyu Tae may be preachy,

288
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,750
but he's not that bad of a guy.

289
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,960
I'm not lying.

290
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,799
I do look up to you, Gyu Tae.

291
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,400
But my boyfriend likes you even more.

292
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:25,069
I love you, Gyu Tae.

293
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:26,539
But I don't.

294
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:31,440
Although I'm jealous you have a nice girlfriend.

295
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,279
By the way, about the muffler and the gloves.

296
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:41,789
Those were cheap.

297
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,890
You'll regret it.

298
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,630
I might.

299
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,660
But...

300
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,299
I meant it when I wanted to stand on the stage with you.

301
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,309
You're the best actor, after all.

302
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,778
She's right. You're the best.

303
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:07,140
Zip it, punk.

304
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,490
Take care.

305
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,160
Let's meet again...

306
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:24,789
if we can.

307
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,630
Okay.

308
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:30,630
Thank you.

309
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,440
Gyu Tae.

310
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:38,710
Let's...

311
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,579
surely meet again...

312
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:45,880
someday.

313
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,099
("The Miracle of Love")

314
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,980
Mr. Kang.

315
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:52,450
It isn't much, but please accept it.

316
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,950
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

317
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,819
- What's going on? - Please excuse me.

318
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,200
Money, for real?

319
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,720
What?

320
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,500
From the reason why you must eat seaweed...

321
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:16,329
to recipes to make it more delicious and healthy.

322
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,970
(My Son)

323
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:24,609
Hey.

324
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,140
How long has it been? Are you doing well?

325
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:30,180
Isn't it the evening in England?

326
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,608
Did you have dinner?

327
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,519
Yes, it's around 8pm right now.

328
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:35,750
I'm sorry I didn't call until now.

329
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,250
How is your health?

330
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,589
My health is the one thing I'm always confident about.

331
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,758
Listen, recently...

332
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:46,230
I danced and sang at the hospital as volunteer work.

333
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:47,929
Funny, right?

334
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,299
It was a musical.

335
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:51,969
Goodness. I was in a musical at this age.

336
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,640
Hey, Mom. I'm really sorry.

337
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,269
I can't go home at the end of the year. Something urgent came up.

338
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,410
I see.

339
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,880
This year too?

340
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,819
It has already been three years.

341
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,690
I doubt I can even recognize Ji Hoon and Ji Woo anymore.

342
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:14,460
I'm sorry. I'll try it so that we can go next year.

343
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,829
Ji Woo, can you stop running in the restaurant? Come here.

344
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,259
Stay healthy. I'll call you again.

345
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,940
How upsetting.

346
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,000
Are you not getting on?

347
00:29:57,369 --> 00:30:00,240
Oh, I left my phone at home.

348
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,239
Please go first.

349
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,740
Bye, Grandma.

350
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,140
Yes, bye.

351
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:07,910
The door is closing.

352
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,499
From Se Hee. She sent us a letter.

353
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,499
- Really? - Read it out loud for us.

354
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
Go ahead.

355
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:30,569
Se Hee's got a pretty voice, so mine's going to sound weird.

356
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,109
"Hi, everyone. It's Se Hee."

357
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,778
"I'm writing this letter..."

358
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:45,819
"because I don't think I said goodbye properly."

359
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,048
"I thought my wish was too bizarre..."

360
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:50,788
and gave everyone a hard time,

361
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:53,289
so I wanted to give up several times in the middle.

362
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,660
But thank you for cheering me on every single time.

363
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:02,170
"Because my life revolved around musicals before I got sick,"

364
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,069
"I might have wanted..."

365
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,500
"to continue that daily life."

366
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,239
"The reality of death..."

367
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
"might have hit me if I had asked for something new."

368
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,180
"It must have been..."

369
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,680
"everyone's first time. You all had it tough."

370
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,949
You're right, Se Hee.

371
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,119
Ms. Yeom's knees went bad.

372
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:24,220
They so did.

373
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,420
I was really scared,

374
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,259
but thank you again from the bottom of my heart...

375
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:37,700
for sharing my daily life and giving me courage.

376
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,799
"In the distant future..."

377
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:49,750
"If we meet again in the far distant future,"

378
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,880
"I'll sing you a better song."

379
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,759
I love you.

380
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:11,470
I loved you all.

381
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,640
Even if you want to listen to my song,

382
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:20,839
please...

383
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,109
take your time...

384
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,279
and have fun before you come here.

385
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,190
It...

386
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,460
was a perfect ending.

387
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:37,890
From Se Hee.

388
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,799
It was worth the trouble.

389
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,970
I agree.

390
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:53,140
Where are you going?

391
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,779
Gyeo Rye must be heartbroken.

392
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,950
It's like that at first.

393
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:03,549
You're right.

394
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,150
I also had...

395
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,459
a really hard time at first.

396
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,130
You did, sweetie?

397
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,230
Gosh, don't cry.

398
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,470
Since you're not the one dying.

399
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:23,569
They're fighting.

400
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:27,210
It's your husband and me, his roommate, who are dying.

401
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,250
Thank you.

402
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:54,900
Did you cry?

403
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,369
No way. Don't be absurd.

404
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,309
Here. It's good.

405
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:10,349
By the way, how is everyone okay?

406
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:14,860
The person who we danced and sang together with died.

407
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,489
It was the same with the elder who lived in the house...

408
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,559
with the persimmon tree.

409
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:25,469
We're not okay either.

410
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,170
We're simply accepting it.

411
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,280
But I guess...

412
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,849
we're sort of used to accepting it...

413
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,349
more than you.

414
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,769
Have you ever been happy in your life?

415
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,969
That question is a bit...

416
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:16,419
I don't know. I don't think I have.

417
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,719
You're taking it too seriously again.

418
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:20,388
It was the same with your dream.

419
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:23,389
I wasn't asking for something grand.

420
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:25,059
Here are some examples.

421
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,598
It could have been when you ate something delicious,

422
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,469
laughed out loud with your friends,

423
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:35,710
received someone's love,

424
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,569
or were comforted by someone.

425
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,039
Something like those.

426
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,780
I had no moments like that.

427
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:48,650
In my life,

428
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,750
nothing tasted delicious.

429
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:54,058
I had no friends.

430
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:55,929
Nor was I comforted by anyone.

431
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,590
And...

432
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,059
Love.

433
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:09,769
Love?

434
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,679
Gosh. Why are you stopping there?

435
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,788
Stop what?

436
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:25,519
You stopped right at love.

437
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:27,618
And it's making me super awkward.

438
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,288
Why would you feel awkward?

439
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:31,559
- What did I do? - Oh, gosh.

440
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,299
Do you want to be in love that badly?

441
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,129
When did I ever say that?

442
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,468
Gosh. Even during the performance, you pouted your lips,

443
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:39,638
dying to kiss me.

444
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,999
When did I pout my lips to kiss you?

445
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,409
- I understand. - That was in the script.

446
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:45,839
I know what we agreed on.

447
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,238
But that social worker pushed me in the back.

448
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,808
And so that happened as an accident.

449
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,348
- "Pushed me?" - You were there.

450
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:55,050
Gosh. But you don't look that weak to be pushed easily.

451
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:58,250
What? I got pushed from the back, so how was I...

452
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,089
What a weirdo.

453
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,360
That dream of yours.

454
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,860
If you haven't decided yet,

455
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:10,070
how about becoming happy, even just once before you die?

456
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:15,340
Anyway, do you know what his last wish might be?

457
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,469
"I want to feel happy,"

458
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,679
"even just once in my life."

459
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,079
And for that one happiness,

460
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,019
why don't you try all sorts with us?

461
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,789
Nice idea, isn't it?

462
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,889
And...

463
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:34,789
maybe I could get you what you want.

464
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
Me wanting what? You getting me what?

465
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,130
Who knows?

466
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,198
- What? - What is it?

467
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,170
- What? - Whatever.

468
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,139
What on earth is wrong with her?

469
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,789
I mean, what would she get me?

470
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,199
Hi.

471
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,098
Hey, Gyeo Rye.

472
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:18,530
- I almost forgot. - What?

473
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,239
What is it?

474
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:24,609
Did you cry because of Se Hee's letter?

475
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,309
Cry, my foot. Why would I...

476
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,510
Why would I cry? Stop being ridiculous.

477
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,510
Hold on a minute.

478
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,380
I have a question.

479
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,649
The thing you received...

480
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,619
from Se Hee's parents after the show we had.

481
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,820
Tell me. What was that?

482
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:45,429
Did you see us?

483
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,029
Of course, I did.

484
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,099
Did you think I couldn't? I saw everything.

485
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:50,530
That white envelope.

486
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:53,539
It was this, right?

487
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:55,670
Money. He gave you money, didn't he?

488
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,650
I can't believe you saw that.

489
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:06,349
But when? Gosh.

490
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:09,420
So what was that?

491
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,619
He dodged the question.

492
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,019
How suspicious.

493
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,329
He did receive something.

494
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:21,499
I heard she set fire...

495
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,900
to commit suicide with her lover.

496
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:25,500
Seems like it.

497
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:28,299
Making money would have been easy with that pretty face.

498
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,440
I wonder why she did it.

499
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,250
Darn it. You little...

500
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:38,749
- Let go of me. - My bad.

501
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,179
- That wench. - Stop.

502
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:52,859
Sonny.

503
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,029
- He's so cute. - What is his name?

504
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,529
His name is Sonny.

505
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,899
Even his name is adorable. Where did you come from?

506
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,199
Hey, punk. Why are you out here?

507
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:03,969
My gosh. His fur is so soft.

508
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,269
Come here.

509
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:08,809
I told you to stay in the room. So why are you here?

510
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:12,980
Let's go home. Come on.

511
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:15,179
What the heck?

512
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,690
Why is he smiling like that?

513
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Stop.

514
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:29,369
Hey.

515
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,469
Stop it.

516
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,659
Spinach.

517
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:05,030
I came because you called me over.

518
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,799
But I don't understand...

519
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,269
why I traveled all the way here for bibimbap.

520
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:10,538
It's not even beef bibimbap.

521
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:12,368
Consider it a business trip.

522
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:15,138
Just think that you're here to treat Sonny.

523
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,749
You see, earning money isn't an easy thing to do.

524
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,879
Okay. So I'm here as a doctor, not as your friend, right?

525
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,819
You're just Jin Gu, not my friend. How many times must I tell you?

526
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,018
Fine, you jerk.

527
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:26,859
- He called him a jerk. - They're hilarious.

528
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,859
- Wow! - This is Yoon Gyeo Rye's...

529
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,988
crazy delicious bibimbap.

530
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:31,189
- Oh, my. - Wow.

531
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,599
It doesn't look that appetizing.

532
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:34,729
Ta-da!

533
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,169
- My gosh! - Oh, my.

534
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,269
It doesn't look that appetizing.

535
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,969
My gosh, Soon Ja.

536
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,709
Oh, dear.

537
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,078
Gyeo Rye, don't let her beat you. Okay?

538
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,209
What are you talking about?

539
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,749
You don't need to know. It's an inside joke.

540
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,909
I see.

541
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:53,948
All right. Dig in, everyone.

542
00:41:53,949 --> 00:41:56,250
- Thank you. - Let's eat!

543
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,448
- Give me some too. - Can I have one more?

544
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,919
- No, this is for Gyeo Rye. - Eat as much as you want.

545
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,889
- This is good. - Hey, stop it.

546
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,530
I told you. It's to die for.

547
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,599
- Oh, my. - I didn't know you could smile.

548
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,570
- It's so good. - Yes. Of course, I can.

549
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:15,369
- Hey, eat up. - He's a natural-born cook.

550

552

(Cheongsu Women's Correctional Facility)

553

(If you have a dream, you can start afresh.)

554
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,070
- Hello. - Hello.

555
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,799
How are you feeling today? Good?

556
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,340
- Yes, I feel great. - I'm glad to hear that.

557
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:22,539
Excuse me! We need help.

558
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:24,339
- My gosh. - A wild boar...

559
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,138
suddenly showed up and attacked him.

560
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:28,409
But this is a hospice hospital.

561
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,780
Hold on. Call 911!

562
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:32,879
One moment. We're calling 911 for you.

563
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,980
- One moment, please. - Gosh, careful.

564
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,320
Be careful. Watch your head.

565
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:40,259
- How did he get hurt? - He's bleeding!

566
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,788
- He's bleeding. - My leg...

567
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:43,090
- Hurry. - Any other injuries?

568
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,799
- When did this happen? - About 15 minutes ago.

569
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,530
I did call 911,

570
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:50,529
but they might take long, so I brought him here.

571
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,899
We can give him first aid.

572
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,940
- Let's go. - This way.

573
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,488
My gosh. Is it okay...

574
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:14,689
to bring an emergency patient to a hospice hospital?

575
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,959
Hey.

576
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,328
I told you earlier.

577
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:22,029
You need to press harder.

578
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,669
You slacker. Don't do it half-heartedly.

579
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,800
No, it feels great.

580
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,699
The pressure is just perfect.

581
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,369
No, come on. That can't be.

582
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,308
Hey, focus and press each acupressure point carefully.

583
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:35,839
Press for three seconds and take a break for a second.

584
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,279
Press for three seconds and take a break for a second.

585
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,879
That's how you should do it.

586
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,250
My gosh. You're not showing any improvement.

587
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,448
No, it's perfect.

588
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:46,889
No, it can't be. He's not doing it right.

589
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,629
You fool. When I teach you 1 thing, you forget 2 things.

590
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:51,729
You're not getting any better.

591
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,098
I don't have to get better at this.

592
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:56,070
I just need to complete 31 hours. And that's it.

593
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:00,599
Well...

594
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:08,210
What? Did you think I'd stay here forever?

595
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:13,619
Hey, did I ask you to stay here forever?

596
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:15,949
Then what's with that look on your face?

597
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,590
Let's be honest.

598
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:24,429
Let's not get attached to each other. Don't be such an amateur.

599
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:25,829
What? An amateur?

600
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:30,530
Sir. Who isn't an amateur in this thing called life? Right?

601
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,698
Hey, who gets to live twice?

602
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:35,099
If you know someone like that, bring them to me.

603
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:37,209
Then I'll call them a pro.

604
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:40,179
An amateur? All that punk does is talk nonsense.

605
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,348
What's with him? Goodness. Is he mad at me?

606
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:46,619
He's being like that because he's fond of you.

607
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,050
Gosh, I really can't stand him. He's too much.

608
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,888
Now, it hurts.

609
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:54,920
- Really? The pressure point... - Yes.

610
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,840
Darn it. There isn't much time left.

611
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,849
I feel like I haven't done much at all. Time's flying by.

612
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,550
Gosh.

613
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,679
Mr. Yoon.

614
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,989
That dog should stay somewhere else. Does he have a place to go?

615
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,119
Sorry? Dog?

616
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,760
You mean...

617
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,928
My dog, Sonny? Why?

618
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:35,098
For hygienic reasons, I think that would be the best.

619
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:36,670
I think some guardians are bothered by it.

620
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,500
No. Everyone loves Sonny.

621
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:44,439
And to be prepared for a situation like that,

622
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,339
I suggest you learn how to stop bleeding...

623
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,539
or how to perform CPR.

624
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,110
You should learn some useful things while you're here anyway.

625
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,550
That'd be much better than just slacking off to kill time.

626
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,820
Well...

627
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:05,460
Gosh.

628
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,900
This is crazy.

629
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,530
Hey, look.

630
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,169
I'm very close to completing my community service hours,

631
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,699
so I'll figure out what to do. Okay?

632
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:18,340
We're not exactly close enough to talk about stuff like this.

633
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:23,078
I'll keep slacking off to kill time and leave when I'm done.

634
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:25,880
So mind your own business and be on your way, will you?

635
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,719
All right. The choice is yours.

636
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:31,289
See you around.

637
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:42,059
Darn it.

638
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:48,269
Hey, you're about to get kicked out.

639
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,710
They want you gone.

640
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,480
What should we do? My gosh.

641
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,239
Hey, can't we...

642
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:58,849
Can't we just stay at the hotel until I wrap things up here?

643
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,989
It's much nicer than this place. And it's quiet there.

644
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,859
Also, everyone is so weird here.

645
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,030
They're either weird or suspicious. Or they exhaust me.

646
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,788
There's something very fishy about Mr. Kang, that boomer.

647
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,129
And all those old people.

648
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,598
They always tell me to eat this and that...

649
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:18,769
and try to boss me around. They're so annoying.

650
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,139
They nag me all the time.

651
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:24,070
Hey, and Seo Yeon Joo...

652
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,139
Nurse Seo.

653
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,539
Gosh, Nurse Seo...

654
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,179
What should we do, Sonny?

655
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,820
Well, hang in there. I'll try to get it sorted out.

656
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:41,260
Let's hang in there.

657
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:53,739
Sonny, come here.

658
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:55,269
Come on.

659
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:03,349
Sonny, don't come out. Okay?

660
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:07,050
Stay in there. Okay?

661
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,420
Excuse me. Do you know where Nurse Seo is?

662
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:16,690
- Where would she be now? - Oh, right. Okay.

663
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:18,860
Oh!

664
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:28,969
You're working out again?

665
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:30,939
Do you want to join me?

666
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,510
No, thanks.

667
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,210
I want to talk to you about something.

668
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:41,820
You want to talk to me?

669
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,319
(Doctor Yang Chi Hoon)

670
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,420
Come in.

671
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:53,230
Dr. Yang.

672
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,199
Well...

673
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,170
By any chance,

674
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,539
did you tell Mr. Yoon to send Sonny elsewhere?

675
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:07,110
He's like a child.

676
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,780
I can't believe he told you right away.

677
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:13,780
You know, Sonny...

678
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,690
only goes outside when he goes for a walk.

679
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,989
He's usually in the volunteers' lounge all day.

680
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:22,059
Is it really necessary to send him somewhere else?

681
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,488
You're sure that we shouldn't be concerned...

682
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:27,558
about him impacting the patients' hygiene, right?

683
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:29,030
Yes, that's right.

684
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,170
The thing is...

685
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,639
Sonny is ill too.

686
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:39,070
I guess you weren't only focused on granting the patients' last wishes.

687
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,479
You rush over like a paramedic...

688
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,110
to help Mr. Yoon.

689
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:48,179
Sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

690
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:50,590
Okay.

691
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:03,269
Mr. Yoon wasn't the one who told me.

692
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:06,839
One of the patients who adore Sonny...

693
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,369
happened to overhear it and told me.

694
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:11,710
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

695
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:14,309
See you.

696
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:25,690
- Hello. - Hello.

697
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,909
You want to learn how to do CPR?

698
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,909
Yes.

699
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:49,780
From me?

700
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,710
Yes, who else?

701
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,679
Beggars can't be choosers.

702
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:57,849
- Darn it. - My gosh.

703
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:02,760
Oh, boy. I'm not sure if you're trying...

704
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,899
to hit on me or if you really just want to learn the skill.

705
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:07,900
My gosh.

706
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,468
Should I just play along or not? I mean...

707
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:12,329
Hit on you? What are you talking about?

708
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,739
You know, a man and a woman who are around the same age...

709
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:20,279
- doing things like... - Hey, come on.

710
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,079
- Gosh. - What the heck.

711
00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:24,949
What are you thinking? I just...

712
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:28,118
My gosh, CPR? Who would've thought?

713
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:29,780
- Oh, my. - What? Come on.

714
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:33,259
- Have you lost your mind? - My gosh. How ingenious.

715
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,889
- What a great excuse. - I was just...

716
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,459
- Can't you just teach me? - My gosh, CPR?

717
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,598
Me, of all people? You could've asked Mr. Kang.

718
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,530
My gosh, you're such a handful.

719
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,039
- Hey, Little Captain. - Yes.

720
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:54,380
"Where is Mr. Kang? He's nowhere to be seen."

721
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,649
"He said he'd give me a bath later." Says the patient.

722
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:59,380
Oh, he's not here?

723
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:02,420
Where did he go to slack off? I'll look for him.

724
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,590
Wait, Little Captain.

725
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:06,619
Here.

726
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:10,090
He says, "Take this and eat it while you look for him."

727
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,000
Thank you.

728
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,469
- Have you seen Mr. Kang? - No.

729
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,280
Mr. Kang.

730
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:36,619
Mr. Kang!

731
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,590
Where did he go?

732
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:45,389
Mr. Kang! Mister!

733
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,400
Where is he?

734
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:57,110
Please...

735
00:53:58,510 --> 00:53:59,539
kill me.

736
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,409
Sorry?

737
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,618
Just kill me, please.

738
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,518
(Woori Hospice Hospital, Hospital Entrance)

739
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:09,880
It's my last wish.

740
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,690
My goodness.

741
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:19,690
You're here to do community service.

742
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,098
I don't really know how you ended up here,

743
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:23,369
but I heard you had a criminal record.

744
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:25,800
You must've done it before.

745
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,340
The first time is the hardest. It becomes easier after that.

746
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:34,840
What?

747
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,949
I'm practically dead anyway.

748
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:38,780
So it's not a crime.

749
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:42,979
Just hold down a pillow on my face when I'm asleep at night...

750
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,019
Hey, mister.

751
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:45,820
What the...

752
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:48,559
Are you out of your mind?

753
00:54:48,989 --> 00:54:51,530
You're asking me to kill you because I'm an ex-con?

754
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,929
Gosh.

755
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,440
I can't believe this. This place is nuts.

756
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:04,940
- Go away! - They said I had a month left,

757
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:07,179
but it's already been eight months.

758
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:10,779
At this rate, my wife will die before I do.

759
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,050
After taking care of her ill husband for over three years!

760
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:16,889
Please, I beg you.

761
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,190
Mister.

762
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,659
I'll pretend I didn't hear any of this, okay?

763
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,260
Go away. Go.

764
00:55:43,449 --> 00:55:45,448
You have such a nasty temper!

765
00:55:45,449 --> 00:55:47,679
That's why your parents and siblings don't even want to visit you!

766
00:55:56,059 --> 00:55:57,260
Gosh.

767
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,130
Hey, stop talking nonsense.

768
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,039
How dare you accuse me of killing him?

769
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,539
He went out to meet you and never came back. It's been months.

770
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:15,079
It's only natural that I think you're suspicious.

771
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,510
I mean, why would I suspect someone random?

772
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,980
You'd better tell me the truth before I call the police.

773
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,119
Fine. Go ahead and call the police. Do it, you jerk!

774
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:33,599
Also, you need to at least bring evidence to talk such nonsense.

775
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:35,199
What's going on?

776
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:36,769
Evidence?

777
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:39,329
Evidence...

778
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:43,099
What?

779
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:44,469
I can't believe this.

780
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,179
See? Look at that.

781
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,550
That's evidence right there.

782
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:55,550
Your leg is totally fine. Why are you using the crutches?

783
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,349
There must be a reason you're putting on such an act.

784
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:02,059
He always came here to extort money from you,

785
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,030
so you killed him...

786
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:07,000
and buried him somewhere, didn't you?

787
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:09,699
Hey.

788
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,969
I'm not a scumbag like you guys. You jerk!

789
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:14,170
Let go of me!

790
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:22,280
Then what makes you different from us?

791
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,010
Hey, let's go.

792
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,980
I heard you were terminally ill, but you're totally fine.

793
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,420
You could easily kill someone.

794
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:33,989
See you around.

795
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:00,650
Darn it.

796
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:16,929
Hey, when did you get here?

797
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,340
Mr. Park is looking for you. He needs a bath.

798
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:26,570
Oh, right.

799
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:29,409
Where did the time go?

800
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:32,750
Oh, you don't need to fake it.

801
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,980
I know you can walk.

802
00:58:37,989 --> 00:58:39,519
You don't need your crutches.

803
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:41,920
You see...

804
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:45,959
Well, I've never been curious...

805
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,730
about anyone. And I'm...

806
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:51,529
so used to people suspecting me,

807
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,229
so I'd hate to suspect others, whoever it may be.

808
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,300
But the thing is...

809
00:58:55,739 --> 00:58:58,039
Listen, this is just too...

810
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:01,610
This is awfully suspicious.

811
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,480
It's so strange.

812
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:08,250
What's with all the gold hidden in the ambulance?

813
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,349
Why did you accept money from Se Hee's parents?

814
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:12,889
You said you were doing this for free!

815
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,658
Oh, I guess you have to give money to those gangsters.

816
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:20,260
So you collect kickbacks after granting the patients' wishes.

817
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:21,730
Is that it?

818
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,969
Darn it. What a mess.

819
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:29,139
Even so,

820
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,710
they're desperate knowing they're dying.

821
00:59:33,909 --> 00:59:36,510
How could you use them?

822
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:39,710
What is this?

823
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:43,789
Your leg is fine. What's with the crutches?

824
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,750
Why did you deceive me?

825
00:59:46,389 --> 00:59:48,059
Why did you lie?

826
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:55,900
Did you really kill someone?

827
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:20,019
Report me to the police if you'd like.

828
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,860
What the...

829
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:32,230
Hey!

830
01:00:34,469 --> 01:00:35,639
Mr. Kang!

831
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:38,039
Gosh.

832
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:44,280
Darn it! Say something, will you?

833
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,699
(If You Wish Upon Me)

834
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:10,369
What's your friend's wish?

835
01:01:11,369 --> 01:01:12,409
Revenge.

836
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,539
Do you think I'm a joke?

837
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:18,550
What brings you joy?

838
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:22,219
Having someone who wants to know what brings me joy.

839
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:25,650
Call me when you make your decision.

840
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:29,889
You and Yoon Gyeo Rye. I'll let you go.

841
01:01:30,889 --> 01:01:32,329
