7
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,350
Ma'am. Are you going home?

8
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,718
Yes, I'll come back next week.

9
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,148
Where are you coming from?

10
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:50,789
I lost a game and had to buy ice cream.

11
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,118
Would you like one?

12
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,789
Thank you.

13
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,869
Watch out.

14
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,340
- Ma'am. Are you okay? - Yes.

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,920
That little...

16
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,060
Gosh.

17
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,760
Goodness. It's in the middle of nowhere.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,060
Hey!

19
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,099
You're that jerk from last time.

20
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:41,909
Are you the volunteer who's supposed to come today?

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,739
Yes, so?

22
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,180
Oh, gosh.

23
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,379
- Look, lady. - What...

24
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,550
Have you gone mad? What are you doing?

25
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:26,718
Look what you did. Are you out of your mind?

26
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,649
If I wasn't, do you think I would've done that?

27
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,849
That looks like a fancy car.

28
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,459
Why did you run so fast and drive me crazy?

29
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,159
Where do you think you are? It's a hospital.

30
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,229
How can a volunteer show up like that?

31
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,870
Do volunteers have to crawl from there?

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,568
What have you done?

33
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,769
- She's in a mess. - Let's go back in.

34
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,039
Let's get some coffee. Come on.

35
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:02,889
If I did that, I'll pay to get it cleaned.

36
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,418
Pay for the repair.

37
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,460
I'll pay you when you get the estimate.

38
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,129
Are you...

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,830
a grandson of some wealthy family?

40
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,169
Or are you some rude idol I'm not aware of?

41
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:21,110
You got all the expensive stuff, but you can't hide how shallow you are.

42
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:26,210
Mr. Kang. We shouldn't let him drive.

43
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,109
He has no manners.

44
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,150
Still, we can't send him back.

45
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,860
My ice cream.

46
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,030
Aren't you coming in? Do you want to go back to prison?

47
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,770
Come in.

48
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,509
This is crazy.

49
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,409
Darn it.

(Episode 2)

52
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:33,610
Most people here have...

53
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,810
last-stage cancer.

54
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,180
You must get a proper volunteer education.

55
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,050
So, don't even think about slacking off.

56
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,459
I haven't made a decision yet.

57
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:47,688
This volunteer job.

58
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:50,860
I haven't decided whether to work here yet.

59
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:55,699
I thought about doing it after taking a look,

60
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:58,198
but because of that crazy woman,

61
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,509
I don't feel like doing it.

62
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,810
Should I call it a coincidence?

63
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:09,949
This is totally strange.

64
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,649
Why do you happen to be...

65
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,720
in my volunteer work place?

66
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:18,688
Because it was me...

67
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:20,990
who requested a driver.

68
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,199
Besides, who made me unable to work?

69
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,268
To be honest, I never expected you to come.

70
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:34,239
Stop nagging at me for a tiny accident.

71
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,540
What have I...

72
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,139
Be quiet. Wait here.

73
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,338
Where are you going?

74
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,879
Here. Where else?

75
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,790
Sir.

76
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,529
Please wait here.

77
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,360
Well...

78
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,500
I'll be right back.

79
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,670
Okay.

80
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:08,610
You see,

81
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,439
this week might be his last week.

82
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,009
Will it be possible?

83
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,990
Sister. Who are we?

84
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,720
We're Team Genie.

85
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,089
The Avengers of Wish-Granting.

86
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,360
See you later.

87
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,279
What?

88
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,149
Are you telling me...

89
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,420
to drive this?

90
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,290
Or? Are you going to push it?

91
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,990
This is...

92
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,529
Your car's side mirror is broken. You can't drive that.

93
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,699
What's this? Antenna?

94
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,060
Put that back in.

95
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,500
Stop messing around.

96
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,399
If you're here to drive, drive.

97
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,769
Oh, geez.

98
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,279
What are you doing? Hurry up and get in.

99
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,410
Oh, dear.

100
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,350
Seriously.

101
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,990
It's darn tight.

102
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,689
You better get a new car.

103
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,829
My goodness.

104
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,269
Hey. Are you...

105
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,370
taking that dog too?

106
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,609
Do we have any other choice? I might not come back here again.

107
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,279
Oh, dear. What a devoted father.

108
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,948
You're the only volunteer...

109
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,550
to bring a dog.

110
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,720
Didn't you have anyone to look after the dog at home?

111
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,220
Don't you have a family?

112
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,259
Do you live alone?

113
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:20,069
Oh, it actually works.

114
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,180
It won't be easy to start this car.

115
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,180
Sonny. Let's go.

116
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,779
Sonny?

117
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:34,789
Is his name Sonny?

118
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:39,460
So you do have a family.

119
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,889
Old man. Be quiet. Where to?

120
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:45,029
Get out of here first.

121
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,980
It does move.

122
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,058
Where are we going? Are we picking up a patient?

123
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,788
Why didn't you just take the ambulance?

124
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:14,090
You'll see when you get there.

125
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:22,398
By the way, this car is perfect for you.

126
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,899
No matter how hard you hit it, it won't speed up.

127
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:29,408
And if you drive a car that goes as fast as you want,

128
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:31,109
you'll die early.

129
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,440
I don't plan to live a long life anyway.

130
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:36,149
My car is perfect.

131
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,189
If this gets into an accident, we'll die on the spot.

132
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,820
Does it even have air bags?

133
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,320
- It came with the car. - My goodness.

Tell me.

It's somewhere around here.

Where is it?

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,519
It's right here. The persimmons.

Hello.

We're from Woori Hospice Hospital.

148
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,628
Why did you ring the doorbell?

149
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:34,470
It's upsetting.

150
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,299
What's her problem?

151
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,870
- I... - You cult.

152
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,209
I'm so sick of it.

153
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,378
You're nothing but a pain in the neck.

154
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:49,209
Why is she turning us into a cult?

155
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,720

What are you doing? Hey.

Are you out of your mind?

161
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,740
Get out of there now.

162

That punk. We're not loan sharks or petty thieves.

Hurry up and get out of there.

Why does it matter? I thought you wanted to go in.

00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,330
Are you crazy?

173
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,259
Get in the car.

174
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,080
- You're home. - Yes.

175
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,518
Dong Ho. You're home.

176
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,049
(Baekil Express)

177
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,888
Dong Sik.

178
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,590
(Baekil Express)

179
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:48,129
Wash your hands and join dinner.

180
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,549
You too.

181
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,649
Enjoy.

182
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,730
Are they a silent family?

183
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,529
What's a silent family?

184
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,259
I saw it on TV.

185
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,869
A family lives under the same roof,

186
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,340
but they don't talk to each other at all.

187
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,769
A family...

188
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:31,508
is the most unreasonable human relationship...

189
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,340
and upsets you the most.

190
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:37,850
You didn't even get to choose it, but there's so much responsibility.

191
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:44,659
I don't think the family that upsets you is the dog behind you.

192
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm serious. It's true.

193
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,399
I didn't get anything.

194
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,570
So you borrowed money, but you never got it?

195
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,408
I withdrew money from the bank myself...

196
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:09,210
and sent it in a bag.

197
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,950
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars.

198
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,989
Are you saying my boys are lying?

199
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,548
No.

200
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,658
I can bet on my family.

201
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,029
I never received...

202
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,259
But that's the truth.

203
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,940
You're obviously a gambler for betting on your family.

204
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,070
I'm sorry.

205
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:36,110
- Seok Jun. - Yes, boss.

206
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:40,710
You dropped Yoon Gyeo Rye off in front of his school, right?

207
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:42,950
No outside cars were allowed.

208
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,378
But I dropped him off and picked him up.

209
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:49,249
No. That's not true.

210
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,320
He didn't come.

211
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:56,289
How could you gamble as an economics professor?

212
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:59,329
I'm sorry.

213
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,370
Have you found Yoon Gyeo Rye yet?

214
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:03,628
Everyone has to meet...

215
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,039
to see who's lying.

216
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,370
- I'm sorry. - It's not your fault.

217
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,149
Tell him the interest is 1,000 dollars a day.

218
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:16,950
Yes, boss.

219
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,850
If he still doesn't show up, he wishes to die.

220
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,820
I should grant his wish.

221
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,000
You're always borrowing money, yet you wear expensive underwear.

222
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,850
I can't do that.

223
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,980
Even if he was the former owner, I don't know him at all.

224
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,820
You're asking us to let him die in this house?

225
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,759
Of course I understand.

226
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:03,960
But the former house owner lived here for decades.

227
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,528
He's very attached to this house.

228
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:09,900
That's his problem. I have a problem of my own.

229
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,470
The whole neighbourhood is redeveloping.

230
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,740
I have to move out by next month.

231
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,910
It's hectic. I have a lot on my mind.

232
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,250
Do you think you can move a week later?

233
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,048
My family can't wait to move out,

234
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,119
let alone wait for a week.

235
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,019
So it's been over eight months since we moved in,

236
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,759
but we still haven't unpacked yet.

237
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,130
Look, man.

238
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,670
I don't think it's that big of a deal.

239
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:46,599
Why don't you take this and rent your place?

240
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,339
- Hey. - We're only...

241
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,869
Why are you giving them money?

242
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,509
Stop it.

243
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,549
There's a studio the former house owner used to stay.

244
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,749
You could stay there for a while if you want.

245
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,249
It may be small.

246
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,318
You'll have to tell each other to move,

247
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,518
go, clean up,

248
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,829
eat, sit down, lie down.

249
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,699
But that's life, right?

250
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,470
You interact with each other.

251
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,099
But you get to talk to your family.

252
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:22,670
If you want a hotel,

253
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,910
we could provide you with one.

254
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,750
I'm sorry.

255
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,420
It's not an easy decision. Goodbye.

256
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,349
Come in.

257
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:37,859
If you change your mind...

258
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,018
If this isn't enough, I'll give you one more.

259
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,159
Two.

260
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,959
Hey. Stop it.

261
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,029
You see...

262
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:46,759
Yes.

263
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,970
How much time does he have left?

264
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,869
Well, the doctor said...

265
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,539
before this week.

266
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,279
But then, it's never certain.

267
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,049
- Okay. - Thank you.

268
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,960
But...

269
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,079
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:39,219
What stock investment?

271
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,589
You never even read a book about it before.

272
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:44,588
Are you stupid or brave?

273
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:47,190
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

274
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:48,930
What do we do now?

275
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,098
- What do you mean we're moving? - Dong Ho.

276
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:53,699
I'm taking SAT next year!

277
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,669
I'm sorry. Oh, my goodness.

278
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,539
I feel terrible.

279
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:05,079
My goodness.

280
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,779
Maybe this house...

281
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,720
meant so much...

282
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,630
to someone.

283
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,329
But...

284
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:31,069
how did we end up hating it so much?

285
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,319
Let's see.

286
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,019
Come here.

287
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,190
Let's go.

288
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,769
Mister, here. The car key.

289
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,730
Take it.

290
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,869
Have dinner.

291
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,710
Dinner? No, I'm good.

292
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,039
Come inside.

293
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,109
Come in and have dinner.

294
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,858
- Here. - Gosh.

295
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,969
- Oh, my goodness. - Amazing.

296
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,969
It doesn't look visually appetizing at all.

297
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,440
- Oh, my. - No, Ms. Yeom.

298
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:43,140
Don't lose your temper.

299
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,640
You won't be able to say that after a bite.

300
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,179
How about it?

301
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,679
She's right. Ms. Yeom's bibimbap is the bomb.

302
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,149
Totally. You don't even know how skilled she is.

303
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,088
Just have it without me.

304
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:00,358
It's my taste. Stop nagging about it.

305
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,990
Gosh. This jerk sure is playing hard to get.

306
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:06,130
- Why don't we enjoy it ourselves? - Okay!

307
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,669
- Let's dig in. - Give me a spoon too.

308
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,529
Oh, my gosh.

309
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,399
- I'm psyched! - It looks good.

310
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,439
How did you make the eggs look so round?

311
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,140
Her over-easy eggs are to die for.

312
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,409
- Have some. - It's so good!

313
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,618
- Why aren't you eating the egg? - Can I have it?

314
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:28,749
- Seriously. - This is what you call bibimbap.

315
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,589
Gosh, I'm drooling.

316
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:33,058
It's a masterpiece.

317
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,629
Fried eggs are a must in bibimbap.

318
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,890
Of course!

319
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,430
You feel empty without them.

320
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,200
As expected of you, Ms. Yeom.

321
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,139
- Over-easy eggs aren't easy. - It's really good today.

322
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,970
- I know, right? - Isn't it extra good?

323
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:53,839
- I made it more special today. - I see.

324
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:57,480
Love

325
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,549
I wonder if that alone

326
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,990
Can bring a miracle

327
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,798
Can't you make at least one of my wishes

328
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,299
- Come true? - This isn't a single room.

329
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:18,098
When will she get that this is a shared room?

330
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:20,440
Can't she sing someplace else?

331
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,839
And how can she feel like singing in this situation?

332
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,379
How dare you talk back to someone older than you?

333
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,679
Being here alone is frustrating...

334
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,989
to the point I want to die.

335
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,719
Die? That's easy for you to say...

336
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,288
since you're not dying.

337
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:40,818
- They're fighting. - It's your husband and me,

338
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,189
his roommate, who are dying.

339
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,758
All you are feeling is frustration,

340
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,730
but we're on the verge of our death.

341
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,939
- That nasty temper got you sick. - Quiet, my foot.

342
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,639
- I bet all the female patients... - Gosh.

343
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,508
- hate you. - It's freaking noisy.

344
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:58,068
Isn't that why you got transferred to my husband's room?

345
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,809
What did you say?

346
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,480
I got sick because of my nasty temper?

347
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,389
Excuse me. Quiet down, will you?

348
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,788
- Yes. And that's why... - Stop it.

349
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:12,989
none of your family members come to visit you.

350
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,889
Ma'am, come on.

351
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,258
- Quiet. - It's either you or me...

352
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:18,129
that'll leave this room today.

353
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,159
- Stop. Talk it out, okay? - Darn it.

354
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,268
- Let go of me! - You're strong for a patient.

355
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:23,329
Let go.

356
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,900
- Let go before I head butt you. - Okay.

357
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,970
I'm sick of it all.

358
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:33,778
My poor life.

359
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:36,209
How can you say that when your husband is sick?

360
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,578
- You wicked woman! - Enough. Stop it!

361
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,048
- Who are you? - A volunteer worker. Got a problem?

362
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:44,858
Bollocks. You, a volunteer worker? Seriously?

363
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:48,359
- I'd rather die. - What did you say just now?

364
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,689
- What did you say? - How miserable.

365
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,029
Get out!

366
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:55,400
Darn it.

367
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,440
Whatever.

368
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:11,549
For real?

369
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,589
Who the heck duct taped it?

370
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,490
Seriously.

371
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:22,960
Who did this?

372
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,200
Who wrapped duct tape on my car?

373
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:29,969
You little...

374
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,700
Why did you use duct tape on the side...

375
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,308
If you hate bibimbap, try this yakbap.

376
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:39,240
It's easier to eat and delicious to boot.

377
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,779
A review of it is a must, okay?

378
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,019
- No, I'm good. - Take it.

379
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,049
Forget it. I don't eat things like this.

380
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,960
Gosh, that punk.

381
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,960
For goodness' sake.

382
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:12,640
Judging by his imported car, he must be really rich.

383
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,250
He's rich but a parvenu.

384
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,250
A spoiled kid raised by parvenu parents.

385
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,819
He's not rich. You can tell at a glance.

386
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,059
No rich person could possibly resist my food.

387
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,029
Am I wrong?

388
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,240
It's perfectly seasoned.

389
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,439
I love your bibimbap.

390
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,210
If you hate bibimbap, try this yakbap.

391
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:49,079
- No, I'm good. - Take it.

392
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:52,720
Goodness. Why was she acting all friendly?

393
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,619
Unbelievable.

394
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:07,259
Hey, what's wrong? Are you in pain, Sonny?

395
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,670
What is it?

396
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,369
Darn it. Is he getting car sick?

397
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,210
Hey, you barely eat.

398
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,539
But you hate the hotel.

399
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,109
Do you hate this car too?

400
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:30,420
What now?

401
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,089
I don't know.

402
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,099
Everything sucks for me too, Sonny.

403
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:04,890
This is all I can get?

404
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,719
It's not even half of what I paid.

405
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,930
This, right here.

406
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,829
How can you say that after breaking this side mirror?

407
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,769
- I was being very generous. - Gosh.

408
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,069
Fine. Have a nice life.

409
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,508
Are you leaving already? Okay, alright.

410
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:31,920
Why don't we go inside and look at other cars over a cup of tea?

411
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:45,059
What?

412
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,470
Did you call Seok Jun again?

413
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:52,440
Gosh, you jerk.

414
00:28:57,809 --> 00:28:59,109
Darn it.

415
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
What?

416
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,920
Good morning. You're up early.

417
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,220
For goodness' sake.

418
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,390
What are you two doing?

419
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:20,099
- Oh, my. - No, I'm okay.

420
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,528
- Gosh. - I'm totally fine.

421
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:24,199
Stop it. You're wearing a cast.

422
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,599
Why are you sweeping the ground?

423
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,940
And stop wiping my car.

424
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,240
It's already clean enough. Seriously!

425
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:34,609
Goodness.

426
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,839
Please enjoy! From Team Genie.

427
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:31,529
Oh, man. Really.

428
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,339
I have to do volunteer work solely because of you.

429
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,109
You failed to get any sleep at that fancy hotel.

430
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:43,079
What? Is it comfier here?

431
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,420
(Ambulance)

432
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:54,390
Aren't you here to do volunteer work?

433
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,529
So why are you slacking off?

434
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,999
Hey, just keep walking.

435
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,959
And stop picking a fight for nothing.

436
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,429
But if you're still going to,

437
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,028
do it after you pay for the repairs, Lady.

438
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,039
How much did it cost?

439
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,240
Are you going to pay me right away?

440
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,278
I'll get a loan or ask for my room deposit,

441
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,779
so tell me how much it cost.

442
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,649
Goodness. Wouldn't you be wealthier...

443
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,150
if you kept your temper in check?

444
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,119
I'll take care of my own wealth.

445
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:25,490
Just tell me already.

446
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,490
The repair cost?

447
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,829
Around 18,000 dollars.

448
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,660
A big shocker, right?

449
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,369
What? 18,000 dollars?

450
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,680
Yes, 18,000 dollars. Do you have the money?

451
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,940
Gosh.

452
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:50,150
Well, 18,000 dollars. That's...

453
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,220
less than 20,000 dollars.

454
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,950
The deposit for my house is 20,000 dollars.

455
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,219
I'll have 2,000 dollars left.

456
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,890
Goodness. So you're going to move out?

457
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:01,819
And where will you live with that 2,000 dollars?

458
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,599
I'll take care of that myself.

459
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,700
Thanks to you, I'll become the first woman living in nature.

460
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:10,769
Gosh.

461
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,900
This is fun.

462
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,779
She's out of her mind.

463
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,480
A weirdo.

464
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,690
My house feels more precious today.

465
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:48,539
The repair cost? Around 18,000 dollars.

466
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,410
Mom.

467
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:55,509
I met a really weird guy.

468
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:59,049
Listen. Like...

469
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,589
What a jerk.

470
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:08,389
He was annoying.

471
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,960
Seriously annoying.

472
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:14,829
Are you really going to sleep here?

473
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,970
For real?

474
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,410
You're not, right?

475
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:28,909
Why on earth do you sleep like a baby here?

476
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,410
You've got an unusual taste.

477
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,348
I find it really uncomfortable here.

478
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:37,990
I can't possibly sleep here.

479
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,119
Sonny.

480
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,059
Fine.

481
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,059
But we're leaving tomorrow...

482
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,829
for the hotel, okay?

483
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,839
This is all because of you.

484
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,608
- Hey, Gyeo Rye. - I'm not sleeping.

485
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:58,210
- Did I scare you? - No.

486
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:00,939
We did it.

487
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,079
Did what?

488
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,250
Gosh. Look.

489
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:09,090
We decided to push back the contract to a week.

490
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,420
See that?

491
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:15,929
There is nothing Team Genie can't do.

492
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,960
This is why I do my best.

493
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,669
We need to move early tomorrow morning,

494
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,800
so get some sleep.

495
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:27,840
I won't charge you for the bed or electricity.

496
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:30,368
You have nowhere to go anyway.

497
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,409
What?

498
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:34,280
Nowhere to go? Nonsense.

499
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:38,979
I have a room in that expensive hotel.

500
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,420
And you can't charge me for anything.

501
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,719
What are you? A thug?

502
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,340
- I'm off. - Okay.

503
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,440
I'll be back.

504
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,340
Hi.

505
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:15,519
Are you going again?

506
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:20,219
Yes.

507
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:26,428
I'm allowing you to go today since you're simply taking him...

508
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:27,559
to his old house.

509
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:30,269
But there was that car accident last time.

510
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,269
So I want you to be more mindful.

511
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:36,940
Okay.

512
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,769
He's right.

513
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,639
Don't feel pressured to do something special.

514
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,480
Everyone in this hospital is doing their best.

515
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,119
So there's no need to go all out for those patients.

516
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:49,719
We all feel the same way.

517
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,559
You're right. I know.

518
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:56,590
I'll be more careful and mindful.

519
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,329
I'm off.

520
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,599
- I'll be back. - Have a safe trip.

521
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,280
Gosh, you're already ready to go.

522
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,808
- Hey. - I'm sorry for being late.

523
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,349
- Good morning. - Are you feeling okay, sir?

524
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:26,489
Goodness, my ears hurt.

525
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:32,190
There he goes again with his awful driving skills.

526
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:35,869
That's why people need to learn.

527
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:38,828
(Transporting Patient)

528
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,768
Don't speed like with your car.

529
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:42,170
Be careful, got it?

530
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:43,670
Don't speed, okay?

531
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,880
(Pyeon Yong Ho)

532
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,949
Welcome.

533
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:09,699
- Let's carry it together. - Gosh.

534
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:21,110
(Ambulance, Transporting Patient)

535
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,849
You're happy to go home, right?

536
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:30,449
Yes.

537
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:34,420
Hey.

538
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,659
Sonny? Hey, Sonny. Are you happy too?

539
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,630
What a cutie.

540
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:50,539
(Ambulance, Transporting Patient)

541
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,170
Hey.

542
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:56,510
Drive properly, will you?

543
00:37:57,849 --> 00:37:59,849
You nag too much.

544
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,019
I'm driving properly, aren't I?

545
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:07,019
If you change lanes, you should turn on the blinker.

546
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:09,428
Gosh, I'm not a driver instructor.

547
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:10,829
Must I have to teach you?

548
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,899
There are no cars anyway. Just leave it to me.

549
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,800
You're butting in too much. Stop nagging, okay?

550
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,429
This isn't an ordinary car.

551
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,039
You punk. We have a patient at the back.

552
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,239
So be careful when you drive.

553
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:27,380
Darn it. Does it even matter?

554
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,449
He's about to croak anyway.

555
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,579
What did you just say?

556
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,820
It doesn't matter, does it?

557
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,389
- Stop the car. - What?

558
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,329
Stop the car, you jerk!

559
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:51,629
(Ambulance, Transporting Patient)

560
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,670
Get out.

561
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,670
Why?

562
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,079
Get out now.

563
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,380
What is it?

564
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,349
Seriously, what?

565
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,419
Why did you have to say it like that?

566
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,158
But I'm right. He's on the verge of passing away.

567
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,558
So what is it?

568
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:16,630
That's no way of putting it, brat.

569
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,329
"He's on the verge of passing away?"

570
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:23,530
Is there anyone who will grieve over your death?

571
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:25,530
So why are you still alive?

572
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:27,070
Why?

573
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:29,340
Darn it. Let go.

574
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,010
Who was the one who stopped me from dying?

575
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,710
It was you!

576
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,650
Why did you stop me?

577
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:44,090
You should have just let me drown. So why?

578
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:01,599
For goodness' sake.

579
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,809
What right do you have to scold me?

580
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,750
Who the heck are you to meddle in my life?

581
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:34,940
You.

582
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:39,880
If you want to complete the rest of your volunteer hours,

583
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,480
think twice before you speak.

584
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:46,519
And drive safely.

585
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:54,260
Sorry. Let's go.

586
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:56,130
It's okay. Hop in.

587
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:06,500
It's okay.

588
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,449
What are you doing? Aren't you coming?

589
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,820
Hurry up and get in the car, or we'll just leave without you.

590
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,570
(Geum Village)

591
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:51,880
It's okay. Come on in.

592
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:03,360
My gosh.

593
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,598
They even decorated this. This is so cute.

594
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,030
(Make happy memories together. From Team Genie)

595
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,969
It's very clean here.

596
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:16,340
If you don't like it here,

597
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,739
we can go on a trip with the money they gave us.

598
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,710
How about we go to Jeju Island?

599
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,150
We had so much fun the last time we went to Jeju together.

600
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:31,090
Darn it, my charger.

601
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,260
What's wrong? Did you forget something?

602
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:37,730
Darn it!

603
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,969
- Sir. - Yes.

604
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:20,969
Which room would you like?

605
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,469
Over there.

606
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:26,780
- That bed over there? - Yes.

607
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,409
All right.

608
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:39,389
- All right. I'll pull this down. - Okay.

609
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,429
Hey, can you come over here and give me a hand?

610
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:45,329
Come on.

611
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:49,500
You work out a lot. Can't you do it alone?

612
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,300
Come and help.

613
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,280
There we go.

614
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,249
Sir, if your pain gets worse, you have to tell me right away.

615
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,420
Don't hold it in.

616
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,788
I'm not in pain.

617
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:13,789
Pardon me?

618
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,159
Now that I'm back at home,

619
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,929
all my pain is gone.

620
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,130
I bet. There's no place like home.

621
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,599
Come back home. Home sweet home.

622
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:31,739
But...

623
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,139
I heard...

624
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,380
this house would be demolished.

625
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,980
Yes, they're building an apartment complex.

626
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:46,619
That persimmon tree...

627
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:50,929
used to bear so many persimmons every year.

628
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,130
- Oh, that's a persimmon tree. - Yes.

629

(Divine Sauce, made by Yeom Soon Ja)

630
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:31,170
All right, guys. Let's eat.

631
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,940
Try it.

632
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,239
Dig in.

633
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:47,780
Is it good?

634
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,219
Dong Ho, come and eat.

635
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,289
You didn't eat all day.

636
00:45:55,789 --> 00:45:57,889
I put in stir-fried bracken, your favourite.

637
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,960
You always do whatever you want.

638
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,659
I didn't even want to come here.

639
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:07,800
Why? Do you not like bibimbap?

640
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,210
- Should I order you something else? - Gosh, seriously.

641
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:13,639
Even if you do this, we can't go back to how we used to be.

642
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,908
I can't take this. Kim Dong Ho! Must you be so rude to your mother?

643
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:20,249
- What? - Honey, it's okay.

644
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,718
Can't you see that we're all trying hard to patch things up?

645
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,319
Can't you at least pretend to play along for once?

646
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,090
Or we'll all just live separately!

647
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:29,559
If you don't want to cooperate, get out!

648
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:32,030
Earn money and support yourself if you're that confident!

649
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,670
Let's eat.

650
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,488
May I help you?

651
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:06,500
Hello, Officer. I was just wondering...

652
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,598
if I could ask you some questions about the hit-and-run...

653
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:11,269
involving an imported luxury car, which took place on August 19.

654
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:14,469
A hit-and-run? In August...

655
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:17,138
- One moment, please. - Sir.

656
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:18,239
Thanks.

657
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:20,879
- Oh, right. Hey. - Yes, sir.

658
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,678
The hit-and-run with the imported car last month.

659
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:24,749
You know, the guy who ran away. Remember?

660
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,118
Well... Yes, I remember. That man who drove the ambulance.

661
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:29,919
That's right, the ambulance.

662
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,119
Oh, okay. What about it?

663
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:36,529
Well, my car was damaged in the accident too.

664
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:39,900
- I see. - But I didn't press charges.

665
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,829
- You should. - Yes.

666
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,789
Do you really not want to eat? There's a lot of food left.

667
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:26,279
Thanks for the food. I'm going to bed.

668
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,909
Yes, get some sleep. I'll tidy up.

669
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,559
I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier.

670
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,429
It's not like you've never done it before.

671
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,468
When we first met, you dragged me by my collar.

672
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:55,539
You punk. That was...

673
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:58,409
You brought it upon yourself.

674
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,050
Anyway, I'm going to bed.

675
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:18,889
Wait.

676
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:22,260
Well...

677
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:26,269
You know, the program that grants patients' wishes.

678
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,840
Aladdin or whatever it's called.

679
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:30,769
- Genie. Team Genie. - Right, Genie.

680
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:32,710
Do people...

681
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,610
have to pay for this?

682
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:37,880
Gosh.

683
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:42,179
I guess rich people only think about money.

684
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,449
No. It's 100 percent volunteer-run.

685
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:50,789
Okay.

686
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:55,960
Hold on. Why do you treat me like a rich man?

687
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,070
Wouldn't it be weird if I thought you were poor?

688
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,440
I mean, from the way you dress to how much you spend.

689
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,510
And your car too.

690
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:11,050
Most importantly, when I first met you...

691
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:14,320
Do you know what you were doing?

692
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,119
- When you first met me? - You threw money in the air.

693
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,860
Cash, 50-dollar bills at that.

694
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:22,218
You were throwing cash around...

695
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:23,960
as if you were blowing white dandelion floaties.

696
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,630
You must be loaded.

697
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,170
In any case, you need to eat something.

698
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:40,079
You can have this. It might be too late to get things delivered.

699
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,679
Wake me up before the shift handover.

700
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:46,519
I told you to eat with us.

701
00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:52,420
Why would she give me this?

702
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:57,460
These days, you can get anything delivered 24-7.

703
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,960
- Honey. - Yes?

704
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:35,158
Our Spring and that persimmon tree. Are they friends now?

705
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:36,929
Yes, they are friends.

706
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,099
When will it start getting tall?

707
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:42,439
When Spring turns three?

708
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,268
How about we name this tree Summer?

709
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:46,710
Grow nice and tall, Summer.

710
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,480
You too, Spring.

711
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,750
Be careful.

712
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,549
- You're so adorable, Hee Sook. - Hee Sook.

713
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:54,619
Look at your earring.

714
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:57,250
Look, persimmons!

715
00:51:57,449 --> 00:51:59,619
- Hurry and pick more! - You picked so many.

716
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,630
Daughter, look at this persimmon I picked.

717
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,889
It looks like you, Hee Sook.

718
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,260
How many did you pick?

719
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:10,968
Hee Sook, come here and eat.

720
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:12,670
Honey! You too.

721
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:15,840
Come and have some fritters first. Come down.

722
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,070
Sir.

723
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,380
Yes.

724
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,820
Aren't you scared?

725
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,789
What?

726
00:53:09,929 --> 00:53:10,929
Of death.

727
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:24,670
You know...

728
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:28,880
To be honest, I was afraid.

729
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,050
But you see,

730
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:43,530
life scares me even more.

731
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,329
What should I do?

732
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:16,860
Come here.

733
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,340
What is it?

734
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,860
Thank you so much...

735
00:54:51,429 --> 00:54:54,199
for driving me home.

736
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,389
Sir.

737
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:20,320
If there is anything you need,

738
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:22,690
just call me over.

739
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,599
Sir, my name is...

740
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,070
Yoon Gyeo Rye.

741
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:39,840
But you can just call me "Hey".

742
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,139
Okay.

743
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:06,800
Sonny seems to be feeling chipper today.

744
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,590
All right.

745
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:30,928
It's such a gorgeous day, isn't it?

746
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:31,960
Yes.

747
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,400
- Good morning. - Oh, you woke up.

748
00:56:41,369 --> 00:56:42,869
Did you have a good night's sleep?

749
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:49,039
(Cancel the redevelopment project!)

750
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,829
What happened? Where did those persimmons come from?

751
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,760
It's Yoon Gyeo Rye.

752
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:08,828
He was busy all night. The hustle and bustle kept me up.

753
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:09,960
I barely got any sleep.

754
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,260
Yesterday,

755
00:57:40,659 --> 00:57:44,300
Mr. Pyeon said the tree used to bear many persimmons.

756
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,369
Yoon Gyeo Rye made it after hearing that.

757
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:50,610
If he felt bad, he could've just said sorry.

758
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:56,480
I suppose he's not a total jerk after all.

759
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,280
Pick up the rest of his stuff.

760
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,820
Make sure you bring his family photo.

761
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:48,658
Seriously. Why couldn't we have taken everything at once?

762
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:50,630
Why make two trips?

763
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,809
What? Where did he go?

764
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,579
Sonny, where...

765
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:23,460
Hey, how did you even get up here?

766
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:25,969
Sonny. My goodness.

767
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,969
Hey, come here. You little troublemaker.

768
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:31,710
What are you doing here?

769
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:53,760
Don't go in.

770
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:58,630
- Sorry? - Just listen to me and don't go in.

771
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,070
Why can't I go in?

772
01:00:03,869 --> 01:00:06,039
Hold on. Is this not one of the wards?

773
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:09,639
Why is this locked?

774
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:17,090
Listen to me and don't go in. Do not ask questions.

775
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:20,250
Oh, boy. Something's very fishy here.

776
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:23,519
- Are you curious? - Yes.

777
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:40,739
(We thank Kim Shin Rock for her special appearance.)

778
01:00:51,489 --> 01:00:54,190
(If You Wish Upon Me)

779
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:58,360
Do you know why I entrusted you with that big chunk of money?

780
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,500
What would be your last message?

781
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:03,699
Be honest. You want to live.

782
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,829
What kind of miracle do you want to see happen?

783
01:01:07,139 --> 01:01:10,239
If you're in pain, scream. Otherwise, no one will know.

784
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,880
Kang Tae Sik gave us the perfect job.

785
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:17,110
Can I keep wearing the bandages?

786
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:18,849
It's okay so far.

787
01:01:19,949 --> 01:01:23,449
I want to feel happy, even just once in my life.
