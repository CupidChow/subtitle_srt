1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,600
I've already sent Ve's photo.

2
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,160
Ms. Ve.

3
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,200
<i>Still don't realize</i>
<i>you got the wrong person.</i>

4
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,960
Damn it!

5
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,400
<i>I guess I'm just too lucky to die.</i>

6
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,360
If anyone wants me dead,
I'll just keep on living.

7
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,040
<i>And I believe that</i>
<i>when Miss Gingploy wakes up,</i>

8
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,880
<i>she won't ever let the person</i>
<i>who hurt her that badly</i>

9
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,880
<i>get away with it.</i>

10
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,280
I wasn't kidnapped.
It was all a misunderstanding.

11
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,720
<i>No one was involved.</i>

12
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,920
PREVIOUSLY

13
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,760
Miss Gingploy.

14
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,760
You can't barge in
and disturb the patient.

15
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,920
It's okay.

16
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,840
Let her in.

17
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,800
If anything happens,
I'll press the call button.

18
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,080
Alright.

19
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,960
Why didn't you just tell the truth?

20
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,760
What you said out there

21
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,320
makes it almost impossible
to hold Singha accountable.

22
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,720
- I know.
- You know?

23
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,160
Are you saying

24
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,880
you won't press charges
against the person who assaulted you?

25
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,560
What are you doing here?

26
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,280
Get out of my granddaughter's room.

27
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,520
And don't ever come back.

28
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,560
There'll be no interviews,
no statements, nothing.

29
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,440
Then please excuse me.

30
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,480
So annoying.

31
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,360
Ploy, don't get involved
with the press, okay?

32
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,760
It's better if this all dies down quietly.

33
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,760
Three percent shares

34
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,160
in my father's newly opened
jewelry export company.

35
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,079
That's worth tens of millions.

36
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,839
For someone who has almost nothing left,

37
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,959
no shares,

38
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,160
no power in the company,

39
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,640
I think this is more than generous.

40
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,440
How dare you insult me like that?

41
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,120
I'm not insulting you.

42
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,960
I'm offering you a better solution.

43
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,800
Between gaining an ally

44
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,840
and making another enemy,

45
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,160
the choice is yours.

46
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,520
But if you choose to go against my father,

47
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,400
I'd say that's not a very smart decision.

48
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,360
Wouldn't you agree, Mrs. Manee?

49
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,680
Was Singha's offer
really that great, Grandma?

50
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,320
To the point you're forcing me
to let everything go

51
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,520
even though I was assaulted,

52
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,520
kidnapped,

53
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,320
nearly murdered.

54
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,680
And now I have to pretend
like nothing happened?

55
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,520
Well, nothing did happen.

56
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,080
You're still well enough
to rant at me, aren't you?

57
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,680
Honestly, Singha didn't mean to hurt you.

58
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,880
It was you who stuck your nose
into Wanvela's business.

59
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,920
Am I wrong? From now on,

60
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,800
stay out of it.

61
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,520
Do as I say,

62
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,040
and stop interfering
in other people's matters.

63
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,800
And what if something had happened to me?

64
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,640
Would you still say this, Grandma?

65
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,440
If I had died,

66
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,240
or never woken up again,

67
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,040
would you still say
I brought it on myself?

68
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,360
But nothing happened.

69
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,360
So why are you pressing me for answers?

70
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,040
I'll head off for today, Auntie.

71
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,240
Come by for a meal
with me and Nun sometime.

72
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,280
Don't think that
just because Miss Ploy didn't expose you,

73
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,080
this is all over.

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,120
It's not over yet?

75
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,040
Are you that determined
to paint me as the villain?

76
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,200
We're going to be family soon.

77
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,840
Wouldn't it be better if we all got along?

78
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,080
I'm being sincere, you know, Ms. Ve.

79
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,880
Didn't anyone teach you manners?!

80
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,280
If I had no manners,

81
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,520
I would've done much worse!

82
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,240
Stop taking it out on my guest.

83
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,840
You've ruined
so many reputations with your lies.

84
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,000
You should apologize and thank Singha

85
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,640
for not pressing charges against you.

86
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,560
I think she doesn't have to do either.

87
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,680
There's no need to apologize or thank

88
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,440
someone who intended to harm her.

89
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,200
You're still defending her

90
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,160
even after what Gingploy said publicly?

91
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
I believe what I see.

92
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,920
And soon,

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,080
he'll see it too that someone else

94
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,080
was behind the attack on me.

95
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,040
Are you poisoning my son's mind?

96
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,800
- No, Mom.
- Huh?!

97
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Why so defensive?

98
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,600
Can't you hear what she's saying?

99
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,080
She's turning you against me,

100
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,560
manipulating you to only listen to her.

101
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,800
Are you afraid that day will really come?

102
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,720
- Let go!
- Ms. Ve.

103
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,080
- Let go.
- That's enough.

104
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,600
You should be telling your mother to stop,
not me.

105
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,720
Let go!

106
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,760
Hey.

107
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,480
Mom!

108
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,000
- I can't take it anymore!
- Mrs. Sorn.

109
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,400
- Nun!
- Miss Nun.

110
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,520
- Nun.
- Nun.

111
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,120
- Nun.
- What's wrong?

112
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,960
Take her to her room.

113
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,280
Drink some juice.
It'll help you feel better.

114
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,920
I know you're not really sick.

115
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,640
I just don't get
why you had to fake fainting.

116
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,600
So what? You're going to tell everyone

117
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,160
I faked it?

118
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,000
Why would I?

119
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,760
You made Mrs. Sorn stop lashing out at me.

120
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,000
I should be thanking you, actually.

121
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,560
No need to thank me.

122
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,840
I wasn't helping you.

123
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,159
I just didn't want my mom
to stress more than she already is.

124
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,200
There's no peace in this house as it is.

125
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,799
I've always wondered

126
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,880
why you had to come live here.

127
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,840
Why ruin the lives
of everyone in this family?

128
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,200
You hate me.

129
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,760
I understand.

130
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,520
And I've never held it against you.

131
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,360
But I do want to warn you.

132
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,720
Singha is dangerous.

133
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,360
What you've seen
isn't even half of who he really is.

134
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,880
Maybe just like you,

135
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,680
hiding more viciousness than we've seen.

136
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
I'm genuinely trying to warn you.

137
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,480
Stay out of my business.

138
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,880
Just worry about yourself.

139
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,520
Now leave.

140
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,720
I said get out!

141
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,720
Miss Nun.

142
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,920
Someone might find out you faked fainting.

143
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,600
I'll leave.

144
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,840
But I hope you'll remember what I said.

145
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,000
If you can,

146
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,080
stay away from Singha.

147
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,720
And don't forget to drink this.

148
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,120
Miss Nun's okay, right?

149
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,320
It's my fault. I stressed her out so much

150
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,520
that she fainted.

151
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,800
Once she's better,
I'll let you know right away.

152
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,640
Please tell her for me
that I'm worried about her.

153
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,320
She knows that.

154
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,800
Singha,

155
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,440
can I ask you to speak with Mr. Sajja
about our businesses?

156
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,560
Even though
I can clear things up with Gingploy,

157
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,920
as for my father,

158
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,080
he's still very upset.

159
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,800
It'll take some time.

160
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,200
Helping me is like
helping Nun too, Singha.

161
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,440
The Suttha Group can't afford
to lose another project.

162
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,760
I'll do my best.

163
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
Then I'll take my leave for today.

164
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,160
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

165
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,360
The Suttha Group can't
lose another project?

166
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,960
What does that mean, Mom?

167
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,480
The truth is, we don't even need
to rely on Mr. Sajja.

168
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,280
So why are you using my sister
as a bargaining chip with Singha?

169
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,760
Or is there something about the company

170
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,440
that I don't know?

171
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,880
There is.

172
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,920
There's plenty.

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,800
Especially the massive damage

174
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,600
caused by the person you married.

175
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,520
I've tried to fix things.

176
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,720
I tried to make everything right.

177
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,800
I just want you to understand

178
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,520
and let me do what's right.

179
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,640
What you should do now is divorce her.

180
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,800
I can't do that, Mom.

181
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,720
Ki, why are you so stupid?!

182
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,920
You never should've been my son.

183
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,440
Don't forget what you promised yourself.

184
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,040
I shouldn't be caring about anyone else.

185
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,960
What happens to these people
isn't my concern.

186
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,960
Didn't you say
you were going to check on Nun?

187
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,520
I already did.

188
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,360
But she seemed perfectly fine,
and even had the energy to kick me out.

189
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,040
And your mother?

190
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,240
What do you want me to say?

191
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,240
Say the truth.

192
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,880
How does your mother feel right now
knowing she can't get rid of me?

193
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,280
Maybe I was wrong

194
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,320
to follow your way of handling things.

195
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,560
I'm trying, and you know it.

196
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,840
Just give me a little more time.

197
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,560
If I keep giving you time,

198
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,560
that just means I'm also giving your mom
more time to get rid of me, aren't I?

199
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,480
I don't want things to turn out like this.

200
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,840
You don't want to,

201
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,520
but your mom is doing
everything she can to kill me, Mr. Ki.

202
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,840
All you ever say is for me to wait,

203
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,360
and keep dragging things out.

204
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,520
But I haven't seen you do a single thing
you said you would.

205
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,000
I want to make things right.

206
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,320
I want to give everything back to you.
But the other side is my mom.

207
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,440
If it's that exhausting,
then stop pretending to be the good guy.

208
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,920
Go back to helping your mom.

209
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,920
Keep doing everything for her
like you always have.

210
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
You think everything I've done so far

211
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,600
was a lie?

212
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,480
Do you know how scared I was
when I couldn't reach you?

213
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,400
When I saw Ploy get kidnapped,
and I thought it was you,

214
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,520
do you know how terrified I was?

215
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,320
I was afraid
something would happen to you.

216
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I was afraid I'd lose you.

217
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,760
Mr. Ki.

218
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,200
Mr. Ki.

219
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,920
Why were you even afraid?

220
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,240
Did you forget
what we promised each other?

221
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,600
Once you fulfill that promise,

222
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,720
we go our separate ways.

223
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,440
I haven't forgotten

224
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,400
what we promised.

225
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,520
But I'm a human too.

226
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,480
I have feelings.

227
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,080
I have a heart.

228
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,640
That's why I care about you.

229
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,560
That's why I'm afraid of losing you.

230
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,000
But maybe you'll never understand.

231
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,560
Because your life…

232
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,680
is consumed by revenge.

233
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,680
You've thrown away your feelings

234
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,640
and your heart.

235
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,280
<i>Ki, why are you so stupid?!</i>

236
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,800
You never should've been my son.

237
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,720
Whatever I say now, you won't listen.

238
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,720
But soon, you'll realize
that she's been using you all along.

239
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,560
I don't care anymore, Mom.

240
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,160
You really think she loves you, Ki?

241
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,160
I don't know.

242
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,960
All I know is

243
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,040
I love her.

244
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,480
Then you better know this.

245
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,640
In love,

246
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,680
the one who loves first always loses.

247
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
And one day,

248
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,800
you'll be the one who gets hurt the most.

249
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,600
So in the end, I'll lose

250
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,080
and I'll be left broken, huh?

251
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,359
Hey, where are you going?

252
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,359
I came to visit.

253
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,960
Are you feeling better now?

254
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,960
Wait.

255
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,160
I want to talk to you.

256
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,520
I don't want to talk. Go home.

257
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,720
Hey.

258
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,400
Ouch!

259
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,160
Hey. I'm sorry.

260
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,080
Are you alright?

261
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,680
You tricked me?

262
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,160
Oh, come on. You tricked
the press, you tricked everyone.

263
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,160
If you want to yell at me, go ahead.

264
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,000
But I can't take back what I said.

265
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,440
Besides,

266
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,400
the whole thing is over now anyway.

267
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,640
I know

268
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,160
you had to tell the media what you did.

269
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,360
And I'm not here to make you take it back

270
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,720
or to go after Singha.

271
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,640
I came here

272
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,480
because I was worried about you.

273
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,480
Worried?

274
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,520
Who are we to each other?

275
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,240
Why do you care?

276
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,520
Even my own grandmother

277
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,920
doesn't care about me.

278
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,640
Well, I do.

279
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,200
You're just trying to comfort me.

280
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,480
No one cares about me.

281
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,680
Stop lying to me.

282
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,800
Just go.

283
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,520
Get out!

284
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,840
STAFF ONLY

285
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,720
It's just as we thought.

286
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,480
Mrs. Manee forced Miss Ploy
to say that to the reporters.

287
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,000
Singha probably offered Mrs. Manee
some kind of deal.

288
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,760
Honestly, I wish
Singha would get some punishment.

289
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,840
But at the same time,

290
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,880
I feel bad for Miss Ploy.

291
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,160
I don't want to pressure her too much.

292
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,640
Being caught in the middle must be awful.

293
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,400
But in the end,
the person behind it all walks away

294
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,880
without consequences.

295
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,080
Are you really sure

296
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,560
Aunt Sorn was the one who ordered Singha

297
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,760
to hurt you?

298
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,920
If that's really true,

299
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
then it must be hard for Ki to accept.

300
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,440
It's just like
what Miss Ploy's going through.

301
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,640
He's stuck between you and Aunt Sorn.

302
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,520
About the news, I can tell you right now
that it's not true.

303
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,520
I just hope to hear some
good news from you soon, Mr. Chain.

304
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,560
Thank you.

305
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,320
Ve.

306
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,080
Because of you,

307
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,280
I had to swallow my pride and go
beg people left and right like this.

308
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,120
Mrs. Sorn.

309
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,160
Oh, Mint,

310
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,680
you're here.

311
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,640
Why did you ask me to meet?

312
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,960
Come sit down, dear.

313
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,480
I wanted to apologize to you, Mint,

314
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,800
for what Ve did to you the other day.

315
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,080
Take this.

316
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,560
Consider it my apology.

317
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,080
Please understand me, dear.

318
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,520
You've seen for yourself
how wicked that woman is.

319
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,880
I just don't want our families
to end up in conflict because of her.

320
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,720
I've heard a bit about your situation,

321
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,720
that you've been having a hard time
after being discredited publicly.

322
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,920
My parents are still hesitant

323
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,600
about joining
the project with the Suttha Group.

324
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,640
The news that came out isn't true at all.

325
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,680
All those false rumors
came from that Ve woman.

326
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,720
I have no idea why Ki chose
a woman like that to be his wife.

327
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,680
That's why I'm so angry with him now.

328
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,920
The person I wanted
as my daughter-in-law wasn't her.

329
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,640
It was you, Mint.

330
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,160
I'll try to speak with my parents again

331
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
about the investment.

332
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,680
If I became your daughter-in-law,

333
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,920
I'd be able to help you even more.

334
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
Don't worry about Ki.

335
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,600
I'll do everything in my power to make him
divorce her as soon as possible.

336
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,640
You can be sure, Mint,

337
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,760
that the one
who truly belongs with Ki is you.

338
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,640
If you came here to see Ploy

339
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,280
in order to help her get rid of Singha,
you can forget it.

340
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,120
I'm not trying to control her.

341
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,480
She's already hurting enough

342
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,240
from being forced to lie to the press

343
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,360
so that her attacker walks free.

344
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,680
You're saying I was the one behind it?

345
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,520
Aren't you the only person

346
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,360
who could've forced her to say that?

347
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,600
That's just how the world is.

348
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,480
Not every truth can be spoken aloud.

349
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,200
Otherwise,

350
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,680
you would've already gone public

351
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,680
with your grudge against Kanisorn.

352
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,680
Even if I don't say it out loud,

353
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,000
I'll never let the guilty go unpunished.

354
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,640
Oh really?

355
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,000
Then what are you waiting for?

356
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,160
Go ahead and take action.

357
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,280
Or perhaps

358
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,960
marrying Kirin

359
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,400
dulled your hatred so much

360
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,560
that there's nothing left of it now?

361
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,000
That day will never come.

362
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,120
Then you'd better hurry and do something

363
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,080
before it's too late

364
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,320
because you'll be the one

365
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,280
that Kanisorn

366
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,480
gets rid of first.

367
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,960
I won't be the one to fall first.

368
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,320
Dad.

369
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,760
Hello, Dad.

370
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,680
Aw.

371
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,880
Why are you alone?

372
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,280
Teacher Ve isn't back yet?

373
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,480
She is, but Grandma called her for a talk.

374
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,600
You already talked to Mom, huh?

375
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,720
Why are your clothes wet?

376
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,320
Nun.

377
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,040
Are you going out?

378
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,200
Yes.

379
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,600
Mom arranged a meeting with some
Chinese investors and told me to come.

380
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,000
She's taking a shower before we leave.

381
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,920
It's almost time already.

382
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,360
Why isn't she downstairs yet?

383
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,560
Oh, right. Kita told me
Mom called Ms. Ve in to talk.

384
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,120
Were you there?

385
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,640
No, I just found out

386
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,040
Mom called Wanvela to talk.

387
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,800
What did they talk about?

388
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,680
Why don't you ask her yourself?

389
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,400
She's in the shower.

390
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,080
Then maybe I should go
check on Mom. We'll be late.

391
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,240
Or better yet,
you could go ask Mom yourself.

392
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
You'll find out
what they were talking about.

393
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,560
Mom.

394
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,360
- Mom!
- Mom!

395
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
- Mom!
- Mom!

396
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,000
- Mom!
- Mom!

397
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,600
Mom!

398
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,880
- Mom!
- Mom!

399
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,080
Mom! Mom!

400
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,240
Nun, call an ambulance!

401
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,520
- Okay.
- Mom.

402
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,360
- Mom.
- Mom!

403
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,640
Mom.

404
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,080
Mr. Ki,

405
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,920
what happened?

406
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,160
I don't know yet.
I sent Nun with the ambulance.

407
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,200
I'm about to follow.

408
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,480
Uh, Mr. Ki,

409
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,800
I'll come with you.

410
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
What happened to your hand?

411
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,320
Uh…

412
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm not sure.

413
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,920
I must've brushed against something.

414
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,480
We'd better hurry to the hospital.

415
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,000
Right.

416
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,160
Will Mom be alright?

417
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,000
Why would something like this
suddenly happen to her?

418
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,840
She's with the doctor now.
Let's not worry.

419
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,080
You're probably cursing my mom
in your head right now.

420
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,960
Nun, we don't even know
what really happened yet.

421
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,160
- This has nothing to do with her.
- How can it not have?

422
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,800
It's pretty obvious

423
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,960
how stressed Mom has been.

424
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,000
It must be just like that time
when I didn't want to live anymore.

425
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,320
Are you saying Mom…

426
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,680
Didn't you see

427
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,360
what she brought into the bathroom?

428
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,280
Mom!

429
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,120
Before the ambulance came,

430
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,960
I found this bottle in Mom's bathroom.

431
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,600
It's my medicine.

432
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,160
It wasn't because of me,

433
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,040
or because of you, Ki.

434
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,360
It was because of her.

435
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,040
- She's the reason Mom wanted to die!
- Hey.

436
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,560
Ms. Ve. Nun! Stop it.

437
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,000
Nun.

438
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,720
Now's not the time
to find someone to blame.

439
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,600
Listen to me.

440
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,640
I know you're scared

441
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,600
and worried about Mom right now.

442
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,560
But calm down first.

443
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,440
Because this

444
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,880
isn't Ms. Ve's fault.

445
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,360
Miss Nun.

446
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,840
- Miss Nun.
- Let her go.

447
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,160
Prae.

448
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,520
When I heard about Mrs. Kanisorn,
I came right away.

449
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,000
- How did you find out?
- Come on.

450
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,880
Something this big happens,
did you really think no one would talk

451
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,840
or spread the news?

452
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,760
Everyone in the inner circle
already knows.

453
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,160
I just hope my mother's condition
doesn't make it to the news.

454
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,480
I trust you won't let it

455
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,600
spread any further.

456
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,200
I came here today as Ve's friend,

457
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,760
not as a journalist.

458
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
And I have enough decency

459
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,760
to know which stories
should and shouldn't be reported.

460
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,200
Prae's not here to write about your mom.

461
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,640
Looks like Mr. Ki
doesn't really want me around here.

462
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,280
I'd better go.

463
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,240
But let me tell you first

464
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,880
I'm not the only one who knows
about your mother's situation.

465
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,040
So,

466
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,600
if this story happens to leak out,

467
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,520
it won't be from me.

468
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,480
Uh.

469
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,840
I'm sorry

470
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,920
to upset your friend.

471
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,960
Don't worry.

472
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,680
Prae won't report on it.

473
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,400
There's something I'd like to ask you.

474
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,760
What is it?

475
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,160
Kita told me

476
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,640
my mom called you in to talk.

477
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,280
What did you talk about?

478
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,400
Are you alright?

479
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,240
I'm fine.

480
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,920
Your mom called me in to talk about you.

481
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,000
Same old story,
telling me to get out of your life.

482
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,920
That's all.

483
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,000
And then?

484
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,280
Are you asking

485
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
because you think I hurt your mother?

486
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
Yes, Mint?

487
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,040
Where did you hear about my mother?

488
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,040
Nun.

489
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,360
How's Aunt Sorn doing?

490
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,440
You…

491
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,240
you knew too, Puth?

492
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,920
Yes, that's why I came.

493
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,400
What's wrong, Nun?

494
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,320
Singha's here.

495
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,160
I don't want to see him.

496
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,640
Why don't you want to see him?

497
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,240
I don't even know how Mom is doing yet.

498
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,640
I don't want to see anyone.

499
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,120
But during a time like this,

500
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,720
you shouldn't be alone.

501
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,560
I know you want someone beside you.

502
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,120
I can be alone.

503
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,080
But wouldn't it be better

504
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,000
if I stayed with you?

505
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,080
Before, whenever you were sad

506
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,440
or hurt, I was always there.

507
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,320
Puth…

508
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,480
if something happens to Mom,
I don't know what I'll do.

509
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,040
Oh?

510
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,280
Mr. Pete?

511
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,040
It's good you're here. How's Aunt Sorn?

512
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,240
I heard from Prae.

513
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,600
The doctor hasn't said anything yet.

514
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,040
Mr. Ki's on the phone,
so I was going to get him some coffee.

515
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,960
So

516
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,120
what exactly happened?

517
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,000
Mr. Ki found her
unconscious in the bathtub.

518
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,000
And Miss Nun said

519
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,000
she took sleeping pills.

520
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,840
Seems like she tried to kill herself.

521
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,560
Aunt Sorn? Suicide?

522
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,040
It looks like that.

523
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,720
I think that sounds strange.

524
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,960
There you are.

525
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,560
What do you want to talk about?

526
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,160
I want to end this once and for all.

527
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,960
Sign these papers,

528
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,120
and I'll stay out of your life and Ki's.

529
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,720
This is an agreement

530
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,960
that if you divorce Ki,

531
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,840
you'll have no claim
to any of his inheritance.

532
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,240
Then why should I sign that?

533
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,760
So, you married him for his fortune?

534
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,200
Don't be shameless.

535
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,120
You've never contributed a thing
to the Suttha Group,

536
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,040
yet you still want
what doesn't belong to you?

537
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,360
Me? I want something that isn't mine?

538
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,240
Huh? Hey.

539
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,440
What's going on here?

540
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,560
Why are you bowing to her like that?

541
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,960
Your daughter
broke the vase Mr. Terd loved.

542
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,080
It was her fault.

543
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,440
Is that true?

544
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,840
Even if it is,

545
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,440
the person she should apologize to

546
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,400
is Mr. Terd, not you.

547
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,560
What's going on?

548
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,640
My vase?

549
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,719
Mr. Terd,

550
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,719
Hathai was just being a playful child

551
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,239
and accidentally broke a vase you cherish.

552
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,800
I just taught her a lesson, but looks like

553
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,080
Mrs. Kitinee was very upset.

554
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,520
Do you even know how much that vase costs?

555
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,400
She didn't do it!

556
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,239
Come on, Nee.

557
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,239
Don't spoil her.

558
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,639
When she makes mistakes,

559
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,920
she should be disciplined.

560
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:34,280
Do you believe everything she says?

561
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,840
Whatever she tells you,
you just take her word for it.

562
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,760
She asks for company shares,
and you give them to her.

563
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,679
Sorn is still my wife

564
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,920
and the mother of my child.

565
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,120
Mr. Terd,

566
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,080
everything you've given me,

567
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,080
I never wanted it.

568
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,400
It all belongs to our child in the end.

569
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,200
You really are shameless, aren't you?

570
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,320
You've never built anything
for the Suttha Group,

571
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,760
yet you still claim what isn't yours.

572
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,000
What's the point
of arguing in front of our child?

573
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,960
Honestly,

574
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,160
you haven't done much
for the Suttha Group either.

575
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,280
When you insult me,

576
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,720
don't you feel embarrassed?

577
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,600
Because you've wanted things
that weren't yours too,

578
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,280
both people

579
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,880
and money.

580
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,960
Is that all?

581
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,560
You!

582
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,480
Uh, hey.

583
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,000
- Mrs. Sorn!
- Where are you going?

584
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,480
Mrs. Sorn! Ow!

585
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,960
I'm telling you

586
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,400
I'll never let you take a single thing

587
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,800
from this house.

588
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,480
Everything belongs to my children.

589
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,040
Ki and Nun

590
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,000
are the only rightful heirs
of the Suttha Group.

591
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,600
Heirs of the Suttha Group?

592
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,920
Are you sure about that?

593
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,040
Everyone knows Mr. Ki
is just Mr. Terd's stepson,

594
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,760
not a true heir of the Suttha Group.

595
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,760
And as for your daughter,

596
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,960
you know exactly who her real father is.

597
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,000
Don't you dare speak nonsense!

598
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,760
Nonsense?

599
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,480
Do you have any proof
that what I said isn't true?

600
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,240
I told you to watch your mouth!

601
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,160
Are you afraid of the truth so much
you've gone crazy?

602
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,480
Crazy?!

603
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,880
Huh?!

604
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,160
Crazy?!

605
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,720
You…

606
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,200
- You!
- Ouch!

607
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,560
- You!
- Mrs. Sorn, that hurts!

608
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,120
Ouch!

609
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,960
Ugh!

610
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,920
- You! You!
- Ah!

611
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,720
- You… You! You!
- Mrs. Sorn.

612
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,000
Die now!

613
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,320
Die now!

614
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,880
<i>What are you thinking about?</i>
<i>Or are you also wondering</i>

615
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,440
<i>why this whole situation feels so strange?</i>

616
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,520
Because of you,

617
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,800
Mom ended up like this!

618
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,040
Miss Nun!

619
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,880
You!

620
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,680
- Hey.
- <i>Ki's so blinded by that woman,</i>

621
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,800
<i>he's forgotten I'm his sister.</i>

I want to trust him

624
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,720
the way I trust you, Prae.

625
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,480
<i>You know,</i>

626
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,480
<i>when you trust someone too much,</i>

627
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,840
<i>it hurts so badly</i>

628
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,040

<i>who you thought they were.</i>
