1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,720
<i>I'd like to invite Mrs. Kanisorn</i>
<i>to personally present</i>

2
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,840
<i>the necklace set.</i>

3
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,040
<i>I'll offer three million.</i>

4
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,160
Someone at your level
wouldn't want to turn that down.

5
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm afraid I can't sell it back to you.

6
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,840
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,560
- Give me back my necklace.
- Mom. Mom.

8
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,880
<i>Don't think pinning the blame</i>
<i>on a scapegoat</i>

9
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,720
<i>will get you off the hook.</i>

10
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,920
Who are you?

11
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,040
<i>Twenty million. Cash.</i>

12
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,720
<i>I'll handle the rest.</i>

13
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
PREVIOUSLY

14
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,920
Ki?

15
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
Ki.

16
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,880
Why did you do this to me?

17
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,200
Do you realize

18
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,440
that if I go to the police,
this matter will escalate beyond control?

19
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,920
You wouldn't dare go to the police.

20
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,520
If you did that,

21
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,040
the fact that your guy

22
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
hired someone
to give false testimony about the fire

23
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,480
would also come out.

24
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,560
So you're blackmailing me?

25
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,160
I didn't do this.

26
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,120
You came here to get the money yourself,

27
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,200
and you're still saying you didn't?

28
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,160
Someone sent me messages,

29
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,080
and even called me.

30
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,920
- He's there.
- Uncle.

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,320
Did you really start the fire?

32
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,560
I did it.

33
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,600
I didn't mean to.

34
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
Who are you?

35
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,320
<i>You don't need to know.</i>
<i>If you want the truth,</i>

36
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,200
<i>just follow the place and time I sent.</i>

37
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,960
I came here
because I wanted to know the truth.

38
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,640
And it seems like this mysterious person

39
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,880
wasn't lying.

40
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,840
I was just playing along,
to find out who it was.

41
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,840
And yet he dares summon you here too?

42
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,840
Hurry.

43
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,200
And what about the video clip I saw?
What was that all about?

44
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
If it weren't true,

45
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,000
you wouldn't have risked this much money,
would you?

46
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,680
What?

47
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,920
GUEST STAR: RAMIDA TEERAPAT

48
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,240
It's done, sis.

49
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,360
Thanks.

50
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,320
Mom, are you really
going to let it end like this?

51
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,880
And what else do you want from me?

52
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,000
I have to protect
the company's reputation.

53
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,200
As it is, the company hardly has
any credit left.

54
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,000
So all this time,
whenever the company had problems,

55
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,800
you've always just shifted
the blame away like this?

56
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,360
Whatever benefits the company, I must do.

57
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,960
Sooner or later,
this company will be yours.

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,480
Everything I've done,

59
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,240
I've done for your future, our future.

60
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,680
And

61
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,320
what about the people
who suffer from our work, Mom?

62
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,680
I've donated money already, haven't I?

63
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,440
What more do they want from me?

64
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,840
And now I've lost another 20 million.

65
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,880
That should be enough, shouldn't it?

66
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Or what?

67
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,360
Do you think those worthless people
matter more than your own mother?

68
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,640
You really want to fight for them, do you?

69
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,720
Go then.

70
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,760
Expose the truth.

71
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,720
Let the police arrest your own mother.
Go on!

72
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
Are you still not asleep?

73
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,320
I'm not sleepy yet.

74
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,960
You're not even going to ask me once

75
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,920
why I came back at this hour?

76
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,080
Even if I asked,

77
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,200
you wouldn't tell me the truth anyway.

78
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,120
And right now,
I'd rather be alone with my thoughts.

79
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,840
So you have other problems on your mind,

80
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,360
besides keeping watch on people
you're always suspicious of, right?

81
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,480
You're not just good

82
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,680
at analyzing children, are you?

83
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,600
I can handle kids with problems.

84
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,920
But with adults,

85
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,760
I might be able to help a little too.

86
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,920
And how would you help me?

87
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,080
By listening. By sitting by your side,

88
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,640
until that adult feels better.

89
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,799
Unless he pushes me away first.

90
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,040
Are you having trouble with Mrs. Sorn?

91
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,560
I have many disagreements with my mother.

92
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,640
Whenever I think differently,

93
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,240
she pressures me to give in

94
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,240
with the same old words.

95
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,080
"Everything I do is for you."

96
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,800
Mom.

97
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Why do we have to live
in someone else's house?

98
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,520
Why do you let people

99
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,280
call you…?

100
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,720
A mistress?

101
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,360
Ki.

102
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,160
The reason I brought you here,

103
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,120
and endured people calling me a mistress,

104
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,440
was for you and your sister.

105
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,880
From now on,

106
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,480
whether it's this house,

107
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,000
or everything of Liangsuttha,

108
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,720
it will all belong to you, Ki.

109
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,440
But I've always resisted in my heart.

110
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,560
Do I really deserve everything
the way my mother claims

111
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,720
when it once belonged to someone else?

112
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,880
You're talking about

113
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,640
Mr. Terdthong's daughter, aren't you?

114
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,000
Hathai.

115
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,360
She should have had
everything I have today,

116
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,720
if she were still alive.

117
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,280
And if Hathai were still here,
sitting beside you right now,

118
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,000
what would you want to tell her?

119
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,840
I wish she were still here.

120
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,960
I'd give everything back to her.

121
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,520
Even the happiness she once had,

122
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,800
before my mother and I came here.

123
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,440
If only I had been old enough back then

124
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,880
to understand what was happening…

125
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,120
Hathai wouldn't
have had to leave this house.

126
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,200
Wouldn't have faced those tragedies.

127
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,640
Wouldn't have had to meet her end.

128
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,840
It's all my fault.

129
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,600
It isn't your fault.

130
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,560
Because if Hathai were here right now,

131
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,040
she wouldn't blame you either.

132
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,800
At a time like that, neither you nor she

133
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,880
could have changed anything.

134
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,640
I think you'd better rest now.

135
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,320
Wait.

136
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,760
Yes?

137
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,880
Mr. Ki.

138
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,360
Please get a hold of yourself.

139
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,160
I'm not Hathai.

140
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,040
Mom, you haven't gone
into the meeting yet, right?

141
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,800
Not yet. What is it?

142
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,760
Have you seen this clip?

143
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,920
What clip?

144
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,160
<i>We must thank the Suttha Group</i>
<i>so very much</i>

145
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,920
<i>for helping us this much.</i>

146
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,560
<i>Please extend our thanks</i>
<i>to all the executives.</i>

147
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,280
Mrs. Sorn, have you seen the clip?

148
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,520
Mm.

149
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,680
People from the community
are here at the office now.

150
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,240
They want to thank us personally
for the aid money.

151
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,400
In the clip, they said
the houses that burned

152
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,040
each received
several hundred thousand baht.

153
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,720
Mom, you arranged this?
Why didn't I hear about it?

154
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,400
Didn't you say
you'd give the money quietly?

155
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,080
Why let Kanisorn get all the credit?

156
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,760
It was their money to begin with.

157
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,640
Unless you've softened toward someone.

158
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,680
What are you talking about?

159
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,480
I don't know.

160
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
They say

161
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,240
when you get too close to someone,
your heart tends to weaken.

162
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,600
So, you're not going to let me
throw myself a birthday party?

163
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,640
Hm?

164
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,040
Just going to the temple
to make merit is enough, Mom.

165
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,920
You've had too many scandals lately.

166
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,640
If you hold another big party,

167
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm afraid more trouble will come.

168
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,680
At least there will still be guests

169
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,240
at the temple event.

170
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,720
I still need photos for social media.

171
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,160
Please, just keep it quiet this year, Mom.

172
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,440
Right now your luck is bad.
Don't force anything.

173
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,160
Me? Unlucky?

174
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,680
Here's proof.

175
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,360
Even when you're just going to the temple,
it's a bad omen.

176
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,840
That's fake.

177
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,440
It's not even a real gecko.
It's Kita's toy.

178
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,280
Kita!

179
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,720
And still, no gifts?

180
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,120
No cards? Nothing for me this year?

181
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,120
Every year they've already arrived by now.

182
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,720
Someone sent you a package, Mrs. Sorn.

183
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,560
See?
Someone finally sent you a birthday gift.

184
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Who sent it?

185
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,880
I don't know.

186
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,040
The delivery man didn't say anything,
just that it had to be given to you.

187
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,800
Just take a look at the card, Mom.

188
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,440
"Happy Birthday."

189
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,080
No signature.

190
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,080
This…

191
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,040
Who dares send something like this to you?

192
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,280
It's clearly a curse.

193
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,640
Was this your doing?

194
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,560
No, it wasn't.

195
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,400
If you don't believe me, ask Aunt Kob.

196
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,280
She was with me when I received it.

197
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,520
Oh?

198
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,520
Mrs. Sorn, what happened?

199
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,720
Is that…?

200
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,280
Find out immediately

201
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,960
who sent me this vile package.

202
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,920
Yes.

203
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,960
Who sent this?

204
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,320
What now?

205
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,000
If I find out

206
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,760
it was you who sent it,

207
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,040
you'll be thrown
out of this house for sure.

208
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,840
Is something wrong, Miss Ve?

209
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,400
Mr. Pat just asked me about those things.

210
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,240
So, you're done here?

211
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,200
Did he hurt you?

212
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,160
No. Excuse me.

213
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,599
Wait.

214
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,960
Where are you taking that?

215
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,480
I'm going to throw it away.

216
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,160
If someone sent this kind of thing
on her own birthday,

217
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,160
Mrs. Sorn wouldn't want to keep it.

218
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,960
I'll throw it away myself.

219
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,880
Don't throw away my stuff.

220
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,760
Oh, hey.

221
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,200
Hey, Kita.

222
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,840
Promise me you won't use this
to prank anyone again, alright?

223
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,120
Excuse me, I need to take this.

224
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,760
I know now

225
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,640
who sent that package to you.

226
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,480
Who was it?

227
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,240
Oh, it could only be one person right now.

228
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,040
The one drowning in scandals.

229
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,880
- Hm.
- No wonder

230
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,080
she didn't dare
throw a birthday party this year.

231
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,480
But we don't care.

232
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,360
We don't want to get involved.

233
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
We're afraid
of being dragged into the mess.

234
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,360
I only pity poor Mr. Terd.

235
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,400
He built the Suttha Group
with his own hands,

236
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,480
only to see it rot because of a mistress.

237
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,400
That's what people say.

238
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,040
No matter how much gold
you smear on a rotting corpse,

239
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,760
- you can't cover the stench.
- Yes.

240
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,760
True.

241
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,880
When we die, we all rot.

242
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,240
Not just me,

243
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,600
you all can rot too.

244
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,800
But some people start rotting
even while they're still alive.

245
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,040
They say tea leaves can cover bad smells.

246
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,800
But just sipping isn't enough.

247
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,360
You have to drink the whole pot.

248
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,760
- Hey.
- What?

249
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,120
How dare you treat me like this.

250
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,720
I can do far worse than this
to you gossiping nobodies.

251
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,880
You want more?!

252
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,040
I think you should all leave.

253
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,280
Don't give people more reason to gossip.

254
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,600
You don't need to flare up like that.

255
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,640
You'll still see each other in society.

256
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,320
Well, I'm not like you,
so good at hiding my true nature.

257
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,200
Honestly,

258
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,120
you should be punished more than anyone.

259
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,880
Me?

260
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,040
I already know
you sent that package to me.

261
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,080
What do you want? Why curse me like that?

262
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Your people investigate well.

263
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,360
I only wanted you
to remember my dead granddaughter

264
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,320
on your special day.

265
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,360
After making merit to clear your sin,

266
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,040
you should also dedicate it
to my granddaughter

267
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,760
to repay
that she transferred all her shares

268
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,760
to Kirin, your son.

269
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,120
If that's all you came for, you can leave.

270
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,560
I have other meetings.

271
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,960
Mrs. Sorn?

272
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,200
You actually called her here too?

273
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,040
Yes.

274
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,000
I invited Teacher Ve myself.

275
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,840
Well, well.

276
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,400
Acting all innocent, pretending
not to know who sent me that package,

277
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,360
but you were in it
with Mrs. Manee all along.

278
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,440
I really knew nothing.

279
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,720
I caught you red-handed,
and you still have the nerve to deny it?

280
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,680
What?

281
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,240
Was Ki's payment

282
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,200
- not enough for you?
- Hey!

283
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,640
Mrs. Sorn!

284
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,400
You!

285
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,520
You dare? Huh?

286
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,400
Even if I'm your employee,

287
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,520
you have no right to lay hands on me.

288
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,240
And about that package,
I had nothing to do with Mrs. Manee.

289
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,080
Please understand that.

290
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,080
This is going too far, Mrs. Sorn.

291
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,480
I called Teacher Ve here
to talk about Kita

292
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,560
as his great-grandmother.

293
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,240
She has nothing to do with this.

294
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,680
You've jumped to wild conclusions.

295
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,440
Why did you do this, Mrs. Manee?

296
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,520
Sending that mysterious gift,

297
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,360
then calling me here too?

298
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,040
I did it for my granddaughter.

299
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,120
So Kanisorn wouldn't forget
what she did to Ging.

300
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,640
You knew already, didn't you,

301
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,280
that Mrs. Kanisorn would be here?

302
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,400
And still you called me?

303
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,520
You're making her suspicious of me.

304
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,520
So, do you still want my help or not?

305
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,880
Of course.

306
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,920
And I want you to hurry up
with the work for me too.

307
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,640
Move faster, Teacher Ve,

308
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,120
before you get kicked out of that house.

309
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,440
Mom,

310
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,520
where did you just go?

311
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,040
I went to deal with those people
who tried to get under my skin.

312
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,360
- And I even ran into that Teacher Ve.
- Mom.

313
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,440
Please don't throw a tantrum now.

314
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,800
What is it with you?

315
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,640
Oh.

316
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,080
- Oh! Wiputh.
- Hello, Auntie.

317
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Hello, dear.

318
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,880
Well, what brings you here?

319
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,120
Puth just got back
from a work trip in Europe.

320
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,840
As soon as he landed, he called me
and said he wanted to come visit.

321
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,120
I brought souvenirs
and a belated birthday gift for you.

322
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,800
Thank you, dear.

323
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,800
I heard you didn't throw
a birthday party this year?

324
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,080
That's right.

325
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,560
There's been
so much trouble with the company.

326
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,960
I had no heart to host any celebration.

327
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,920
I did hear some news myself.

328
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,680
Hopefully not the wrong kind of news.

329
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,320
No, not at all.

330
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,840
Nun told me that you've helped
the community in need

331
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,400
with as much as 20 million baht.

332
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,320
Yes, that's right.

333
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,360
But there are still people
whispering behind my back.

334
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,800
And the rumors just won't die down.

335
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,800
If only I had connections
in the media world, like your family does,

336
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,520
then I wouldn't be bullied like this.

337
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,640
I'll talk to my father for you

338
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,760
and see how we can manage the news.

339
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,880
Thank you, Wiputh.

340
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,800
Seeing how good you are to me and to Nun,

341
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,320
I feel assured
about entrusting my daughter to you.

342
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,640
It would be nice if we had
some good news between you two soon,

343
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,520
to drown out all these bad rumors.

344
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,200
Actually,

345
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,800
I have been thinking about that myself.

346
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,400
Mom,
maybe we should talk about that later.

347
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,040
Mrs. Manee is quite ruthless, isn't she?

348
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,600
Ugh.

349
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,960
Who'd want to help
after she pulled a stunt like that?

350
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,240
By the way,

351
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,320
I gave you the number of the doctor
who treated Ms. Ging.

352
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,360
Did you contact him?

353
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,440
I got the number of the doctor
who took care of Ms. Gingyok.

354
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,120
I tried to call him,

355
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,760
but the hospital said
Dr. Wichan already resigned

356
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,480
and went abroad for research work.

357
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,280
No one knows when he'll be back.

358
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,280
So how will we track him down?

359
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,840
Mr. Pete said he'd help follow up.

360
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,840
But if we can't find Dr. Wichan,

361
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,720
and you don't have any information
to give Mrs. Manee,

362
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,880
what will you do?

363
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,960
Hello, Mr. Pete. What is it?

364
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,320
You've found Dr. Wichan?

365
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,480
<i>Dr. Wichan's coming to meet me for work.</i>

366
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,440
<i>You'll need to be there before noon.</i>

367
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,080
I hear you're heading to Pete's school?

368
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,360
I was going to discuss
Kita with him as well.

369
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,320
Get in the car. We can go together.

370
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,640
Or are you uncomfortable
going to see him with me?

371
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Do you have secrets?

372
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
No. I don't.

373
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,400
I guess I'm not the only one

374
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,440
that Teacher Ve tries to get close to.

375
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,120
I believe you can see now

376
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,120
why I was deceived, right?

377
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,000
You said you had nothing to hide.
Yet riding here with me,

378
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,120
you've looked uneasy the whole time.

379
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,920
I'm a friend of Ki's.

380
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,080
I just wanted to ask you…

381
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,160
What's wrong?

382
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,160
Uh… I'm feeling stomach pain.

383
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,800
I'll go to the infirmary
for some medicine first.

384
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,880
Oh, Mr. Ki. You came to see Mr. Pete?

385
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,920
- Yes.
- Ah, Mr. Pete just finished his meeting.

386
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,480
Please, this way.

387
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,360
Doctor.

388
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,400
You are…?

389
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,320
Hello.

390
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,840
I'm a friend of Ms. Gingyok,
Mrs. Manee's granddaughter.

391
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,040
I'd like to speak to you personally.

392
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,280
Well,

393
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,320
Mr. Ki.

394
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,040
Yes?

395
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,480
Teacher Ve asked me to tell you
she had to leave early.

396
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,760
- She already left?
- Yes.

397
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,920
Kita, didn't you promise me
you wouldn't use this to scare others?

398
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,600
I will have to take it away.

399
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,360
But you aren't scared.

400
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,120
I'm not scared, but others are,

401
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,000
your grandma, your Aunt Nun, Aunt Kob.

402
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,800
Give it here, right now.

403
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,080
Hm?

404
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,400
Hey, Kita, hand it over.

405
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,680
Come on, quickly.

406
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,800
Kita.

407
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,600
Stop there.
Where do you think you're going?

408
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,080
Come here, come here.

409
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,000
You little rascal. Give it to me.

410
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,480
Hm?

411
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,520
Dad.

412
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,840
Hey.

413
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,200
- Were you teasing Teacher Ve?
- No.

414
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,040
Then,

415
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,360
put your toy away.
I'll take you out for a treat.

416
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,120
- How about ice cream?
- Yes.

417
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,440
Come on then, put it away.

418
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,920
Did you just take a photo of me?

419
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,320
Please delete it.

420
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,720
I don't feel comfortable
being photographed

421
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,360
without permission.

422
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,000
A rare smile like that,
how could I delete it?

423
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,520
Someone claimed to have a stomach pain

424
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,680
but then sneaked back

425
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,600
and laughed so freely with my son.

426
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,000
I needed to keep proof.

427
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,680
Well, I felt better.

428
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,960
So I came to watch over Kita.

429
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,640
Besides, I asked
Teacher Ying to tell you I'd gone home.

430
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,640
Still, please delete it.

431
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,520
I did.

432
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,480
Though I regret not keeping
a memory of you smiling easily,

433
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,520
being carefree,

434
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,440
not hiding everything inside.

435
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,120
I suppose only Kita

436
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,680
gets to see the real you.

437
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,480
Because Kita and I are alike, maybe.

438
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,840
People who've been wounded, and forced
to build walls to protect themselves

439
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,080
would feel safe to be with one another.

440
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,080
Then I must be like that too,

441
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,480
because I feel calmer

442
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,560
every time I'm close to you.

443
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,640
Ki.

444
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,200
Mom.

445
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,000
Even if you're in the house,

446
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,200
you shouldn't be alone with her.

447
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,840
Is that why you called me here?

448
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,840
The reason I was talking to Miss Ve
was because I was waiting

449
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,400
for Kita to put his toy away,
and then I'll take him out.

450
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,640
But I don't trust her.

451
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,400
Avoid her if you can.

452
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,280
I don't want what happened
with Pat to happen to you.

453
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,600
You don't need to worry, Mom.

454
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,960
I'm not reckless or lustful

455
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,120
like a certain someone.

456
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,160
I didn't call you here to argue.

457
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,280
Then let's not talk about this again.

458
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,400
If there's nothing else,

459
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,520
I'll take Kita out now.

460
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
Wait.

461
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,400
There's something else
I need your help with.

462
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,920
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY

463
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,400
Um, so

464
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,320
what do Kita's drawings
and your father's blood test results

465
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,360
have to do with Ms. Gingyok's illness?

466
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,800
Ms. Gingyok and Dad
both had heart disease.

467
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,720
Mm.

468
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,720
And before Dad passed away,

469
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,480
his blood tests

470
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,400
showed very high potassium levels,

471
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,760
which made his heart condition worse.

472
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,880
Don't tell me…

473
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,000
I already knew Ging had a heart condition.

474
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,200
The car accident happened
because she had a sudden heart attack.

475
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,520
I was looking after her case.

476
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,160
Her condition had been stable.

477
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,440
She consulted

478
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,920
the hospital nutritionist regularly
about her diet plan.

479
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,200
But still, the incident happened.

480
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,160
And did Ging have any other problems?

481
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,960
Lately she seemed stressed.

482
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,160
She once vented to me

483
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,600
that she felt uneasy
about the company shares

484
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,840
and about her mother-in-law.

485
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,760
That's why I suspect

486
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,280
what happened to Dad
and to Ms. Gingyok might be the same.

487
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,800
Patients whose conditions were stable,

488
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,880
suddenly collapsing.

489
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,520
Was it Kanisorn's doing?

490
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,040
It's beautiful.

491
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,680
Nun will love it.

492
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,480
I've had everything prepared already.

493
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,680
A surprise like this,

494
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,920
are you sure Nun will be okay with it?

495
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,040
Of course she will be.

496
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,360
She's just been playing hard to get
saying she doesn't want to get married.

497
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,560
Don't worry about it.

498
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,480
Ki should be bringing her back here soon.

499
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,800
You can get ready.

500
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,400
Yes, Auntie.

501
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,120
Are you sure this is really a surprise,

502
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,400
and not forcing Miss Nun's hand?

503
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,640
This is my family's business.

504
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,240
It's nothing to do with you.

505
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,159
Why's the house so dark, Ki?

506
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,760
There's no one here.

507
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,040
Where did they all go?

508
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,600
Nun, please marry me.

509
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,320
I love you, but…

510
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,400
I don't like being cornered like this.

511
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,600
And

512
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,160
I've already told you many times,
let's not talk about marriage now.

513
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,840
Why?

514
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,800
I don't want to rush into marriage
just because

515
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,400
I've found someone as perfect as you.

516
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,120
It's because I don't want

517
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,040
people thinking

518
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,920
I'm clinging onto you for advantage.

519
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,200
I want to be someone perfect for you too.

520
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,000
That's nonsense, Nun.

521
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,840
I will not marry

522
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,280
for anyone's benefit.

523
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,280
Nun. Nun!

524
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,640
I'll be leaving now.

525
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,040
Oh?

526
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,040
Wiputh.

527
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,200
Wiputh, wait.

528
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,120
Well…

529
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,560
Ki.

530
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,760
You're not going to help me
talk to your sister?

531
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,840
There's nothing I can do, Mom.

532
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,000
I can't force Nun's heart.

533
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,080
Are you kidding me?

534
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,560
Wiputh proposed and you rejected him?

535
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,960
And you even argued with your mom?

536
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,880
I have to praise you, Nun,

537
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,240
for rejecting the proposal

538
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,240
of a man as perfect as Wiputh.

539
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,040
Cheers to that. Bottoms up.

540
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,840
Kita's asleep.

541
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,040
Good.

542
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,200
I need to talk to you.

543
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,160
Play it.

544
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,240
I was afraid they'd notice me,

545
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,960
so I didn't get too close.

546
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,320
I didn't hear
what they were talking about.

547
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,360
I'll keep the video myself.
Don't worry about it.

548
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,920
<i>Even without sound,</i>

549
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,160
I tried to piece together
what you and Pete were talking about.

550
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,360
Because if I asked,

551
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
neither of you would tell me the truth.

552
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,880
And do you think doing this

553
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,960
isn't a violation of someone's privacy?

554
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,880
If something is suspicious here,

555
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,480
I need to find out the truth.

556
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,400
From watching the clip many times,

557
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,440
I know you and Pete
were talking about your father.

558
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,400
Yes, Nun?

559
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,800
<i>Ki…</i>

560
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,960
I hit someone with my car.

561
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,600
I don't know if she's dead.

562
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,600
Please help me.

563
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,880
Ki, help me. Where are you?

564
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,640
<i>No matter what it takes,</i>

565
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,400
Nun must not be implicated.

566
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,640
<i>Mom said</i>

567
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,000
<i>if I get married,</i>
<i>this whole mess will end.</i>

568
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,840
<i>What they've covered up</i>

569
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,880
<i>will haunt them</i>

570
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,040
<i>until they get</i>
<i>the punishment they deserve.</i>

571
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,680
What? The police are coming here?

572
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,360
Miss Nunnalin, please come
to the station for further questioning.

573
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,320
Please come see Miss Nun.

574
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,240
- What? Nun!
- Nun.

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,040

- Nun!

577
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,040
Nun.
