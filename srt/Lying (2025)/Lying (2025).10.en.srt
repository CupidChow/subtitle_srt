1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,160
<i>Without Teacher Rawee, I wouldn't be</i>
<i>in New Zealand with my adoptive parents.</i>

2
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,320
<i>Who could've known that when I came back</i>
<i>she would be sick like this.</i>

3
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,480
<i>You want me to kidnap Kita?</i>

4
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,960
<i>Make Kita disappear for a few hours.</i>

5
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,280
<i>After this, he'll definitely fire her.</i>

6
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,800
<i>I saw the culprit</i>
<i>get into Mr. Napat's car.</i>

7
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,120
Don't you know
she’s lied about everything,

8
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,640
even her own background?

9
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,120
<i>Is the person I told you to find here?</i>

10
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,560
<i>Yes.</i>

11
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,920
PREVIOUSLY

12
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,160
Who is she, Mom?

13
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,800
The one who knows the teacher
you hired to take care of Kita best.

14
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,000
I found out that
before she worked with Pete,

15
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,520
Teacher Ve had once
written her own background

16
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,560
when volunteering at a shelter,

17
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,360
saying she used to be under the care
of the Baan Sukkwan Foundation.

18
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,840
Baan Sukkwan?

19
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,160
That orphanage?

20
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,080
Yes, the orphanage Hathai used to stay in.

21
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,680
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

22
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,160
- Or could Hathai not be dead after all?
- Impossible.

23
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,080
I personally checked that teacher's home.

24
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,360
She really did die.

25
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,520
What do you want from me?

26
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,600
Please have a seat.

27
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,520
There's something I'd like to ask you.

28
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,280
Two days ago,

29
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
I heard there was a fire at the orphanage.

30
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,279
I'd like to know
if this child is still safe.

31
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,480
What's your relationship to the child?

32
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,960
Hathai is a distant relative of mine.

33
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,240
Her mother was murdered by a thief.

34
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,480
I just learned the news

35
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,880
that she was put under your care.

36
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,680
I'm sorry to hear that.

37
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,880
Hathai passed away the night of the fire.

38
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,680
Really?

39
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,080
If you'd like to see the documents,
I can get them.

40
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,120
The documents say Hathai died.
I saw it with my own eyes.

41
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,280
I went to check myself.

42
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,560
There's no way I got it wrong.

43
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,280
Teacher Ve might've just been
another kid from that orphanage.

44
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,440
Or maybe she's pretending
that she was in the orphanage

45
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,240
just to get the job at the shelter.

46
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,520
I heard

47
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,520
she even managed the finances there.

48
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,720
She could've faked
her background to gain benefits.

49
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,200
Then check it thoroughly.

50
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,240
Find out whether
she actually lived there or made it up,

51
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,240
so I'll know how to deal with her.

52
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,240
Then we'll need Teacher Rawee,
who used to work there,

53
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,040
to verify it.

54
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
I happened to get this document.

55
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,280
Miss Ve filled in her background,

56
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,920
saying you used to be
under Baan Sukkwan's care.

57
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,840
But why didn't you include that

58
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,120
when she applied here?

59
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,160
So what?

60
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,760
What's wrong with leaving it out?

61
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,240
Someone who hides, lies,
and keeps altering her background

62
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,760
is no different from a fraudster.

63
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,040
Mrs. Sorn's really concerned
about her grandson, Mr. Ki.

64
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,000
You can't let someone
with a shady past stay near Kita.

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,160
Mrs. Sorn's very uncomfortable.

66
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,480
And I've been falsely accused

67
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,280
twice by someone with no credibility.

68
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,280
You should be suspicious by now.

69
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
So everything you're doing…

70
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,120
You're trying to say I framed you
for kidnapping Kita, aren't you?

71
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,400
You were being suspicious,

72
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,400
Teacher Ve.

73
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,200
To clear things up, I brought someone
who used to work at the orphanage

74
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,920
to confirm whether
she really lived at Baan Sukkwan.

75
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,440
Please tell us.

76
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,600
Did a girl named Wanvela

77
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,640
ever live under your care, ma'am?

78
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,760
I remember every child from Baan Sukkwan.

79
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,680
No matter how much time passes,

80
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,520
I still remember them.

81
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,880
But I've never seen this girl.

82
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,360
There was no child
named Wanvela at Baan Sukkwan.

83
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,240
Teacher…

84
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,040
Teacher.

85
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,080
Ah.

86
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,120
I told you to not come back here again.

87
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,000
It's dangerous.

88
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,040
Run away, Hathai.

89
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,520
Why did you lie
about living at Baan Sukkwan?

90
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,280
Why did you do it?

91
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,840
Why did you lie?

92
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
See?

93
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,640
You really are a fraud,

94
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,760
changing your profile everywhere. Ki.

95
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,880
I won't let her look after Kita anymore.

96
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,240
I'm firing her.

97
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,560
But from what I know,
Teacher Rawee is sick.

98
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,320
She might be confused about the past.

99
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,480
Even if I'm sick,
I remember every child there.

100
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,200
Or are you arguing
that you really were in her orphanage?

101
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,480
If so, show me proof.

102
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Well?

103
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,159
If not, then get out of my house.

104
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,000
Before I call the police

105
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,120
and charge you with fraud.

106
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,040
And I'll sue Pete's school too

107
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,240
for sending someone like you here.

108
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,640
Fine. I resign.

109
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,440
I'll drive you.

110
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,040
It's okay. I can go on my own.

111
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,600
Teacher Ve, where are you going?
I won't let you go.

112
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,240
No, Kita.

113
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
She has to go now.

114
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
No. I won't let her.

115
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,120
Kita.

116
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,480
Even if I'm not here anymore,

117
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,840
that doesn't mean
we won't see each other again.

118
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,760
Really?

119
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,160
Yes.

120
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,600
As long as you remember
everything between us,

121
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,920
I'll always be here
and here with you.

122
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,840
Here and here?

123
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,440
Yes.

124
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,960
I'm going now.

125
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,080
Aunt Kob, what are you doing?

126
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,920
Mrs. Sorn told me to.

127
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,600
I told someone to wash
the front of the house

128
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,240
so everything dirty would be clean again.

129
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,960
Consider it a big cleaning day.

130
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,960
Mr. Ki, please take Kita inside.

131
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,000
He might be contaminated
standing out here.

132
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,040
Mother, Miss Ve is already leaving.

133
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,680
Please, let's not create
more drama in this house.

134
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,080
Alright, dear.
You still have to go to work.

135
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,680
I won't do anything to distract you.

136
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,920
Take Kita inside.

137
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,160
Let's go, Kita.

138
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,000
Come on.

139
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,440
As for you,

140
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,280
since you tried your best
to take care of Kita,

141
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,120
I'll let you leave this house

142
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,560
with nothing owed between us.

143
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,720
And I hope we never meet again.

144
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,080
I can't promise

145
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,520
whether we'll meet again or not.

146
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,120
What do you mean by that?

147
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,880
Have you ever heard this saying?

148
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,480
"The more you hate, the more you meet.
What you hate, you attract."

149
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,480
You…

150
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,040
I'll be going now.

151
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,880
I was wondering where Teacher went.

152
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,280
Turns out they brought her there.

153
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,640
- Yeah.
- But

154
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,520
when she came back,
she said she didn't remember anything.

155
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,200
But I think when she saw me,
she remembered everything.

156
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,600
Because she tried to help me
and told me it was dangerous there.

157
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,880
Maybe her mind is a bit unstable,

158
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,600
or maybe she just didn't want Im to know.

159
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,240
But in the end,
I had to leave that house anyway.

160
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,560
I don't want Kanisorn
to keep suspecting me.

161
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,960
Good. Because back then,

162
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,720
Teacher showed the document
about your death to Napat.

163
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,320
I think if Kanisorn keeps digging,

164
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,200
she might find out the truth about you.

165
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,240
Hm.

166
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,000
Anyway, go home for today.

167
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,760
Just put your luggage in my car.

168
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,760
When I finish work,
let's discuss what to do next.

169
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,960
Mm.

170
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,120
If you don't want to get hurt,
just get in.

171
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,680
Don't cause trouble.

172
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,480
- Come here! Get down! Move.
- Ow. Let go.

173
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Move!

174
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,440
- Ugh!
- You sure are feisty. Come here.

175
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,560
Ugh!

176
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,920
Ah! Ouch!

177
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,440
Hey! Stop!

178
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,840
You…

179
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,520
Come here. So feisty, aren't you?

180
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,480
- Come here.
- Let go. No.

181
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,000
I said move.

182
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Go.

183
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,600
Mrs. Manee?

184
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,280
You're quite something.

185
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,440
Why did you have him bring me here?

186
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,480
If you wanted to see me,
you could've just asked.

187
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,320
Because you promised me
you'd investigate about Ging for me.

188
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,280
But then you disappeared.

189
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,920
Now I'm not sure
if we're even on the same side anymore.

190
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,840
I've been trying to look into Ms. Ging.

191
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,520
Are you investigating her death,

192
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,360
or trying to take her place?

193
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,960
You misunderstood me.

194
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,600
Mr. Kirin and I
were just trying to comfort Kita.

195
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,480
I've never had feelings for him.

196
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,680
And you think I believe you?

197
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,440
I don't care.

198
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,160
But I can assure you.
I've been digging into Ms. Ging's case.

199
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,120
It's just that things aren't clear yet,
so I didn't want to tell you.

200
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,800
Then go on, tell me. What have you found?

201
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,400
Before the accident,
Ms. Ging's condition severely worsened,

202
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,640
even though she regularly saw her doctor.

203
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,960
Even the doctor was suspicious.

204
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,760
Are you saying she was poisoned?

205
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,560
Mr. It, I'm near the land we plan to buy.

206
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,720
Let me know when you're close.

207
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,640
I'll walk around to inspect first.

208
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,360
Miss Ve?

209
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,960
Mr. Ki.

210
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,640
What are you doing here?

211
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,520
I just saw Mrs. Manee.

212
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,880
I came to visit a friend nearby
and happened to run into her.

213
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,000
Ugh.

214
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,720
Are you okay?

215
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,200
Thanks for the information about Ging.

216
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,880
I hope you weren't lying
about not wanting to take her place.

217
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,360
But just to show your sincerity,

218
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,960
stay away from Kirin.

219
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,440
I'm fine. I'll be going now.

220
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,040
Wait. How are you getting back?

221
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,040
I'm no longer your employee.

222
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,240
Why do you care about me?

223
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,960
Even if you're no longer
taking care of Kita,

224
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,840
I'm still happy to help you with anything.

225
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,960
Just tell me.

226
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,520
Are you sure

227
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,640
that if I told you, you'd be willing
to help me with everything?

228
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,280
You can't help someone who's lost
everything bit by bit like me, Mr. Ki.

229
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,839
Hathai.

230
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,920
If you have a problem and need help,
just say so.

231
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,480
Help? Then you and your mother
can leave this house.

232
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,319
Because your mom made my mom cry.

233
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,720
I'm sorry.

234
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,079
In the end, you can't do it.

235
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,320
You can't help someone who's about
to lose everything bit by bit like me.

236
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,160
Whoa…

237
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,680
How can you remember all that?

238
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,520
I just keep all the images in my heart.

239
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,160
They stay here and here.

240
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,640
As long as you remember
everything between us,

241
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,840
I'll always be here and here with you.

242
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,680
Here and here?

243
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,200
Yes.

244
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,960
Why did you…?

245
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,480
So,

246
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,080
my mom says you keep changing
your background everywhere you go.

247
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,360
Is that true?

248
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,720
Why are you bringing this up again?

249
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,800
What are you hiding from me?

250
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,960
Who are you really?

251
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,440
What are you talking about? Let go of me.

252
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,640
I'm not your employee anymore.

253
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,480
You don't have the right to question me.

254
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,680
End of story.

255
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,760
Mr. It. I need your help.

256
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,600
How was the land
you went to see yesterday?

257
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,120
Would it be suitable
for our new development project?

258
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,600
It's okay, Mom.

259
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,320
But the capital we estimated might not
be enough if we also have to buy land

260
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,640
near the factory.

261
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,240
That's not a problem.

262
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,600
I've been talking to some people
who want to co-invest.

263
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,880
Mrs. Sorn, Ki, Hello.

264
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,800
Oh.

265
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,520
Mint, perfect timing.

266
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,440
Dad sent me to discuss
the project details you mentioned.

267
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,800
Shall we talk over lunch?

268
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,720
Then looks like
I arrived at the perfect time too.

269
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,200
I brought Ki
and Kita's favorite food for lunch.

270
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,440
Let's eat together.

271
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,920
That's great.

272
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Maybe Kita will be happy to see you.

273
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,640
Thank you, Ki.

274
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,160
Kita is here.

275
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,320
- Kita!
- Kita!

276
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,440
Hey, move!

277
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,560
A gift for you, Kita.

278
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,040
Thank you.

279
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,880
Don't you know
Kita doesn't like remote-controlled cars?

280
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,920
You don't even know
what he likes or dislikes.

281
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,480
Kita,

282
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,680
Auntie Ploy brought
your favorite chocolate cake.

283
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,480
You want two slices after lunch?

284
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,640
Here.

285
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,840
- Want some?
- Too much sugar isn't good for you.

286
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,240
Even Kita knows that too much sugar's bad.

287
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,880
Don't you know anything at all?

288
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,520
Your dad taught you that, right, Kita?

289
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,880
Teacher Ve taught me.

290
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,600
Even if I like it,
I shouldn't eat too much.

291
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,600
You're still talking about her, Kita?

292
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,400
I guess he doesn't know
that Teacher Ve was fired.

293
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,120
Kita, Teacher Ve
doesn't live here anymore.

294
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,600
But she's still in here and here with me.

295
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,040
Huh?

296
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,440
Kita must've been tricked by that woman
to remember her,

297
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,840
hoping to come back to this house.

298
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,640
She didn't trick me!

299
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,120
Kita.

300
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,800
- Oh!
- Ah!

301
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,720
Kita!

302
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,000
Uh… I'll go check on him.

303
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,400
Mint.

304
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,400
Don't talk about Teacher Ve
like that to Kita again.

305
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,960
Exactly.

306
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,000
You don't even know how to talk to him.

307
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,280
You're not fit to care for a child.

308
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,040
I only said it
because I care about him. Ki.

309
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,320
You can't come back from that.

310
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,280
Hey.

311
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,240
- What?
- There's no need to worry about Kita.

312
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,080
Soon, Kita will be sent
to a boarding school overseas.

313
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,160
You can't just make that decision alone.

314
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,880
I won't let my son go anywhere.

315
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,920
I'm just choosing
what's best for you and for Kita.

316
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,160
But neither I nor my son want that, Mom.

317
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,200
How dare you talk to me like this now, Ki?

318
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,120
If you're choosing what's best
for someone you love,

319
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,400
shouldn't you ask what they want too?

320
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,920
If it only comes from you,

321
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,240
it's more like forcing your will on us.

322
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,800
Ki.

323
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't think Kita is ready for that.

324
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,560
And I want him
to stay close to me a little longer.

325
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,480
Then find someone suitable
to help take care of him,

326
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
like Mint.

327
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
So the reason you want me to marry Mint

328
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,320
is just so someone
can help take care of Kita?

329
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,680
Mint is perfect in every way,

330
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,440
looks, manners, status.

331
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,560
She's the daughter
of a major hotel group owner.

332
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,200
She'd be an asset to us.

333
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,800
Running a big business like ours,

334
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,680
it's better to have someone proper
by your side than to go it alone.

335
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,440
But I don't love Mint, Mom.

336
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,080
And I don't want to remarry either.

337
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,440
Then choose, either marry Mint,

338
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,000
or send Kita to boarding school abroad.

339
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,160
I think Kita's still too young

340
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,120
to be sent overseas alone.

341
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,480
I'll try to talk to your mom.

342
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,600
But she's not happy with me right now
because of Teacher Ve.

343
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,680
She even threatened to sue me.

344
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,040
Not sure if she'll listen.

345
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,480
At least you understand kids.

346
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,880
She might listen to you.

347
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,640
Will Miss Ve come back to work with you?

348
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm not sure.

349
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,720
But if she comes back, I'd be happy.

350
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,800
You're really doing everything
to help her.

351
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,080
You must know her family well.

352
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,360
I don't know much.

353
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,160
But I do have something to ask you.

354
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,600
Do you know this woman?

355
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,040
Nope.

356
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,600
But she does look familiar.

357
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,280
I think I've seen her a couple of times.

358
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,160
Hey, wait!

359
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,520
- Oh.
- Ow. What the hell?

360
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,600
I remember now.

361
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,760
She was acting shady at Napat's bar

362
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,160
on the night of that incident.

363
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,560
Could she be a reporter?

364
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,040
When we were kids, Prae and I
were helped by the same foundation.

365
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,840
We only talked about Teacher Rawee.

366
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,840
Ve doesn’t know anything about my work.

367
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,760
They're lying, aren't they?

368
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,400
What did you say?

369
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,520
Why are you asking about that woman?

370
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,000
Oh, nothing.

371
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,880
Help me dig into a reporter named Praepai.

372
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,400
"Socialite girl hospitalized for a week,

373
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,400
no sign of her boyfriend."

374
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,800
"Did breakup lead to overdose?"

375
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,200
Could the rumor about Mr. Wiputh
having someone new be true?

376
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,000
I heard that girl
just came back from abroad.

377
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,440
Then what caused the breakup?

378
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,080
Could it be that hit-and-run scandal
involving her friend?

379
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,320
People say she was made a scapegoat.

380
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,000
That's possible.

381
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,840
- Right? I think it's true.
- Yeah, for sure.

382
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,560
- It's--
- Are you all that free?

383
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,400
With this much free time,

384
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,400
maybe I should tell Ki and my mom
to reduce the number of staff.

385
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,320
So you can stop wasting time.

386
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,640
- I'm sorry. Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

387
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,120
Nun.

388
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
You just got discharged.

389
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,440
Why are you back at the office already?

390
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,600
I'm bored.

391
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,560
If I stay home,
I might get suicidal again.

392
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,320
Hey…

393
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,920
Why would you say that?

394
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,280
We've talked about this.

395
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,520
What you did didn't help anything.

396
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,000
You're still heartbroken
over Wiputh, aren't you?

397
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,800
If only

398
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,360
I had said yes
when he was on one knee proposing,

399
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,960
I'd probably be happy by now.

400
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,520
If you didn't want to bring me,
you could've said so.

401
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,720
No need to be polite to your dad or mine.

402
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,680
You've misunderstood, Ivy.

403
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,840
I just thought this place was boring.

404
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,120
I wanted to take you somewhere more fun.

405
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,560
Fine. I'll go wherever you want.

406
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,920
Let's move to another bar.

407
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,120
Let's go.

408
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,400
So this is why

409
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,640
you never visited me in the hospital.

410
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,640
Does no one tell you that after a breakup,

411
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,280
you shouldn't chase after your ex?

412
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,480
It makes you look worthless and pathetic.

413
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,000
And hasn't anyone ever told you
that if no one asked your opinion,

414
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,840
you shouldn't butt in. It's obnoxious!

415
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,720
- You!
- Obnoxious!

416
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,600
Stop, Ivy.

417
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,880
Go wait for me in the car.

418
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,680
I'll handle this.

419
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,720
You said it, so handle it for me.

420
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,200
I know you're hurt
about what happened between us.

421
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,080
But acting out like that

422
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
won't change anything.

423
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,800
Puth…

424
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,400
So everything

425
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,320
that happened between us

426
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,880
meant nothing to you?

427
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,960
You know

428
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,400
I love you.

429
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,280
And you love me too.

430
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,600
I promise

431
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,680
that video will never leave my hands.

432
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,680
But no matter what, this is the end of us.

433
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,480
Puth. Puth.

434
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,000
Miss Nun.

435
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,680
Don't you realize you shouldn't be here?

436
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,080
What are you doing here?

437
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,040
Someone saw Nunnalin here.

438
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,160
You're worried about your sister now?

439
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,560
I just wanted to check on her.

440
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,520
I don't want her to make the same mistake.

441
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,240
I'm waiting for a friend.

442
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
But I saw you with Mr. Wiputh.

443
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,720
I thought you'd gone home, but you didn't.

444
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,840
Let me give you some advice, Miss Nun.

445
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,280
Even if your crimes
haven't come to light yet,

446
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,960
you know what you've done.

447
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,960
Don't keep making the same mistakes.

448
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,960
Stay out of my business.

449
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,320
Worry about saving yourself first.

450
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,680
Or are you unemployed with too much time
to butt into other people's lives?

451
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,800
I may no longer work at your house,

452
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,600
but I came to warn you out of goodwill.

453
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,240
Goodwill?

454
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,880
Ever since you came to our house,

455
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,520
everything's been a mess.

456
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,360
Mom was right to fire you.

457
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,840
Maybe you should ask yourself

458
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,280
whether it was really because of me
or because of all of you.

459
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,400
Admitting your own faults
may be just too hard for you.

460
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,560
Blaming others must be much easier, right?

461
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,440
Hey.

462
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,920
Miss Nun, calm down.

463
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,160
We're not alone here.

464
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,680
Where's my earring?

465
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,360
Hey, are you filming me?

466
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,160
Huh?

467
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,800
Hey! Stop!

468
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,440
Why are you filming me?

469
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,960
Get out of the car
and delete that video now. Hey!

470
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,920
Out! I said come out!

471
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,040
Why did you record me?!

472
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,840
Is there something I can help with?

473
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,560
He secretly filmed me.

474
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,840
I told him to come talk, but he won't.

475
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,120
Let me handle it.

476
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,480
Hey.

477
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,080
If you didn't record anything,
then just come explain.

478
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,600
But if you did, take out
your phone and delete all the clips.

479
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,680
Hey.

480
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,160
If you won't talk, don't expect to leave.

481
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,560
Delete the video.

482
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,520
I said delete the video.

483
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,000
Come out and talk.

484
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,680
Don't! Don't!

485
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,360
Let's end this.

486
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,240
Here.

487
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,240
Thank you.

488
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,480
- Hey!
- What do you think you're doing?

489
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,640
- Why are you getting involved?
- Miss Nun.

490
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,840
Thank you.

491
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,480
My pleasure.

492
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,280
Here, this is
everything I found on Singha.

493
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:23,360
"Singha, the only son
of powerful politician, Sajja."

494
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,159
"He just returned from the US
to help with his father's business."

495
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,440
<i>"Sajja's family is now</i>
<i>investing in real estate</i>

496
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,199
<i>to expand beyond their current ventures."</i>

497
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,400
And most importantly, he's still single.

498
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,560
That night, I think Singha was
totally showing off for Nunnalin.

499
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,520
He might've done it to help Nun,
but it felt more scary than charming.

500
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,320
That's true.

501
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,639
But maybe he thinks, as a powerful
figure's son, he can do whatever he wants.

502
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,639
Don't tell me

503
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,440
Sajja and his son are interested in
the Suttha Group's business.

504
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,000
What a small world.

505
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,200
I didn't think you and your father
would want to do business with us.

506
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,800
Same here.

507
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,400
I'm surprised to see you here too.

508
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,560
Hope I didn't scare you that night.

509
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,480
Not at all. That guy deserved it.

510
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,760
I had my people look into him,
turns out he's a journalist.

511
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,480
He's been fired now.

512
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,520
You got him fired?

513
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,120
Oh, right.

514
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,480
You dropped
one of your earrings that night.

515
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,760
So I got you a new pair.

516
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,600
Please take them.

517
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,560
Just a little gift.

518
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,000
Thank you.

519
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,560
My pleasure.

520
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,480
We hope to welcome you
at the company soon, Mr. Sajja,

521
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,880
to discuss the investment further.

522
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,800
Of course. With pleasure.

523
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,720
Especially if our children grow closer,

524
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,720
I'm sure everything else
will run more smoothly.

525
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,680
Yes.

526
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,880
I've had people investigate

527
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,200
what remains from the records before
the fire at Teacher Rawee's orphanage.

528
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,160
There was a child
named Praepai in her care,

529
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,720
but no child named Wanvela.

530
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,520
After the incident,
Baan Sukkwan was shut down.

531
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,880
So Miss Ve really faked it?

532
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,240
It's possible the name was changed.

533
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,640
Many of the kids from there
changed names and surnames.

534
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,720
Can you keep looking into this?

535
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,840
Of course.

536
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,960
And one more thing.
It might be useful for you.

537
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,360
When the fire broke out at Baan Sukkwan,
one child died.

538
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,400
And this is the girl
Teacher Rawee said died that night.

539
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,320
Her name was Hathai.

540
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,760
Hathai?

541
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,080
How is that possible?

542
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,440
Mom said Hathai was killed by robbers
alongside Mrs. Kitinee.

543
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,960
But this is really Hathai's picture.

544
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,200
Could she still be alive?

545
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,880
I need to go now, Teacher.

546
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,480
There's still a lot
I have to take care of.

547
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,720
What more is there?

548
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,200
You've had a good life for so long.

549
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,960
Live it happily.

550
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,000
Don't put yourself at risk.

551
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,640
I can't be happy yet,

552
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,240
not while the people who hurt my family
go unpunished.

553
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,040
But it's dangerous.

554
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,560
I don't want you to get hurt.

555
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,720
Let it go, Hathai.

556
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,480
They've tracked you here.

557
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,560
I need to take you somewhere else.

558
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,920
Hathai,

559
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,840
they followed us.

560
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,240
Hathai, watch out! Hurry! Run!

561
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,560
Teacher. Teacher.

562
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,480
Don't worry about me.

563
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,280
I'm a grown woman now.

564
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,960
I'm not the same helpless Hathai anymore.

565
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,880
So that Ve woman is Hathai?

566
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,960
Didn't Teacher say she died in the fire?

567
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,160
If you learn anything about Wanvela,
call me.

568
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,520
You'll be rewarded more than this.

569
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,720
Im has arrived.

570
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,920
Well, what do you want
to talk to me about?

571
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,440
You want to know
who Wanvela really is, right?

572
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,960
I've found out who she truly is.

573
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,320
<i>I want Hathai back.</i>

574
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,800
<i>I'll give everything back.</i>

575
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,480
Hathai's life should be returned to her.

576
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,760
<i>If Kirin doesn't have time</i>
<i>to manage Panpailin company,</i>

577
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,960
then hand all the shares back to us.

578
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,320
Then make some money
to buy the shares from my son.

579
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,800
How about two billion baht?

580
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,400
Two billion?!

581
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,400
<i>Nun's been stressed lately.</i>

582
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,640
<i>That woman keeps harassing</i>
<i>and attacking our family.</i>

583
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,200
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

584
