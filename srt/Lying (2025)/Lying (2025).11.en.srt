1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,240
<i>I'll let you leave this house</i>

2
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,800
with nothing owed between us.

3
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,760
Have you ever heard this saying?

4
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,440
"What you hate, you attract."

5
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,440
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
You…

7
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,800
<i>Are you investigating Ging's death,</i>

8
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,200
<i>or trying to take her place?</i>

9
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,200
When the fire broke out at Baan Sukkwan,

10
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,560
one child died.

11
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,760
How is that possible?

12
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,800
Could Hathai still be alive?

13
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,800
<i>You want to know</i>
<i>who Wanvela really is, right?</i>

14
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,360
<i>I've found out</i>

15
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,920
<i>who she truly is.</i>

16
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,400
I don't think
I can come back to work here.

17
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,040
I don't want your school
to get in trouble.

18
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,960
ARUN EDUCARE

19
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,040
But I'm honestly not worried at all.

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,920
I'll help you with Aunt Sorn
as much as I can.

21
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,160
As for lawsuits or anything else,
I'm not concerned.

22
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,680
Thank you for always helping me,

23
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,480
even when you had no reason to.

24
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,640
I'd do anything for you

25
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,680
because I…

26
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,920
Ki.

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,280
Why are you here?

28
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,560
I need to speak to Miss Ve.

29
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,800
I have nothing to say to you.

30
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,120
You're coming with me.

31
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,520
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

32
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,680
Where are you taking her?

33
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,000
I need to talk to her alone.

34
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Don't follow me.

35
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,200
- Let's go.
- What are you doing, Mr. Ki?

36
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,880
Hey, Mr. Ki.

37
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,720
I have something important to ask you.

38
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Are you a cop
and I'm a criminal or something?

39
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,200
Why are you interrogating me?

40
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,560
I want to know about Hathai.

41
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,640
About someone in your household,
and you're asking me?

42
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,200
I just found out Hathai

43
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,800
didn't die with her mother.

44
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,880
She was sent to Baan Sukkwan.

45
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,600
I'm sure you wouldn't lie
about having lived there.

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,400
So then you must know who Hathai is.

47
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,720
I don't.

48
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,280
I didn't stay at Baan Sukkwan very long.

49
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,560
I hardly remember the kids there,
and I wasn't close to anyone.

50
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,000
Even Praepai,
I only recently reconnected with her.

51
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,520
Is that all? Can I go now?

52
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,960
Then Praepai probably knows her.

53
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,880
So what?

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,840
Why are you trying to find Hathai?

55
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,920
You already know your mother
doesn't want her to come back.

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,440
I want Hathai back.

57
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,160
I want her to forgive my mother.

58
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,440
And forgive me.

59
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,640
And I'll repay her for everything.

60
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,680
Repay?

61
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,200
What if she believes you and your mother
took everything from her?

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,400
Are you sure you can make that right?

63
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,720
I'll give everything back.

64
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
Hathai's life

65
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,600
should be returned to her.

66
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,200
I'll make it happen.

67
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,160
You said she was taken care of.

68
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,200
You said she was dead. How is she back?

69
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,920
I heard Teacher Rawee
call Wanvela "Hathai".

70
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,520
I think the one who died in the fire

71
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,880
wasn't really Hathai.

72
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,560
Im said Teacher Rawee
is in the second stage of Alzheimer's.

73
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,960
She may have been confused,
thinking Hathai died.

74
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,320
Then investigate.

75
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,160
Find out for sure if she's dead or not!

76
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,720
Her mother's already dead.

77
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,200
I won't let her live either.

78
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,600
Yes, ma'am.

79
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,360
Mom.

80
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,080
Nun.

81
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,720
What…

82
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,160
What's going on?

83
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,160
Didn't you tell me

84
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,920
Dad's ex-wife's daughter
was murdered by robbers long ago?

85
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
I don't want to jump

86
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,440
to conclusions
that you are the one who had them killed?

87
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,680
Then don't jump to anything.

88
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,160
Don't think about anything.

89
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,640
Don't care. Just close your ears and eyes.

90
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,080
Okay?

91
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,120
I'll take care of the rest.

92
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,640
No one's going to steal
anything from us.

93
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,520
Understand?

94
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,480
But she's Dad's daughter.

95
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,360
That means she's my sister, right?

96
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,200
You don't have to kill her.

97
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,480
And I don't want it to be like that.

98
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,840
Why would you call someone
who's taking everything from you "sister"?

99
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,920
If she's still alive,

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,520
our family will never know peace.

101
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,960
You don't know this,
but it's because of you

102
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,440
that I was able to find her.

103
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,960
Why is Mr. Terd contacting other lawyers?

104
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,400
Why would he?

105
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,240
That case about Kitinee
and Hathai's deaths has been over a year.

106
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,960
Maybe Mr. Terd suspects
Hathai is still alive.

107
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,760
He's practically in a coma.

108
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,360
What's left to suspect?

109
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,640
If you don't want problems later,

110
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,560
you better find out

111
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,280
whether Hathai's alive or not.

112
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,240
- Yes.
- Miss Nun, please don't run.

113
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,240
What, sweetie?

114
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,320
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful?

115
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,440
Please don't run like that.

116
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,840
It's dangerous.

117
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,760
- Yes.
- Jit, keep an eye on her.

118
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,160
Yes, ma'am.

119
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,600
What's this?

120
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,160
It's a letter delivered today.

121
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,320
"To Mr. Turtle, from Chubby Cheeks."

122
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,080
<i>It's because of you</i>

123
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,760
that I found out where she was.

124
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,840
Let this be

125
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,800
a secret between us,
just mother and daughter.

126
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,960
We must protect our family together.

127
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,680
Don't let her destroy it.

128
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,120
And I

129
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,440
will be the one to protect you,

130
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,560
alright?

131
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,680
Nun.

132
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,280
Someday, you'll understand me.

133
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,120
You don't believe

134
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,320
I'll do it, do you?

135
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,000
Whether what you're saying is true or not,

136
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,520
it has nothing to do with me.

137
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,960
I'm not Hathai.

138
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,280
I don't need to know what you're thinking.

139
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,960
Are you sure

140
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,720
that you really don't need to know?

141
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,800
Hey.

142
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,640
- Hey.
- Hey.

143
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,520
Stop.

144
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,800
Please, I'm sorry.

145
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,360
Who are you?

146
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,360
Why were you filming us?

147
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,560
I wasn't filming. I was just passing by.

148
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,800
- Give me your phone.
- Hey.

149
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,120
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,960
Give me your phone!

151
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,400
Okay. I give up.

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,400
I'll delete it.

153
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,440
Who sent you?

154
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,360
- Who sent you?
- Let him go.

155
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,520
He deleted the video.

156
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,000
Let's just end it here.

157
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,320
You can go now.

158
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,280
Thank you.

159
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,720
So you know
who sent that guy to film us, don't you?

160
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,680
I don't know.

161
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,800
I just don't want
any more trouble with anyone.

162
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,240
Sometimes I let things go when I can.

163
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,400
You should too.

164
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,360
Just let me go already.

165
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,960
Are you sure you didn't let my name slip?

166
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,680
Useless.

167
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,840
Did you have someone
do something again, Grandma?

168
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,680
Don't bother with these trivial matters.

169
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,640
Just focus on managing our company.

170
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,880
This is our family business,

171
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,160
yet we have to wait
on someone else's decisions?

172
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,560
That's not right.

173
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,080
Mrs. Sorn is here.

174
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,560
Is something wrong
that you were in such a hurry to see me?

175
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Say it quickly. I don't have much time.

176
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,280
I've kept quiet for too long.
But not anymore.

177
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,000
If Kirin doesn't have time
to manage Panpailin company,

178
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,240
then hand all the shares back to us.

179
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,600
Then make some money
to buy the shares from my son.

180
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,120
How about two billion baht?

181
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,840
Two billion?!

182
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,200
I'm kidding.

183
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
No need to take it so seriously.

184
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,840
Ki's been busy lately.

185
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,040
He's focusing on the Suttha Group,

186
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,840
so he doesn't have time
to help with Panpailin.

187
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,280
Oh, and you must've heard

188
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,400
I've got a new investment partner.

189
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,640
The one who was rumored
to be involved in money laundering

190
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,360
with shady people?

191
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,000
So the Suttha Group is now

192
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,480
a laundering hub for gray businesses?

193
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,320
That's just baseless rumors.

194
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,240
No need to turn them into an issue.

195
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,040
As for work, don't worry.

196
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,160
There won't be any more problems.

197
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,680
Ki will transfer Jade Biz to become
a subsidiary of the Suttha Group.

198
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,280
What?

199
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,080
I'm busy.

200
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,040
I don't have time for nonsense.

201
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,080
Excuse me.

202
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,680
So that was the plan all along,

203
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,440
to take over our company.

204
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,000
He tricked Ging into marrying him,

205
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,440
tricked her into transferring
the shares before she died.

206
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,120
Grandma.

207
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,440
- Ki wouldn't do that.
- Hey!

208
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,840
Stop defending him.

209
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Your sister died because of him.

210
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,400
He poisoned her.

211
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,160
You still want to defend him?

212
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,560
How do you know that?

213
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,040
Someone helped me investigate.

214
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,200
<i>Let me blow on it for you.</i>

215
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,280
Here. It's delicious.

216
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,440
I made it myself.

217
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,280
Made it yourself?

218
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
More like frozen food.

219
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,560
Let me see.

220
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,000
Ow, hot.

221
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,160
Yuck, it's sticky.

222
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,840
Kita, don't eat it.

223
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,080
Who knows what it is?

224
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,520
You'll get a stomachache.

225
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,360
Hey.

226
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,720
You don't get to tell Kita
what to eat or not.

227
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,080
Oh.

228
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,920
I'm his aunt.

229
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,320
An aunt who's trying to replace his mom?

230
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,400
Aren't you ashamed?

231
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,160
Your sister might be dead,

232
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,280
but if she knew
her own sister was scheming

233
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,320
to take her place,

234
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,480
she'd be devastated.

235
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,520
I pity your sister.

236
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,240
She died young
and has an ungrateful sister.

237
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,000
Don't talk about my sister like that!

238
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,160
And someone like you
will never take her place either.

239
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,200
You!

240
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,920
Gingploy!

241
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,040
Hey. Enough!

242
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,120
Stop! Kita.

243
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,640
- Kita.
- Get off of me!

244
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,480
- Hey.
- Kita.

245
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,280
Hey. Stop right now!

246
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,560
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

247
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,200
If you're fighting like this,

248
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,320
I'll ask both of you to leave!

249
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,280
Ki.

250
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Kita. Kita!

251
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
Go.

252
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,360
I'll settle this.

253
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,560
Come here.

254
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,120
Hey.

255
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,840
The homeowner asked you to leave

256
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,120
and you're still not going?

257
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
I'm not leaving.

258
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,520
I didn't do anything wrong.

259
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,320
Mint talked bad about my sister first,

260
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,920
so I had to act.

261
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,000
In front of Kita?

262
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,520
You've lost your mind over a man?

263
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,760
- Hey.
- Am I wrong?

264
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,480
You have feelings for Ki. Everyone knows.

265
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,200
Is it wrong? Not really.

266
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,960
Loving someone isn't a crime.

267
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,600
But if you keep
acting irrationally like this,

268
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,160
you really think
Ki will want you around Kita again?

269
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,320
I'm saying this because I care.

270
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,840
You're Kita's aunt.

271
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,880
You care about me?

272
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,360
Save your concern for your girl.

273
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,920
Who do you mean?

274
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,600
Your precious Teacher Ve.

275
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,359
Ploy,

276
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
watch my bag.

277
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,839
I'm going to the bathroom.

278
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,160
Yes, Grandma.

279
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,720
<i>Stop sending people after me</i>
<i>if you want information on Ms. Gingyok.</i>

280
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,240
Keep your people in check.

281
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,760
or my grandma will use her.

282
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,240
And don't say I didn't warn you.

283
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,400
This isn't the first time

284
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,760
that Mint's been assaulted
by your Mrs. Manee's granddaughter.

285
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,440
And your son never defends our daughter.

286
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,600
Honestly,

287
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,000
your son isn't all that special.

288
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,840
He's not even a Liangsuttha,

289
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,280
and he even has a kid.

290
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,840
I don't blame Ki, Mom and Dad.

291
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,680
I apologize on behalf of my son.

292
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,400
But don't let this ruin our business.

293
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,520
You know, doing business

294
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,640
requires trust,

295
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,080
not just money.

296
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,440
I know.

297
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,600
That's why I'm here
with sincerity today, Mr. Decha.

298
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,760
I've got a new partner,

299
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,640
wealthy and powerful.

300
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,760
I'm sure
you'll want to join our big project.

301
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
I've heard about that.

302
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,240
Is it Mr. Sajja and his son?

303
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,160
Yes.

304
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,160
About Kita's teacher to replace Miss Ve,

305
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,880
I'm still looking into it.

306
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,120
Thanks.

307
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,920
You still haven't told me

308
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,040
why you took her that day.

309
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,520
What did you have to talk to her about?

310
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,960
You already know.

311
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,560
How would I know unless you tell me?

312
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,920
Even if I don't tell you,

313
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,160
Miss Ve will.

314
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,920
What are you talking about?

315
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
Remember the reporter named Praepai?

316
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,240
Yeah. Why?

317
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,400
She's Miss Ve's friend.

318
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,440
What did you say?

319
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,200
So she didn't tell you.

320
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,720
There are probably plenty
of other things she didn't tell you

321
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,000
even though
you try to help her with everything.

322
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,840
Next time, I'll invite Mr. Sajja
and his son to meet you.

323
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
Great.

324
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,680
I'm very interested
in the project you mentioned.

325
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,480
What about our project
with the Suttha Group, Dad?

326
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,120
I have no issue.

327
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,760
Then please proceed, Mrs. Sorn.

328
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,240
Thank you very much.

329
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,640
Let's go.

330
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,040
I'm surprised how someone like you,

331
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,720
so full of pride,

332
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,560
would grovel just to land a deal.

333
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,960
You.

334
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,200
Well, I have to apologize.

335
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,200
I couldn't follow your orders
before I left home.

336
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,120
In the end, we still meet here anyway.

337
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,840
You came here to provoke me, didn't you?

338
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,560
No. I came to show you

339
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,200
that you can't control everyone
through fear.

340
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,280
Because I'm not afraid.

341
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,520
And it's the same with your son.

342
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,560
The more you push women onto him,

343
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,560
the more he'll resist.

344
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,880
He'll end up running away from you

345
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,320
to be with the one you hate most.

346
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,360
Don't even think of getting with my son.

347
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,040
Come here, Mrs. Sorn.

348
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,080
Mrs. Sorn, don't forget
I don't work for you anymore.

349
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,520
What I did today,
I'll call it self-defense.

350
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,680
Let me go!

351
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,960
- Let go. I said let go!
- What's going on, ma'am?!

352
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,600
‪Let go!

353
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,240
Stay out of it!

354
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,280
Ve!

355
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,280
Mrs. Sorn.

356
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,200
What now?

357
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,200
Well.

358
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,760
Im found the photo of Teacher Ve

359
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,200
when the Patel family

360
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,800
took her to New Zealand.

361
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,440
This is Hathai.

362
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,720
Yes.

363
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,560
The girl who died in the fire

364
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,120
wasn't Hathai.

365
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,800
I was tricked.

366
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,560
Hathai is still alive.

367
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,520
Wanvela Patel

368
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,920
is Hathai.

369
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,960
You mouthy little…

370
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,880
<i>Have you ever heard this saying?</i>

371
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,560
"The more you hate, the more you meet."

372
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,040
"What you hate, you attract."

373
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,280
I came to show you

374
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,000
that you can't control everyone
through fear.

375
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,000
Because I'm not afraid.

376
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,520
She tricked me.

377
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,760
She changed her name and fooled us all.

378
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,360
Hathai…

379
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,080
KANISORN'S FAMILY

380
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,840
Even if you kicked me out of the house,

381
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,400
this isn't over.

382
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,000
PRAEPAI

383
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,720
<i>I've arranged a meeting with Aunt Kob.</i>

384
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,960
The food's delicious.

385
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,920
Then come eat with us often.

386
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Nun won't have to eat alone then.

387
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,800
Today's dessert is apple pie made by Nun.

388
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,720
That's my favorite.

389
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,200
Really?

390
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,480
What a coincidence.

391
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,680
That means Nun kinda knows you well.

392
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,080
You like baking?

393
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,080
Nun.

394
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,440
Don't be rude.

395
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,400
I don't like it. Mom forced me to.

396
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,640
Nun…

397
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,480
Then,

398
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,240
I'll go get your favorite dish
as Mom told me to.

399
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,600
She's been stressed lately.

400
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,320
She's a bit moody. Don't mind her.

401
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,000
What's she stressed about?
Maybe I can help.

402
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,720
She once tried to commit suicide

403
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,000
after being wrongly accused
in a hit-and-run case.

404
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,360
She wasn't at fault.

405
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,200
Yet that woman keeps harassing

406
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,160
and attacking our family.

407
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,240
I'll take care of it.

408
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,320
I'll make sure
Miss Nun won't be harassed again.

409
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,960
Are you sure, Singha?

410
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,080
For me, dealing with lowlifes

411
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,360
is not that hard.

412
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,920
Anyway,

413
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,680
who's this pest bothering Miss Nun?

414
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,080
Noi,

415
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,280
are you sure they'll show up

416
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
and give me a loan with good interest?

417
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,120
Alright, I'll call you back.

418
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,440
What are you doing here?

419
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,360
Aren't you're looking
for low-interest loans?

420
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,960
Don't tell me
you're the one Noi mentioned?

421
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
Why would you fool me?

422
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Will someone like you give me a loan?

423
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,040
You need bail money for your son,

424
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,240
who was tricked into smuggling, right?

425
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,480
Apart from money,

426
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,280
I can also help with legal stuff.

427
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,920
Why are you helping me?

428
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,920
I want to know about Jit.

429
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,840
I want to know where she is.

430
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,040
Just tell me,

431
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,240
and I'll help you and your son.

432
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,000
- Hello?
- <i>Mr. Ki.</i>

433
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,200
<i>I've got the reporter Praepai's address.</i>

434
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,320
Thanks a lot.

435
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,320
Stop messing with me.

436
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,920
- Move.
- No.

437
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,800
I want to talk about Miss Ve.

438
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,760
When you said your Grandma would use her,

439
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
what did you mean?

440
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,520
You're so worried about her
that you followed me here?

441
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,360
Yeah. I care about Miss Ve. So what?

442
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,640
Then let me tell you something.

443
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,880
Grandma is misunderstanding

444
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,520
that Ki made Ging transfer
her shares to him before dying

445
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,080
and she's trying to investigate

446
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,240
if he caused her death.

447
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,920
And the one helping Grandma investigate

448
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,400
is Wanvela.

449
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,680
Miss Ve?

450
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,560
You didn't expect that, did you?

451
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,520
That she'd do this behind Ki's back.

452
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,320
Grandma's only doing this

453
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,720
to get Ging's shares back.

454
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,080
And I don't want your people to be used

455
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
by Grandma to hurt Ki.

456
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,000
Because I don't believe
Ki would do that to Ging.

457
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,680
Move.

458
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,000
I don't know

459
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,440
if Jit still lives at the same place.

460
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,320
Go check for yourself.

461
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,400
Why does it seem abandoned?

462
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,400
You.

463
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,080
You and this house look the same.

464
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,680
Cheap.

465
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,200
Filthy.

466
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,000
Why are you doing this to me?

467
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,960
And what did you do?

468
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
Threaten Nun and Mrs. Sorn?

469
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,800
You messed with the wrong people.

470
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,520
You're being deceived.

471
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,440
When ants or bugs cling to your feet,

472
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,200
they're annoying.

473
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,960
To get rid of the problem,

474
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,000
I'll eliminate the whole nest.

475
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,560
So no one can bother us again.

476
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,080
Take care of it.

477
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,520
- Come here!
- Don't.

478
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,680
Boss.

479
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,840
Nice handwriting.

480
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,480
I've taken care of the rest.

481
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,840
"The sin I committed is heavy."

482
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,400
"I ruined other people's lives,

483
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,080
<i>but in the end, I have nothing left."</i>

484
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,560
<i>"Don't look for my relatives."</i>

485
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,040
<i>"No one else</i>
<i>should be sad or disappointed."</i>

486
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,320
<i>"I've been through so much."</i>

487
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,320
<i>"Please forgive me."</i>

488
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,520
<i>"I surrender to fate."</i>

489
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,040
"Wanvela."

490
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,640
Get it over with.

491
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,200
Promise me.

492
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,640
If I don't come back,

493
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,320
don't leave this spot.

494
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,320
Don't call for anyone.

495
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,760
Promise me.

496
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,200
Please.

497
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,240
I'm sorry, Mom.

498
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,360
This is all I could do.

499
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,400
<i>After a fire at an old wooden house</i>
<i>in Nong Chok this evening,</i>

500
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,520
<i>although the flames didn't spread,</i>

501
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,640
<i>authorities found</i>
<i>one deceased woman inside.</i>

502
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,960
<i>They have not yet contacted her relatives</i>

503
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,200
<i>and are still investigating</i>
<i>the cause of the fire.</i>

504
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,280
Your family
is finally back together, Mr. Terd.

505
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,520
Twenty years ago, she escaped,

506
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,560
but she came back on her own.

507
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,000
This time you won't get away, Hathai.

508
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,560
You're still drinking, Nun?

509
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,360
I'm already not going anywhere.

510
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400
I'm staying home

511
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,680
like a prisoner.

512
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,680
Don't stop me.

513
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,040
You're still upset about Wiputh?

514
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,960
I wish I could move on,

515
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,280
but it's not easy.

516
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,440
And I'm also being forced

517
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,680
to love someone I don't love.

518
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,520
No matter what, we both

519
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,600
can't go against Mom's orders.

520
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,520
She controls everyone,

521
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,120
dictates every life in this house…

522
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,800
including those two.

523
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,600
You mean

524
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,840
Mrs. Kitinee and Hathai?

525
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,800
I overheard Mom talking to Uncle Pat.

526
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,800
Hathai isn't dead.

527
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,680
She didn't die with Mrs. Kitinee.

528
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,080
She was sent

529
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,720
to

530
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,800
an orphanage.

531
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,560
And it was my fault.

532
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,000
Because of me,

533
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,760
Mom knew where she was.

534
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,280
What are you talking about?

535
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,400
I'm so confused.

536
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,560
Mom told me that

537
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,520
20 years ago,

538
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,800
Hathai sent a postcard to you.

539
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,000
That's how she knew

540
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,480
Hathai was still alive

541
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,719
and knew where she was.

542
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,840
But she said

543
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,000
it was because of me,

544
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,080
she was able to send someone
to get rid of her.

545
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,880
Are you done yet, Mr. Turtle?
I'm all sore.

546
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,640
Just finished.

547
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,840
Why are my cheeks so round?

548
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,840
I'll call you Chubby Cheeks from now on.

549
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,480
Ouch!

550
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,840
I'm sorry, Hathai.

551
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,000
I really am.

552
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,080
You look beautiful today, Mint.

553
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,000
It's a special day.

554
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,880
Yes, a very special day for you and Ki.

555
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,400
Are you sure Ki won't have any problems

556
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,800
with our press conference?

557
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,560
Of course.

558
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,160
I'll announce
your engagement with Mint today.

559
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
Mom.

560
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,520
I've also arranged Kita's boarding school,

561
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,520
visa, and flight.

562
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,120
It depends on what you do today.

563
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,800
If you disappoint me,

564
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,840
Kita leaves tomorrow.

565
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,040
Ki,

566
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,160
I hope you won't let me down.

567
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,440
Don't worry, Mint.

568
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,440
Just smile and answer questions.

569
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,120
Today,

570
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,800
you must stand proudly beside Ki.

571
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,160
Where is he, anyway?

572
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,880
It's almost time.

573
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,360
I sent Nun to get him.
He'll be here in no time.

574
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,480
Ah.

575
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,560
There he is.

576
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,840
Hello.

577
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,240
Ki.

578
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,360
Come stand beside her. Come on.

579
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,640
Mrs. Sorn, it's time.

580
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,960
Thank you all

581
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,000
for attending the grand launch

582
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,760
of the joint project
between the Suttha Group and Wisasart.

583
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,800
I heard that apart
from the project launch,

584
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,160
there's also good news
from Mr. Kirin today too. Is that right?

585
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,440
Yes, there is.

586
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,680
About the good news,

587
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,440
I'll share it myself.

588
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,760
Don't disappoint me, Ki.

589
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,280
Mint.

590
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,040
What's the good news, Mr. Kirin?

591
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,040
It's about my marriage.

592
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,640
Are you going to announce your marriage?

593
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,160
I'm married.

594
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,320
I'd like you all to meet my wife.

595
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,360
Ki.

596
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,120
That's my wife.

597
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,080
Hello.

598
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,240
I'm Wanvela,

599
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,560
Mr. Kirin's wife.

600
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,480
Ve is still alive.

601
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,200
I forgot to show you last time.

602
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,320
Our marriage certificate.

603
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,040
<i>Do you think I care?</i>

604
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,000
NEXT EPISODE

605
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,800
- Mom!
- <i>I know some people want me dead.</i>

606
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,760
But too bad, I'm not easy to kill.

607
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,320
I'll have you
run the company in place of Ki.

608
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,000
<i>Your brother is blinded by that woman,</i>

609
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,360
<i>neglecting work.</i>

610
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,680
<i>I can't let the company suffer any more.</i>

611
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,920
Even though you're married now,

612
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,960
<i>I'll still help you in any way.</i>

613
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,400
I'm sorry

614
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,920
<i>I made you upset.</i>

615
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,920
