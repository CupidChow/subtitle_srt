1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,640
It looks like
she passed out in the bathtub on her own.

2
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,280
There's only a bruise
on the back of her head.

3
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
<i>If you could just let some things go,</i>

4
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,440
maybe things would get better.

5
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,160
<i>I can't forgive your mom</i>
<i>like you want me to, Mr. Ki.</i>

6
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,880
<i>I'll make it up to you.</i>

7
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,080
<i>Let me be the one</i>
<i>to make amends for everything.</i>

8
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,440
<i>Because of you,</i>

9
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,680
<i>I had to become strong</i>
<i>like my mom taught me to be.</i>

10
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,720
You…

11
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,360
PREVIOUSLY

12
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,920
Please, don't hurt me!

13
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,320
- Help!
- Mrs. Sorn.

14
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,080
- Mrs. Sorn. Mrs. Sorn!
- Help me!

15
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,960
Let me go, I'm scared!

16
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,960
Please, don't hurt me!

17
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,520
- Mrs. Sorn, what's wrong?
- I'm scared!

18
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,960
- Hey!
- Ow!

19
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,480
Nun, help me.

20
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,720
- Mom.
- What are you doing to my mom?

21
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,920
I didn't do anything.

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,920
She just woke up and screamed.

23
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,400
If you didn't do it,

24
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,080
why would my mom be shaking like this?

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,200
Mom, what happened?

26
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,640
She…

27
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,480
She tried to kill me. Help me.

28
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,840
I'm scared.

29
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,200
Mrs. Sorn. What are you talking about?

30
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,320
She tried to kill me.
She held my head underwater.

31
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,040
She wanted me dead!

32
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,720
She wanted me to drown!

33
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,600
So you really did hurt my mom

34
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,000
and tried to make everyone
believe she attempted suicide?!

35
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,080
I think we should call the police.

36
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,320
This is my family's business.

37
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,520
I'll handle it myself.

38
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,520
Ki.

39
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,600
If you tell me what you want,
I'll take care of everything for you.

40
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,480
What do you say?

41
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,040
Thank you,

42
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,000
but I think our family
should deal with this.

43
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,040
You heard her.

44
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,600
I'll do whatever Miss Nun decides.

45
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,040
Mom, don't be afraid.

46
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,240
No one can hurt you now.

47
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,120
You just woke up. You're still confused.

48
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,080
And Ms. Ve didn't hurt you.

49
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,320
I'm not confused.
I remember. I'm not confused.

50
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,680
She tried to kill me. I'm not confused.

51
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,400
She's not confused.

52
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,240
This woman really tried to kill her.

53
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,800
Mint.

54
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,880
If you're talking about what Mom told you,

55
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,480
that's not enough to accuse Ms. Ve.

56
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,000
Of course I have proof.

57
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,440
That's mom's phone.

58
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,600
Yes, I went to get it myself.

59
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,000
I just remembered

60
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,640
she told me that
if anything happened to her,

61
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,400
I should check her phone immediately.

62
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,960
When I found out she woke up,
I went to get it right away.

63
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,240
Mrs. Sorn's phone, ma'am.

64
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,400
She never locks it.

65
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,240
She must have known
something would happen.

66
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,840
So, she told me this.

67
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,800
And since it wasn't locked,

68
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,920
I found this voice recording.

69
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,320
<i>So what you really want</i>

70
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,040
<i>is to see me die, right?</i>

71
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,080
<i>Yes!</i>

72
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,400
<i>I want to see you die.</i>

73
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,320
<i>But not like this, Mrs. Sorn.</i>

74
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,720
<i>Because this isn't</i>
<i>nearly enough to pay for what you've done.</i>

75
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,160
- Mom. Mom.
- Mom. Mom.

76
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,080
- Mom.
- You really are heartless.

77
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,440
You meant to kill her.

78
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,480
I didn't do it!

79
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,200
No, please!

80
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,960
- Get her out.
- Mom.

81
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,120
Get her out. I'm scared!

82
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,720
I'm scared! Get her out of here!

83
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,280
Get her out…

84
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Can you tell me
what really happened that day?

85
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,000
Tell me everything.

86
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,240
Your mom recorded that.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,840
But it's not what you think, Mr. Ki.

88
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,200
Then what is it?

89
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,320
What were you two fighting about?

90
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,280
It wasn't just about me, was it?

91
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,400
I thought we agreed

92
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,880
there would be no more secrets between us.

93
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,320
I can't tell you everything.

94
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,080
But can you trust me?

95
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,880
I really don't know
what happened to your mom.

96
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,200
How can I trust you

97
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,920
when you don't even trust me enough

98
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,720
to tell me everything?

99
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,360
Ki. Ms. Ve.

100
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,600
What's going on?

101
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,840
Excuse me.

102
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,280
What happened? I thought your mom woke up.

103
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,120
Why do you two
look like you just had a fight?

104
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,560
Hey.

105
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,680
Calm down, man.

106
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,280
You can tell me everything.

107
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,080
RECEPTION

108
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,480
So you thought that if Mrs. Sorn died,

109
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
you'd get away with it easily?

110
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,960
Too bad she's strong. She survived.

111
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,320
But you won't.

112
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,800
The recording says it all

113
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,480
that you're the one who hurt her.

114
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
You mean the edited recording?

115
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,880
Are you saying she framed you?

116
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,760
Do you really think

117
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,960
Ki would believe that?

118
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,920
Dream on. No son would ever

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,760
take the side of someone
who tried to kill his own mother.

120
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,600
Or are you in on this too?

121
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,559
Is that why you conveniently
have her phone and the recording?

122
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,680
So framing Mom isn't enough for you?

123
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
You're trying to frame me too now?

124
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,160
If you've gone this far,
I should applaud you.

125
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,800
Even if Mr. Ki's married, you're still
willing to be used to help frame someone.

126
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,320
If he knew how much you loved him,
I'm sure he'd be touched.

127
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,880
You don't have to mock me.

128
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,280
I'm not mocking you.
I'm just reminding you

129
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,600
that even if I weren't here,
Mr. Ki would never choose you.

130
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,080
Otherwise, he wouldn't have overlooked you
and asked me to marry him instead.

131
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,640
You…

132
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,800
And you should know this.

133
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,360
If this whole thing
was planned by you and Mrs. Sorn

134
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,600
to risk her life like that,

135
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,120
and she really ends up dying,

136
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,760
then you'll be an accomplice
and a murderer too.

137
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,360
Mint, stop it.

138
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,320
Why do you have to fight?

139
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,840
Ki.

140
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,600
She accused me and Mom.

141
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,160
Everyone heard the evidence already,
and she's still trying to twist the truth.

142
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,600
Then I'll find my own proof
that I didn't do it.

143
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,000
What proof could you possibly have?

144
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,320
The security camera footage
from the house.

145
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,240
I'm sure that before I left the room,
Mrs. Sorn was perfectly fine.

146
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,120
The timestamps will tell the truth.

147
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,000
Ki, don't believe her.

148
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,360
In situations like this,
the accused should have the chance

149
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,680
to present their own evidence too.

150
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,040
Are you taking the side of a criminal?

151
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,440
I don't like judging people,
especially not just based on your words.

152
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,040
What's that supposed to mean?

153
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,200
Enough, Mint.

154
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
I don't jump to conclusions either,

155
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
not without clear evidence.

156
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,640
Ki.

157
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,040
Thank you for trying to help my mom,

158
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,680
but from now on, please let this
stay a matter within my family.

159
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
Why is there no footage at all?

160
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,840
Mm.

161
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,320
Looks like the cameras were broken.

162
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,400
None of the footage
from any camera recorded anything.

163
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,960
- Hm?
- When I checked the saved files,

164
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,080
it seems they've been down
for at least a week.

165
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,160
All of them are broken?

166
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,320
How is that even possible?

167
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,760
If they haven't been checked in a while,

168
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,200
the owner might not even realize
they were broken.

169
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,320
Hello?

170
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,160
What? Teacher's condition has worsened?

171
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,240
Mrs. Sorn.

172
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,960
THREE MINUTES

173
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Mom.

174
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
- Mom!
- Mom!

175
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,360
Mom!

176
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,160
Mom. Nun, anything?

177
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,880
Uh.

178
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,000
Mom.

179
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,720
Mom.

180
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,000
Mom!

181
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,440
Hathai, run!

182
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,680
No! No, Hathai!

183
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,360
Run! Run away now!

184
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,320
- Teacher.
- Hathai!

185
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,640
Teacher. Teacher.

186
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,400
Hathai.

187
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,320
Teacher.

188
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,800
Those heartless people want to kill you.

189
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,160
No one can hurt me, Teacher.

190
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,600
Are you okay?

191
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,640
Prae told me you fainted
before I got here.

192
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,360
I don't know how much longer I'll last.

193
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,680
But I won't let them hurt you.

194
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,080
That woman is capable of anything.

195
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,400
She's not even afraid of death,

196
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,560
as long as she wins,
as long as she gets everything.

197
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,480
Someone like that

198
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,640
is no different from a demon.

199
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,360
She really is a demon, just like you said.

200
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,800
So then,

201
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,200
how do I defeat a demon?

202
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,240
You have to become one too.

203
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,320
Only then can you win.

204
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,120
Mom.

205
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,160
After coming back from the hospital,

206
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,880
have you remembered anything else?

207
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,560
I'm thirsty.

208
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,760
I'll get you some water.

209
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,040
Why are you pretending to be scared of me,

210
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,280
when you know I never did anything to you?

211
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,440
What's wrong with you, Mrs. Sorn?

212
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,200
Help! I'm scared!

213
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,920
- Mrs. Sorn.
- I'm scared.

214
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,280
What are you doing?

215
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,160
Were you waiting for everyone to leave
so you could hurt her again?

216
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,880
You're really something else.

217
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,440
Hey.

218
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,800
Mr. Ki.

219
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,600
What's going on?

220
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,080
Mom.

221
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,760
- Mom.
- If I hadn't walked in,

222
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,400
no one would know what had happened again.

223
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,960
No one saw what Ms. Ve was about to do,

224
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,600
but I saw you trying to hurt my wife.

225
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,760
I'm scared. Help me.

226
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,040
What are you trying to do to my mom again?

227
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,000
I just came to check on her.

228
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,200
To see if her so-called sudden confusion

229
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
has improved.

230
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,640
But it clearly hasn't.

231
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,880
I won't bother her anymore,

232
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,760
so she doesn't get confused again
and go accusing me.

233
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,880
I'm going to make sure
she ends up in jail.

234
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,760
Nun.

235
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,480
Mom.

236
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,920
Let's get you some rest first.

237
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,240
- Let's go.
- Let me help.

238
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,920
The security cameras in the house
are all broken?

239
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,120
Yes.

240
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,480
I had a technician check.
He said there's no footage at all.

241
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,960
Right now, I don't have
any evidence to clear myself.

242
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,920
What about the audio clip from Aunt Sorn?

243
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,720
What did Ki say about that?

244
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
I haven't talked to him about it yet.

245
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,240
But that clip was clearly edited.

246
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,520
Thinking back,

247
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,680
it was like she was trying to provoke me
to make me say

248
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,480
I wanted her dead.

249
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,440
So what you really want

250
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,040
is to see me die, right?

251
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,600
It's come this far.

252
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,600
Then say it. Say it out loud
you want me to die.

253
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,760
But now, I don't have anything to prove
my innocence, so I don't want to say much.

254
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,960
Ms. Ve.

255
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,480
If there's anything I can do to help,

256
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,040
please just tell me.

257
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,280
Thank you.

258
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,480
I'm on your side, no matter what.

259
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,840
Wait for me just a moment, I'll be back.

260
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Hey, wait for me.

261
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,760
You came to see me?

262
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,960
I was just passing by.
I didn't mean to see you.

263
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,640
Your grandma let you out of the hospital?

264
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,880
Yes.

265
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,200
And…

266
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,520
I just dropped by to let you know
that I'm out of the hospital,

267
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,599
so you don't end up
going there for nothing.

268
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,280
Huh.

269
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,040
But then again, you probably
don't have time for that anyway.

270
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Yeah, I've been busy

271
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,160
- with school, and with Ms. Ve.
- Huh.

272
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,880
You're so open about your priorities.

273
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,680
So, you don't have to worry about me,
like you said before.

274
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,120
Well, you're fine now, aren't you?

275
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,840
So go back to your important matters.

276
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,400
My story's done.

277
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,800
Guess you won't have time
for the cake anymore.

278
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,600
Might as well feed it to the dogs.

279
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,760
What's her problem?

280
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,920
Please wait here, Mrs. Sorn.
I'll get you something to eat.

281
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,520
Mrs. Sorn.

282
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,920
I'm here to check on you.

283
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,720
I brought your favorite flowers.

284
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,080
Do you like them?

285
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,000
Whan.

286
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
- Whan!
- Yes, ma'am.

287
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,160
- I want to go upstairs.
- Yes.

288
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,920
- Now.
- Yes.

289
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,880
Let's go.

290
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,160
Let's go.

291
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,880
Even now, she's still scared of you.

292
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,440
Ki and Nun won't let you
walk freely in this house for much longer.

293
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,120
And what does that have to do with you?

294
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,120
It has,
because I'll be the witness to everything.

295
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,000
I'll testify that you're the one
who almost killed her.

296
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,880
The evidence is ready, and so am I.

297
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,080
Remember to be this tough
in front of the police.

298
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,200
The truth is still the truth.
I didn't do anything to Mrs. Sorn.

299
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,120
Stop making empty claims.

300
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,200
Didn't you say you had proof
of your innocence?

301
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,680
Then show it. Come on, show it! Now!

302
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,200
So you lied that day, didn't you?

303
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,440
People like you,
always insisting you're innocent,

304
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,400
but when it's time to prove it,
there's nothing

305
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,120
because there's nothing to prove.
So what excuse do you have now?

306
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,440
Even if I don't have evidence yet,

307
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,680
liars will be exposed eventually.

308
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,760
And the ones helping liars,

309
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,680
they'll be exposed too.

310
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,560
You.

311
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,760
Hey!

312
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Ow!

313
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,680
Miss Mint!

314
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,640
Ouch!

315
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,960
Miss Mint, calm down.

316
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,240
- Miss Mint.
- Stop right now.

317
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,160
Mintra, stop!

318
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,840
What are you doing? Get out of the way!

319
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,720
My nephew lives in this house.

320
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,760
I won't let Kita witness
this kind of violence from you.

321
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,560
At least show some respect
to the homeowners.

322
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,560
Or should I call Ki

323
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
to deal with what you've just done?

324
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,680
Are you seriously siding with a criminal?

325
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,920
I don't care who's good or bad,

326
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,320
and I don't want to know either.

327
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,040
All I know is you need to leave.

328
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,440
Go.

329
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,320
Good thing it's just a bruise.

330
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,640
Apply a cold compress
and it'll heal quickly.

331
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,680
I'll do it myself.

332
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Thank you
for getting Miss Mintra to leave.

333
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,160
Even if I hadn't,

334
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
you probably
could've handled her yourself.

335
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,840
You're good at everything, after all.

336
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,520
Oh,

337
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,440
and you've got people caring about you,

338
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,320
taking care of you.

339
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,880
Ki.

340
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,840
And also Mr. Pete.

341
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
So,

342
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,920
did you really hurt Mrs. Sorn
like Mintra said?

343
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,080
If I answer you, will you believe me?

344
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,840
You're right. I shouldn't have asked.

345
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,560
What criminal ever admits to being one?

346
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,200
And anyway,
I never thought you were a saint.

347
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,960
And I never intended

348
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,480
to believe anything you say anyway.

349
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,480
You're pretty straightforward, aren't you?

350
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
But still,
your words don't match your heart.

351
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,800
If you thought I was bad,
you wouldn't have sent Miss Mintra away

352
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,680
and helped me.

353
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,960
I helped you for Ki and Kita's sake.

354
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,920
Because no matter what,

355
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,120
you matter a lot to both of them.

356
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,120
No one is more important than family.

357
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,280
How could you say something like that?

358
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,320
You're married to Ki.

359
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,600
So what?

360
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,760
I'm still just an outsider.

361
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,160
And now that this has happened,

362
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,320
those promises we made,

363
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,160
I can't expect anything anymore.

364
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,320
I'll keep my promise no matter what.

365
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,240
You'll get everything back.

366
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,360
Are the documents about me, Mom,

367
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,120
Nun and Kita moving to England ready yet?

368
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,840
Be careful walking, Mom.

369
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,480
I think you should start
taking supplements too.

370
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,280
Or…

371
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,280
is there anything else you want?

372
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,920
No, dear.

373
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,000
Just make sure
I never see that Ve woman again.

374
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,280
I'm afraid she'll hurt me again.

375
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,160
Okay.

376
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,200
Then, please rest.

377
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,680
How much longer do I have to
pretend to be a patient?

378
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
Nun.

379
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,280
I need to talk to you
about something important.

380
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,280
If it's important to you,

381
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,400
it must be about Wanvela.

382
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,960
Hm. Yes.

383
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,080
She's the most important matter right now.

384
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,280
Then I have nothing to say to you.

385
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,800
Wanvela is Hathai.

386
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,440
She's Dad's daughter. She's still alive.

387
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,120
It's time we gave everything back to her.

388
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,080
What are you talking about?

389
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,240
That woman is Dad's daughter?

390
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,000
So she planned to lie to all of us,

391
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,120
came into our family,

392
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,800
took care of Kita, and married you.

393
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,320
That's clearly deception.

394
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,560
I knew.

395
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,560
That's why I married her.

396
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,600
Because I want to make it right,
to give her everything back.

397
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,640
Why should she get everything back?

398
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,240
I'm Dad's daughter too.

399
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,560
But we came later, Nun.

400
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,000
You know since Mom came into this family,

401
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,160
Hathai and Mrs. Kitinee lost Dad,

402
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,560
lost everything.

403
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,400
We should return it to her.

404
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,120
I've prepared everything.
Once we return what's rightfully hers,

405
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,920
we'll move to England.

406
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,360
Let's start over.

407
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,920
I'll take care of you, Mom, and Kita.

408
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Come with me.

409
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,560
I'm so confused.

410
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,400
Please give me time to think.

411
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,200
Ugh, and here I was wondering who it was.

412
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,800
I told you not to come into my room.

413
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,560
I was just checking

414
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,720
whether you had slipped up
in front of anyone.

415
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,840
Don't worry about me.

416
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,400
Looks like
Ve doesn't seem to believe I'm sick.

417
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,240
She dared say to my face
that I'm faking it.

418
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,720
As long as Mr. Ki and Miss Nun believe it,
that's all that matters.

419
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,400
I'll handle the rest.

420
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,840
Oh? That's Kita's ball.

421
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,480
Mom, I brought your vitamins.

422
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,960
Why are you in Mom's bedroom?

423
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,440
Uh,

424
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,120
I was just checking on Mrs. Sorn.

425
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,320
She's afraid someone will hurt her.
So I came in to make sure she's okay.

426
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,360
If there's nothing else,
I'll take my leave.

427
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,400
When Uncle Pat visits,

428
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,840
your condition seems to improve.

429
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,840
Well, I won't bother you anymore.

430
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,800
Nun.

431
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
Kita?

432
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,680
Where is he? He's not upstairs either.

433
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,480
Oh.

434
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Kita, what's wrong?

435
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,440
What happened? Tell me.

436
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,600
Grandma's not sick. She tried to hurt you.

437
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
There, there.

438
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,720
Why would she do that?

439
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,320
Grandma's unwell.
Maybe she said something confusing,

440
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,080
and you misunderstood.

441
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,320
It's okay, I'll talk to her.

442
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,120
Don't worry, Kita.

443
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,080
Alright?

444
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,680
There, there.

445
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,560
Nun.

446
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,880
Don't misunderstand Pat.

447
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,440
But he shouldn't have been
in your bedroom, Mom.

448
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,840
- Mom.
- Nun…

449
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,400
Nun,

450
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,920
Pat's been with our family for years,
since your father was still alive.

451
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,120
He's helped me with everything,
never once complained.

452
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,480
He's practically family to us.

453
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,520
Then he must know everything

454
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,320
about Mrs. Kitinee and Hathai, right?

455
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,960
Why are you bringing up those two again?

456
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,880
I want to know the whole truth.

457
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,520
What did you do to them?

458
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,520
Did you…

459
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,440
have Uncle Pat
kill Mrs. Kitinee and Hathai?

460
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,800
Otherwise, why would you be searching
for Hathai to see if she's alive or dead?

461
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,440
You don't have to answer me.

462
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,080
I'll ask Uncle Pat myself.

463
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,240
Nun.

464
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,160
They're the ones who tried to kill us.

465
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,600
Do you know, when you were little,

466
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,960
that girl Hathai
tried to push you into the pool?

467
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,200
Luckily, I saw it in time,
otherwise, you would've drowned.

468
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,880
And Kitinee accused me,

469
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,960
said you were another man's child.

470
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,520
After everything they did to us,

471
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,120
you think I should've just stayed quiet?

472
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,520
I couldn't let them hurt you.
I had to protect my daughter.

473
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
I…

474
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,800
I did everything for you, dear.

475
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,360
No matter who accuses me,

476
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,240
I don't care.

477
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,840
I've endured all of it,

478
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,080
but I had to protect you.

479
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,800
I had to make sure you were safe.

480
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,240
No one could ever hurt you.
You understand me, don't you?

481
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,360
You understand me?

482
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,680
Mom…

483
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,280
Nun.

484
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,880
You can't stand pretending
to be sick anymore, can you?

485
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,480
Why?

486
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,600
What's wrong with wanting to get up
and feel alive again? Is that a crime?

487
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,480
I know everything now.
You've been faking it.

488
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,720
But who's going to believe

489
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,720
that you'd risk your own life
just to take me down?

490
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,880
You said it yourself

491
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,280
that you can do more than you say.

492
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,600
As for me,

493
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,920
I can do a lot more than you think.

494
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Haven't you ever wondered

495
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,160
how Mr. Ki and Miss Nun will feel
when they find out their own mother

496
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,760
is this rotten inside,
so cruel she'd go this far?

497
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,640
My children believe me.

498
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,240
They don't believe you.

499
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,400
Don't you remember?

500
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,400
Back when Mr. Terd was alive,
he never believed your mom either.

501
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,800
He only believed me.

502
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,880
What are you doing?

503
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,040
The same thing I did to your mother.

504
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,880
Stop!

505
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,160
I said stop! What are you doing?!

506
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,040
I'll show you

507
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,040
that I can do anything.

508
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,680
No!

509
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,400
Stop!

510
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,720
Help me!

511
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,560
Nee.

512
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,600
What's going on here?

513
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
What are you doing to her again?

514
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,520
Mrs. Sorn.

515
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,520
DIE

516
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,480
Mrs. Sorn, stop!

517
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,520
- Hey.
- Ow!

518
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
Ouch!

519
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,520
Mrs. Sorn, stop!

520
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,320
Die.

521
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,840
Mrs. Sorn.

522
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,679
- Help me!
- Mrs. Sorn!

523
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,600
- Help!
- Mrs. Sorn.

524
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,480
- Hey, Mom!
- Help me!

525
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,400
- Mom!
- Mom!

526
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,800
Ms. Ve!

527
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,159
Mom!

528
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,760
- Mom!
- Nun, help me.

529
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,400
She… She's going to kill me.

530
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,239
She's going to kill me.

531
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,640
So your mask finally comes off.

532
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,560
After what you've done to her,
you still dare to deny it?

533
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,400
I…

534
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,400
I never thought

535
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,960
you'd actually hurt my mom like this.

536
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,760
Even when she's sick, how could you?

537
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,600
Nun, stay with Mom.

538
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,560
You're coming with me.

539
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,440
I'm scared…

540
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,400
Nun.

541
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,120
Mr. Ki. Mr. Ki.

542
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,920
I tried to make everything right,

543
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,480
but you just made it worse.

544
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,480
Mr. Ki, please, I didn't do it.

545
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,920
You have to listen to me.

546
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,040
Ow!

547
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,560
After all this,

548
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,360
what's left for me to hear?

549
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,520
What's left for me to believe?

550
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,760
That woman is capable of anything.

551
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,800
She's not even afraid of death,

552
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,960
as long as she wins,
as long as she gets everything.

553
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,880
Someone like that

554
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,040
is no different from a demon.

555
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,720
So then,

556
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,280
how do I defeat a demon?

557
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,400
You have to become one too.

558
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,840
Only then can you win.

559
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,400
Mr. Ki.

560
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,320
Your mother is a demon.

561
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,120
She deceives everyone so easily.

562
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,640
It's my fault I was weak.

563
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,960
I'm not even half as cruel as your mother.

564
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,600
That's her,

565
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,560
the woman who tried to kill Mrs. Sorn.

566
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,880
What's going on here?

567
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,080
I called Mr. Singha to bring the police.

568
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,280
I won't let the person who hurt Mom
stay in this house any longer.

569
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,680
And I hope this time,

570
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,680
you won't take your wife's side.

571
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,200
Take her away.

572
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,520
Please come to the station
and give your statement, ma'am.

573
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,840
Thank you for taking care of it.

574
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,440
If you ask me, I'll do anything.

575
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,120
- Mom.
- Nun.

576
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,080
I'm scared.

577
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,120
The police took her away, Mom.

578
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,120
Really?

579
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,640
No one can hurt you now.

580
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,640
Mm.

581
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,880
If you and Ki

582
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,520
hadn't come in time, I'd be dead by now.

583
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,560
No one will hurt you again.

584
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
She won't come back here anymore.

585
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,960
I believe she'll never come back.

586
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,400
- Can you go check?
- Alright.

587
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,520
Sir.

588
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,960
Sir!

589
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,240
Hey!

590
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,680
Ma'am, get down!

591
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,680
Hey!

592
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,200
<i>On the way to take Wanvela in,</i>

593
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,160
something happened.

594
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,080
NEXT EPISODE

595
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,800
So, she's dead, right?

596
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,880
<i>My men handled it.</i>

597
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,960
<i>I need to talk to you</i>
<i>about Nun's test results.</i>

598
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,520
I should've started
suspecting this a long time ago,

599
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,560
<i>You still haven't stopped seeing her?</i>

600
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,200
I need to be with my girlfriend.

601
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,920
Why are you doing this?

602
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,800
<i>Because I love you.</i>

603
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,960
She's agreed to get married.

604
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,000
<i>I'm going to marry Singha</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

605
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,560
