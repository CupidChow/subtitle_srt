1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,720
I heard Teacher Rawee
call Wanvela "Hathai."

2
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,360
She tricked me.
She changed her name and fooled us all.

3
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,280
- <i>Hathai…</i>
- <i>I came to show you</i>

4
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,600
<i>that you can't control everyone</i>
<i>through fear.</i>

5
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,240
<i>Your family</i>
<i>is finally back together, Mr. Terd.</i>

6
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,120
<i>This time you won't get away, Hathai.</i>

7
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,120
That's my wife.

8
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,040
Ve is still alive.

9
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,920
PREVIOUSLY

10
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,440
Excuse me.

11
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,240
Thank you, Miss Mintra,
for helping with today's press event.

12
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,080
But now,

13
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,160
please allow the two of us,
husband and wife,

14
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,960
to give the interview.

15
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,840
- You.
- Oh.

16
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,280
‪-Wow.
‪-You two look so good together.

17
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,320
‪-Look this way, please.
‪-This camera too.

18
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,920
Why did you suddenly get married

19
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,640
and announce your marriage here, Mr. Ki?
There wasn't any news beforehand.

20
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,120
Yeah.

21
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,600
I wanted our relationship
to stay private at first,

22
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,560
so we didn't tell anyone.

23
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,000
And today, I wanted to make it public
because after the wedding,

24
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,080
I'll be joining Mr. Ki
in managing Suttha Group.

25
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,280
What?

26
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,680
Ki, I just learned about this now.

27
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,160
I wanted everyone
to find out together today, Mom.

28
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,960
Please take care of me
at my new workplace, the Suttha Group,

29
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,560
Mother.

30
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,880
I'm terminating all contracts
between our companies, Mrs. Sorn!

31
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,680
Please calm down, Mr. Decha.

32
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,560
Calm down?!

33
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,320
Your son just announced he was married

34
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,720
and even introduced that woman
in front of the press.

35
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,160
He embarrassed
and humiliated my daughter like that.

36
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,960
No parent could stand that!

37
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,440
Please, sir,

38
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,400
don't mix business with personal matters.

39
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,800
The Suttha Group's offer still stands

40
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,120
and you'll still earn all the benefits.

41
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,120
No matter how good the deal is,

42
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,240
if I lose face, it's over.

43
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,040
Come on, dear, Mint.

44
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,800
Sir. Sir.

45
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,520
You see what you've done, Ki?

46
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,560
Have you lost your mind?

47
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,400
You announced to everyone
that you married that woman.

48
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,680
You didn't want to get engaged to Mint,
so you brought her here to fool me, right?

49
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,000
I told you to bring our marriage
certificate, but you wouldn't listen.

50
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,600
Ki, you…

51
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,640
Oh, but that's fine.
You can see it when we get home.

52
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,160
Move, Ki.

53
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,960
I can't let you hurt my wife, Mom.

54
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,680
I said move. Ki.

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,880
- Mom.
- I said move.

56
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,080
- Mom, please stop.
- You're protecting her?

57
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,400
- Mom.
- Move.

58
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,200
- Mom.
- I said move, Ki.

59
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,000
- Mrs. Kanisorn.
- Mom…

60
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,920
- Could we get a quick interview?
- Yes.

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,640
Is it true that Mr. Decha
canceled the project today?

62
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,280
Was there some conflict?

63
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,600
It's nothing.
It's probably just a misunderstanding.

64
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,640
Now that no one's watching,
we don't have to keep pretending, right?

65
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,840
I didn't force you.

66
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,440
You agreed to this deal yourself, Hathai.

67
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,440
Mr. Ki?

68
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,440
What were you and Miss Ve talking about?

69
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,360
Teacher Ve…

70
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,800
Uh…

71
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,440
Miss Ve!

72
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,400
Miss Ve! Miss Ve. Miss Ve.

73
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,520
KANISORN'S FAMILY

74
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,800
KANISORN'S FAMILY

75
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,760
KIRIN'S FAMILY, WIPUTH: NUN'S PARTNER

76
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,640
GRANDMA MANEE'S FAMILY

77
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
YOUNG BUSINESSMAN: KIRIN LIANGSUTTHA

78
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,480
What?

79
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,120
THAILAND, MISS WANVELA PATEL

80
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,320
NEW ZEALAND, WANVELA PATEL

81
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,040
Miss Ve is Hathai.

82
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,880
You really are Hathai.

83
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,280
Yes, it's me.

84
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,160
You have no idea
how happy I am that you're alive.

85
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,040
Hathai, what happened in that house?

86
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,320
How did the fire start?
Was someone trying to hurt you?

87
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,520
You don't need to know.
Even if I told you, there's no evidence.

88
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,440
And if you knew why I came back,

89
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,400
are you sure you'd still be happy?

90
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,600
I don't care why you came back
and why you hide it from me.

91
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,600
Now that I know the truth,
I'll do what I promised.

92
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,240
I'll return everything to you.

93
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,280
How will you do that?

94
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,360
My life, my parents' lives,

95
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,120
and the people who died because of me.

96
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,920
You can't fix that, Mr. Ki! You can't!

97
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,920
Hathai, Hathai.

98
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,080
Listen to me. I'll return
everything that belongs to you.

99
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,560
Everything under Liangsuttha
will go back to you.

100
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
And how exactly will you do that?

101
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,480
Marry me. And I'll give it all back.

102
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,160
I'm not sure anymore
if your offer is as sincere as you claim,

103
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,320
or if you're just using me
for your own gain.

104
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,960
I've never lied to you
or used you, Hathai.

105
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,280
Please trust me.

106
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,680
But I don't trust your mother.

107
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,280
Whatever you plan,
she'll never let it happen easily.

108
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,760
You saw what happened today.

109
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,280
But as your husband,
I'll protect you myself.

110
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,800
Let time prove it.

111
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,720
And you promised me
you wouldn't tell her who I am.

112
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,680
I'd never tell her you're Hathai.

113
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,880
Come on. Hurry up.

114
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,720
- What?
- We just went public today.

115
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,840
- Don't make people suspicious.
- Hurry.

116
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,440
Mr. Kirin, let us take photos, please.

117
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,840
Of course.

118
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,360
- Alright.
- This camera.

119
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
- This way too.
- One more.

120
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,680
- Alright.
- Yes.

121
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,280
- Nice. One more, please.
- This way too.

122
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,880
Yes.

123
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,520
I won't let you hurt Nun or Mrs. Sorn,

124
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,760
Hathai.

125
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,200
What are you planning?

126
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,400
I just got home, and there's
already people waiting to greet me.

127
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,120
Who allowed you back in this house?

128
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,560
Mom,

129
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,840
Ve married me.
Where I live, my wife lives with me.

130
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,640
Oh, right.

131
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,200
I forgot to show you last time.
So I brought it today.

132
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,320
Our marriage certificate.

133
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,120
Mom.

134
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,320
Mom!

135
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,080
It's fine, it's just paper.

136
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,880
But legally, Mr. Ki and I

137
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,600
are still the same.

138
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,920
Do you think I care?

139
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,080
You still have no right to stay
in this house. Get out

140
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,320
before I have someone drag you out.

141
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,520
Mr. Ki,

142
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,160
you said you owned this house.

143
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,840
If I'm your wife,
then I have the same legal right, don't I?

144
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,920
Your mother is just a resident.

145
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,240
Does she have the right
to kick anyone out?

146
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,840
- You!
- Mom, please stop.

147
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,240
Ve is my wife now.
Nothing can change that.

148
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,360
We'll still respect you.

149
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,840
We just hope you can open your heart
to our love.

150
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,640
Love? I don't believe it!

151
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,240
You don't want to marry Mint?
Fine, I won't force you.

152
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,480
But to marry that woman
just to spite me? I can't accept that!

153
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,480
Mom, I didn't do this to spite you.

154
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,240
Oh, and one more thing.

155
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,320
Forget about sending Kita
to boarding school.

156
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,520
Mr. Ki already has his passport
and flight ticket.

157
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Ki. How did you get those?

158
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,800
He's my son. Of course I can get them.

159
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,600
I hope from now on,
you won't use Kita to threaten me again.

160
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,600
From now on,
whoever wants to send Kita anywhere

161
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,120
will need Mr. Ki's permission first.

162
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,800
Let's have Aunt Kob clean everything up.

163
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,520
Mr. Ki, I'm tired.

164
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,240
Take me to your room, please.

165
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,120
Looks like he's trying
to make his mom die of heartbreak.

166
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,320
He's just infatuated. She's using him.

167
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,280
He still doesn't know who she really is.
But he absolutely can't find out.

168
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,200
I never thought
she would survive that day.

169
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,600
And the corpse
found in that house was Jit's.

170
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,320
She must've been suspicious
so she looked for Jit.

171
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,520
Luckily Jit was already dead.

172
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,080
But can we really leave it like this?

173
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:40,360
I don't think it will just end with her
moving into this house as Mr. Ki's wife.

174
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,320
No matter what, I'll find a way
to get her out of this house.

175
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,120
You should do something

176
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,000
to protect yourself.

177
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,000
You should find someone you trust
to replace Mr. Ki.

178
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,440
Teacher Ve.

179
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,080
Kita, did you miss me?

180
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,600
I did. But you are
in here and in here with me.

181
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,240
Are you coming back to live here?

182
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes.

183
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,360
But Teacher Ve won't be living here
as a teacher anymore, Kita.

184
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,720
Then what will she be?

185
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,320
I'll be here as your father's wife

186
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,920
and another mother for you.

187
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,319
- Yay! I'm so happy!
- Oh.

188
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Aw.

189
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,040
Kita.

190
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,560
Are you really happy?

191
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,800
- Are you happy?
- Oh.

192
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,960
Hey.

193
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,240
Was the fire really just an accident?

194
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:32,320
Yes. I went to look for someone
who used to work in this house,

195
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,000
but it seems she had already died.

196
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
Then suddenly the fire broke out.

197
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,240
I was worried about you,
so I told Ki you contacted

198
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,080
Aunt Kob.

199
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,280
I really must apologize.

200
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,160
Miss Ve hiding
so many things from you like this

201
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,280
could put her in danger.

202
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,480
Do you think you can protect Miss Ve
all by yourself?

203
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,000
But she doesn't trust you.

204
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,800
And do you trust this friend of yours?
You know I'd never hurt anyone.

205
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,920
If you know what Ve is up to,
you should tell me.

206
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,200
Miss Ve wanted to meet Aunt Kob.

207
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,440
Why?

208
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,600
She wants to contact someone
who used to work in your house.

209
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,560
But she didn't tell me who.

210
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,120
I should be the one thanking you.

211
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,840
If you hadn't told Mr. Ki,
I might be dead.

212
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,720
But now Ki knows everything.

213
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,120
Never mind.

214
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,880
Even if he didn't find out today,
he would someday.

215
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,840
And…

216
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,320
about your marriage, was there a reason?

217
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,720
I don't believe you married for love.

218
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,920
Let that stay between me and Mr. Ki.

219
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,800
I owe you an apology

220
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,000
for hiding so many things from you,
even though you've always helped me.

221
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,640
But I just couldn't bring myself
to tell the truth.

222
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,000
Ms. Ve,

223
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,480
don't worry.
Even though you're married now,

224
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,240
I'll still help you in any way.

225
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,920
Just tell me.

226
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,080
Thank you so much.

227
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,320
It's Kita's lesson time now.
I'll excuse myself.

228
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,320
Uh, when did you get here?

229
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,120
What are you doing?

230
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,680
I'm sorry.

231
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,720
Could you step aside a bit?

232
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,720
I'm going to shower. Don't worry.
Nobody will suspect anything.

233
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,920
I'll sleep in Kita's room.

234
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,360
You can use this room as you like,
as agreed.

235
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,400
How long must we stay like this?

236
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,520
Until I've transferred
everything back to you.

237
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,160
Then I'll take Nun and Mom away from here,

238
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,800
away from Liangsuttha.

239
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,000
Your mother won't agree easily.

240
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,960
I'll try. Give me some time.

241
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,960
As for your identity,

242
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,680
I won't tell my mom. I'll keep it secret.

243
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,560
Just don't do anything rash.

244
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,800
Of course. I won't.

245
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,120
But you should worry more
about your mother.

246
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't know
what she might do to get rid of me next.

247
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,800
I sent a basket to apologize
and it was returned.

248
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,240
I called Mint, but got no answer.

249
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,840
I think our project
with Mint's family is ruined.

250
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,760
I've invested a lot in this project.

251
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,880
We can't let it be ruined
because of your brother and that woman.

252
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,400
What do you want me to do?
I've done everything I can.

253
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,200
I'll have you
run the company in place of Ki.

254
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,560
What… what did you say?

255
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,360
Your brother is blinded by that woman,
neglecting work.

256
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,880
I can't let the company suffer any more.

257
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,080
I want someone I can trust.

258
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,360
Nun,

259
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,960
you're the only child I have left.

260
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,880
But what can I do, Mom?

261
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,280
I'm not as talented as Ki. He's the one

262
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,480
who runs the company and the projects.

263
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,280
You expect me to replace him?
I can't handle that.

264
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,080
I won't let her
take everything back either.

265
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,480
What do you mean by that?

266
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,280
Who's taking everything back?

267
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,000
I mean I'll slowly
take back the work from Ki.

268
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,240
You'll learn along the way.
I believe you can do it.

269
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,760
Don't let that woman ruin our company.

270
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
- Is it straight now?
- Yes.

271
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,560
- Looks good, Auntie?
- Okay.

272
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,760
- Done.
- What are you doing?

273
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,640
Uh, well…

274
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,640
I ordered the portrait changed myself.

275
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,840
How dare you.

276
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,600
You think you own the house?

277
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,640
I am the owner, like you said.

278
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,480
You and your mother are just residents.

279
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,400
You.

280
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,000
Miss Nun.

281
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,160
Stop right now!

282
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,480
You bitch.

283
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,320
Mom.

284
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,880
Is the breakfast I ordered ready?

285
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,240
Yes.

286
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,560
Come eat with me. I'll make coffee.

287
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,160
Are you really going to let
her hurt me and do nothing?

288
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,400
I'll handle her myself.

289
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,800
I really want to know.

290
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,600
If Ki knew you hurt Nun,
what would he say?

291
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,720
If you run to Mr. Ki and tell on me,
don't say I'm cruel.

292
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,920
You…

293
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,160
I know some people want me dead.

294
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,080
But too bad, I'm not easy to kill.

295
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
What… what are you going to do?

296
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,600
What are you going to do to me?

297
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,720
What are you going to do to me?!
What are you doing?!

298
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,920
Mom!

299
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,320
- Ki, help me.
- Mom.

300
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,280
She's trying to hurt me, Ki! Look!

301
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,760
- She's hurting me…
- Come with me.

302
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,640
She's trying to hurt me.

303
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,040
What were you doing?

304
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,880
I was just making coffee.

305
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,000
But what I saw wasn't just that.

306
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,880
Maybe your mother's haunted
by her past sins.

307
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,680
Have you forgotten our agreement?

308
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,720
I haven't.

309
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,880
And I've never forgotten
what happened in this house either.

310
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,040
I'll stay calm

311
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,080
as long as nobody messes with me first.

312
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,120
That's why I told you to be calm.

313
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,320
You always react
emotionally to everything.

314
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,520
Me? Emotional?

315
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,280
If you weren't so blinded, you'd know
how your mom and sister feel about me.

316
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,080
You've always wanted revenge
on my mother, haven't you?

317
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,840
Is everything okay, Ms. Ve?

318
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,920
Did Ki do something to you?

319
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,160
I don't think you should meddle
in a husband-and-wife talk.

320
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,800
Mr. Ki.

321
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,040
Did I say something wrong?

322
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,720
Or aren't you used to it yet?
You should know what we are now.

323
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,760
You should know what you should mind
and what you shouldn't.

324
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,360
But I know about Ms. Ve
almost as much as you do.

325
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,520
Even if I don't know why she married you,

326
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,480
I can guess

327
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,480
it probably wasn't normal.

328
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,320
Ms. Ve,

329
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,280
if you're ever ready to tell me,

330
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,400
just let me know.
I'm ready to help you too.

331
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,720
Pete.

332
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Hey, Mr. Ki.

333
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,560
I don't have anything
I need your help with right now.

334
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,880
Please just go back.

335
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,760
I don't want you getting into trouble
because of me.

336
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,440
If there's nothing important,

337
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,040
then excuse us.

338
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,600
I've seen this kind of thing
many times already.

339
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,200
Even after that woman married Ki.

340
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,960
I've noticed
how he feels about Teacher Ve.

341
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,280
But I didn't think he'd dare
to show it so openly in front of Ki.

342
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,880
Since we're talking about this,
let me be honest.

343
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,440
Aside from Ging,

344
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,560
I see you as another big sister, Ploy.

345
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,040
If anyone were to take Ging's place,

346
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,160
I would want that person to be you.

347
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,040
Mom probably thinks the same way.

348
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,200
But I don't think that's possible anymore.

349
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,560
You saw it yourself.
Ki chose to marry Teacher Ve.

350
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,400
Those two won't last. Just wait and see.

351
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,760
It won't be long.

352
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,560
Uh…

353
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,360
Did that girl really try to hurt you?

354
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,600
I think she was trying to get back at me.
Luckily Ki showed up first.

355
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,480
Then we can't let this go. What if one day

356
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,480
she snaps and hurts you?

357
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,400
I won't let her lay a finger on me.

358
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,080
The problem is that Ki is completely taken
with her right now. So I can't do much.

359
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,160
We need to make him stop being so blinded.

360
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,560
Make him see that
she's a wicked, evil woman.

361
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,360
He has to realize she's just using him.

362
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,520
I'm sorry I didn't tell anyone about
the marriage. It happened so suddenly.

363
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,280
Exactly. It felt like a secret.

364
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,320
No one even knew Ki and Teacher Ve

365
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,800
were in love, let alone getting married.

366
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,040
Ploy, with feelings,
it doesn't always take time.

367
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,680
Just like when you married Ging, right?
That was fast too.

368
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,520
I'm just worried about you.

369
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,040
There are so many things
I want to say, but I can't.

370
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,840
But I want to warn you about that woman.

371
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,440
She's not sincere. She's using you.

372
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,440
And when you're no longer useful,
she'll toss you aside.

373
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,840
It's not like that, Ploy.

374
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,440
Don't see Ms. Ve in such a negative light.

375
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,560
So now I'm the one being negative?

376
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,560
If I really am,
then where is your wife right now?

377
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,040
Uh…

378
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,240
She had an appointment. She just left.

379
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,920
Did she say with whom?
Where? What it was about?

380
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,000
A wife shouldn't be keeping secrets
from her husband.

381
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,040
Mrs. Manee. Hello.

382
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,120
Ah.

383
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,560
You said you wouldn't go near Kirin.
You said you wouldn't try to replace Ging.

384
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,560
You were lying straight to my face.

385
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,320
Even if I'm married to Mr. Ki,

386
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,200
I would never touch anything
that belonged to Ms. Ging.

387
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,600
And you think I believe you? You promised

388
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,960
to help investigate her death,
and you couldn't do it.

389
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,400
And now, with your new status,

390
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,280
I guess you no longer need to help me.

391
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,920
A grandmother like me…

392
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,040
I guess I'll never get justice
for my granddaughter.

393
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,000
Whatever I promised, I will keep my word.

394
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,680
I won't seek justice only for myself,

395
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,120
Ms. Ging deserves justice too.

396
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,680
Then I'll trust you one more time.

397
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,040
I've contacted Ging's secretary,
the one Kanisorn fired

398
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,200
when she was seriously ill.

399
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,920
But I can't approach her myself.
I'll need you to do it.

400
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,760
I'll call and set up a meeting.

401
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,640
Once you learn something,
let me know right away.

402
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,200
Yes, I will.

403
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,320
I thought you said
you wouldn't use this room.

404
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,040
I'm not staying in this room,
but my clothes should be here.

405
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,920
So people won't get suspicious.

406
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,320
Where did you go?
Why are you just getting back?

407
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,480
I don't think I need to tell you.

408
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,840
Don't forget we're married now.

409
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,680
Wherever you go, whoever you're with,

410
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,760
you need to tell me. Or lie, if you must.

411
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,800
Just so people won't question
how our marriage works.

412
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,200
Why I never know where my wife is?
Who's she with?

413
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,600
And why are you…

414
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,280
Why are you mad at me now?

415
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,159
Where did you go? With who?

416
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:13,120
Or did you send Pete away
just to meet him outside?

417
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,880
I didn't go to see Mr. Pete.

418
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,920
Then who did you go with?

419
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,600
- I don't have to tell you. Let me go.
- No.

420
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,400
Not until you tell me.

421
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,560
- I won't. Let me go.
- Then we'll just stay like this.

422
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,880
Mr. Ki.

423
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,520
Mr. Ki.

424
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,000
Teacher Ve. Dad. Are you two fighting?

425
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,159
- No.
- N… No.

426
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,080
Not at all.

427
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,960
Not at all.

428
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,080
Is something wrong, Kita?

429
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,400
Can you read me a story?

430
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,199
‪FIVE LITTLE DUCKLINGS GO TO SCHOOL

431
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,440
- Ah, Mr. Pete.
- Yes?

432
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,360
Someone sent you these flowers.

433
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,960
- For me?
- Yes.

434
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,520
- And this envelope too.
- Alright.

435
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,560
- Thank you so much.
- Right.

436
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,960
Hm?

437
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,240
THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS HELPING ME
SORRY FOR IGNORING YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS

438
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,440
WANVELA
FRIDAY 9 P.M., KEEP IT TO YOURSELF

439
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,760
"Keep it to yourself."
She's asking me to meet her?

440
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,320
Madam asked me to tell you
to enjoy your drink while you wait.

441
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,720
She should be here shortly.

442
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,960
Thank you.

443
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

444
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,320
- Nice to see you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

445
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,240
Thank you.

446
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,640
Charging interest that high.
He must think we have no other choice.

447
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,160
Because of you, Ki, we lost
a major investor like Mint's family

448
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,600
and now we're stuck
with outrageous interest rates.

449
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,640
I'll talk to other financiers.
We need more options.

450
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,080
I'm not waiting anymore.
This project has to move forward now.

451
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,160
Shall we go?

452
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,680
Hey, isn't that Pete?

453
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,440
What a coincidence.

454
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,920
Aren't you going to say hi, Ki?

455
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,400
It's okay.

456
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,920
I forgot to tell you. While you and Mom
were talking to Mr. Wong about the loan,

457
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,080
I went to the restroom
and saw Teacher Ve there.

458
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,080
And now Pete's here too?
Isn't that all a bit too coincidental?

459
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,480
So I guess you know
Ki married that Teacher Ve.

460
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,960
They made a grand appearance
together at a big event.

461
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,920
I don't live under a rock.

462
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,320
So what do you want from me?

463
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,640
Neither I nor Mom approve of what Ki did.

464
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,600
To me, no one can replace Ging.

465
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,640
It's obvious that woman
only came into my son's life for comfort.

466
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,600
She's tricked both Kita
and Ki into loving her.

467
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,360
If you do nothing,

468
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,240
she'll strip Ging's legacy clean.

469
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,360
Kita will get nothing.

470
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,040
So… what do you want me to do?

471
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,360
You.

472
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,000
What's wrong, Ms. Ve?

473
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,120
Hey.

474
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,080
Hey.

475
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,200
Ms. Ve.

476
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,240
My close friend
is a partner at this hotel.

477
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,760
That's how I got a spare keycard.

478
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,720
Why is that woman staying here?
Don't tell me she's meeting Pete here.

479
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,640
Exactly. I'd like to know that too.

480
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,640
I'm sorry I made you upset.

481
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,480
You used to be
Mr. Terdthong's employee too, didn't you?

482
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:05,200
And you ended up living in this house
as his mistress, right?

483
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,680
Mom!

484
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,760
<i>What are you doing here? Don't tell me</i>

485
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,760
you're Kirin's representative.

486
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,520
I'm here as
the majority shareholder of Jade Biz.

487
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,720
<i>And I don't want you to ever regret</i>
<i>the time you've spent with me.</i>

488
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,960
Because every minute
I spend with you is meaningful.

489
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,040
Mr. Ki?

490
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,680
Mr. Ki. Mr. Ki!
