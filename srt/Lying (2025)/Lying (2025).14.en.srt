1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,840
<i>I'm here as</i>
<i>the majority shareholder of Jade Biz.</i>

2
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,040
<i>Mr. Ki transferred all his shares to me.</i>

3
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,520
Did Ki really give Gingyok's
Jade Biz shares to Wanvela?

4
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,120
<i>Call a board meeting immediately.</i>

5
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,720
If you're not mad at me,
if you don't hate me,

6
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,240
then how do you really feel about me?

7
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,400
<i>Or you…</i>

8
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,520
- Mr. Ki?
- Does he have a history of drug use?

9
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,320
<i>No one drugged me, Mom.</i>

10
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,120
I took them myself.

11
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,560
PREVIOUSLY

12
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,200
No. That's impossible.

13
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,800
I don't believe you'd
get involved with something like that.

14
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,760
Or you know who drugged you
and you're trying to defend her?

15
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,560
Auntie thinks Ms. Ve drugged you.

16
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
This has nothing to do with Ms. Ve, Mom.

17
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,960
Everything happened because of me.

18
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,160
Why are you defending her like this?

19
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,200
I'm not defending her, Mom.

20
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Ms. Ve and I just got married.

21
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,400
Why would she poison me?

22
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,960
She wants you dead,

23
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,840
so she can take everything from you.

24
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,880
You seem awfully fixated on wives
poisoning their husbands for inheritance.

25
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,320
Why? Is that something you've done before?

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,800
You.

27
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,600
Mom, I have a really bad headache.

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,120
Could you all leave?

29
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,040
I need to rest.

30
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,160
Fine.

31
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,480
I'll go.

32
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,840
But let me be clear.

33
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,240
I still don't believe
you took those drugs yourself.

34
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,839
Rest, dear.

35
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,160
Mr. Ki, how are you feeling?

36
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,960
You and Pete too.

37
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,760
Please leave.

38
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,240
I have nothing to say right now.

39
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,440
I don't believe

40
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,760
that Mr. Ki took the drugs willingly.

41
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,080
But Ki insisted that he did.

42
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,320
He probably said that because of me.

43
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,480
Otherwise, Mrs. Sorn
wouldn't stop accusing me.

44
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,400
Aunt Sorn won't stop anyway,

45
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,520
until she finds the real culprit.

46
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,160
Last night, when I saw him collapse,

47
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,600
I was terrified.

48
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,720
I didn't know what to do.

49
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,400
It felt like his heart
could stop at any second.

50
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,680
It reminded me
of when I saw my father collapse

51
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,760
and I couldn't do anything to help.

52
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,000
You were still very young then.

53
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,440
And Ki is safe now.

54
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,200
You don't have to worry anymore.

55
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,480
But I don't want anyone else
to suffer because of me.

56
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Ms. Ve,

57
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,240
please don't blame yourself.

58
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,440
None of this is your fault,

59
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,040
whether it's Ki or your father.

60
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,120
Thank you for trying to comfort me.

61
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,240
I'll always be here to comfort

62
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,760
and support you

63
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,120
as

64
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,960
a sincere friend.

65
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,520
What are you looking for?

66
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,960
The night Mr. Ki was poisoned,

67
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,240
you reheated the pizza.

68
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,760
I made the salad and a few snacks.

69
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,680
And all the ingredients
were the usual ones, right?

70
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,320
Yes. And Mr. Ki
didn't eat anything else after that.

71
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,680
There was one more thing.

72
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,280
What was it?

73
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,840
That night, Mr. Ki drank tea before bed.

74
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,720
Do you know who made it for him?

75
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,920
Let me ask you honestly.

76
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,880
Mrs. Sorn said you poisoned Mr. Ki.

77
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,200
Is it true?

78
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,840
I didn't do it.

79
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,320
And I'm trying to find out who did.

80
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,160
If you remember anything
or suspect anyone,

81
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,800
please let me know.

82
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,360
Yes. Madam also told me that.

83
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,160
Thank you for agreeing to this lunch.

84
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,720
Only because you've apologized
to us dozens of times.

85
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,400
Even if I had to apologize
100 times, I'd do it.

86
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,320
I don't want us to be at odds.

87
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,640
After all, your family and Mint

88
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,000
are more important than some people here.

89
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,800
Then you have to prove
that my daughter is truly

90
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,520
more valuable

91
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,720
than someone else here like you said.

92
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,440
Can't you see we have guests?

93
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,800
I see. So what?

94
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,240
You're the owner of the house, aren't you?

95
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,520
Why aren't you welcoming the guests?

96
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,720
You say you love my son so much,
you wouldn't hurt him.

97
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,400
Yet you ruined our family business.

98
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,280
Aren't you going to help at all?

99
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,320
But it seems like your guests
don't really want to see me.

100
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,039
Then help with something else.

101
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,760
Can you?

102
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,440
What would you like me to do?

103
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,920
Ms. Ve.

104
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,520
You're stuck in the kitchen, serving food

105
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,000
even though you're Mr. Ki's wife.

106
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,280
If Mr. Ki finds out,
he'll surely be upset.

107
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,920
It's okay.

108
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,040
It's just a small task. I can handle it.

109
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,000
Only dessert left to serve.

110
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,680
Yes.

111
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,520
The guests said
they're too full for dessert.

112
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,920
They just want coffee now.

113
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,040
Um…

114
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,920
I'll go make it then.

115
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,080
In that case, I'm done.
I'll excuse myself.

116
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,320
Not yet.

117
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,480
Mrs. Sorn said
you also have to clear the dishes.

118
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,680
You alone.

119
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,160
Your daughter-in-law is quite capable.

120
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,720
She seems very skilled
at this kind of work.

121
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,600
You say you studied abroad.

122
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,000
It must've been in garbage disposal
and dishwashing, right?

123
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,840
Let me help.

124
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,280
Sorry.

125
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,600
Hurry and clean this up.

126
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
Here.

127
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,960
It's dirty here.

128
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,960
- Should we go to the tea room?
- Yes.

129
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,880
- Sure.
- Let's go.

130
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,360
- Sounds good.
- Let's go.

131
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,000
Right this way.

132
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,480
Well.

133
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,280
This trash is so disgusting.

134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,480
Just like you.

135
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,320
Stop it right there, Miss Mint!

136
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,480
Trash will always be trash.

137
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,280
Don't think you're superior
just because you married Ki.

138
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,480
I doubt Ki even wants
to honor you that much.

139
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,240
It's just one marriage certificate.

140
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,880
No real wedding at all.

141
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,600
Weddings are a waste of time these days.

142
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,280
Society already knows I'm Ki's wife.

143
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,920
And it's backed by law.

144
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,520
Only a thick-skinned, dim-witted woman

145
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,800
would imagine she's more important
than the legal wife like me.

146
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,160
You! Wanvela!

147
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,320
Ms. Mint, if you think I'll just bow down
and clean up the mess you made,

148
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,520
you're dead wrong.

149
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,600
Stop right now!

150
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,200
Dad! Mom!

151
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,440
How dare you treat Mint like that?

152
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,240
This is my house!

153
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,240
Such low-class behavior!

154
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,120
I can't help it.

155
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,680
Someone here behaves even lower than me.

156
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,320
If I tried to fight her the classy way,
it'd be a waste of time.

157
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,640
You know my nature well, Mrs. Sorn.

158
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,600
If someone comes at me first,
I never let it slide.

159
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,040
You too, Mrs. Sorn.

160
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Whan!

161
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,240
- Whan.
- Yes, ma'am.

162
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,680
Come clean up this mess.

163
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,720
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,520
Mom…

165
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,000
What's going on?

166
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,800
Oh my gosh.

167
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,120
My goodness.

168
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,200
How did you know
I was at the hospital, Ploy?

169
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,320
I went to see Kita at home.

170
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,160
Kita told me you were here,

171
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,760
so I came to see you.

172
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,000
So, are you okay?

173
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,240
What did the doctor say?

174
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,440
I just haven't been sleeping well.

175
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,400
Then have some fruit.

176
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,000
It'll help you feel refreshed.

177
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,120
Ki, let me help you.

178
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,200
Uh, Ki isn't fully recovered yet.

179
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,240
I was just helping him eat more easily.

180
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,360
Don't get the wrong idea.

181
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,800
Ms. Ve doesn't mind, Ploy.

182
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,440
That's right. I don't mind at all.

183
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,120
It's actually good
that someone looks after him.

184
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,960
I'm quite busy lately.

185
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,120
I'm just dropping this off.

186
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,960
Then I have to take Kita shopping.

187
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,200
Ploy, I want more fruit.

188
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,600
Uh…

189
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,360
Sure.

190
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,640
Aunt Ploy, do you have
any snacks? I want some.

191
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,880
I don't, Kita.

192
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,400
How about this?

193
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,800
I'll take you downstairs to get some.

194
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,120
- Okay.
- Let's go.

195
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,400
I'll take you to buy some.

196
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,200
I thought you were getting better.

197
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,240
But you seem worse
if you can't even feed yourself.

198
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,560
I brought you some soup.

199
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,800
Whether you want the soup or fruit,
wait for Ploy to feed you.

200
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,600
Actually, if you don't have time,
you don't need to bring Kita to visit.

201
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,400
I'll be discharged in a few days anyway.

202
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,360
You don't have to pretend
to be the dutiful wife

203
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,120
in front of others.

204
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,480
Because it was never real.

205
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,720
I'm just following the agreement.

206
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,000
But if you don't want the soup, fine.

207
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,400
I won't waste time making it again.

208
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,800
I'll go put it back in the car.

209
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,680
Hello, Great-Grandma.

210
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,640
Yes.

211
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,680
Did you visit your dad
in the hospital today?

212
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,880
Yes.

213
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,240
Did you come to see Kita, Mrs. Manee?

214
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,280
No.

215
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,560
Why don't you have someone
take Kita upstairs first?

216
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,200
- Aunt Kob.
- Yes?

217
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,760
Please take Kita to his room.

218
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,920
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,280
Let's go, Master Kita.

220
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,560
Good day.

221
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,160
You came all this way.

222
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,440
I doubt it's to visit
the majority shareholder of Jade Biz.

223
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,120
I came to see both of you.

224
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,680
You're Kirin's mother.

225
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,880
And you're his wife.

226
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,000
So I had to see both of you together.

227
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,440
Is this about Mr. Ki?

228
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,120
Mm.

229
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,000
I heard Kirin was unwell.

230
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,280
I was worried

231
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,240
if it was severe.

232
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,160
So I had someone look into it.

233
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,160
‪BLOOD TEST RESULTS

234
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,720
When I saw his blood test, I was shocked.

235
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,960
There was a very high amount of drugs.

236
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,720
I just realized

237
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,680
my grandson-in-law was into that stuff.

238
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,120
My son doesn't do drugs.

239
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,360
Every mother says that.

240
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,880
No one admits their child is an addict.

241
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,960
Mr. Ki isn't what you think.

242
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,320
Oh?

243
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,000
Playing the loyal wife,
defending your husband now?

244
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,760
I'm really curious
if this test result got out,

245
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,119
how much damage
it would do to Kirin's reputation?

246
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,240
What do you really want?

247
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,200
Just say it.

248
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Good. I'll get straight to the point.

249
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,200
I want all of Gingyok's shares

250
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,880
in Jade Biz back.

251
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,000
I won't let anyone
run my company into the ground.

252
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,200
Mrs. Manee.

253
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,560
You know full well
Mr. Ki would never touch drugs.

254
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,040
Yet you're using this to threaten me?

255
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,760
You're no better than Mrs. Sorn.

256
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,480
You should stop saying
everything you do is for Ms. Ging,

257
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,840
because if she were alive,

258
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,800
she'd be heartbroken
seeing you hurt Mr. Ki like this.

259
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,240
Don't pretend to understand
what my granddaughter would think.

260
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,600
Who knows,

261
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,200
Ging might be thrilled

262
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,880
that her assets
didn't end up with someone like you.

263
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,400
She might even feel satisfied

264
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,640
to take revenge
on the one who wanted her dead.

265
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,040
Mr. Ki has nothing to do with any of this.

266
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Everyone in this house
has something to do with it.

267
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,120
Think it over

268
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,200
when you will return the shares to me.

269
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,320
You'd better hurry

270
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,640
before I accidentally

271
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,880
leak Kirin's blood test results.

272
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,080
How did that Manee woman
get Ki's blood test?

273
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,560
If she leaks his results,

274
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,560
both Ki and the Suttha Group
are in big trouble.

275
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,000
But maybe this could work in our favor.

276
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,720
Favor?

277
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,920
This is just more chaos.

278
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,400
Wanvela already has the shares.

279
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,160
Like she'd just hand them back to Manee.

280
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,040
Someone like her
would never do anything for Ki.

281
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,000
That's why we must use this

282
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,200
to gain the upper hand.

283
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,880
If there's something you want now,

284
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,480
you better act fast.

285
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,160
What are you trying to tell me?

286
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,560
Think it over
when you will return the shares to me.

287
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,920
You'd better hurry before I accidentally

288
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
leak Kirin's blood test results.

289
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,880
I came here for you,
Dad, Mom, not anyone else.

290
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,640
If I want to win,
I have to be strong, right?

291
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,800
But what should I do now?

292
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,880
I don't want to destroy his life.

293
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,760
You still keep this?

294
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,840
IF HATHAI WERE 15

295
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,880
IF HATHAI WERE 20

296
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,400
HATHAI NOW

297
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,400
It's Manee's doing, spreading the news.

298
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,840
Even if she didn't name names,

299
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
it's clearly meant to threaten us.

300
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,520
Even if we give her the shares back,
there's no guarantee she'll keep her word.

301
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,840
For the share transfer,

302
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,760
I'll let Ms. Ve decide.

303
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,600
I already gave them to her.

304
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,880
I can't force her.

305
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,280
If that's how you feel,

306
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,440
then I must protect
the company's reputation.

307
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,360
You can't blame me for that, Ki.

308
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,960
What are you going to do?

309
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,880
Soon, we'll vote
for the new company president.

310
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,200
I'll nominate Nun.

311
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,480
To avoid comparisons
between you and her at our company,

312
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,440
I want you
to resign from all executive roles.

313
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,880
Did you ask Nun about this?

314
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,440
No need.

315
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,120
I've thought it through.

316
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,640
In the end, I'll be the one
supporting her from behind.

317
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,880
I hope you agree, Ki.

318
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,680
Do it for your sister and for the company.

319
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,520
Honestly, I didn't want to do this.

320
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,680
But since you married Wanvela,

321
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,000
you'll have to learn
to make some sacrifices.

322
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,920
What did Mr. Ki say?

323
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,440
With everything that's happened,
his only choice is to resign.

324
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Then all that's left is getting
the board to support Miss Nun.

325
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,240
Yes.

326
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,720
But even though we've lobbied
several board members,

327
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,520
there are still some
who definitely won't side with us.

328
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,880
And what worries me most is

329
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,960
someone changing their mind
at the last moment.

330
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,080
If we don't have enough votes for Nun,

331
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,880
everything will fall apart.

332
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,840
Then you'll need to find more support.

333
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,040
There's one person

334
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,960
I really don't want to deal with.

335
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,440
But for Nun, I guess I'll have to.

336
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,440
Who?

337
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,320
I almost forgot

338
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,320
I own a small portion
of shares in the Suttha Group.

339
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,240
I suddenly become important.

340
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,960
Normally,

341
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,120
I'm never invited to any board meetings.

342
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,720
But this time, I want you
to use your vote to support Nun

343
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,280
as the new president.

344
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,160
Oh.

345
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,640
You must be afraid your son
might give all the assets to his wife,

346
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,120
so you're making your daughter
the president instead.

347
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,720
Sorry. I don't think I can't help.

348
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,680
Wait.

349
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,840
I can help you get
your Jade Biz shares back from Wanvela.

350
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,400
She'll return them to me anyway.

351
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,680
And how can you be sure

352
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,320
that woman loves Ki enough

353
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,960
to spit out that juicy piece of meat
from her mouth and give it back to you?

354
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,360
No matter how much you tarnish Ki's name,
she might not even care.

355
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,080
But if you work with me

356
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,640
to help Nun become the president,

357
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,800
I'll pressure her into submitting to you.

358
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,760
Besides,
it's just raising your hand for Nun.

359
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,520
You're not losing anything,
and you even gain everything.

360
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,680
I'll think about it.

361
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,640
I'll text you later.

362
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,880
You venomous old hag.

363
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,960
Playing so hard to get?

364
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,520
I picked up your meds.

365
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,960
If you've packed, we can go.

366
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,280
You didn't have to come pick me up.

367
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
If I hadn't, no one would have.

368
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,720
Everyone's at the company now.

369
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,120
I know.

370
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,880
My mother called a board meeting today
to elect a new president.

371
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,760
Are you going to resign like she asked?

372
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,000
Where's Mr. Krerk?

373
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,120
Looks like he's changed his mind
and won't support us.

374
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,920
I forgot to mention. Mr. Krerk

375
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,560
asked me to let you know

376
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,560
he's abstaining from the vote today.

377
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,560
You haven't forgotten
the company's rules, have you?

378
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,080
If less than
half the board votes in favor,

379
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,160
the vote is invalid,

380
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,520
and we'll have to hold a new election

381
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,200
with a different nominee next time.

382
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,720
I haven't forgotten.

383
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,360
Mom,

384
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,400
Mr. Dol and the others won't vote for me.

385
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,320
I won't become the president.

386
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,360
You must become the new president today.

387
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,200
I've looked into it.

388
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,000
There's no way Mr. Dol's side
will support Miss Nun.

389
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,440
And we can't pressure them either.

390
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,480
But don't we still
have more votes than they do?

391
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,600
From what I've found,

392
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,560
Mr. Dol's side
has been lobbying our people too.

393
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,560
If they succeed,

394
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,720
we'll be at a disadvantage.

395
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,720
But Mom,

396
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,120
even if we count two board members
plus your vote,

397
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,720
that's still not over half.

398
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,280
So, can we begin the vote now?

399
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,280
I think it shouldn't take long.

400
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,720
Sorry I'm late.

401
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,560
Alright.

402
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Now that all voting members are present,

403
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,680
let's begin.

404
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,360
As Mr. Dol said, it shouldn't take long.

405
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,600
Alright, I nominate Miss Nunnalin,

406
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,360
my daughter,

407
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,120
to be the new president
of the Suttha Group.

408
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,120
If anyone agrees,

409
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,520
please raise your hands.

410
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,040
One more vote

411
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
and we'll have the majority.

412
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,360
Wait.

413
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,960
Ki, what are you doing here?

414
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,120
I'm here regarding my resignation
from all positions at the Suttha Group.

415
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,560
I can't do what you asked, Mom.

416
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,240
And I would like to nominate myself

417
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,480
as the new president of the Suttha Group.

418
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,680
Ki.

419
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,040
If that's the case,

420
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,960
shouldn't we postpone the vote?

421
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,280
We will not postpone.

422
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,920
And no one else has the right
to nominate themselves.

423
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,720
She's right. I don't agree with that.

424
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,400
But I agree.

425
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
And I believe
other board members would too.

426
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,360
If there's disagreement,

427
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,720
shouldn't we take a short break?

428
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,440
You don't have the right to call a break.

429
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,760
Allow me a moment to speak with my mother

430
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,360
and grandmother.

431
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,240
Once we're done,
whatever decision they make

432
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,160
about the vote,

433
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,320
I won't object.

434
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,720
Pat, take Nun out for now.

435
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,240
Right this way, Miss Nun.

436
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,000
Now that everyone left, say what you want.

437
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,240
You going to say you disobeyed me
because of her, aren't you?

438
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,000
I came to say

439
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,000
the drugs in my blood test

440
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,360
were from being drugged.

441
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,760
Huh?

442
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,080
But you told me you--

443
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,040
At first, Mr. Ki had no proof.

444
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,720
But now he has solid proof.

445
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,560
I kept wondering

446
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,760
who could've drugged Mr. Ki
if not the people in the house.

447
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,520
After questioning everyone,

448
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,360
Aunt Kob said
she saw Mr. Ki drink tea that night.

449
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,080
Someone's watching us.

450
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,600
<i>In the evening,</i>

451
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,680
I saw Mr. Ki reading for a bit,

452
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,320
<i>then he took Ms. Ve back to their room.</i>

453
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,200
But she never mentioned the tea

454
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,360
even if it was just a night later.

455
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,160
To forget about this,
seemed suspicious.

456
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,200
So I suspected Aunt Kob first.

457
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,240
Now Mrs. Sorn suspects Ms. Ve did it.

458
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,120
What do you want me to do?

459
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,160
I'm afraid I'll get caught someday.

460
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,400
Don't worry.

461
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,560
No one knows it was you.

462
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,240
But I did what you asked.

463
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,720
Hello, Uncle.

464
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,040
I sent you the report.

465
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,400
Did you read it through?

466
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,800
Yes.

467
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,320
Here.

468
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,840
Don't be afraid.

469
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,440
If you don't say it, I don't say it,
no one will ever know.

470
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,000
Yes, ma'am.

471
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,680
You did it to my son?!

472
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,040
- Did you?!
- Mom!

473
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,760
Were you trying to kill my son?!

474
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,560
- Huh?!
- Mom, I'm okay now.

475
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,240
- Huh?
- I'm okay now.

476
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,320
Grandma.

477
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,120
So you called me here

478
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,040
just to see how badly
you all treat my Grandma?

479
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,880
Did they call you here, Ploy?

480
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,200
Yes. So I rushed over.

481
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,320
- What did they do to you?
- Uh.

482
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,760
I just wanted you to know

483
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,760
what your grandma did to Mr. Ki.

484
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,320
If you're about to say you drugged Mr. Ki

485
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,840
because of Ms. Ging's shares,

486
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,680
I want you to know I never wanted them.

487
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,440
And Mr. Ki never wanted your company

488
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,600
to merge with the Suttha Group either.

489
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,360
Did you really drug Ki?

490
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,360
You think I'll believe you?

491
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,000
If your mother ordered it,

492
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,560
would you dare go against her, Ki?

493
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,960
Huh?! Would you?!

494
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,840
That's why I transferred them to Ms. Ve.

495
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,200
Because I knew my mother

496
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,840
would never be able to force her.

497
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,400
I won't release
the clip of you planning to drug Mr. Ki.

498
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,040
And I'll transfer
all of Ms. Ging's shares to Kita.

499
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,360
As for you, stay away from Mr. Ki.

500
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,080
Everything that belonged to Ms. Ging
should go to Kita.

501
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,000
From now on,

502
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,000
you need to stop using Ms. Ging
to serve your own interests.

503
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,880
Grandma.

504
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,640
That's enough.

505
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,760
What belongs to Ging belongs to Kita.

506
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,680
That's only right.

507
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,320
Let's go home, Grandma.

508
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,840
So, what did your mother decide
about the president vote?

509
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,800
It's been postponed indefinitely.

510
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,600
If they had to vote today,
Miss Nun wouldn't have won anyway.

511
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,840
There are still several board members
who want you to be chair instead.

512
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,639
I really have to thank you

513
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,920
for finding out who drugged me

514
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,760
and for transferring the shares to Kita.

515
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,199
Well, they belonged to Ms. Ging.

516
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,440
I never want anything that isn't mine.

517
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,960
But the reason I accepted them
from the beginning was because I knew

518
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,199
you didn't want to be controlled
by Mrs. Sorn for the merger either.

519
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,960
This is probably the best solution.

520
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,159
I just hope
Mrs. Manee will finally understand me.

521
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,400
I was right to do this.

522
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,679
Thank you so much.

523
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,560
And thank you too

524
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,760
for protecting me from your mother.

525
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,320
Even when you didn't know who drugged you,

526
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,200
you still believed it wasn't me.

527
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,560
Why did you believe that?

528
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,640
Because you told me if you hated me,

529
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,480
everything would've been easier.

530
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,200
That alone showed me you'd never hurt me.

531
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,000
Ugh!

532
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,760
All the plans I made for you
are all ruined because of that Wanvela!

533
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,640
Mom, it's okay.

534
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,400
We can just let Ki be the president.

535
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,080
What are you saying?

536
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,840
Everything I've done was for you.

537
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,560
If something doesn't work,
you help me fix it,

538
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,480
not hand it over to someone else.

539
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,560
Ki isn't someone else.

540
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,600
And he's right for the role.

541
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,560
Why force me into it when I'm not capable?

542
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,720
Are you even my daughter?

543
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,400
If you are, then act like it.

544
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,560
Anything that belongs to us,
you must protect it.

545
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,240
Don't just give it away
like it's nothing.

546
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,760
Are you crazy?!

547
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,800
This is why

548
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,400
you never succeed at anything.

549
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
Mrs. Sorn.

550
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,040
But I never even wanted it.

551
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,120
So why are you forcing it on me?

552
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,920
I never wanted it.
Didn't you hear me? I never wanted it!

553
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,360
- You idiot.
- Ouch!

554
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,880
Miss Nun!

555
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,680
Are you hurt?

556
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,800
Miss Nun.

557
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,080
Miss Nun, are you alright?

558
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,760
Let's treat your wound. Let me help.

559
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,000
Stay out of my business.

560
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,800
Mrs. Sorn has done everything for you.

561
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,640
Everything in this house
will belong to you.

562
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,480
You're not part of this family.

563
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,960
Stay out of it.

564
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,320
Miss Nun, what's wrong?

565
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,000
Who hurt you?

566
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,000
It's none of your business.

567
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,240
She had a little problem with Mrs. Sorn.

568
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
So she's a bit moody.

569
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,280
Is it that woman again?

570
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,760
Did she cost her the position?

571
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,760
Yes.

572
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,000
Nun's so upset,
no one can even talk to her now.

573
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,280
Singha, can you help me again?

574
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,560
I failed last time.

575
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,400
But if I succeed this time,

576
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,080
I want you to help me in return.

577
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,800
Of course.

578
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,120
What do you need?

579
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,800
I want to marry Nun.

580
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,040
Kita, aren't you going to order something?

581
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,560
No, I'll wait for Teacher Ve.

582
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,480
She's tied up with something.

583
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,760
How about ordering now
and waiting for her?

584
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,560
No, I'll wait for her, Dad.

585
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,440
Alright.

586
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,640
I'll call her and check where she is.

587
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,840
Okay.

588
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,640
NEXT EPISODE

589
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,120
Ms. Ve.

590
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,720
<i>I saw you send</i>
<i>Wanvela's photo to Mr. Singha.</i>

591
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,880
What are you two planning?

592
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,720
Pretend you don't know anything.

593
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,120
Here. If money can solve it,
I'm willing to pay.

594
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,720
<i>We've got that woman, boss.</i>

595
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,640
I'll head there now.

596
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,320
<i>I want to know if you're still seeing him.</i>

597
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,720
Why would you care about who I see?

598
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,280
<i>But he's dangerous.</i>

599
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,960
<i>You shouldn't be around him.</i>
