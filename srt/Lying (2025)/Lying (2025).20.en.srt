1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,920
<i>- How is it?</i>
<i>- She's dead, boss.</i>

2
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,360
Finally, this day has come.

3
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,600
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,520
<i>If the audio clip</i>

5
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,000
<i>and the dashcam footage get leaked,</i>

6
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,320
what am I going to do, Mom?

7
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,760
<i>You have to marry Singha.</i>

8
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,240
<i>Mr. Sajja and Singha will help you.</i>

9
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,880
The DNA test results are in.

10
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,840
The DNA test for Nun

11
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,360
and Pat?!

12
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,920
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

13
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,080
<i>Leave everything.</i>
<i>Walk away from this place.</i>

14
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,920
Ve's not dead yet.

15
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,440
Huh?

16
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,280
What's going on?
I'm so confused right now.

17
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,120
You said you'd recover her body
to prove she was dead.

18
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,440
My man messed up.

19
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,960
Someone got to Ve and helped her.

20
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,600
He panicked and lied to me.

21
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,880
Someone helped her?

22
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,240
<i>Who?!</i>

23
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,600
Could it be…?

24
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,200
Nun, thank you

25
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,440
for not telling Mom about Hathai.

26
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,560
You don't have to thank me.

27
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,360
Mom's already gone.

28
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,440
Let's just end it here.

29
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Mom?

30
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,560
Didn't you say we'd meet at the airport?

31
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,480
Why are you back? Did something happen?

32
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Mom, what's…

33
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,800
What's going on?

34
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
Ki.

35
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,680
You knew Ve was still alive

36
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,880
and you never told me.

37
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,760
You tricked me
into giving everything back to her

38
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,120
and promised
we'd leave this place together.

39
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,400
But you were sending me away

40
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,080
so you could be with her, weren't you?

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,640
Wanvela's alive?

42
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,720
Why?

43
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,280
Why would you side with someone
who tried to kill your own mother, Ki?

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,920
How could you do this to me?

45
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,000
Tell me.

46
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,960
Is Ve with you?

47
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,600
And how do you even know

48
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,360
she's still alive?

49
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,080
The police haven't found her yet.

50
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,480
Yes, Mom.

51
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,480
They don't even know. How would Ki?

52
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,960
Because someone helped her…

53
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,120
A police friend of mine told me…

54
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,240
they caught another perp
who shot at the other police car.

55
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,240
He confessed someone rescued Ms. Ve.

56
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,680
So I informed her.

57
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,320
What do you say, Ki?

58
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,920
She tried to kill me,
and yet you helped her escape.

59
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,720
Do you realize

60
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,840
that makes you
an accomplice to a criminal?

61
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,040
If that's how it is,

62
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,720
then I won't go anywhere.

63
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,800
Even if you threaten me,

64
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,360
I won't back down.

65
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,480
Why?

66
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,440
Just because Ms. Ve is still alive

67
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,440
or not arrested yet,

68
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,400
you're willing to break
your promise to me?

69
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,760
Does she really matter to you?

70
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,800
Of course.

71
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,960
Knowing the person
who tried to kill her is still out there,

72
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,440
anyone would feel unsettled.

73
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,320
And knowing her own son

74
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,760
chose that person over his own mother?

75
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,560
She wouldn't want to leave.

76
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,080
If Ve isn't arrested,

77
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,080
then I won't leave either.

78
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,400
If you did help her and you're too scared

79
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,240
to admit it,

80
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,440
you can just tell me, Ki.

81
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,560
I wouldn't be that harsh
on my own brother-in-law.

82
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,760
Singha,

83
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,000
he already said he didn't know anything.

84
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,840
You should go now.

85
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,600
I just want to catch the culprit
as soon as possible, that's all.

86
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,560
Why do I need to go now?

87
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,320
Please, Singha.

88
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,760
Let me talk to Ki myself.

89
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Alright.

90
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,520
I'll have someone pick me up.

91
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Okay.

92
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
Ki.

93
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,200
What's really going on?

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,080
Did you make some deal with Mom?

95
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,520
Why did she agree to leave?

96
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,760
Or is this about more than just Wanvela?

97
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,600
I told her just what I told you.

98
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,160
I wanted to return everything to Hathai.

99
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,320
But you never told her

100
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,880
that Hathai is Wanvela.

101
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,080
Because I didn't want her to hate Ms. Ve
any more than she already does.

102
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,240
But now she's changed her mind
and won't leave.

103
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,360
Still,

104
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
we must return everything to Hathai.

105
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,520
Mom, me, and you too.

106
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,400
Why do I have to return everything to her?

107
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,040
I'm Dad's daughter too.

108
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,040
And Mom kept his business
going all these years.

109
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,440
Don't you think
we deserve something out of it?

110
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
And now,

111
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,560
I'm already married.

112
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,680
If I have nothing left,

113
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,080
how do you think
my husband's family will look at me?

114
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,480
I won't let anyone
look down on me that easily, Ki.

115
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,280
Let me ask you this.

116
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,160
Have you

117
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,200
ever once considered how I feel?

118
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,080
How I've been affected?

119
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,840
I think

120
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,240
just keeping quiet that Hathai is Wanvela

121
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,880
is already the best I could do.

122
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Nun.

123
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,520
Now I think I understand Mom.

124
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,840
I understand why she refuses to leave.

125
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,880
Mrs. Sorn,

126
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,920
are you really not leaving anymore?

127
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,360
I'd be a fool to leave
when Ve's still out there.

128
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,280
How could I let her return
and live happily?

129
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,600
So Mr. Ki really helped her?

130
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,200
He'll never admit it.

131
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,840
But forget it.

132
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,560
From now on, no matter what threats
he throws at me, I'm not going anywhere.

133
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,840
What did he threaten you with?

134
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,240
You don't need to know.

135
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,000
Stay out of this.

136
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,560
Singha and I will handle it.

137
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,520
I can guess

138
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
where she might be hiding.

139
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
So now you trust Singha more than me?

140
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,440
Thanks for helping me dig into this.

141
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,840
I had a senior friend investigate it.

142
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,280
Turns out Mrs. Kanisorn
didn't leave for England.

143
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,680
What happened?

144
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,320
Maybe she found out that you're
still alive, and refused to go.

145
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,040
No wonder Ki's been quiet lately.

146
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,600
He probably can't face you.

147
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,520
After saying all that,

148
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,520
asking his own mom
to walk out of your life,

149
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,080
saying he'd return everything to you,

150
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,320
but he achieved nothing in the end.

151
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,520
He probably doesn't even know
how cruel his mother really is.

152
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,280
But I think
he's still trying his best for me.

153
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,600
Then I just hope he finally
does what he says this time.

154
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,520
Don't forget you're also facing
an attempted murder charge.

155
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,760
I will find proof that Kanisorn is lying.

156
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,120
There has to be someone helping her.

157
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,160
You suspect Miss Mintra, don't you?

158
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,120
Everything points to her.
I just don't have the evidence yet.

159
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,760
Then I'll help you look into it too.

160
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,560
What's wrong?

161
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
It's Im.

162
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,640
She messaged
asking me to transfer more money.

163
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,960
Said Teacher's not doing well.

164
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,640
She needs to see a doctor
and buy more meds.

165
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,200
But don't worry about this.

166
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,720
I'll take care of it.

167
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,240
And if anything comes up,

168
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,760
you can always call me, okay?

169
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,520
Please take care of Teacher for me.

170
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
You can count on me.

171
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,200
Hathai,

172
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,840
please be okay.

173
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
I'm worried about you.

174
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,960
- Hathai…
- Teacher.

175
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,960
Teacher, let's eat!

176
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,400
Here.

177
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,920
Here's your meal.

178
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,800
No, I'm not eating. I'm not hungry.

179
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,320
Please, just eat.

180
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,880
I need to go out to buy some things.

181
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
I'm not hungry, Im.

182
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
You need to take your meds after eating.

183
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,600
You need to eat. Here.

184
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,840
No, I'm not hungry.

185
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,880
Eat it.

186
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,560
Eat it, Teacher, just eat.

187
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,840
Here. Eat.

188
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,280
- No! I'm not eating!
- Just eat and be done with it.

189
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,520
Just eat it and be done.

190
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,000
Ouch! Teacher!

191
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,840
No! I'm not eating!

192
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,920
Teacher,

193
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,960
if you die from not eating,
I'm not taking responsibility.

194
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,920
Prae and Ve
won't be able to save you either.

195
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,720
Such a hassle!

196
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,760
When will you just die already?

197
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,800
Hathai.

198
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,600
It's really you, Hathai.

199
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,480
Hathai, you're here.

200
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,160
Teacher…

201
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,280
Hathai.

202
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,600
No.

203
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
I have to call you Ve.

204
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,080
Ve, are you safe?

205
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,240
I'm sorry I worried you, Teacher.

206
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,280
It's alright.

207
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,120
Seeing you safe makes me feel better.

208
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,640
How are you feeling?

209
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,760
Don't worry,

210
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,960
just some coughing and fatigue.

211
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,040
Then please eat so you can take your meds.

212
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,880
Here, let me feed you.

213
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,320
Is that good?

214
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,440
Im's cooking isn't too bad.

215
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,080
- Teacher.
- Hm?

216
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,560
Please don't tell anyone
I came to see you.

217
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,600
I won't tell anyone.

218
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,240
Has Im treated you like that often?

219
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,480
Only when she's angry.

220
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,080
But don't hold it against her.

221
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,680
I did what you ordered, boss.

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,320
My men followed your order.

223
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,600
But are you sure this is okay

224
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,040
if Mr. Ki finds out?

225
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,800
It's just a mother

226
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,120
tracking where her son is.
What's wrong with that?

227
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,520
Then good.

228
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,160
If Mr. Ki really helped Ve, soon enough,

229
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,760
you'll find out where she is.

230
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,560
He'll go to her eventually.

231
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,840
Thank you so much, Singha.

232
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,000
We're family now.

233
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,680
You should call me Mom from now on.

234
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,440
Yes, Mom.

235
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,720
And what did your men say?

236
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,680
I've already ordered them.

237
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,280
If Ve shows her face,

238
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,320
we'll know immediately.

239
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,600
Hey!

240
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,800
Prae, what are you doing around here?

241
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,560
Didn't you ask me to transfer money
to buy meds for Teacher?

242
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,600
Where's the medicine?

243
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,600
Well…

244
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,920
I went to buy some stuff, and…

245
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,080
for the medicine…

246
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,960
I'm just about to buy it.

247
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,680
Oh yeah?

248
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,160
- Hey! Ouch!
- Hm?

249
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,920
- Hm?
- Ouch! Ugh!

250
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,560
What the hell are you doing?!

251
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,200
Just doing what you did to Teacher.

252
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,960
How did you know?

253
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,800
It doesn't matter how I know.

254
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,760
But if you treat her like that again,

255
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,640
it won't be this easy next time, Im.

256
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,840
Ow!

257
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,360
Ugh!

258
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,960
You crazy bitch!

259
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,640
How the hell did she find out?

260
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,960
Hello, Ve?

261
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,359
I already taught Im a lesson.

262
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,560
She probably won't dare
treat Teacher like that again.

263
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,359
How?
I did the same thing she did to Teacher.

264
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,240
Ve came to Teacher's house?

265
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,680
She brought sticky rice, so I shoved it

266
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,040
right back in her mouth.

267
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,440
So satisfying.

268
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,040
Ve, did you forget something?

269
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,840
Who are you? How did you get in here?

270
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,920
I'm looking for someone.

271
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,280
Looking for who?

272
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,720
You'll find out.

273
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,160
- Hey.
- Ugh.

274
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,640
Where's Ve?
She came to see you, didn't she?

275
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't know. She didn't come.

276
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,920
Ugh!

277
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,600
Last time, I let you off
because you were sick

278
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,360
and senile.
So I didn't want to do anything.

279
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,400
But this time,
if you don't tell me where she is,

280
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
just imagine

281
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,640
what could happen to you.

282
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,440
I don't know.

283
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,120
I'm asking where Ve is.

284
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,360
This is your one last chance!

285
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,200
Make her talk.

286
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
- Here!
- Ugh!

287
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,680
Ah! Teacher!

288
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,560
Teacher!

289
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,560
Teacher!

290
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,160
Where is Ve?

291
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,400
Didn't you say she was here?

292
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,400
How would I know? I just got here!

293
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,880
Oh.

294
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,720
- Teacher.
- Im,

295
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,360
did you tell them about Ve?

296
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,560
I had to, Teacher.

297
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,320
Had to?

298
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,040
How could you
betray your friend like this?

299
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,760
She's not my friend.

300
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,680
She never did anything for me!

301
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,320
Even now,

302
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,160
you're still protecting her.

303
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,600
Tell them where she is. Just tell them!

304
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,960
Hey.

305
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,200
Maybe she really doesn't know.

306
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,400
Let her go, please.

307
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,280
Wait until she wakes up.

308
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,480
Make her talk.
Make her tell us where Ve is.

309
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,360
Pete, I'll meet you at the usual place.

310
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,480
Don't forget what I asked you for.

311
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
I don't think we should
waste any more time here.

312
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,920
She's not breathing!

313
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,760
Then there's no point

314
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,000
waiting anymore.

315
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,800
Singha, please handle the rest.

316
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,600
How should I handle it?

317
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,320
Make it look like

318
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,000
someone here was careless
and that's why she died.

319
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,200
That actually works.

320
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,560
No, no, no. Please.

321
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,680
Please let me go.

322
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,480
I swear I won't tell anyone.

323
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,640
I wasn't involved. I don't know anything!

324
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,200
Please let me go.

325
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,160
You even betrayed
a teacher who raised you.

326
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,960
Do you really think
I'll trust you not to rat on me?

327
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,320
Please let me go. I don't want to die!

328
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,840
I'm begging you…

329
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,960
Please let me go…

330
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,720
I really pity your teacher.

331
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,640
Fine then.

332
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,280
I'll just send you
to atone for your sins with her.

333
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,080
No! Let go! Let me go!

334
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,320
Hey!

335
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,880
So all that talk about giving
everything up and moving overseas

336
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,160
was just for show?

337
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,400
Say whatever you need to say.

338
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,400
Normally, If you don't make
an appointment, I won't meet you.

339
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,040
I'm here to talk about my shares.

340
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,920
Your shares? What now, Mrs. Manee?

341
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,160
Since your daughter-in-law is dead,

342
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,360
I want to know how you're planning
to divide the shares

343
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,520
and assets under her name.

344
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,680
Uh…

345
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,560
Actually, Grandma and I
just want to know about Wanvela

346
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,880
after she disappeared.

347
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,880
Why do you need to know?

348
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,200
You have no rights
to anything that belonged to her.

349
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,040
Let me tell you something.

350
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,840
Even if that woman is dead,

351
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,120
don't you dare dream

352
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,400
that you'll get
even a sliver of her shares.

353
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,520
Everything will belong to my son.

354
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,680
Not a single thing
will fall into your hands.

355
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,320
Is that all? You've wasted my time.

356
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,160
Just as expected.

357
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,360
She wants to take everything again,

358
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,040
just like when Ging died.

359
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,800
You shouldn't have rushed.

360
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,640
The news wasn't even confirmed

361
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,760
whether Wanvela is dead or alive.

362
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,960
But I'm sure she's not dead.

363
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,040
Because if she really was,
even without her body,

364
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,360
Kanisorn would've rushed to hold a funeral

365
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,120
so she could transfer
all of Wanvela's assets

366
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,160
to her son as fast as possible.

367
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,920
But honestly, none of this
even has anything to do with us, Grandma.

368
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,800
See? That's how you are.

369
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,680
This is why you couldn't
handle a thing about your sister.

370
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,160
You let them
take all that belongs to Ging.

371
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,600
Who would've known

372
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,360
that Ging's heart would act up and then…

373
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,960
she'd have an accident.

374
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,160
An accident?

375
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,760
When will you finally wise up, Ploy?

376
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,720
When will you open your eyes and see
what really caused your sister's death?

377
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,520
Pete.

378
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,080
Yeah?

379
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,640
What you asked for,

380
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,640
I handled all of it.

381
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,480
Thanks.

382
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,200
Go take care of your own business.

383
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,560
If anything comes up, I'll call.

384
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,000
Why are you following me here?

385
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,840
I want to know about Wanvela.

386
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,720
She's not dead, right?

387
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,440
Didn't you hate her?

388
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,800
Why do you suddenly care
whether she's dead or alive?

389
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,400
She's the only one

390
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,760
who knows
the truth about my sister's death.

391
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,080
Grandma,

392
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,080
what is it you want to tell me?
Just tell me everything.

393
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,920
About this,

394
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,480
no one knows the truth
better than Wanvela.

395
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,720
If she's still alive,

396
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,880
then ask her yourself.

397
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,560
Even my own grandmother

398
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,680
thinks I'm useless.

399
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,280
I don't even know the truth

400
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,080
about my sister's death.

401
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,480
Why are you crying?

402
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,240
Can you tell me the truth?

403
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,360
It's really important for my sister.

404
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,200
Fine. I'll tell you.

405
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,680
She's safe.

406
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,000
But I can't tell you where she is.

407
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,840
When the time comes,
she'll meet you herself.

408
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,800
Thank you for telling me the truth.

409
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,680
Wipe your tears.

410
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,880
Seeing you cry makes me feel guilty.

411
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,600
Like I hurt you badly somehow.

412
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,520
<i>I'm going to see Ms. Ve now.</i>
<i>I'll call you.</i>

413
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
Mom,

414
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,080
I know where she is now.

415
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,960
I thought you wouldn't come back.

416
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,400
Where were you?

417
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,040
I told you not to go anywhere.
It's dangerous.

418
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,440
Don't worry. No one saw me.

419
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,680
Can't you just listen to me once?

420
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,040
What about you?

421
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,360
Have you ever achieved anything
you promised me?

422
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,120
It's my fault.

423
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,200
I thought it would be easier than this.

424
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,080
But I won't give up.

425
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,480
I'll keep my promise to you.

426
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,520
I understand.

427
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,680
Nothing about us is simple.

428
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,560
You don't have to do everything for me.

429
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,720
I have to. Even if I fail 100 times,

430
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,040
I'll still do what I promised.

431
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,640
Thank you.

432
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,920
Singha is trying to find you.

433
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
He wants to hand you over to the police.

434
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,280
But I won't let anyone take you.

435
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,960
The GPS says she's here.

436
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,200
She must be inside.

437
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,040
We finally found her.

438
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,200
Let's see where else she can run now.

439
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,880
Where did she go?

440
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,680
What is it?

441
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,240
I did what you ordered, boss.

442
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,120
I'm going to see Ms. Ve now.
I'll call you.

443
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,640
I had Miss Prae handle the rest.

444
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,640
No one will find us.

445
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,960
I'm taking you somewhere safe.

446
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,560
Are you sure this is okay?

447
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,960
I'm just letting them think

448
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,280
that even if they followed me here,
they wouldn't find you.

449
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,480
So they'll know they shouldn't follow me.

450
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,760
You enabled this yourself,

451
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,520
Mr. Ki.

452
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,680
Sorry, Mr. Ki.

453
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,640
Ve comes first no matter what.

454
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,520
Ow!

455
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,880
Because I love you.

456
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,480
Ah.

457
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,400
Singha, calm down.

458
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,320
It's not a real video.
It's edited, Singha.

459
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,720
No one's ever
humiliated me like this before!

460
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,040
Calm down. Please calm down, Singha.

461
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,680
Don't get angry.

462
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,640
Calm down?

463
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,840
You want me to calm down?

464
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,160
Yes, please calm down.

465
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,880
Singha! Singha, listen to me!

466
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,720
Singha! Singha.

467
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,920
You're here with me like this.
So what about Kita?

468
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,480
Kita's not as stubborn as before.

469
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,000
So I asked Pete to send
a reliable teacher to stay with him.

470
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,560
Have a seat.

471
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,160
Thank you.

472
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,680
Now that you're here,

473
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,040
don't go anywhere on your own, okay?

474
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,400
Can you promise me that?

475
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,440
But I'm worried about Teacher Rawee.

476
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,400
Prae said her condition
still hasn't improved.

477
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,800
And Im isn't taking proper care of her.

478
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,760
Didn't you tell me

479
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,600
that Prae already dealt with Im?

480
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,000
She probably wouldn't hurt her again.

481
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,920
Eat up, then go shower and rest.

482
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,440
Simple first meal
to go with your new place, okay?

483
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,240
How is it? Is my cooking edible?

484
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,800
If it is,
I'll cook for you again tomorrow.

485
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,520
What if I want you to cook
lunch and dinner too?

486
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,120
However many meals you want,

487
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,160
I'll cook for you if you want.

488
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,840
Are you sure it's Teacher Rawee's house?

489
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
<i>I think so.</i>

490
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,800
They said the fire
was caused by a gas leak.

491
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,120
<i>And when they went in to rescue them,</i>

492
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
neither of them was breathing.

493
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,840
Teacher Rawee and Im?

494
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,320
How could an accident like that
happen at her house?

495
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,560
If Ms. Ve finds out,

496
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,480
<i>she'll be devastated.</i>

497
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,440
Don't tell her.

498
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,800
I don't want her to know yet.

499
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
<i>Why, Ki?</i>

500
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,240
This is a huge deal.

501
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,680
Exactly because it's a huge deal.
If she finds out, she'll go out for sure.

502
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,640
I'm worried about her safety.

503
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,680
Fine, it's up to you then.

504
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,720
I'll try to look further into this.

505
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,000
Thanks a lot.

506
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,720
Is something wrong?

507
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,960
You looked tense on the phone.

508
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,200
It's nothing.

509
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,560
I was just talking to Pete
about your case.

510
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
About how we could help you.

511
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,360
But all I can do…

512
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,520
is keep apologizing.

513
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,239
Don't worry about it.

514
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,800
Whatever will be, will be.

515
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,880
You've done your best.

516
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,719
I love you.

517
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,840
Everything I've done

518
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,280
is all for your safety.

519
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,520
But no matter how hard I try,

520
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,719
I've never been able
to get justice for you.

521
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,360
Don't blame yourself anymore.

522
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,520
None of this happened because of you.

523
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,000
But you've always tried to help me.

524
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,080
You've done everything you could for me.

525
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,320
You and Kita

526
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
made me feel like…

527
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,720
I'm not alone anymore.

528
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,960
No matter what happens…

529
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,280
Kita and I will always be by your side.

530
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,000
Do you know

531
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,560
that when you're near me,

532
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,080
it really does make me forget all the pain
I've gone through, just like you said.

533
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,760
Why are you home so late today?

534
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,440
I made soup and waited for you so long.

535
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,400
I had to reheat it again.

536
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,560
Go sit down. I'll get it for you.

537
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,960
It's still warm.

538
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,880
If you've got something to do, go ahead.

539
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,640
I'll take care of Mr. Singha.

540
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,360
You had meetings with Mom all day today?

541
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,480
Are you tired?

542
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,920
You haven't said a word to me.

543
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,120
Singha, what are you doing?!

544
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,440
You'll find out.

545
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,600
Mrs. Sorn.

546
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,800
Is something wrong?

547
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,120
I broke a wine glass. It's nothing.

548
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,200
Have someone clean it up.

549
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,160
Uh…

550
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,640
Wait.

551
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,440
I saw the news.
Teacher Rawee's house burned down.

552
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,200
She and Im died inside.

553
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,120
Did you do it?

554
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,440
Don't tell me
you asked Singha to handle it?

555
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,760
- So what?
- Mrs. Sorn.

556
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,760
Have you even considered
what kind of man our daughter is with?

557
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,480
The kind who's wealthy and powerful.

558
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,360
The kind that loves Nun,
and is able to protect her.

559
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,080
My daughter will be happy
for the rest of her life.

560
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,840
As for you,

561
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,200
stop meddling in Nun's life.
You're annoying.

562
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,880
PRAEPAI

563
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,800
Hello, Prae, it's me.

564
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,280
Why did you call Mr. Ki?

565
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,560
Ve, Teacher's house just burned down.

566
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,360
Teacher and Im are dead.

567
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,080
<i>You were trying to hide this from me?</i>

568
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,880
When you said you loved me,

569
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,160
it was just to make me weak,

570
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,240
<i>so I'd forget</i>
<i>what your mother did to my family.</i>

571
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,640
<i>I swear,</i>

572
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,120
<i>the ones who hurt you</i>

573
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,240
will be punished.

574
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,000
If there's anything I can do to help,
just tell me.

575
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,760
Sign the divorce papers.

576
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,480
