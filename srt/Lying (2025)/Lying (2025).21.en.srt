1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,560
<i>She tried to kill me,</i>
<i>and yet you helped her escape.</i>

2
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,440
If that's how it is,
then I won't go anywhere.

3
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,280
<i>Where is Ve? Make her talk.</i>

4
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,920
‪PREVIOUSLY

5
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,600
I'm going to see Ms. Ve now.
I'll call you.

6
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,920
<i>Mom,</i>

7
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,280
<i>I know where Ve is now.</i>

8
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,680
<i>No one's ever</i>
<i>humiliated me like this before!</i>

9
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,640
<i>Are you sure it's Teacher Rawee's house?</i>

10
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,360
Hello, Prae, it's me.

11
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,920
<i>Ve, Teacher and Im are dead.</i>

12
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,760
Ms. Ve.

13
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,200
What you talked about with Mr. Pete
wasn't about me,

14
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,800
but about the fire
at Teacher Rawee's house, right?

15
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,280
Well…

16
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,400
You turned off my phone.

17
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,440
That's why Prae had to call you.

18
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,440
You were trying to hide this from me?

19
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,760
Why would you do this, Mr. Ki?

20
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,640
Why did you do this? Why?!

21
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,160
<i>No matter what, the fire</i>
<i>must be connected to Kanisorn and Singha.</i>

22
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,080
I went to the house
before coming to the hospital.

23
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,360
Auntie, please tell me
who came to see Teacher.

24
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,880
I told you I don't know.

25
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,040
Auntie, but if someone
hadn't put out the fire in time,

26
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,880
your house would've burned down too.

27
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,240
Are you just
going to let the culprit go free?

28
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,760
If I tell you,
you have to leave me alone, okay?

29
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,840
I saw several men come with a woman.

30
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,360
One of the men
is a politician's son or something.

31
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,480
His name is…

32
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,040
Sajja or something.

33
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,960
Wait, Ms. Ve.

34
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,160
Mr. Ki. Mr. Ki.

35
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,000
You already know

36
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,800
who killed Teacher, right?

37
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,280
That's why you chose to hide it from me.

38
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,120
All those times you kept apologizing,

39
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,200
you were really just
helping your mother, weren't you?

40
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,920
When you said you loved me,

41
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,080
it was just to make me weak,

42
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,640
to make me stupid,

43
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,800
so I'd forget
what your mother did to my family.

44
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
In the end,

45
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,960
you just wanted me
to be the one who loses.

46
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,240
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

47
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,000
Ms. Ve.

48
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,440
- Ms. Ve…
- Don't touch me!

49
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,440
Everything I did

50
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,480
was to protect you, Ve.

51
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,120
How are you feeling, Ve?

52
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,800
Prae, is it because of me

53
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,920
that Teacher and Im had to die?

54
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,520
Don't blame yourself.

55
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,000
It's my fault, Prae.
It's all because of me.

56
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,840
It's because of me, Prae…

57
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Listen to me, Ve.

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,640
Teacher and Im died because of
Kanisorn and Singha, not you.

59
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,080
Did Mr. Ki know about this?

60
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,440
Of course he did.

61
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,760
He knew everything,
but chose to lie to me, Prae.

62
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,400
Why?

63
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,920
I used to think
I could forget everything because of him.

64
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,800
But in the end, I was just a fool.

65
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,440
He fooled me, Prae…

66
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,200
Those people will pay for what they did.

67
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,840
It won't be long, Ve.

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,320
You'll see.

69
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,720
We're sorry

70
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,600
we couldn't do more for you, Teacher…

71
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
But I swear,

72
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,920
the ones who hurt you

73
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,280
will be punished.

74
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,080
STAFF ONLY

75
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,160
Ms. Ve.

76
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,480
Mr. Pete? What are you doing here?

77
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,960
Ki said you disappeared.

78
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,760
So, he sent me here in case I'd find you.

79
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Ms. Ve.

80
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,360
Ms. Ve. Ms. Ve.

81
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,040
Tell Mr. Ki I can take care of myself.

82
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,960
No need for anyone to babysit me.

83
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,680
Ki didn't tell you
about Teacher Rawee and Im

84
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,800
because he was worried about you.

85
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,160
Worried?

86
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,960
I don't think I can believe that anymore.

87
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,159
Wait, Ms. Ve.

88
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,120
Let's talk.

89
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,600
I have nothing to say to you.

90
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,960
Then will you talk to me?

91
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,640
I'm sorry, Ms. Ve.

92
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,800
I'm the one who told Ploy about you.

93
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,680
I wanted to talk to you about my sister.

94
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,040
What Miss Ploy
wanted to talk about is also important.

95
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,040
That's why I--

96
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,720
Please don't blame Mr. Pete.

97
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,400
I promise I won't tell anyone
I met you today.

98
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
Not even Grandma.

99
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,400
I understand that
your sister's case is also important.

100
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,600
But didn't Mrs. Manee tell you anything?

101
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,160
Grandma said Ging was poisoned.

102
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,760
But I didn't believe it.

103
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,960
I thought she just had a grudge
against Ki's family.

104
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,200
So she told me to ask you directly
if you're still alive.

105
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,240
That's why I asked Mr. Pete
to bring me to you.

106
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,800
You're the only one
who could tell me the truth.

107
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,440
<i>I already told Mrs. Manee</i>

108
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,120
that before Ms. Ging passed away,

109
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,400
her primary doctor said
she had been doing better and better.

110
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,640
But suddenly, her condition worsened,

111
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,600
even though
she was still seeing the doctor.

112
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,640
The doctor also found it strange.

113
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,360
That's why Mrs. Manee
believes Ms. Ging was poisoned.

114
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,560
If she really was poisoned,

115
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,760
shouldn't there be some kind of evidence?

116
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,840
It's been two or three years
since Ms. Ging passed away.

117
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,640
But at Liangsuttha's house,
there's nothing to connect to it anymore.

118
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,320
GINGYOK'S

119
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,040
Ging's medicine.

120
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,480
- Here.
- Thank you.

121
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,480
See? Sorting the pills
like this makes them easy to take.

122
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,840
I'm glad you like it.

123
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,560
Anything you buy me, I like it all.

124
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,040
Wait.

125
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,760
Yes?

126
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,520
That's my sister's.

127
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,640
But Mrs. Sorn told me to throw it away.

128
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Then don't tell her.
Just say you already did.

129
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,120
I will find out the truth about this.

130
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,320
The teacher I sent to look after Kita

131
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,400
didn't have any issues, right?

132
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,400
None at all.

133
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,760
Kita's adjusting well to new people.

134
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,240
And Ms. Ve?

135
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,760
She said she could take care of herself.

136
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,200
I guess she just needs time.

137
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,680
Maybe she'll understand you.

138
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,400
It's my fault

139
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,800
for not telling her
about Im and Teacher Rawee.

140
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,800
Still, thank you for helping me out.

141
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,280
But there's still a lot you don't know.

142
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,400
Like what?

143
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,760
About Ms. Ging.

144
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,640
About Mr. Pete and me.

145
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,440
What was that?

146
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Oh?

147
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
You were going to tell Ki about us,
weren't you?

148
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,280
That…

149
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,240
we've been seeing each other, Ki.

150
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,240
Huh?

151
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,760
So,

152
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,960
you and Pete…

153
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,040
No, no way…

154
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,200
You don't know how to say it, right?

155
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,680
It happened so fast,
it caught us all off guard, right?

156
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,400
Are you crazy or something?

157
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,520
Why did you suddenly tell Ki we're dating?

158
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,040
Or do you have a crush on me?

159
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,320
Right?

160
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,920
Me? Have a crush on you?

161
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,120
I said "seeing each other," not "dating."

162
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Whenever we're through,
we can just go our separate ways.

163
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,920
Then why did you tell Ki about it?

164
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,040
You're the one
who was going to tell him about Ging.

165
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,080
That's why I said it.

166
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,800
I told you, didn't I?
If we don't have clear proof,

167
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,920
don't say anything to Ki.

168
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,800
But Ms. Ging was his wife.

169
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,760
He deserves to know.

170
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,960
Or do you suspect Ki too?

171
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,720
I already
sent Ging's medicine in for testing.

172
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,400
We'll know the results soon.

173
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,200
I don't care what the results say.

174
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,920
I still believe Ki had nothing
to do with poisoning his own wife.

175
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,560
Yes?

176
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,720
The lab results are in?

177
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,960
Puth.

178
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,040
Is something wrong?

179
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,600
Nun, I want to know why you married him.

180
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,160
I…

181
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,120
- Uh, ouch!
- Why?

182
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,960
What's wrong? What happened to you?

183
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,360
I'm fine.

184
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,400
That's not true.

185
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,080
Why do you have medicine?

186
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,760
What did he do to you? You can tell me.

187
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
Puth…

188
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,000
A man who loves his wife
can do whatever he wants to her.

189
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,840
- Puth…
- If you do anything to Nun…

190
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,920
Singha didn't do anything to me.

191
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,400
Stop bringing up nonsense.

192
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,800
There's nothing between us anymore.

193
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,960
Leave me alone. Go away.

194
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,000
Nun.

195
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,800
Go!

196
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,680
Singha,

197
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,160
if he won't leave, then let's go.

198
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,840
You wanted to leave
because you were worried about him?

199
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,960
No. I just… I just wanted you
to know I chose you.

200
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm not involved with Puth anymore.

201
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,920
I'm a sane man,

202
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,560
not a fool!

203
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,800
I can see clearly that you still love him!

204
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,320
I'm done. I'm going home.

205
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,600
Hey.

206
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Going home?

207
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,760
I helped your mom
get rid of so many enemies.

208
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,120
If I wanted your mom gone,
all I'd have to do is snap my fingers.

209
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,960
And then she'd be gone.

210
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,640
Then who would you turn to for help?

211
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Huh?

212
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,280
Stop, Mr. Singha!

213
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,120
What did you do to Ms. Nun?

214
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,880
Why do you care?

215
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,320
- Ms. Nun.
- Ouch.

216
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,160
Ms. Nun.

217
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,000
What did you do to her?

218
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,119
You're a gopher. Why are you sticking
your nose in a husband-wife matter?

219
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,400
Hey, anyone outside?

220
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,440
Yes, boss.

221
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,480
Take him away.

222
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
This way.

223
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,880
I had Ging's medicine tested.

224
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,320
The rest are just regular heart meds.

225
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,560
But there's one that isn't.

226
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,800
You mean potassium?

227
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,200
If a healthy person
takes that amount, it's fine.

228
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,320
But for someone with heart disease,

229
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,720
it's very dangerous.

230
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,280
I heard about that too.

231
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,720
I'm starting to believe Grandma now
that Ging didn't die accidentally.

232
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,040
Someone must've
deliberately triggered her condition.

233
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,240
Someone had to have switched her meds.

234
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,440
Then you should keep this evidence safe.

235
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,560
Wait until things are clearer.

236
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,200
I believe we'll find out
what really happened.

237
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,960
Rest well in a better place, Teacher.

238
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,760
I'm starting to believe Grandma now
that Ging didn't die accidentally.

239
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,920
Someone must've
deliberately triggered her condition.

240
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,920
Someone had to have switched her meds.

241
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,680
Take a break and take your medicine.

242
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,480
Just leave it there. I'll take it myself.

243
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,160
The doctor said
you have to take it on time.

244
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,400
Dad's blood test result?

245
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,640
It's you?

246
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,440
Pete told me you came to the temple,
so I came here.

247
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,040
I already told Mr. Pete
I can take care of myself.

248
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,320
And I don't need any more help from you.

249
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,360
I want to apologize.
I don't want you to misunderstand me.

250
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,880
About Teacher Rawee and Im's funeral,
I'll handle everything myself.

251
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,280
Then get ready to take responsibility
for hundreds more funerals.

252
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,040
How many people have died
because of your mother?

253
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,320
But we don't have any solid evidence
about Teacher Rawee.

254
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,200
There may be no legal proof.

255
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,280
But someone saw Singha
at the teacher's house with a woman.

256
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,880
And who else
could that be if not your mother?

257
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,120
Do you have anything that confirms

258
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,840
it was my mother?

259
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Have you ever seen
anyone catch a real demon?

260
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,200
Exactly. Your mother
and Singha are the demons.

261
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,320
Let's go, Ve.

262
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,960
Haven't you hurt her enough?

263
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,360
If there's anything I can do to help,

264
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,200
just tell me.

265
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,800
If you really want to help me,

266
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,640
sign the divorce papers.

267
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,400
So, Mrs. Sorn,
you've decided not to go abroad?

268
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,760
Yes.

269
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,200
I'm not going anywhere.

270
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,960
And from now on, Kirin won't be
making any decisions for the company.

271
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,880
Then who will you have
manage things instead?

272
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,160
Don't tell me…

273
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,960
Yes.

274
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,520
I'm appointing Nunnalin
as the next president of the company.

275
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,880
There will be an official announcement

276
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,480
at the project press conference.

277
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,000
Mom, last time some board members

278
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,640
weren't on board with me.

279
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,160
Don't worry about that, Ms. Nun.

280
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,080
I've taken care of it.

281
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,280
No one will challenge your candidacy
as president of the Suttha Group again.

282
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,520
Isn't that right?

283
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,640
Nun, you're lucky

284
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,760
to have a husband
who supports you so much.

285
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,720
Nun.

286
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,640
Why are you standing here? Just go inside.

287
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,360
Mom, I think you should
change your mind. I…

288
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,960
I'm not suited to take over your position.

289
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
You need to believe in yourself, Nun.

290
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,080
There's nothing to be afraid of.

291
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,160
Singha will support everything.

292
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,040
Didn't you see today?

293
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,560
Not a single person objected.

294
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,280
Remember, today,
you will become successful in everything,

295
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,600
both career and family.

296
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,640
That's not true.

297
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,880
Do you know that I…?

298
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,640
No need to say anything.

299
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,560
We'll talk later. Right now, go inside.
Let's go.

300
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,480
Go.

301
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,520
Mrs. Sorn.

302
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
I have something important
to talk to you about.

303
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,000
There you are.
Why haven't you answered my calls?

304
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,760
I've had a lot on my mind.

305
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,600
But right now,
you need to stop thinking and go.

306
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,520
Grandma just told me
about your company's press conference.

307
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,080
Do you even know
what your mother is planning?

308
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,560
If you've got something to say,
say it now.

309
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,120
Haven't you noticed
how unhappy Ms. Nun looks lately?

310
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,760
It's nothing.

311
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,160
She's just not confident about
becoming the new president. That's all.

312
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,200
The event is about to start shortly.

313
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,640
Please make your way inside, everyone.

314
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,240
Instead of being happy to see Nun
rising up, what is this?

315
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,800
You only care about your own interests.

316
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Do you even realize

317
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,080
that Singha has been hurting Ms. Nun?

318
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,720
What are you talking about?

319
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,960
When I dropped off her clothes,

320
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,400
I saw bruises all over her body.

321
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,680
Singha's been abusing her.

322
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,640
Mrs. Sorn.

323
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,520
Stop being so jealous.

324
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,640
Stop twisting stories
and feeding me nonsense. It's annoying.

325
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,320
Singha loves Nun dearly.

326
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,040
And if that were really happening,
Nun would've packed up and left long ago.

327
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,960
So you think I'm lying
because I'm jealous of that brat?

328
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,840
Are you gonna deny it then?

329
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,840
You just can't stand
to see me walk by myself again.

330
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Take a good look at yourself.

331
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,640
You've been useless for a long time.

332
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,560
If you don't believe me,

333
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,960
you'll regret it someday.

334
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,720
What? Are you threatening me now?

335
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,960
It's not a threat.

336
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,560
The truth will come out eventually

337
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,800
about you and me,

338
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,760
and about our child.

339
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,400
Go ahead and try.

340
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,920
But when the time comes
and anything leaks out,

341
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,520
don't say I'm heartless.

342
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,840
- Move.
- Sorry.

343
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,560
Mrs. Sorn gave a strict order
not to let you into the event.

344
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,120
What?

345
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,720
My men made it very clear,
dear brother-in-law.

346
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,120
You're not needed here today.

347
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,320
You arranged everything
for my mom today, didn't you?

348
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,480
Of course.
My wife's about to become president.

349
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,920
Of course I had to take care of it all.

350
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,680
You can go home now.

351
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,160
Whoa. Calm down.

352
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,640
- Move.
- Ki, stop.

353
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,600
So this is why

354
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,040
you and Mom
kept today's event a secret from me.

355
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,480
Nun's still your sister, isn't she?

356
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,480
Maybe it's time
you start learning to sacrifice.

357
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,280
It might help you be a better brother.

358
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,920
Ki, come with me.

359
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,920
- Come on, Ki.
- Please.

360
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,720
Ki.

361
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,680
Ki, I didn't want it to be like this.

362
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,760
But I couldn't go against Mom.

363
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,800
About you
giving everything back to Hathai,

364
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,200
you can just forget about it.

365
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
Nun.

366
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,960
I just want to warn you.

367
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,960
Mom is trying
to cut you out of the company.

368
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,400
All the board members
who used to support you,

369
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,920
they've all changed sides because of…

370
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,080
Singha.

371
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,200
What did you say, Nun?

372
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,480
Your mom's planning to remove Ki
as the president?

373
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,160
So the announcement today
about the new president

374
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,520
isn't about Ki?

375
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,600
That's right. It's not Ki.

376
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,920
How could she do this?

377
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,520
Ki, don't let this happen.

378
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,120
If Mom really wants
to cut me out of Liangsuttha,

379
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,000
there's nothing I can do.

380
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,840
So this means you end up with nothing.

381
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,640
Then everything
I worked so hard for meant nothing?

382
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,080
What do you mean you worked hard?

383
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,040
About that Ve woman and your mom.

384
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,640
What are you talking about?
What about Ve and Mom?

385
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,920
Let go of me.

386
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,280
Mint.

387
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,720
Mrs. Sorn wants you inside, Ms. Nun.

388
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,680
As for you, you're not needed.

389
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,480
If they buy a lot,
we'll give some freebies.

390
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,560
Mrs. Sorn.

391
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,800
Why didn't you tell me

392
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,600
that Ki wouldn't be
the new president of Suttha Group

393
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,320
and that you plan to remove him
from Liangsuttha completely?

394
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,240
Just a moment.

395
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,280
Why are you making a scene here now?

396
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,000
I helped you take down Ve
so you could get rid of her,

397
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,040
and now you betray me
and leave Ki with nothing?

398
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,640
Then what was the point of me
doing everything to marry Ki?

399
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,560
You don't need to marry him.

400
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
And you'd better keep your mouth shut.

401
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,000
Unless you want to disappear like Ve.

402
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,840
Are you threatening me?

403
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,200
It's not a threat.

404
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,240
You've already seen what happened to Ve.

405
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,920
If you want the same, just say the word.
I'll make it happen.

406
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,320
Mom, it's time.

407
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,880
<i>Today,</i>

408
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,520
aside from the Model Gen project,

409
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,040
I also have an important announcement
regarding the Suttha Group.

410
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,080
Is it about the new president?

411
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,960
That's right.

412
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,160
It's time for someone
to take over the role from me.

413
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,200
After all I've done for the company,
working hard,

414
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,400
solving countless problems,
facing attacks and slander,

415
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,160
but in the end, as you can all see,

416
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,080
pure gold doesn't burn in the fire, right?

417
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,720
At last,

418
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,520
the person who tried to
destroy the Suttha Group has lost.

419
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,600
And now it's time for me to step down.

420
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,880
Are you stepping down to announce

421
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,000
your relationship with someone?

422
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,200
What are you talking about?

423
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,000
Someone sent a photo
of you and your secretary

424
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,720
to the press group chat.

425
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,640
They say you two
have been together for a long time,

426
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,080
and that you're stepping down to make
the relationship public. Is that true?

427
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,720
- Here it is.
- This one?

428
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,120
- Here.
- This photo.

429
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,280
Isn't this right?

430
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,120
Where did you get those pictures?

431
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,000
Can we also interview your secretary?

432
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,880
- He's there.
- Is it true you're seeing each other?

433
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,800
Uh, well…

434
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,880
So what exactly is the status

435
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,040
between you

436
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,320
- and Mrs. Kanisorn? Wait.
- Uh, I… Hey.

437
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,880
Please comment on the relationship.

438
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,520
- Here.
- Come on.

439
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,440
- Please answer, Mrs. Kanisorn.
- Mrs. Kanisorn.

440
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,480
What is your relationship, exactly?

441
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,240
There will be no other interviews today.

442
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,800
We will only speak about the Suttha Group.

443
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,520
- Mrs. Kanisorn, please wait.
- Everyone, please remain calm.

444
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,560
- Please don't leave.
- Mrs. Kanisorn.

445
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,880
I'll be waiting to see
what else gets exposed about you.

446
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
Ms. Ve?

447
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,080
You sent those photos
of you and Mom to the press, didn't you?

448
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,360
I didn't.

449
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,040
Then who else
would have pictures like that?

450
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,880
It was just you and Mom.

451
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,680
If it wasn't you, who could it be?

452
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,040
Hey, take care of this.

453
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,200
I would never hurt Mrs. Sorn or Ms. Nun.

454
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
Yes, Mom?

455
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,360
It seems he won't admit it easily.

456
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,280
What should we do?

457
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,040
I'll take care of it.

458
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:18,080
She said she doesn't want
any more scandal involving you.

459
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,600
Hey. Handle it.

460
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,520
Hey, follow him!

461
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:39,080
Nun, get back inside now.
The event's not over.

462
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,880
Maybe you should go back in and
announce your relationship with Uncle Pat

463
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,159
instead of my appointment as president.

464
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,040
Today is an important day for you.

465
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,120
Don't let anything distract you.

466
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,000
Napat is an outsider.

467
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,240
He will never matter more to me than you.

468
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,800
Understand?

469
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880
Come on. Come with me.

470
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,520
Hey. Do you think if Ve knew
about today, she'd show up?

471
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,520
That's why I asked you
to come see the event with me.

472
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,800
Why are you parking behind the hotel?

473
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,000
Well, you saw the front lot was full.

474
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,000
- Wait. Isn't that Mr. Pat?
- Huh?

475
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,280
Mr. Pat. Mr. Pat.

476
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,800
Mr. Pat.

477
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,440
Hey, can you call an ambulance?

478
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,720
It's time for me to step away
from the Suttha Group

479
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,640
and pass on the most important role,

480
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,040
president of the company,

481
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,160
to the most important person in my life,

482
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,760
my daughter,

483
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,040
Ms. Nunnalin Liangsuttha.

484
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,000
Say a few words of thanks
to everyone here.

485
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,360
Thank you all for coming to this event.

486
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,920
Thank you.

487
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,880
Very good, dear.

488
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,520
Alright.

489
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,320
To ensure confidence in the new president,

490
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,760
please enjoy a presentation
of Nunnalin's past accomplishments.

491
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,200
What is that?

492
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,440
<i>Regarding the hit-and-run case…</i>

493
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,080
- Hey.
- What?

494
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,960
<i>The truth is,</i>
<i>I wasn't the one driving that night.</i>

495
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,320
- <i>It was Nun.</i>
- Oh?

496
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,120
<i>I didn't kill anyone with my car.</i>

497
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,840
- What's going on, Ms. Nun?
- Please explain.

498
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,240
- What's happening?
- That's all for today's event.

499
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,040
No, the event isn't over.

500
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,120
- Look. It's Mr. Kirin and his wife.
- What?

501
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,920
I didn't come here today
just as Mr. Ki's wife.

502
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,680
I came as the daughter of Mr. Terdthong

503
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,200
and Mrs. Kitinee Liangsuttha.

504
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,440
I'm Hathai Liangsuttha.

505
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,240
<i>Don't think you'll get anything back.</i>

506

507
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,240
<i>Well, you turned yourself in</i>
<i>and got out on bail.</i>

508
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,640
<i>You just need evidence</i>

509
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,480
to support your case.

510
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,960
<i>And I believe</i>

511
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,400
<i>Mintra definitely has something.</i>

512
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,720
<i>May I take Nun back home for a while?</i>

513
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,360
Why should I move my toy somewhere else?

514
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,040
Did you just call Nun a toy?

515
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,320
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to force yourself like this.</i>

516
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,560
<i>No matter how much</i>

<i>You love him.</i>
