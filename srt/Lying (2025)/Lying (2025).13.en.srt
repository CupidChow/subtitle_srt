1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,480
Please take care of me
at my new workplace, the Suttha Group,

2
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,360
Mother.

3
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,080
You really are Hathai.

4
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,520
<i>I don't care why you came back.</i>

5
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,240
I'll return everything to you.

6
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,000
<i>Whatever you plan,</i>

7
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,720
<i>your mom will never let it happen easily.</i>

8
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,320
<i>If you do nothing,</i>

9
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,040
she'll strip Ging's legacy clean.

10
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,680
Kita will get nothing.

11
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,520
Hey.

12
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,720
I'm sorry I made you upset.

13
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,920
PREVIOUSLY

14
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,000
How did you all get in here?

15
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,600
Why is it Ploy?

16
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,480
How did you end up here with her?

17
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,160
I had an appointment with her.

18
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,880
But after she drank some wine,

19
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,360
she turned out like this.

20
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,560
I have no idea what's wrong with her.

21
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,200
It's like someone
spiked the wine or something.

22
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,480
Madam asked me to tell you
to enjoy your drink while you wait.

23
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,680
She should be here shortly.

24
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,960
Thank you.

25
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,680
Miss Ploy? How did you get here?

26
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,960
Leave.

27
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,480
You're being used by my grandmother.

28
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,600
Is Mrs. Manee setting me up?

29
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Leave, if you don't want trouble.

30
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,920
Thank you for the warning.

31
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,760
Why would Grandma do something like this?

32
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What? Why is it you?

33
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,960
You were tricked into coming
to see Teacher Ve, weren't you?

34
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,000
My grandmother

35
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,680
is using you as another pawn.

36
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,920
So this is all a setup?

37
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,240
Are you alright, Miss Ploy?

38
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,560
I'm fine. You should go now.

39
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,760
Game over.

40
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,760
Hey.

41
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,640
What's wrong?

42
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,000
Hey.

43
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,280
Miss Ploy.

44
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,400
What are you doing?

45
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,800
You think I'm hiding someone?

46
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,920
Yes. We think you're hiding someone.

47
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,600
Just tell us, Pete, where's Wanvela?

48
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,240
You all barged in here
thinking I was with her?

49
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,280
And am I?

50
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,240
You too.

51
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,080
You found a way into this room

52
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,920
to catch Ms. Ve in the act?

53
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,160
What kind of husband are you?

54
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,680
Don't you trust the woman you love at all?

55
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,840
If this is a misunderstanding,

56
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,880
then I apologize for intruding.

57
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,280
Wait.

58
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,480
What?

59
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,480
Or are you about to confess something?

60
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,480
Aren't you the one

61
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,880
who should be confessing, Nun?

62
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,360
Don't think I don't know
what you're up to.

63
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,640
You worked with Mrs. Manee

64
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,120
to trick me into coming here.

65
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,400
You must think I'm so awful

66
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,560
I'd take advantage of a woman.

67
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,480
Is that what you imagined?

68
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,440
Do you think I'm really like that?

69
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,280
Fine, maybe I'm not the best guy,

70
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,640
but I'm not so low that I'd do something

71
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,760
without thinking.

72
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,320
Or are you saying

73
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,000
you don't have any feelings
for Wanvela at all?

74
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,000
Someone like you, who's never known
real love, wouldn't understand

75
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,440
that people can have
pure intentions for each other.

76
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,280
Let go of your bias, Nun.

77
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,560
You might actually
find more happiness in life.

78
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,400
Oh, you're all back already?

79
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
I prepared a late-night meal for you.

80
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,960
I was worried
you'd be hungry when you got home.

81
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,320
Oh, Mother and Nun,
you can stay and eat too.

82
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,880
I made enough.

83
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,680
You must've rushed back to prepare
all this as a cover-up, right?

84
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,000
Cover-up? For what?

85
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,560
Why would I need to cover anything up?

86
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,200
It's not like I did anything wrong
or had any bad intentions.

87
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,560
Mr. Ki,

88
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,960
let's eat before the food gets cold.

89
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,840
Are you hungry?

90
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,440
Aw, Nun,
I thought you'd stay and eat with us.

91
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,080
And you, Mother?

92
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,080
Will you head upstairs or eat with us?

93
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,960
I don't understand how you could
take someone like her as your wife.

94
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,360
It's because of love, Mother.

95
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,440
Someone like you
could never truly love my son.

96
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,640
Enough, Mom.

97
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,680
We're married now.

98
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,560
Can't we all just get along?

99
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,360
You expect me to play nice
with an employee

100
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,720
you made your wife?

101
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,840
Never.

102
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,880
But as far as I know, you used to be
Mr. Terdthong's employee too, didn't you?

103
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And you ended up living in this house

104
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,880
as his mistress, right?

105
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,360
Mom!

106
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,680
- Mom.
- Let go!

107
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,640
Didn't you hear her disrespect me?

108
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,240
Why are you upset over the truth?

109
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,240
Or is it that, as time passes,

110
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,880
people forget their own pasts too easily?

111
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,000
Wait, Mom.

112
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,560
Don't you see she's insulting me?!

113
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,480
Ms. Ve.

114
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,280
I think you should stop now.

115
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,520
If you don't cross the line first,

116
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,760
I'll stay in my place.

117
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,320
Then we won't have an argument.

118
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,760
What is it?

119
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,320
I told you I'd keep my promise.

120
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,240
I'm transferring my first asset to you.

121
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,440
Please sign to acknowledge receipt.

122
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,600
I'll handle the rest.

123
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,600
This is…

124
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,520
I'll explain the details later.

125
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,360
I hope you'll accept it.

126
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,720
Alright. I'll accept it.

127
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,720
What's this emergency meeting about?

128
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,640
Please have a seat, Mrs. Manee.

129
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,120
You'll find out soon.

130
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,240
Is Ki joining this meeting too?

131
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,440
According to the email,
the majority shareholder will be coming.

132
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,080
It's not Mr. Kirin.

133
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,600
What do you mean?

134
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,800
What are you doing here?

135
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,360
Don't tell me
you're Kirin's representative.

136
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,960
I'm here as
the majority shareholder of Jade Biz.

137
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,000
Hm?

138
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,560
Mr. Ki transferred all his shares to me.

139
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,320
The folder in front of you
contains the details.

140
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,120
You…

141
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,120
- Grandma.
- What right do you have

142
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,000
- to take Ging's shares?!
- Grandma.

143
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,800
- You shameless thief!
- Grandma, please.

144
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,280
You shouldn't speak like someone
who's never done business, Mrs. Manee.

145
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,200
Changes in shareholders
are a normal part of any company.

146
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,760
But not here!

147
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,280
Not in my family's company.

148
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,440
I will never let anyone
snatch it away so easily!

149
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,120
Grandma, please.

150
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,840
If you were capable,

151
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,840
you would've figured out
a way to buy the shares back

152
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,400
and reclaimed your position long ago.

153
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,000
Besides, the reason this company
made it through the crisis

154
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,880
is because of the other board members

155
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,800
and Mr. Ki, my husband, as well.

156
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,720
You need to let go of the idea that
this company still belongs to your family.

157
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,120
What Ms. Wanvela said
is right, Mrs. Manee.

158
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,080
This company doesn't belong to you alone.

159
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,640
JADE BIZ
MEETING ROOM

160
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,680
I was foolish to think
you'd be different from Kanisorn's family.

161
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,840
You're just another greedy person

162
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,000
wanting what belongs to others.

163
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,680
Both Ging's man and Ging's shares!

164
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,520
I was nearly foolish enough to think
you truly wanted my help.

165
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,800
But in the end, you went behind my back.

166
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,400
You didn't do any of this for Ms. Ging.

167
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,360
You're selfish
and you did it for yourself.

168
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,960
You!

169
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,480
Grandma. Grandma.

170
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,640
Ugh.

171
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,600
Are you going to fight
to get back what your sister lost?

172
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,400
Or just let them take everything away?

173
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,320
I think if you're still
in this state of mind,

174
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,360
perhaps it's better you step away
from the company for a while.

175
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,320
What did you say?

176
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,840
From this moment on,

177
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,320
you're no longer involved
in the company's affairs.

178
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,280
I'll inform the board
to remove you from all company positions.

179
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,120
Huh?

180
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,680
- Wanvela!
- Grandma.

181
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,400
- Let go of me.
- Enough, please, Grandma.

182
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,160
- Enough.
- Didn't you hear?

183
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,800
- That woman removed me from our company!
- Grandma.

184
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,400
- Grandma, enough.
- Let go.

185
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,840
- Let go of me! Wanvela!
- Grandma.

186
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,320
You're really okay, right?

187
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,840
Yes.

188
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,320
I never expected
Mrs. Manee could be that vicious.

189
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,320
If Miss Ploy hadn't intervened last night,

190
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,520
you would've been wrongly accused.

191
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,280
That's why I came to see you today.

192
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,240
Why?

193
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,360
Because I think
Mrs. Manee hates me even more now.

194
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
I don't want you to get dragged into this.

195
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,080
And besides, I'm married.

196
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,800
Let's only see each other
if we really have to.

197
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,760
Does it really have to be this way?

198
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,480
Or is this what Ki wants?

199
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,400
It's not because of Mr. Ki.

200
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,720
It's because of my own concerns.

201
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,160
Please don't blame him.

202
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,760
Alright.

203
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,080
If it gives you peace of mind.

204
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,240
Mom.

205
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,120
What is it, Nun?

206
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,440
<i>You…</i>

207
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,880
- Grandma.
- What right do you have

208
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,520
- to take Ging's shares?
- Grandma.

209
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
- You shameless thief!
- Grandma, please.

210
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,960
Did Ki really give Gingyok's
Jade Biz shares to Wanvela?

211
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,960
What about your plan to merge Jade Biz
with the Suttha Group now?

212
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,880
Mrs. Manee must've been furious,
no wonder she lashed out.

213
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,080
That Manee woman
is just a fake high-society type.

214
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,560
She thinks
she's better than everyone else.

215
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,920
But when her interests are threatened,
she shows her true colors.

216
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,840
Mr. Ki is unbelievable.

217
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,760
He just got married and already
transferred his shares to an outsider.

218
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,520
If this goes on, won't he be
giving everything away?

219
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,240
I don't think it'll go that far.

220
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,840
Ki's not the kind
to blindly fall for a woman.

221
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,240
But with someone like Wanvela,
you never know.

222
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,840
She might be able
to manipulate him completely.

223
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,280
Call a board meeting immediately.

224
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,480
Don't tell Ki about it.

225
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,920
Yes.

226
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,200
And you, Nun.

227
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,920
Don't say a word to your brother

228
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,680
unless you want our family to fall apart.

229
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,320
Alright, jump in.

230
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,320
Mr. Ki's taking Kita to a tennis lesson,
then out shopping.

231
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,960
They should be back by late afternoon.

232
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,440
Good. What about the board meeting?

233
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,920
Everyone will gather here shortly.

234
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,560
I guarantee no one else knows about it.

235
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,079
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

236
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,880
Is there something urgent
to discuss here, Mrs. Sorn?

237
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,880
I'd like to talk to all of you
about appointing a new CEO.

238
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,440
Are you stepping down?

239
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,440
I'll still support the company.

240
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,400
But I want young blood,
like my daughter's, to take the lead.

241
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,600
Mom…

242
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,000
I want to finalize this
before the official vote.

243
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,280
What about Mr. Kirin?

244
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,520
Excuse me.

245
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,320
I thought you were preparing him for this.

246
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,800
You all know Nun
is the daughter of Mr. Terd.

247
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,760
And now,

248
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,160
she's the only true Liangsuttha. So,

249
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,280
I think she's the most suitable person

250
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,480
to become the new CEO.

251
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,000
But I disagree.

252
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,400
It's outdated to choose leaders
based on bloodline.

253
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,880
I vote for someone with true ability.

254
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,400
If it's Mr. Kirin, I'll support him.

255
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,680
I feel the same.

256
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,440
So I'll excuse myself.

257
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,800
No one leaves this room

258
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,240
until we finish
this discussion with Mrs. Sorn.

259
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,240
How did you get involved, Mr. Sajja?

260
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,680
I'm Mrs. Sorn's partner.

261
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,680
We're allies. Of course I'll support her.

262
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,240
Please have a seat.

263
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,560
Have a seat.

264
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,200
Regarding supporting Ms. Nun,
I have no issue with it, Mr. Sajja.

265
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,200
So, I'll take my leave now.

266
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,520
Thank you.

267
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,400
This way, please.

268
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,520
‪Through here.

269
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,240
Why are you doing this to us, Mrs. Sorn?

270
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,920
I just want your cooperation. That's all.

271
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,920
Nun, wait outside.

272
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
I need to settle this.

273
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,960
What is this?

274
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,880
See for yourself.

275
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,840
This is evidence of bribery
from your rigged land auction deal.

276
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,920
And for you,

277
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,040
this is evidence linking you
to the forced eviction fire case.

278
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,360
Hmm…

279
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,600
three years ago, was it?

280
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,120
It's hard to recall.

281
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,880
This kind of evidence
isn't hard for us to find.

282
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,040
If you help me, I'll help you.

283
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,040
I'll pretend I know nothing.

284
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,200
I'll turn a blind eye to this.

285
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,800
Of course, Mrs. Sorn.

286
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,600
You have my support.

287
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,560
Alright then.

288
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,480
At the next meeting,
I'll vote for Miss Nun.

289
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,400
I'm sorry Grandma hurt you.

290
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,400
But you didn't have to
remove her from the company.

291
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,960
She did it because
she loves the company so much

292
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,760
that she couldn't stand to lose it.

293
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,040
I'm not upset about the physical attack.

294
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,640
But I had my reason for removing her.

295
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,800
What reason?

296
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,080
I can't explain it to you now.

297
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,920
Once I've resolved what I need to,

298
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,960
we'll talk again
about your sister's shares.

299
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,160
Because I never wanted them
in the first place.

300
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,920
I heard from Grandma
you have a grudge against Aunt Sorn.

301
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,640
If you don't love Ki

302
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,760
but you married him just to get revenge,

303
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,360
don't you think

304
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,360
you've let hatred consume you

305
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,560
way too far?

306
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,880
Sometimes, people don't have many choices.

307
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,760
Anyway, I should go
find Mr. Ki and Kita now.

308
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,400
Excuse me.

309
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,480
Who are you really, Wanvela?

310
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,440
Thank you, Mr. Sajja.
Thank you, Mr. Singha.

311
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,040
I've always been fair to everyone
I've gone into business with,

312
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,200
Mrs. Sorn.

313
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,760
You helped me, so I help you.

314
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,120
Especially my son,

315
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,880
once he heard this involved Nun,
he was eager to help right away.

316
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,640
Thank him, dear.

317
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,800
Thank you.

318
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,480
I'll be waiting for the day
you become CEO of the Suttha Group.

319
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,360
After that, I hope our two families
will have some good news to share.

320
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,800
Of course.

321
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,240
Then I'll be going now.

322
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,160
Goodbye.

323
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,200
Goodbye.

324
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,920
Mom,

325
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,520
what did Mr. Sajja mean by good news?

326
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,640
You'll find out when the time comes.

327
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,840
For now, just focus
on your upcoming position.

328
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,160
But Mom,

329
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,760
I don't have what it takes to be a CEO.

330
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,240
Whether you do or don't doesn't matter.

331
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,480
There's no way I'll let Wanvela
interfere with the company,

332
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,600
just like she made Manee
lose her mind at Jade Biz.

333
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,440
Did someone
visit the house today, Aunt Kob?

334
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,800
Oh, no one.

335
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,160
These are for Miss Nun,
Mr. Pat, and Mrs. Sorn.

336
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,960
She ordered several cups today.

337
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,240
- Alright.
- And Master Kita's pizza is warmed up too.

338
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,280
I'll go take in the laundry now.

339
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,640
Is Mom calling a board meeting?

340
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,120
I'm not sure
what she's discussing with them.

341
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,600
Why wouldn't she want you to know?

342
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,480
Could it be about you
transferring Ms. Ging's shares to Ms. Ve?

343
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,320
Or maybe she met the board members here?

344
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,600
What did they talk about?

345
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Mr. Ki, is the pizza done?

346
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,760
Is something wrong?

347
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,880
It's just finished.

348
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,360
You know, you could've taken
Kita out for dinner instead,

349
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,400
so you wouldn't have to
come home to heat up pizza.

350
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,920
Kita just wanted to finish
the pizza he ordered.

351
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,560
Which is a good thing,
my son's learning not to waste food.

352
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,120
That'll make it easier
when he moves into his new home.

353
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,800
New home?

354
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,640
I'm looking for a new place.

355
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,800
So we can move out when the time comes.

356
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,640
Is something wrong, Aunt Kob?

357
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,440
Oh.

358
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,360
Nothing.

359
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,560
I just wanted to say.

360
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,560
Since you moved in with Mr. Ki,

361
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,520
the place has been so neat.

362
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,000
The bed, the closet, everything's tidy.

363
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,920
When Mr. Ki lived alone, it was messier.

364
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,080
I just don't like when things are messy.

365
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,040
So I clean everything.

366
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,120
Are you taking the laundry?

367
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,440
Oh, yes, yes.

368
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,880
Is she suspicious?

369
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,480
Ah.

370
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,400
I was about to go to bed.

371
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,400
I just wanted to ask you to go with me.

372
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,280
Hey.

373
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,360
- You mean you want me to sleep--
- Aunt Kob came into the room

374
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,680
and got suspicious
about the things inside.

375
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,680
If you don't sleep in there sometimes,

376
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
I'm afraid she'll find out the truth.

377
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,400
Won't you feel uncomfortable?

378
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
It's just one night.

379
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,840
But if you're worried
about people getting suspicious,

380
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,760
then I might have to stay with you often.

381
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,120
Let's just get through tonight first.

382
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,000
Let's go.

383
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,720
Hey.

384
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,440
Someone's watching us.

385
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
That was close.

386
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,800
Whoa, hey.

387
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,120
What are you doing?

388
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,280
Taking you to bed.

389
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,480
You don't need to go this far.

390
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,080
People will get suspicious.

391
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,440
- Let's just go to bed.
- Ah.

392
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,120
Mr. Ki, put me down.

393
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,280
We're already in the room.
No one's watching.

394
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,960
Here.

395
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,280
You can sleep standing up?

396
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
Impressive.

397
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,920
I'm trying to find a way to return
the Suttha Group's shares to you.

398
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,800
- Why bring that up now?
- Well,

399
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,800
because every minute
I spend with you is meaningful.

400
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,240
And I don't want you to ever regret
the time you've spent with me.

401
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,440
That's why I've been trying so hard

402
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,360
to achieve this goal.

403
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,800
But the problem is

404
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,520
my mom is watching me closely.

405
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,320
She already found out

406
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,800
about Jade Biz shares I gave you.

407
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,120
What if she finds out
you want to return everything to me?

408
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,640
She'll be upset.

409
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,400
But I'm still her son.

410
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,520
I believe she'll forgive me.

411
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,040
Don't worry.

412
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,320
I think if you stay in this room,
I won't be able to sleep.

413
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,920
You stay here.

414
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,640
I'll sleep with Kita.

415
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,840
Wait.

416
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,880
Are you mad at me?

417
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,480
I'd rather hate you.

418
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,440
Because if I did,

419
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,920
I wouldn't have to
feel so guilty about myself.

420
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,760
If you're not mad at me,

421
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,880
if you don't hate me,

422
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,480
then how do you really feel about me?

423
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,440
Or you…

424
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,160
Mr. Ki? Mr. Ki?

425
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,360
Mr. Ki. Mr. Ki.

426
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,360
Mr. Ki! Mr. Ki!

427
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,480
Mr. Ki!

428
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,240
The patient is now stable.

429
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,280
What happened to my son?

430
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,880
Why did he lose consciousness?

431
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,480
Does he have a history of drug use?

432
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,680
No way. Ki would never touch that stuff.

433
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,480
Is there something wrong, Doctor?

434
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,520
His blood test
shows a high level of amphetamine.

435
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,920
That caused the symptoms you saw.

436
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,240
Mr. Ki would never use drugs.

437
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,800
Someone must've drugged him.

438
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,840
Because every minute
I spend with you is meaningful.

439
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,520
And I don't want you to ever regret
the time you've spent with me.

440
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,560
I'd rather hate you.

441
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,440
Because if I did,

442
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,680
I wouldn't have to
feel guilty about myself.

443
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,880
Then how do you really feel about me?

444
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,480
Mr. Ki.

445
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,440
Please be okay.

446
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,760
For dinner, Mr. Ki asked me to reheat

447
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,280
pizza for Mr. Kita.

448
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
As for the other dishes,

449
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,520
Ms. Ve cooked them.

450
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,960
The three of them ate together.

451
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,600
No, after dinner,

452
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,600
Mr. Ki didn't ask for anything else.

453
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,680
<i>In the evening,</i>

454
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,880
I saw Mr. Ki reading for a bit,

455
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,040
then he took Ms. Ve back to her room.

456
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,040
Yesterday, Ms. Ve

457
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,160
<i>was the one who stayed</i>
<i>with Mr. Ki the whole time.</i>

458
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,320
- Ve. You!
- Hey! Ugh!

459
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,920
- You!
- Mrs. Sorn,

460
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,520
what are you doing?

461
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,360
I found this in your bag, in Ki's room.

462
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,800
You went through my stuff?

463
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,360
If I hadn't,
how would I have found it, huh?

464
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,160
I checked with everyone in the house.

465
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,840
Yesterday, you were the only one
who made food for Ki.

466
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Is this what you gave my son
that almost killed him?

467
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,600
I didn't do it.

468
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,560
- Those drugs aren't mine either.
- I don't believe you.

469
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,680
I had it tested.

470
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,280
It's the exact same drug
found in Ki's system.

471
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,440
Did you drug my son?

472
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,280
- Why did you do it? Why?
- Mrs. Sorn!

473
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,480
- Don't, Mrs. Sorn.
- Why did you do that to my son?!

474
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
- Why?
- I said I didn't do it!

475
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,520
- Uncle Pat, help me!
- Mrs. Sorn, please stop.

476
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,800
- Mrs. Sorn, please stop.
- You!

477
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,200
I'm telling you again

478
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,560
I didn't do it.

479
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,520
And I would never do such a thing.

480
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm not like you, who goes around
drugging people in the house.

481
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,120
What are you talking about?

482
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,560
<i>Dad.</i>

483
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,120
Dad! Dad!

484
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,840
Someone, help him!

485
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,080
Who knows?

486
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,679
Maybe you're the one who drugged Mr. Ki
and you're trying to frame me.

487
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,400
Are you insane?

488
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,360
Mom would never do something like that.

489
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,840
But Mrs. Sorn has done
unexpected things before, hasn't she?

490
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,800
You're the one who found the drugs.

491
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,080
Who's to say they were really mine?

492
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,520
You're the only one saying that.

493
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,080
Everyone in the house
is just as suspicious.

494
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,440
Stop blaming others.

495
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,400
You're the only outsider here.

496
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,040
The only one who would want
to harm this family.

497
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,800
I'm not going to let myself
be accused like this.

498
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,440
No matter what, I'll find the evidence
to prove who drugged Ki.

499
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,000
You didn't do
what Wanvela is saying, right?

500
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,560
Don't be ridiculous.

501
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,360
What kind of mother would hurt her child?

502
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,000
Miss Nun, even if
Mrs. Sorn had issues with Mr. Ki,

503
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,440
she would never go that far.

504
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,720
Then who else could it be?

505
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,520
It was her. It was Wanvela.

506
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,400
I'm sorry.

507
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,960
I know I promised not to come see you,

508
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,640
but when I heard Ki was drugged,
I couldn't stay away.

509
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,480
I needed to come.

510
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,480
It's okay.

511
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,480
Mr. Ki still
hasn't regained consciousness.

512
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,200
And about Mrs. Sorn accusing you
of drugging Ki…

513
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,520
What do you think?

514
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,120
I think someone in the house

515
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,240
wanted to frame you.

516
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,160
To make you fight with Ki.

517
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,000
You're accusing someone else's
family right inside their home?

518
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,600
Just like how people here

519
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,160
keep trying to frame Ms. Ve.

520
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,360
I didn't realize

521
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,760
you were so blinded by love

522
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,280
that everyone else seems evil to you.

523
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,440
What about the other day at the hotel?

524
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,080
Wasn't that some wicked plan?

525
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,480
Pete.

526
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,000
Mr. Pete, please stop.

527
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,440
There's no point arguing right now.

528
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,920
Of course.

529
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,640
Not until we have solid evidence
to catch you red-handed.

530
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,240
Once Ki wakes up,

531
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,120
he'll tell us who did it.

532
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,640
And when that time comes,

533
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,560
you won't get away.

534
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,080
Don't worry, Ms. Ve.

535
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,520
I'll help you.

536
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,400
But for now, let's go check on Ki.

537
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,520
Yes, I was going to check on him too.

538
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,440
I hope he wakes up soon.

539
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,560
Hello, Auntie.

540
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,480
Hello.

541
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,760
Pete, you should go.

542
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,080
Ki's not awake yet.

543
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,200
Leave this place now,
and stay away from my son.

544
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,000
Auntie, doing this won't change anything.

545
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,280
Ah.

546
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,400
I have to do it for Ki's safety.

547
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,840
That girl is dangerous.

548
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,200
She made Ki end up like this.

549
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,440
Ki. You're awake.

550
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,640
Do you know that you were drugged?

551
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,200
Me? Drugged?

552
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,600
Yes, the doctor said
they found drugs in your blood.

553
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,920
Can you remember
how you could've taken them?

554
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,200
Do you recall anything?

555
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,280
No one drugged me, Mom.

556
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,440
What are you saying, Ki?

557
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,200
I took them myself.

558
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,600
<i>When I saw his blood test, I was shocked.</i>

559
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,400
<i>There was a very high amount of drugs.</i>

560
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,880
I want all of Ging's shares
in Jade Biz back

561
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,960
before I accidentally
leak Kirin's blood test results.

562
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
<i>I came here for you, Dad, Mom.</i>

563
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,160
NEXT EPISODE

564
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,360
<i>But what should I do now?</i>

565
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,120
Please don't blame yourself.
None of this is your fault.

566
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,080
<i>Soon, we'll vote</i>
<i>for the new company president.</i>

567
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,240
<i>I'll nominate Nun.</i>

568
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,760
I want you to resign.

569
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,600
