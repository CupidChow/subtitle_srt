00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,800
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,400
Those thugs were Napat's men,
weren't they?

3
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,240
<i>These are Hathai's toys.</i>
<i>Is it because of Miss Ve?</i>

4
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,040
Did she remind you of Hathai?

5
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,000
Stop saying that girl's name.
I don't want to hear it again.

6
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,880
<i>Dad, I'm home now.</i>

7
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,960
<i>Dad's blood test results.</i>

8
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,160
<i>Didn't you say you were just here</i>
<i>to investigate your father's death?</i>

9
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,120
Why go this far?

10
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,480
Don’t worry about me.

11
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,920
I promise I won't say a word.

12
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,480
I'll leave it to you, Mr. Phudit.

13
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,440
If there's any update at the site,
please let me know.

14
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,440
Ki.

15
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,880
I gotta go now.

16
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,840
What is it, Nun?

17
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,120
Nothing. I just wanted to ask

18
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,480
if Teacher Ve and Pete

19
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,800
are really just coworkers.

20
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,520
Why do you ask that?

21
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,720
I was afraid they'd notice me,

22
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,320
so I didn't get too close. I didn't hear
what they were talking about.

23
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
But I was thinking

24
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,360
if I should show this video to Mom.

25
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,080
Ah, no need. Maybe it's nothing.

26
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,240
- Here.
- What? Ki.

27
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,720
Why did you delete my clip?

28
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,720
I'll keep the video myself.
Don't worry about it.

29
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,240
What are you two arguing about?

30
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,200
Is it something about me, Nun?

31
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,560
No, it's nothing.

32
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,640
What about you? Weren't you
going to evaluate Teacher Ve?

33
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,640
Yeah, I was just on my way
to watch her teach Kita.

34
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,120
Just to evaluate her teaching?
Is that all?

35
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,000
Nun.

36
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,280
Mr. Ki, Mrs. Sorn wants to see you now.

37
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,200
Alright. I'll go see Mom first.

38
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,160
- What's going on, Auntie?
- Oh.

39
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,680
There's big news.
You can check your phone.

40
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,360
Right now, firefighters are putting out
a fire at the construction site

41
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,280
of the Suttha Group's new condo project.

42
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,360
The fire has spread
to several nearby residential homes.

43
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,360
<i>Evacuation in the area</i>

44
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,640
<i>is now complete.</i>

45
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,720
- Okay.
- How could this happen?

46
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,280
They still haven't found the cause.
We'll have to wait until the fire is out.

47
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,240
Lots of reporters
want to come interview us.

48
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,120
Reject them all. No interviews allowed.

49
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,560
- Yes.
- But if we do that,

50
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,120
won't the residents be even more upset?

51
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,640
Exactly. At the very least, we should
say we'll offer some compensation.

52
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,040
Compensation?
Why should we compensate them?

53
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,880
If we do that, it's like admitting fault.

54
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,880
And maybe the fire wasn't even our fault.

55
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,040
Then how about we help as philanthropists?

56
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,040
Sorry, I was bringing Kita to see Mr. Ki,

57
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,080
so I just wanted to help.

58
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,200
Help? Philanthropy?

59
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,520
Even if the cause isn't clear yet,

60
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,840
the incident has already happened.

61
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,280
If you step in and help
without expecting anything in return,

62
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,200
I believe people will praise you.

63
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,600
Without expecting anything in return?

64
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,320
You're saying I should donate
to the villagers for free?

65
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,040
Then what if you use

66
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,600
your foundation's name
to make the donation?

67
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,840
Doing it through the foundation is good.
It avoids the issue of if we're at fault.

68
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,720
It's also good PR for the company.

69
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,760
Donate?

70
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,000
Why should I lose millions for this?

71
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,920
You don't have to use your own money.

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,440
Just auction off
some things you no longer use.

73
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,480
And invite those who
crave the spotlight to help raise bids.

74
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm sure it'll raise a lot.

75
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,200
But Mrs. Sorn, I think…

76
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,400
Thank you for helping today.

77
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,160
No trouble at all.

78
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,040
Here's the list of people
who'll log in to join the auction.

79
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,680
I screened them already.

80
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,560
There are only rich and famous people.

81
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,200
Didn't want any randoms bidding
just hundreds or thousands.

82
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,320
Nun.

83
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,760
Then we'll probably
get a big donation total today.

84
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,520
Anything I can help with?

85
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,880
Oh, nothing. Thanks.

86
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,080
So what items is Mrs. Sorn
putting up for auction?

87
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,440
Some shoes, bags,

88
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,280
and this diamond necklace.

89
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,560
But it's not authentic.
She spent hours picking

90
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,920
the oldest,

91
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,640
least favorite, and cheapest ones.

92
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,160
So I wonder how much
she'll get from these things.

93
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,240
People joining this auction
probably just want to help the villagers.

94
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,400
They're not expecting premium stuff.

95
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,840
Besides, with her reputation,

96
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,799
they'll assume
everything is top quality anyway.

97
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,960
Hello?

98
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,680
What? You got lucky numbers?

99
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,440
Yeah, wait. My signal's bad. Hold on.

100
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,840
Yeah.

101
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,720
These are all the items
you'll be auctioning

102
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,560
via livestream today, right?

103
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,480
Yes.

104
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,800
As a representative
of the Liangsuttha Foundation,

105
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,280
I want to thank Mintra,

106
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,720
Gingploy, and many others

107
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,920
for bringing items for auction today.

108
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,480
The items you are auctioning off today

109
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,040
are very special, right?

110
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,360
Oh, not really.

111
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,240
But I brought each piece
with good intentions.

112
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,200
I hope we'll get
a lot of generous bidders,

113
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,120
so we can help the fire victims.

114
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,760
- I see.
- Let's start the auction then.

115
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,200
Alright.

116
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,600
Okay?

117
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,480
Without further ado,

118
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,080
I believe everyone watching the livestream

119
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,720
is ready to bid.

120
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,280
Get your fingers and numbers ready.

121
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,280
And here these are the items

122
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,480
Mrs. Kanisorn Liangsuttha,

123
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,840
CEO of the Suttha Group,
puts up for auction today.

124
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,840
That one.

125
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,120
The necklace.

126
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,120
Mom, what's wrong?

127
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,600
I didn't put
that necklace set up for auction.

128
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,960
Please wear this.

129
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,160
Thank you so much.

130
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,040
Dear.

131
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,920
You gave her my necklace?

132
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,680
That was the one
you gave me on our wedding day.

133
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,440
I'm only lending it to her for an event.

134
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,880
An event?

135
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,800
You dare go to an event
parading yourself as someone's mistress

136
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,560
- and wearing someone else's jewelry?
- Nee.

137
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,960
Give it back. Give it back now!

138
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,920
That's enough, Nee.
Those diamonds are mine.

139
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,240
I can give them to whomever I want.

140
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,640
Not just this. Everything in this house.

141
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,840
If I want to give it to Sorn,
it's none of your business.

142
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,600
Did Aunt Kob take the wrong one, Mom?

143
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,120
Impossible. That necklace
was locked in my safe.

144
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,400
I'm going to get it back.

145
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,920
Mom. Mom.

146
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,360
Wait. We're live right now.

147
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,480
Reporters already took a picture

148
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,680
of everything we're auctioning.

149
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,520
And don't forget the representatives
from the community.

150
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,920
- That's right, Mom.
- Please sit down.

151
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,920
- It's my stuff.
- Sit down first, please.

152
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,320
Why?

153
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,320
You're so charitable, Mom.

154
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,280
Look at each one of them.

155
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,360
And that diamond set,
how many millions is that, Mrs. Sorn?

156
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,000
Everyone's praising you in the comments.

157
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,480
"A real angel."

158
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,920
"Mrs. Kanisorn
is both beautiful and kind."

159
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,840
"So happy for the community."
Please give her a big hand, everyone.

160
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,880
Please just go with it for now, Mom.

161
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,440
Ki and I will buy them back for you later.

162
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,360
And this piece is the last item
we'll be auctioning today.

163
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,480
It belongs to Mrs. Kanisorn,
a genuine diamond necklace set

164
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,680
that was specially commissioned.

165
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,800
We'll start the bidding at

166
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,760
50,000 baht.

167
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,200
It's currently at 200,000 baht.

168
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,840
Now it's at 800,000 baht,

169
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,200
from a user named S Saralee.

170
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,680
Is there anyone who'll bid higher?

171
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,320
If not, I'll start counting.

172
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,160
Eight hundred thousand baht, going once.

173
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,600
Eight hundred thousand baht, going twice.

174
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,400
- And eight hundred thousand baht--
- Two million.

175
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,360
Did she really just bid two million
on Mom's necklace?

176
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,640
Isn't bidding in person
against the rules, Nun?

177
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,080
But we didn't
actually set any rules, Ploy.

178
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,400
Mom, why did it log me out?

179
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,600
Two million baht, going once.

180
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,680
Two million baht, going twice.

181
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,080
And two million baht,

182
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,200
sold.

183
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,680
It's sold

184
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,360
to Miss Wanvela. Congratulations!

185
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,640
PRETTY AND RICH

186
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,280
TWO MILLION?!

187
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,000
SO HAPPY FOR THE COMMUNITY

188
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,960
I've already transferred the payment.

189
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,680
Since the winning bidder
is here with us at the event,

190
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,480
I'd like to invite Mrs. Kanisorn

191
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,400
to personally present the necklace sent.

192
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,600
Please come forward.

193
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,520
Thank you so much, Mrs. Kanisorn.

194
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,160
Let me summarize just the items
auctioned by Mrs. Kanisorn.

195
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,760
The event isn't over yet.

196
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,200
The total is 2,320,000 baht.

197
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,320
Calm down, Mom.

198
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,320
Next, I'd like to invite

199
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,480
a representative of the community
to thank Mrs. Kanisorn

200
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,480
for organizing this event. Please.

201
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,960
Thank you so much

202
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,640
for helping us this much.

203
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,000
I made this curry
to sell in our community.

204
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,800
People say it's delicious,

205
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,319
so I wanted to let you try some.

206
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,520
I hope you don't mind.

207
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,400
Not at all.

208
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,240
It's really okay, Grandma.

209
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,680
It's okay.

210
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,640
I said it's okay, didn't I?!

211
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,920
- What's wrong with you?!
- Mom.

212
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,640
End the livestream now!

213
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,520
Uh, excuse me,
could everyone please step outside?

214
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,400
- Please, this way, this way.
- The event

215
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,960
is now over. Please make your way out.

216
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,880
Thank you. This way, please.

217
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,920
Thank you so much.

218
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,520
This way, everyone.

219
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,960
I'm sorry.

220
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,200
Do you know how much my outfit costs?

221
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,800
Can you even afford to pay for it?

222
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,760
I'm so sorry, ma'am. I didn't mean to.

223
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,240
Didn't mean to? You didn't mean

224
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,920
- to do it?
- Mom!

225
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,600
I shouldn't have
raised money for these fools.

226
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,840
Mom, please stop. She didn't mean it.

227
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,320
Hey, get the grandma cleaned up.

228
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,200
Mom, the livestream is still on.

229
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,840
No one turned it off. Here it is.

230
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,040
SO CONDESCENDING

231
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,960
Huh?

232
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,000
SOMEONE PLEASE RECORD THIS

233
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,800
GET READY FOR THE BACKLASH

234
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,080
- Mrs. Sorn.
- Did you send everyone away?

235
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,120
Yes, everyone's gone. And I've ordered
all the livestream clips deleted too.

236
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,560
But was your necklace really switched?

237
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,320
Of course it was.

238
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,400
I'd never put
that necklace up for auction.

239
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,640
Someone must've taken it out of my safe.

240
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,760
If you hadn't banned security cameras

241
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,440
outside your bedroom,

242
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,320
we'd have caught the thief already.

243
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,000
Mrs. Sorn values her privacy, you know.

244
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,520
She values privacy

245
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,560
or just doesn't want anyone to know

246
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,560
who's been going in and out of her room?

247
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,600
Nun.

248
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,920
If you can't find evidence
to catch the culprit, so be it.

249
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,520
I just want my necklace back.

250
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,720
Then the only thing to worry about
is that necklace, Mom.

251
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,080
And the person who won the auction
doesn't seem like she'll sell it back.

252
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,280
I need to talk to you.

253
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,200
Say what you need to.

254
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,280
I'd like to buy back my mom's necklace.

255
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,680
But I don't think this necklace
really belonged to your mom.

256
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,560
I mean,

257
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,800
maybe she didn't value it much
and that's why she auctioned it.

258
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,080
Or maybe it was a gift from someone else.

259
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Whoever it belonged to,
I want to buy it back.

260
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,320
I'll pay more
than the two million you donated.

261
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,800
But I think it's a beautiful necklace.

262
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,600
Besides, I genuinely
wanted to help the community.

263
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,720
You asking to buy it back now
kind of ruins my intent.

264
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,120
I'll offer three million.

265
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,600
That's more than
the total your auction raised.

266
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,280
If your goal from the start
was truly to help the community,

267
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,640
you wouldn't have to spend this much now.

268
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,960
I don't care.

269
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,720
Even if you flaunted your wealth
bidding two million for the necklace,

270
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,920
I'm handing you
a million baht just like that.

271
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,200
Someone at your level
wouldn't want to turn that down.

272
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,920
It's true I'm not super rich.

273
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,080
It took me years
to save up those two million.

274
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,920
But I'm afraid
I can't sell it back to you.

275
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,720
I'm sorry.

276
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,000
- Give me back my necklace.
- Mom. Mom.

277
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,320
Let me handle this.

278
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,840
I think I've made myself clear.

279
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,720
I hope you won't use your position
as my employer to pressure me.

280
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,560
If three million isn't enough,

281
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,560
just name your price.

282
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,400
And how much do you think
it'd take to satisfy me?

283
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,080
Do you realize you're making me feel like

284
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,800
you're trying to one-up my mother,
and me too?

285
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,720
I'm not trying to one-up anyone.

286
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,280
But I just want you
to know that some things

287
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,440
might be waiting for their true owner
to come claim them.

288
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,400
Like this necklace,
maybe it was waiting for me.

289
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,760
That's why I won the auction.

290
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,520
Tell your mother to let it go.

291
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,560
Because I'm not selling it.

292
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,640
- Miss Ve.
- Oh, and one more thing.

293
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,920
Don't waste your time
trying to buy the necklace back from me.

294
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,200
You should be worrying more
about public opinion right now

295
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,360
about how badly people are criticizing
your mother after today's event.

296
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,160
Why are these reporters here?

297
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Even if the livestream clips got deleted,

298
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,800
someone must have recorded it.

299
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,440
I told you not to come to the office yet.

300
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,320
I have to. I've got an important
meeting today. I can't reschedule.

301
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,560
Should we enter through the back?

302
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,280
No good. I already checked
and reporters are waiting there too.

303
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,760
So how do we get in now?

304
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,040
- She's here.
- She's arrived.

305
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,880
Mrs. Sorn.

306
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,680
- May we get an interview?
- Mrs. Sorn, please give us a statement.

307
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
- Excuse us, please. Excuse us.
- Please talk to us.

308
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,080
- What really happened?
- Um, I'm sorry, but

309
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,880
my mom's not feeling well today.
She won't be giving any interviews.

310
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,880
She's unwell but still came to work?

311
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,480
‪-That's right.
‪-True.

312
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,000
Yes, today she has
a meeting about the fire incident.

313
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,560
Even though she's unwell, she came because

314
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,800
she truly cares about the people affected.

315
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,480
But during the auction livestream,
it didn't quite look that way.

316
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,800
- Yes, right.
- Uh…

317
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,440
There must've been a misunderstanding.
Please let her go inside.

318
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,000
- Excuse us.
- Please wait.

319
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,640
Full makeup, huh?
Didn't you say you were sick?

320
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,000
Such a liar.

321
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,040
Who the hell are you?
How dare you treat Mrs. Sorn like this?

322
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,800
She did worse to our mom.

323
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,440
You probably don't know
how early my mom woke up

324
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,920
just to buy ingredients
and cook curry for her.

325
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,040
If I had known she hated poor people,

326
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,080
I'd have told Mom to cook her
a stinkbean stir-fry with frogs!

327
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,840
So today, she can drink
that stinkbean juice!

328
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,440
Who the hell are you people?
How dare you treat me like this?

329
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,680
Oh, just a splash of stinkbean juice,
and you're suddenly cured.

330
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,440
- You!
- Come on!

331
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,280
Come at me!

332
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,360
Wow, I heard you're the mistress.

333
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,480
Big fancy company, huh?

334
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,440
- Guess you stole someone's husband.
- That's right.

335
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,960
Is that true?

336
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,120
- Mom.
- Is it true, Mrs. Sorn?

337
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,040
Let's go. I'm so humiliated
I don't even know where to hide anymore.

338
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,120
Excuse us.

339
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,760
- Please let us through.
- Please wait.

340
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,800
- Please make way.
- Talk to us, please!

341
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,520
Block them out!

342
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,720
Don't come any closer. If you do,
I'll sue every one of you. Leave!

343
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,680
Yes?

344
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,600
Who are you?

345
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,400
I shouldn't have trusted you
and hosted the charity auction for them.

346
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,320
I don't care about the money. But
the humiliation is because of you, Nun.

347
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,680
It's not fair to blame me, Mom.

348
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,200
Everything that happened was because
you couldn't control your temper.

349
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,160
I'm helping you deal with the problem.
If it's still not enough,

350
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,800
- I honestly don't know what else to do.
- Nun.

351
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,440
Mrs. Sorn.

352
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,640
What now? Why haven't you
brought me a change of clothes yet?

353
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,880
I was about to,

354
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,040
but someone just called,
claiming he has evidence

355
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,520
that could expose our company.

356
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,720
What? Who is it?

357
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,200
ALL RECORDINGS

358
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,040
<i>I have proof that the fire</i>

359
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,680
<i>came from the Suttha Group's</i>
<i>condo construction site.</i>

360
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,560
<i>If you don't want this exposed,</i>
<i>compensate all the residents.</i>

361
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,480
No one must know about this,
especially Ki.

362
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,200
But it looks like Mr. Ki

363
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,880
has already ordered someone
to investigate the cause of the fire.

364
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,760
Anyway, I'll go get
a new outfit for you first.

365
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,920
I've seen it. They actually used
downgraded wiring during construction.

366
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,440
The fire was likely
caused by an electrical short.

367
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,880
If you find anything else, send it to me.

368
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,840
I'll call a board meeting
and we'll figure out how to handle this.

369
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,640
That's all for now.

370
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,160
What's that you brought for Daddy, Kita?

371
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,800
Sandwiches.
Teacher Ve taught me how to make them.

372
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,520
I let Kita try making something simple,
and he wanted to bring it to you to taste.

373
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,000
You're amazing, my boy.

374
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,600
Oops, I forgot the drink.

375
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,880
You must be stressed
about Mrs. Sorn and the fire, right?

376
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,880
There's nothing we can do about my mom,

377
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
but if the fire

378
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,480
really did start at our construction site,
I'll take full responsibility.

379
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,880
By donating some pocket change,
like at the auction?

380
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,880
You seem to think the worst of me.

381
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,320
Then tell me how you plan to fix this?

382
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,440
I've seen a lot of people

383
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,480
who say they'll take full responsibility

384
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,680
and solve everything.

385
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,840
But it never happens.

386
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,960
If we gather solid evidence

387
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,840
that the fire
really did start at our site,

388
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,120
I'll hold a press conference
and take full financial responsibility.

389
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,360
There will be no press conference

390
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,240
or any public admission of fault.

391
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,920
Why not, Mom?

392
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,840
Just donating money

393
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,640
already shows we care.

394
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,240
Besides,

395
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,400
the fire wasn't even our fault.

396
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,600
- It wasn't our fault?
- Hm.

397
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,160
The police caught the arsonist.

398
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,960
- He's here.
- Uncle.

399
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,480
Did you really start the fire?

400
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,400
I did it. I didn't mean to.

401
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,040
So why would you do that?

402
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,840
Yeah, why? What was your motive?

403
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,000
- Well…
- Uh.

404
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,600
Mrs. Kanisorn, can we get a comment?

405
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,600
So, the arsonist confessed.
What exactly did he admit to?

406
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,720
Ah, yes. Basically,

407
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,560
the man snuck into our construction site

408
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,880
without permission.

409
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,360
He got drunk there,

410
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,800
lit a fire,

411
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,160
and couldn't put it out in time,
which led to the fire.

412
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,840
But don't worry.
Our legal team is already looking into

413
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,160
how we can support
the affected households.

414
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,920
Our project follows strict procedures.

415
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,360
Construction is up to standard.

416
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,040
We absolutely weren't responsible
for this fire.

417
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,400
- Can we get a photo?
- Oh, of course.

418
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,960
<i>Our legal team is already looking into</i>

419
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,840
<i>how we can support</i>
<i>the affected households.</i>

420
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,760
<i>Our project follows strict procedures.</i>

421
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,120
<i>Construction is up to standard.</i>

422
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,160
<i>We absolutely weren't responsible</i>
<i>for this fire.</i>

423
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,960
Looks like Mrs. Kanisorn won't have to

424
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,000
compensate the community this time.

425
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,240
Unless there's solid proof

426
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,480
that the fire started from our site,
that's how it'll stay.

427
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,360
Someone suddenly confesses.

428
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,320
How convenient.

429
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,960
Are you being sarcastic?

430
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,080
I'm not.

431
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,880
But I think the people hearing this
will probably feel the same way I do.

432
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,880
Are you saying you don't believe
the man's confession?

433
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,880
I don't know the internal details
of your condo construction.

434
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,640
I'm not in a place to judge.

435
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,840
But you, you have all the facts.

436
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,920
Ask yourself.

437
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,600
Do you believe what your mother said?

438
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,240
Thank you

439
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,120
for finding someone to take the blame.
But are you sure

440
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,360
he won't recant later?

441
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,160
No worries.

442
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,720
People with no future, nothing to lose,

443
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,600
we give them a bit of cash,

444
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,720
and they'll go to jail for you.

445
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,320
Honestly, for him,

446
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,560
life might be easier inside than out.

447
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,560
What about Mr. Ki
sending someone to inspect the project?

448
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,440
I'll assign Ki to another site.
Keep him out of this.

449
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,080
Don't worry.

450
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,800
He's calling again.

451
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,840
Pick it up.

452
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,640
Why are you calling again?

453
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,480
<i>Don't think pinning the blame</i>
<i>on a scapegoat will get you off the hook.</i>

454
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,760
<i>I still have plenty of evidence</i>
<i>to expose you.</i>

455
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,240
You think threats like that will scare me?

456
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,880
<i>So how about we start with</i>
<i>tens of millions in construction bribes?</i>

457
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,320
Who are you?

458
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,840
You don't need to know who I am.
Just compensate the residents,

459
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
unless you want this to blow up even more.

460
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,520
How much do you want?

461
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,200
Twenty million. Cash.

462
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,320
<i>Give it to me, and I'll handle the rest.</i>

463
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,160
And how do I know you won't scam me?

464
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,400
On payday,
bring all the evidence with you.

465
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,040
<i>Deal. I'll call you later.</i>

466
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,520
Are you really going to pay him?

467
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,120
We have no choice.

468
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,159
You have to take responsibility
for their suffering, Mrs. Sorn.

469
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,840
You…

470
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,120
Kita, why aren't you asleep?

471
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,520
Maybe he got bored of my stories.

472
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,639
Sounds like he wants you
to tell them instead.

473
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,680
The moral of this story is

474
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,960
if you don't stand up and fight,

475
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,320
you'll end up a victim.

476
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,400
If you hadn't shown up,

477
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,040
Kita wouldn't have gone
to sleep so easily.

478
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,040
If you're tired, you can sleep here.

479
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,680
I'd better not. I'm just Kita's caretaker.

480
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,840
I don't want him
to get too attached to me.

481
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,560
That'd just make things harder for you.

482
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,400
Why would it be hard for me?

483
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,880
Because everything has a price.

484
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,200
If Kita gets too attached,

485
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,560
I might start charging you

486
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,560
more than you can afford.

487
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,640
Why wouldn't I be able to afford it?

488
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,240
I'd do anything for my son.

489
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,640
Are you sure?

490
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,800
You might have to give me
everything you have in life.

491
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,680
Miss Ve.
What kind of person are you really?

492
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,320
Honestly, we don't have to
give him any money.

493
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,080
We don't even know if he's bluffing.

494
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,280
He might not have anything on us.
Why are we afraid of him?

495
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,680
I'm not afraid.

496
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,040
Even if he has evidence,
I can shut it down.

497
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,560
I just want to know who he is.

498
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,520
How dare he threaten me?

499
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,840
I'll send you the drop-off location.

500
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,240
I'm here. Where should I leave the money?

501
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,560
<i>Face the river.</i>

502
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,240
<i>There's a green crate on your right.</i>

503
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,040
<i>Put the money in there.</i>

504
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,920
And where's the evidence?

505
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,080
<i>Put the money in the crate,</i>
<i>and you'll see.</i>

506
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,640
Now that you've got the money,
you'd better keep your word.

507
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,520
I want to know who he is.

508
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,400
Ki?

509
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,440
<i>The houses that burned</i>

510
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,360
<i>each received</i>
<i>several hundred thousand baht.</i>

511
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,680
<i>You're making Mrs. Sorn suspicious of me.</i>

512
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,560
Move faster,
before you get kicked out of that house.

513
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,360
<i>I gave you Ms. Ging's doctor's contact.</i>
<i>Did you contact him?</i>

514
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,680
I'd like to speak to you personally.

515
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,480
<i>I suppose only Kita</i>

516
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,600
<i>gets to see the real you.</i>

517
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,200
<i>Because Kita and I are alike, maybe.</i>

518
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,760
We feel safe to be with one another.

519
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,560
<i>Then I must be like that too,</i>

520
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,840
<i>because I feel calmer</i>

521
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,880
<i>every time I'm close to you.</i>

522
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,880
