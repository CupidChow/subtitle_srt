1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
<i>Can you tell me</i>

2
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,760
<i>what really happened that day?</i>

3
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,400
I really don't know
what happened to your mom.

4
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,080
Wanvela is Hathai.

5
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,960
I want to make it right,
to give her everything back.

6
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,240
<i>Grandma's not sick.</i>

7
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,760
<i>She tried to hurt Teacher Ve.</i>

8
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,040
What are you doing?

9
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,200
<i>The same thing I did to your mother.</i>

10
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
- Hey, Mom!
- Help me!

11
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,520
That's her,

12
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,200
the woman who tried to kill Mrs. Sorn.

13
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,200
Take her away.

14
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,560
Sir.

15
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,640
Hey!

16
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,920
PREVIOUSLY

17
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,000
Hey!

18
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,200
Hey!

19
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,400
Where are you running to? Come here!

20
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,960
Ugh!

21
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,920
You can't escape me.

22
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,320
Ki,

23
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,160
don't tell me you're actually
worried about Wanvela.

24
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,440
You saw it yourself

25
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,880
what she did to Mom.

26
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,400
Dear,

27
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,240
she won't come back to hurt me, right?

28
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,440
Yes, Mom.
I already handed her to the police.

29
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,520
No need be afraid anymore.

30
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,800
Thank you for protecting me, son.

31
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,640
Please take your meds before you eat.

32
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,800
Why…

33
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Why are the police here again?

34
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,680
Well…

35
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,399
on the way to take Wanvela in,
something happened.

36
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
What happened?

37
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,080
There was a shootout
between an assailant and the officers

38
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,480
transporting your wife.

39
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,800
Both officers were killed,
and one assailant died as well.

40
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,840
What about my wife?

41
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,440
We found blood at the scene

42
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,840
leading down toward the river.

43
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,000
We believe it belongs to her.

44
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,240
The search teams

45
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,240
are sweeping the area.

46
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,400
She might have been shot
and fallen into the water.

47
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,880
How could you let this happen?!

48
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,560
The officers did everything they could.

49
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,600
It was just your wife's misfortune.

50
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,560
Hey, hey.

51
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,080
A thief wouldn't attack a cop

52
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,560
unless they had a reason.

53
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,280
- Sir, calm down.
- Ki.

54
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,800
What does Singha have to do with this?

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,320
Singha has helped
our family with everything.

56
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,320
How could you treat him like that?

57
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,960
Ve wanted to hurt me. She wanted me dead.

58
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,400
This is just karma catching up to her.

59
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,320
I already handed her to the police, Mom.

60
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,120
But then she ran into gunmen

61
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,920
and the cop couldn't find her?

62
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,920
From what we know,

63
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,720
the dead assailant

64
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,680
had a history
with one of the officers who died.

65
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,240
It might be revenge-related.

66
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,760
Either way,
we'll keep searching for your wife

67
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,560
to determine the truth.

68
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,160
That's all I came to report.

69
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,560
I'll keep following up on this.

70
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,400
Don't worry.

71
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,680
I'll take my leave now.

72
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,800
- Alright.
- Alright.

73
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,720
Don't worry, Miss Nun.

74
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,040
This doesn't concern you
or your mom anymore.

75
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,920
I never imagined

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,720
something like this could happen.

77
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,360
Someone lying in wait

78
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,800
shooting up a police car she was in…

79
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,760
But thank you so much, Mr. Singha,

80
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,760
for helping with everything.

81
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,640
I'll do anything for you

82
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,120
as long as you…

83
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,560
I'll see you off here.

84
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,560
So, she's dead, right?

85
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,560
My men handled it.

86
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,440
How is it?

87
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,040
<i>She's dead, boss.</i>

88
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,000
<i>I'll take care of the body myself.</i>

89
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,560
Finally,

90
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,720
this day has come.

91
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,560
My men won't fail this time.

92
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,880
And no one will ever suspect a thing.

93
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,480
The reason no one can find her

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
is because my men

95
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,840
already disposed of her body.

96
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,400
I'm relieved to hear that.

97
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,840
Thank you so much, Singha.

98
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,240
You know I want more than your thanks.

99
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,760
Of course, I know.

100
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,440
I haven't forgotten our agreement.

101
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,000
Whatever you want,

102
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,200
I'll make it happen.

103
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,920
In the recent police ambush,

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,640
two officers were killed,

105
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,800
and one assailant died as well.

106
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,800
The police suspect personal revenge.

107
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,440
The detainee inside the police car
went missing during the incident.

108
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,360
Only bloodstains, belongings, and a gun

109
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,560
<i>believed to belong to the perpetrator,</i>

110
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,440
<i>were found discarded near the river,</i>
<i>presumably left to destroy evidence.</i>

111
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,760
Dad.

112
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,720
Where's Teacher Ve?
Why isn't she coming back?

113
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,080
Teacher Ve…

114
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,360
When you said
we were going somewhere else,

115
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,320
is she coming with us?

116
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,120
She isn't coming with us, Kita.

117
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,799
And we can't force people

118
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,720
to stay with us forever.

119
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,520
You have to understand that.

120
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,080
Why are you both so gloomy?

121
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,160
The world isn't ending.
Nothing's collapsing.

122
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Let's focus on something
that'll make us smile.

123
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,200
Kita, look.

124
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,360
I bought something you like.

125
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,760
Want to open it?

126
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,960
Alright.

127
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,280
Here.

128
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,160
Do you like it?

129
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
Kita is still upset about Teacher Ve.

130
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,760
Don't mind him, Mint.

131
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,560
I don't mind at all.

132
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,280
Who knows what that woman

133
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,200
has been teaching him?

134
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,560
You're busy,

135
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,480
you wouldn't catch on to women like her.

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm not that stupid.

137
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,760
I didn't mean it that way, Ki.

138
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Okay. I have something urgent to do.

139
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,040
I'm needed elsewhere. Excuse me.

140
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,720
But I came to see you, Ki.

141
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,360
If you had told me beforehand,

142
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,520
I could've postponed my meeting.
But it's too late now.

143
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,880
Are you going out to find that fugitive?

144
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,640
If it's about that,

145
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,040
leave it to the police.

146
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,040
They won't let a criminal escape easily

147
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,280
unless they find them as a corpse.

148
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,800
Mint.

149
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,560
The person you're talking about

150
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,720
is my wife.

151
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,040
Are you still calling her your wife?

152
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,680
I really want to know what she had

153
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,440
that made you turn
against your whole family for her.

154
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,840
Ki.

155
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,160
What does she have that I don't?

156
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,160
If you chose me,

157
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,280
your mom and Nun
wouldn't have to suffer like this.

158
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,800
And about your position at the company,

159
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,640
my family and I are ready
to support you completely.

160
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,880
I really have an urgent matter.
I have to go now.

161
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,360
SAOWAKON MEDICAL CLINIC

162
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,680
CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

163
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
Are you hungry?

164
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,200
I'll go get you something to eat.

165
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,200
I'm not.

166
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,640
Are you still in pain?

167
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,280
You haven't even told me

168
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,640
why you're doing this.

169
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,080
You handed me over to the police,

170
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,720
but then you saved me
and brought me to hide here.

171
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,240
I never wanted you to go to prison.

172
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,920
And I know

173
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,800
you didn't hurt my mom.

174
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,000
What happened? Tell me.

175
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,560
Grandma isn't sick.

176
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,760
She tried to hurt you.

177
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,440
You knew?

178
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,760
At first, I didn't believe
my mom would go this far

179
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,920
just to push you out of my life.

180
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,880
It was my fault.

181
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,840
I never should've gone
into your mom's room,

182
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,200
even though I knew
what I'd be walking into.

183
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,200
I just wanted her to stop lying.

184
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,640
That's why
I had to send you to the police.

185
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,840
If I insisted on keeping you with me,

186
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,720
my mom would never stop.

187
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,320
But I never thought
someone would ambush and hurt you.

188
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,920
Mr. It.

189
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
<i>Yes?</i>

190
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,120
<i>Mr. Pete and I</i>
<i>are almost at the house now.</i>

191
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,880
Listen to me carefully.

192
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,640
Ms. Ve has been taken
to the station by the police.

193
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,600
<i>What?</i>

194
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,720
You can't escape me.

195
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,280
Hey!

196
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,240
Who ordered you to kill Ms. Ve?

197
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,120
He won't talk that easily.

198
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,440
Hey.

199
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,880
BOSS

200
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,400
Don't tell your boss

201
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,560
or I'll shoot you.

202
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,840
<i>How is it?</i>

203
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,480
She's dead, boss.

204
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,800
I'll take care of the body myself.

205
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,400
Ms. Ve!

206
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
- Ms. Ve.
- Let's get her to safety first.

207
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,320
I'll call Mr. Ki.

208
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,960
I found Ms. Ve.

209
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,000
The attackers were afraid
their boss would find out

210
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,280
about having taken care of you,

211
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,800
so they dumped your stuff in the river

212
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,120
to avoid suspicion.

213
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,840
That's why I brought you here,
to keep you safe.

214
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,160
No one can hurt you anymore.

215
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,320
I'll make sure you get everything back,

216
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,040
and then I'll take my mom away from here.

217
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,560
You're taking Mrs. Sorn away?

218
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,560
I'll return everything to you.

219
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,120
All I ask is one chance

220
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,320
to take Mom and Nun and start over.

221
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,640
No one has to lose anything anymore.

222
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,080
I know I'm asking too much,

223
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,480
but it's the best option for both of us.

224
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,640
You know why I came back.

225
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,480
I want those who did wrong
to face consequences,

226
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,880
not get away like you said.

227
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,520
But my mom

228
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,080
losing everything she had

229
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,200
is a punishment in itself.

230
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,800
That's why I chose to take my family

231
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,120
as far away from you as possible.

232
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,360
I promise…

233
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,880
you won't see me again.

234
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,000
Here you go, Mr. Pete.
Everything you ordered,

235
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,640
savory, sweet, and fruit, is all here.

236
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,360
By the way, who's the lucky girl
you're bringing these to?

237
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,080
Oh.

238
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,160
I'm not coming back in today.

239
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,880
If anything comes up, please call me.

240
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Ah…

241
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,120
Okay. Sure.

242
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,200
Thank you so much.

243
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,160
Oh.

244
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,600
Who's the girl you're giving it to?
Why didn't you answer her?

245
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,640
Who else?

246
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,320
It's for myself.

247
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,760
Your precious person went missing,

248
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,440
and it's been in the news for days,
still no sign of her.

249
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,720
You don't seem worried at all,

250
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,200
and you're ordering food like a feast.

251
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,080
You're heartless.

252
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,800
If you don't know anything,

253
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,520
don't talk to me like that.

254
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,240
So what do I not know?

255
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,120
Or you know where Wanvela went,

256
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,240
and that's why you're not even concerned?

257
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,360
How would I know?

258
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,960
Are you trying to pick a fight?

259
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,640
You were annoyed last time,

260
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,600
and now you're accusing me?

261
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,680
Don't tell me

262
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,000
you aren't interested in Ki anymore

263
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,840
and are switching over to me.

264
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,880
Don't flatter yourself.

265
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,640
You? Why would I stop liking Ki
for someone like you?

266
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,720
I'm still single, you know.

267
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,640
No wife either. You can pursue me.

268
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,080
It's not immoral.

269
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,600
You're delusional. Go. Just leave.

270
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,320
You think you're that hot?

271
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,320
Think someone like me
would actually like you?

272
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,320
Hey…

273
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,120
I'm here to get information about Wanvela,
but I let him go?

274
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
Who do I ask about her now?

275
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,960
Follow that car.

276
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,600
Could Ve be here?

277
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,440
You're at the clinic, aren't you?

278
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,000
Please take care of Ms. Ve.

279
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,960
The DNA test results are in.

280
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,680
Finally, peace in my life.

281
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,960
Let her be reborn far away or whatever.

282
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,080
Congratulations.

283
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,640
No one can come between our happiness now.

284
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,000
Now it's time for Nun.

285
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,080
I hope she gets married soon.

286
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,600
Well…

287
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,960
I think…

288
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,000
Looks like you're back to being fine now.

289
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,080
Oh.

290
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,520
I'm starting to remember things,
so I'm talking to Napat.

291
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,120
It might help my memory return faster.

292
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Right.

293
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,120
That's good.

294
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,160
I actually have something
to talk to you about.

295
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,240
Privately.

296
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,480
What is it?

297
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,000
It's about Nun's test results.

298
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,520
Hm?

299
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,280
What are you talking about?

300
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,600
The DNA test.

301
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,680
The DNA test for Nun…

302
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,000
…and Pat?!

303
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,360
I should've started
suspecting this a long time ago,

304
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,640
the relationship
between you and Uncle Pat.

305
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,640
It must've started
even before you came into this family.

306
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,280
Then what did you argue about?

307
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,760
Why did it get physical?

308
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,080
You're worried about your mom, right?

309
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,520
No one can hurt her, Nun.

310
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,720
I think we should stop here, Mom.

311
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,600
Ki, Ki. Son.

312
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,080
I'm sorry.
I'm truly sorry for hiding this.

313
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,720
But please…

314
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,360
don't tell your sister.

315
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,400
Don't hurt her, please.

316
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,160
Mom,

317
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,080
I never intended to hurt her.

318
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,120
But you shouldn't have lied

319
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,960
and used her as an excuse
to steal from others.

320
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,960
I didn't have a choice.
What else could I do?!

321
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,280
You know how awful your father was!

322
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,560
He ran off and left us
with a mountain of debt!

323
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,400
When Mr. Terd came into my life,

324
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,680
what did I do wrong by trying to survive?!

325
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,240
Everything I did was for us!

326
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,160
That's enough, Mom.

327
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,400
You don't have to do anything
for me or for Nun anymore.

328
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,240
I'll take care of everything from now on.

329
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,840
Just trust me.

330
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,800
And do what I ask.

331
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,760
What do you want me to do?

332
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,560
Leave everything.
Walk away from this place.

333
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,320
I've already prepared everything.

334
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,720
Are you crazy?

335
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,800
You want me to give up everything?

336
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,640
They're all dead now.

337
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,960
And you want me
to foolishly throw it all away?!

338
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,360
I won't.

339
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,160
Just do the right thing for once, Mom.

340
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,560
I believe Hathai is still alive.

341
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,200
There's proof she's still out there,

342
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,600
adopted by someone abroad.

343
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,320
I've got someone searching for her now.

344
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,800
You're looking for Hathai?

345
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,200
Nun and I

346
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,000
have nothing to do
with the Liangsuttha family.

347
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,400
We don't deserve
to get anything more than this.

348
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,800
Once Hathai is found,

349
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,880
we'll return everything to her.

350
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,560
And I won't ever talk

351
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,280
or ask about the past again.

352
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,240
We've been selfish enough.

353
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,240
Just this once,

354
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,360
can you make me feel like

355
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,120
our family has finally made up

356
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
for all the wrong we've done?

357
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,960
Just once.

358
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,160
Ki…

359
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
I'm sorry…

360
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,680
I'll do everything you said.

361
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,760
I'll walk away from everything.

362
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,000
I was wrong, Ki…

363
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,000
I was wrong.

364
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,920
But you have to think of your sister.

365
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,360
She doesn't need to come with us.

366
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,840
You know

367
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,520
she has someone who'll take care of her.

368
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,760
Can we go just the two of us?

369
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,240
And when you find Hathai,

370
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,000
you can give everything back to her.

371
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,440
Just give me a little time, Ki.

372
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,320
Just a little time.

373
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,600
I swear I'll leave.

374
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,080
Alright, Mom.

375
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,400
My men won't fail this time.

376
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,680
The reason no one can find her

377
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,600
is because my men

378
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,400
already disposed of her body.

379
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,520
I'm relieved to hear that.

380
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,120
Thank you so much, Singha.

381
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,640
Why would you go this far, Mom?

382
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,440
You're late.

383
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,480
Busy with work?

384
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,040
Your father said you've been busy lately.

385
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,480
Too busy to meet up?

386
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Yes.

387
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,360
Alright then.
If it's because of work, I'm not mad.

388
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,720
Nun.

389
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,400
Why are you here?

390
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,360
Have you been drinking?

391
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,720
No.

392
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,080
You still haven't stopped seeing her?

393
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,200
Go take care of your girl. I'm leaving.

394
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,320
Sorry, Ivy.
I need to be with my girlfriend.

395
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,880
Girlfriend?

396
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,920
Then what am I to you?!

397
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,840
Puth, why are you doing this?

398
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,880
Your dad's going to be furious.

399
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,360
Go tell her right now

400
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,200
that there's nothing between us.

401
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,240
I don't care, Nun.

402
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,480
Because I love you.

403
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,120
What if your parents
find out about tonight?

404
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,400
That'd be good.

405
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,040
Then I'll tell them we're getting married.

406
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Married?

407
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,960
Or you don't want to marry me?

408
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,640
I forgot.

409
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,360
Last time you didn't want to marry me.

410
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,160
I was a fool back then.

411
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
What about this time?

412
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,360
I won't be a fool twice.

413
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,840
It's Mom.

414
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,280
Hello?

415
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,120
Yes, I'll head back right away.

416
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,040
Nun.

417
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,240
Where were you all night?

418
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,560
I'm a grown-up now, Mom.

419
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,800
If I don't come home for a night,
I think it's fine.

420
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,720
Besides, I've got something to tell you.

421
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,440
So do I.

422
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,960
I'll go first.

423
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,280
I'll marry--

424
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,440
<i>Whatever you've done,</i>
<i>be ready to face the consequences.</i>

425
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,320
Whose voice is that?

426
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,080
<i>I'm fine now.</i>

427
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,280
<i>But Mom told me</i>

428
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,480
to pretend I was still unwell.

429
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,040
You and Mom might be in trouble in case

430
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,000
that clip leaks again.

431
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,080
<i>If we don’t, Nun will go to prison.</i>

432
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,720
That talk at the hospital.

433
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
How did you get it?

434
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,600
How did you get it, Mom?

435
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,760
Miss Nun doesn’t look like
she’s getting better.

436
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,200
No wonder
Mrs. Sorn wouldn’t let anyone in.

437
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,080
Is it the same person

438
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,360
who sent the clip to Puth?

439
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,360
Nun,

440
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,640
are you okay?

441
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,120
If the audio clip

442
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,720
and the dashcam footage get leaked,

443
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,920
what am I going to do, Mom?

444
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,880
Nun.

445
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,240
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay. Whoever it is,

446
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,760
I'll find a way to protect you.

447
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,920
Alright?

448
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,520
There's only one person who can save you.

449
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Huh?

450
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,160
You have to marry Singha.

451
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,400
Mr. Sajja and Singha will help you, okay?

452
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,320
Marry…

453
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,520
Singha?

454
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,960
Of course.

455
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,520
Who else would you marry?

456
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,760
Wiputh?

457
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,680
Think about it.

458
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,800
If that damn clip gets leaked,
you really think Wiputh could save you?

459
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,600
He might even get dragged down with me.

460
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,440
Mom. Nun.

461
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,720
Is something wrong?

462
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,440
Nothing, dear.

463
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,320
We're just talking about the wedding.

464
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,880
She's agreed to get married.

465
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,200
Yes.

466
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,080
I'm going to marry Singha
as soon as possible.

467
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,960
Are you sure

468
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,480
you really want to marry Singha?

469
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,000
Yes. Didn't you see

470
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,240
how much he's done for me?

471
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,360
And how much he loves me?

472
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,440
I haven't forgotten my promise to you.

473
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,040
I'll get the wedding arranged
for Nun as soon as possible.

474
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,840
Ki's been busy with Nun's wedding lately,

475
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,560
so he asked me to look after you instead.

476
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,320
Miss Nun's getting married?

477
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,400
Yes.

478
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,200
To Singha.

479
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,240
- Prae?
- How did you get here?

480
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,520
I've been tailing you for days,
until I was sure

481
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,960
that Ve was here,

482
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,560
so I followed you in today.

483
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,200
Prae,

484
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,280
I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was here.

485
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,920
It's okay.

486
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
It was for your safety.

487
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,640
Mr. Ki and Mr. Pete did the right thing.

488
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,920
Why did Nun
suddenly decide to get married?

489
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,440
I've been wondering the same thing.

490
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,480
Ki said

491
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,600
she's the one
who insisted on marrying Singha.

492
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,760
She must be

493
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,920
afraid of something.

494
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,000
That's probably why she's rushing it.

495
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,960
What's that?

496
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,000
An audio clip of Nunnalin
confessing about the hit-and-run.

497
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,159
I'm leaving it with you for now.

498
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,400
I'll release it when the time is right.

499
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,719
<i>That woman</i>

500
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,760
is capable of anything.

501
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,560
She's no different from a demon.

502
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,000
You have to become one too.

503
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,400
Only then can you win.

504
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,880
<i>You can't become a demon, Ve</i>

505
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,320
<i>I'll become one for you.</i>

506
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,120
Put the ring on Nun's finger, son.

507
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,639
Yes, Dad.

508
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,120
I wish you all the happiness
in your marriage, Nun, my girl.

509
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,360
Please take care of Nun.

510
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,160
Don't worry.

511
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,040
My son

512
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,560
will take good care of her.

513
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,200
You can go on vacation abroad as planned.

514
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,640
Don't worry about anything.

515
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,680
Anyway, how long will you be gone?

516
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,160
I'm not sure yet.

517
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,240
Ki is handling everything.

518
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,880
I'll just let him handle it.

519
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,800
Even if he tells me never to return,

520
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,600
then I won't.

521
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,080
Wow,

522
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,840
you really

523
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,640
love your children.

524
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,640
Of course.

525
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,360
We're parents.

526
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,200
No matter how many wrong
or terrible things we've done,

527
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,360
we did it all for them, right?

528
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,520
Yes.

529
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,120
Are you really leaving, Mrs. Sorn?

530
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,960
That girl is already dead.

531
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,480
There's no one left to get in our way.

532
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,200
Why give up the chairperson position

533
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,160
and go live somewhere else?

534
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,480
I have to go.

535
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,600
I don't want
any more conflict with my son.

536
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,000
Besides, now that Nun
has married Singha, I can rest easy.

537
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,080
No matter what happens,
Singha will protect her.

538
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,000
You just stay quiet.

539
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,560
What about the company,

540
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,560
the house,
and all of Liangsuttha's assets?

541
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,880
My daughter should get a share too.

542
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,240
Stop.

543
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,440
Don't ever say that again.

544
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,320
After everything that's happened,

545
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,720
I want to be a father too.

546
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,720
Even at my own daughter's wedding,

547
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,920
I was just here as an employee.

548
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,040
You really want to destroy
my life that badly

549
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,880
with what you just said?

550
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,160
Remember.

551
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,760
Never say you have anything
to do with Nun again.

552
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,640
I'll be staying in England for a while.

553
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,840
Once Ki finds out that Hathai,
the girl he's searching for, is dead,

554
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,640
he'll stop trying to make amends.

555
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,600
Why did you lie to me, Nun?

556
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,560
In the end, you chose him.

557
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,040
Come here!

558
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,640
Hey.

559
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,480
Hey, what are you doing? No filming.

560
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,240
Stop recording. Stop.

561
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,560
This is your final warning.

562
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,760
Stay away from Miss Nun.

563
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,440
Because she…

564
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,920
is my wife now.

565
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,400
Bear that in mind.

566
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,840
Yeah, good.

567
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,400
Boss,

568
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,000
we found her.

569
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,320
Then go get her.

570
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,720
Why that face, dear?

571
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,160
I'll be missing you so much, Mom.

572
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,680
If you do,

573
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,120
why don't you
and your husband come visit me?

574
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,480
I'm ready.

575
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,960
And so am I.

576
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,680
I just have to wrap up
some documents at the company.

577
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,240
I'll meet you at the airport.

578
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,280
Are you sure

579
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,520
that you're really going to find Hathai?

580
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,360
Is it worth doing all this?

581
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,640
Come on,

582
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,800
he's made his decision.

583
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,360
Just go take care of everything
and meet me at the airport.

584
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,640
I'll be waiting.

585
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,960
Alright.

586
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,360
Hello, Singha?
I'm on the way to the airport.

587
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,200
Ve's not dead yet.

588
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,520
Huh?

589
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,320
<i>You knew Ve was still alive</i>

590
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,000
and you never told me.

591
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,360
And how do you even know

592
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,560
she's still alive?

593
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,960
<i>My men followed your order.</i>

594
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,200
<i>If Mr. Ki really helped Ve,</i>

595
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,760
<i>soon enough,</i>

596
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,800
<i>- you'll find out where she is.</i>
- Teacher.

597
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,880
NEXT EPISODE

598
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,680
- Hey.
- Ugh.

599
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,640
<i>Mom, I know where she is now.</i>

600
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,000
<i>We finally found her.</i>

601
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,520
<i>Let's see where else she can run now.</i>

602
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,080
