1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,320
<i>So did Miss Nun really run someone over?</i>

2
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,040
Can you confirm

3
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,240
that truth for me?

4
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,160
<i>What they've covered up</i>

5
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,840
<i>will haunt them until they get</i>
<i>the punishment they deserve.</i>

6
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,440
<i>Is this…? I never imagined</i>

7
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,960
<i>your family could lie</i>

8
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,720
<i>and cover up your crimes like this.</i>

9
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,280
<i>I even kneeled in front of the media</i>
<i>to win public sympathy.</i>

10
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,960
<i>If the clip goes online,</i>

11
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,920
<i>people will think it's fake,</i>
<i>an attempt to smear us. Do you understand?</i>

12
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,680
"Poor mother.
She’s suffering along with her daughter."

13
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,640
"At least she’s done good for society.
She has a foundation too."

14
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,880
"I feel bad.
I wonder what they’re accused of now."

15
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,120
Huh?

16
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,280
Looks like everyone is pitying
that Kanisorn woman now.

17
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,720
I guess a mother’s love is real.

18
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,280
She’d go this far for her child.

19
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,240
So you feel sorry for them now?

20
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,240
Enough to visit Nunnalin in the hospital?

21
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,120
I should go and check on…

22
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,800
my sister, right?

23
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,800
I get it.

24
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,840
But let me remind you.

25
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,360
Don’t forget how ruthless
Mrs. Kanisorn really is.

26
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,720
You may see her
looking fragile and pitiful now,

27
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,080
but she might be planning
something behind it all.

28
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,800
Prae was right.

29
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,680
I was a fool for being optimistic.
I won’t be fooled again.

30
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,240
<i>Please.</i>

31
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,000
<i>Stop hurting my daughter.</i>

32
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,640
<i>Don't let it get to the point</i>
<i>where someone's life is lost.</i>

33
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,720
I never thought
you’d resort to this, Mrs. Sorn.

34
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,400
If sympathy were a product,

35
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,400
it would be an all-time best-seller.

36
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,560
The people who used to condemn me
are expressing compassion. Didn’t you see?

37
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,160
I’ve investigated everywhere.

38
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,600
So far,
no clips of Miss Nun have been leaked.

39
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,120
Right now,
sympathy for me and Nun is surging.

40
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,880
They won’t dare release it.

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,440
And what about the other thing
I asked you to dig into?

42
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,120
I checked with Mrs. Manee,

43
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,600
but she doesn’t seem
to know anything about it.

44
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,280
She’s probably not involved.

45
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,440
Then what about our business rivals?

46
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,000
Anyone suspicious?
Have you checked them all?

47
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,200
Yes, I’ve checked everyone.
No links to this mess at all.

48
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,680
But don’t worry. I’ll find out

49
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,640
who has the clip.

50
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,840
Good.

51
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,240
I’m heading to the hospital
to check on Nun.

52
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,760
Teacher, please wait here.

53
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,440
I’ll ask the nurse
how much longer the doctor will take.

54
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,200
Excuse me, nurse.

55
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,520
Can I ask what time the doctor is coming?

56
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,520
Hathai.

57
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,800
Hathai.

58
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,640
- Be strong, just like your mother.
- Yes.

59
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,280
You knew my mother?

60
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,320
Of course I did.

61
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,800
Mrs. Kitinee was a huge help to me.

62
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,240
I only got this job here thanks to her.

63
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,800
But when it happened,

64
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,200
why didn’t you
let anyone contact your father?

65
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,800
Before my mom died, she told me
not to tell anyone where we were going.

66
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,760
Because someone wanted to kill her and me.

67
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,120
She died protecting me.

68
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,320
It’s going to be okay, Hathai.

69
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,200
Even if your mom isn’t here anymore,

70
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,560
I’ll protect you now.

71
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,760
Hathai?

72
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,800
Where did she go?

73
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,360
RECEPTION

74
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,120
Mr. Ki.

75
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,680
Miss Ve.

76
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,960
I came to visit Nun today.

77
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,000
I came yesterday, but Mrs. Sorn wouldn’t
let me in. So I thought I’d try again.

78
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,160
I’m here to see her too. The doctor said

79
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,240
she’s stable now, but not improving.

80
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,640
Hathai?

81
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,280
I just heard someone say "Hathai."

82
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,240
There’s no one there.

83
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,520
I heard it too,
but couldn’t make out who it was.

84
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,440
Mr. Ki,

85
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,760
let’s go see Miss Nun.

86
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,640
Sure. Let me help.

87
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,600
Thank you.

88
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,760
Okay.

89
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,400
- Um…
- Who are you?

90
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,840
It’s me, Prae. Don’t you remember?

91
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,160
The smallest one in the house.

92
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,360
Prae?

93
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,680
Ah, Prae!

94
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,880
Yes.

95
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,200
I was about to go see Hathai.
I just saw her over there.

96
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,320
Teacher,
you can’t go see Hathai right now.

97
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,120
Why not?

98
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,240
Why can’t I see Hathai?

99
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,680
Oh, you have to see
the doctor first, right?

100
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,400
I’ll take you back to Im
and we’ll go together, okay?

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,960
Okay. Let’s go.

102
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,440
There you are.

103
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,720
I told you not to wander off.

104
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,040
Prae, what are you doing here?

105
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,440
You know the teacher isn’t well.
How could you let her walk around alone?

106
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,400
Yeah, yeah. I know. Let’s go.
The doctor’s waiting.

107
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,800
You talk too much. Let’s go.

108
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,440
Miss Nun doesn’t look like
she’s getting better.

109
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,960
No wonder
Mrs. Sorn wouldn’t let anyone in.

110
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,000
Still, people keep sending gifts,

111
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
even though they don’t know what happened.

112
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,320
Mom said
Nun is extremely weak, barely sleeping.

113
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,840
So she’s not ready to talk to anyone.

114
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,760
And that clip has vanished.

115
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,520
Ever since Mr. Sorn made that emotional
public statement, everyone sympathizes.

116
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,560
She clearly loves her daughter dearly.

117
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,720
I think I’ll let Miss Nun rest.

118
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,120
If she wakes up,
please send her my regards.

119
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,560
I hope she recovers soon.

120
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,440
Nun?

121
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,280
I thought you weren’t doing well.

122
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,600
I’m fine now.

123
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,680
But mom told me
to pretend I was still unwell.

124
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,400
You and Mom might be in trouble in case

125
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,400
that clip leaks again.

126
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,080
Nun.

127
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,800
So you lied to me about her condition?

128
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,640
It's good that you know now.

129
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,560
How could you, Mom?

130
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,400
Nun nearly died,
and you still make her lie like this?

131
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,520
If we don’t, Nun will go to prison.

132
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,640
The company will be destroyed.

133
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,200
You and I will be forced
to take responsibility by resigning.

134
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,120
If Nun really did something wrong,

135
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,040
- then I’ll take responsibility with her.
- Take responsibility for what?

136
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,200
Can’t you see
that someone’s trying to destroy us?

137
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,680
Everything was going well

138
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,680
until that clip resurfaced,
and Wiputh broke off the engagement.

139
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,720
I had to kneel in front of the press.

140
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,280
Everything I’ve done was to protect us,

141
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,880
so we can all survive this.

142
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,680
Instead of blaming

143
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,320
me or your sister,

144
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,120
why not help find out
who’s behind all this?

145
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,080
Who would want to bring us down like this?

146
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,600
I honestly can’t think of anyone

147
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,840
who’d want to hurt our family this badly.

148
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,800
I’m sure there's someone.

149
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,320
And whoever it is,

150
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,120
they’re very close to us.

151
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,400
Here, take your medicine.

152
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,520
But I haven’t eaten anything yet, Im.

153
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,040
You did eat. Here.

154
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,720
Look, your plate is right here.
Eat your meds.

155
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,720
Doctor’s orders.

156
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,720
But I don’t remember eating.

157
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,800
You did. Look, your plate is still here.

158
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,440
The doctor said
her Alzheimer’s is now in stage two.

159
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,280
I didn’t eat.

160
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,720
Why did she say I did?

161
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,000
Teacher.

162
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,320
Hathai.

163
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,480
It's you, Hathai.

164
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,080
No, Wanvela. I should call you Ve now.

165
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,080
Teacher.

166
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,880
I missed you.

167
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,840
You never visit me anymore.
Only Prae does.

168
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,720
I miss you so much, Ve.

169
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,360
I’m sorry, Teacher.

170
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,440
I’ve had important things to take care of.
So I didn't have time to come.

171
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,480
But Ve’s free today.

172
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,280
And so am I. So I brought Ve
to visit you. Did I do a good job?

173
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,920
You’re wonderful.

174
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,280
Thank you for still thinking of me.

175
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,560
Of course.

176
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,080
Are you doing okay, Teacher?

177
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,000
Hathai! Prae! There you are! Hurry!

178
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,880
Smoke! Fire!

179
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,880
Hathai, Prae, go!

180
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,720
- Run! Run!
- Teacher.

181
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,160
- Run!
- The neighbor's just burning leaves.

182
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,840
Look, it’s not a fire.

183
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,160
- It’s okay.
- It’s not?

184
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,040
No, Teacher.

185
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,640
This is how her condition is.

186
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,200
Sometimes she can’t remember anything.
But sometimes she remembers everything.

187
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,280
And sometimes, when she sees things,

188
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,000
she thinks it’s back when we were kids.

189
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,760
She's still traumatized
by the fire at the house we lived in.

190
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,920
But it wasn’t just a fire.

191
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,720
Someone died that night too.

192
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,280
Prae, what are you doing here?

193
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,200
Keeping you company. Didn’t that witch
kick you out of the room?

194
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,040
Yeah. She said
she wanted the room to herself.

195
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,360
She even said if I told Teacher,
she’d beat me up.

196
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,280
Nasty girl.

197
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,120
Come on, sleep.
Tomorrow I’ll tell Teacher Rawee for you.

198
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,480
Come, I'll help.

199
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,800
- Where’s all this smoke coming from?
- How could there be a fire?

200
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,680
Hathai! Prae! There you are!

201
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,960
Hurry! Let's go.

202
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,440
Hurry.

203
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,200
So the fire started in Hathai’s bedroom?

204
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,080
<i>Yes. Please come identify</i>
<i>the child who died.</i>

205
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,440
Yes.

206
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,680
The witch… Yada is dead?

207
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,160
Im said that, on the day of the fire,

208
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,480
she saw a strange man
running out with the others.

209
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,880
That fire in your bedroom
wasn’t an accident.

210
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,760
Are you saying Yada died in my place?

211
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,040
The culprit must have known
you were living with me.

212
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,280
If they find out you're alive,
they’ll come after you again.

213
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,280
What should I do, Teacher?

214
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,560
Listen, Hathai. For your safety,

215
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,480
from now on, the child named Hathai
is dead, killed in the fire.

216
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,720
I’ll find a new, safe place for you.

217
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,280
They won’t be able to hurt you anymore.

218
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,200
I promise.

219
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,320
The other kids were all sent elsewhere.

220
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,960
We were scattered everywhere.
I think besides the fire,

221
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,240
no one else knows
what really happened that night.

222
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,120
It’s just you and me who know.

223
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,160
Without Teacher Rawee, I wouldn't be
in New Zealand with my adoptive parents.

224
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,200
Who could've known that when I came back
she would be sick like this.

225
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
I have to work too.

226
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,160
All I can do is
drop by to see her when I can.

227
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,800
I feel like I haven’t
taken care of her very well.

228
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:19,320
At least Im came to work for her
before she knew she was sick.

229
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,520
We still have Im to help look after her.

230
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,960
- Give it to Im just in case.
- No need.

231
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,200
You just gave me money last time.

232
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,240
Honestly, Im's looking after Teacher now

233
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,720
because she probably
couldn’t find a job anywhere else.

234
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,360
I’m afraid if you keep
giving her so much money,

235
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,360
she’ll just give it to herself instead.

236
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,120
Whatever. As long as
Im takes good care of Teacher,

237
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,760
it’s okay.

238
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,720
Fine.

239
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,440
I think Kita
should try some outdoor activities.

240
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,160
I asked him.
He seems interested in learning tennis.

241
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,440
So I found a school
with a coach and a kids’ court.

242
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,120
Do you object?

243
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,600
Mr. Ki?

244
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,560
Uh, yes?

245
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,000
Any concerns about Kita's tennis lessons?

246
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,160
If you think it’s good,
I see no problems with that.

247
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
But I do.

248
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,800
I don't want any more news about us.

249
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,840
Mom.

250
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,320
Kita’s just going to tennis lessons.

251
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,000
And if Kita goes out

252
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,000
and causes trouble again,
what will you do?

253
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,760
I’ve taken Kita out many times, Mom.

254
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,920
Nothing’s ever happened.

255
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,240
I believe Kita is ready
to meet other kids his age now.

256
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,480
I understand your concern, Mrs. Sorn.

257
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,120
But I believe whatever happens,
you can handle it.

258
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,840
You even got through the misunderstanding

259
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,840
about Miss Nun.

260
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,600
So you want Kita to go out
and have problems, don't you?

261
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,200
Mom.

262
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,120
Kita going outside for activities

263
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
was my idea from the start.

264
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,080
Miss Ve just found the place.

265
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,440
Whatever. I don’t agree
with Kita learning outside.

266
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,160
You've asked me for so many things,
and I’ve done them all.

267
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,480
But for Kita,
please let me make decisions myself.

268
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,600
It's all I'm asking.

269
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,200
Mr. Ki's never agreed with anything you do

270
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,520
even though

271
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,880
you mean well for everyone.
That's why he said that to you.

272
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,480
It’s because of that woman.

273
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,840
Teacher Ve?

274
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,040
Exactly.

275
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,800
She’s been whispering to him constantly.
That's why Ki's taking her side.

276
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,480
Now both Ki and Kita are bewitched by her.

277
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,800
Looks like
kicking Teacher Ve out won't be easy now.

278
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,440
Mr. Ki's protecting her.

279
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,480
No matter what,
I must get her out of this house.

280
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,120
How will you do it?

281
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,560
If I can't kick her out,

282
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,280
then I'll let Ki do it.

283
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,320
Make Mr. Ki fire her?

284
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,160
- Each box…
- Fill in each box.

285
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,680
Here.

286
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,440
Who would want to bring us down like this?

287
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,880
I honestly can’t think of anyone

288
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,760
who’d want to hurt our family this badly.

289
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,200
I’m sure there's someone.

290
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,680
And whoever it is,

291
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,960
they’re very close to us.

292
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,520
I understand your concern, Mrs. Sorn.

293
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,320
But I believe whatever happens,
you can handle it.

294
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,680
You even got through the misunderstanding

295
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,920
about Miss Nun.

296
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,480
I got the document. I’ll bring it to you.

297
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Keep following up for me.

298
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,400
Okay. We’ll meet later.

299
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,160
Mr. Ki.

300
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,640
You left Kita during his lesson

301
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,400
to talk on the phone.

302
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,600
Isn’t that neglecting your work?

303
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,080
But you shouldn’t be
eavesdropping on my calls.

304
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,280
I got in trouble with my mom

305
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,000
hiring you to take care of Kita.
But you accuse me of listening in,

306
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,160
when you’re the one
who abandoned him for a personal call.

307
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,240
I’m sorry.

308
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,920
It was an important call.

309
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,280
I think I didn't take long.

310
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,440
That’s an excuse that doesn’t hold up.

311
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,600
So what do you want me to do? Tell me.

312
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,040
Don’t let this happen again.
If you leave Kita again,

313
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,120
I may be the one to fire you myself.

314
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,240
Even if he protests,

315
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,080
I won’t indulge him.

316
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,200
Yes. It won’t happen again.

317
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,600
Then,

318
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,080
what was so important that
you left him to take that call? Tell me.

319
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,880
It’s personal.

320
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,040
If you’re upset I left him,

321
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,880
I’d better go back now.

322
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,920
Excuse me.

323
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,560
Come on.

324
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,560
Will I get to learn tennis today?

325
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,760
Yes.

326
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,160
Remember what I told you?

327
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,760
If something upsets or angers you…

328
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,440
Count from one to ten.

329
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,600
Good job.

330
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,760
Today's your first day. It doesn’t matter
if you’re good at it or not.

331
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,920
Just enjoy it.

332
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,920
Yes.

333
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,520
Let’s go.

334
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,440
Is something wrong, Mrs. Sorn?

335
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,880
I just wanted to make sure

336
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,320
Kita’s really ready to face
the outside world like you say.

337
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,400
Kita, Grandma's here
because she’s worried.

338
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,120
I’ll do my best, Grandma.

339
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,120
I won’t make you worry.

340
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,520
You taught him that line?

341
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,560
I said it myself.

342
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,600
You speak better now.

343
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,680
Fine.

344
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,480
Look after my grandson when he's outside.

345
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,480
Don’t let anything happen to him.

346
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,480
Don’t worry. I’ll take good care of Kita.

347
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,440
- Let’s go.
- Yes.

348
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,360
Goodbye.

349
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,480
- Please take care of him.
- Yes.

350
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,000
Don’t worry. We’ll have fun today.

351
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
I’ll come pick you up after.

352
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,120
Go.

353
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,200
I dropped Kita off. I’m on my way.

354
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,400
Where’s my document?

355
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,040
Here. It's important. Don’t lose it.

356
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,240
Right.

357
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,520
I’ll handle it.

358
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,160
Mr. Ki.

359
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,440
- You know Teacher Ve?
- Uh…

360
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,800
I recognize you.

361
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,880
You’ve been at my company
many times reporting.

362
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,160
I…

363
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,600
Prae’s my friend.

364
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,360
You have a reporter friend. So,

365
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,400
this must be another story
for her to leak, like before.

366
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,440
You’re accusing me.

367
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,440
Then let me see

368
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,240
if this is about my family or my company.

369
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,520
Rawee Saengsoong?

370
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,600
It’s not what you think, is it?

371
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
You seem more suspicious
of me than your mother.

372
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,200
This is going too far.

373
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,320
Ve just brought me
Teacher Rawee’s document so I could help

374
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,160
transfer her to another hospital.

375
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,480
When we were kids, Prae and I
were helped by the same foundation.

376
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,200
Teacher Rawee worked there,

377
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,560
so she’s like a benefactor to me.

378
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,720
I just want to get her
the best treatment I can.

379
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,240
So I asked Prae to help.

380
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,080
We only talked about Teacher Rawee.

381
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,240
Ve doesn’t know anything about my work.

382
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,640
Sorry for misunderstanding.

383
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,600
Never mind. It's probably
because I was acting suspicious.

384
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,760
Then I’ll go handle
the hospital paperwork now.

385
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,320
I'm heading out, Ve.
I’ll call you when I’m done.

386
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,800
Okay?

387
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,680
I have to apologize too

388
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,960
for using the time I should be watching
Kita to handle personal things again.

389
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,840
But Teacher Rawee is like a mother to me.
I have to do everything for her.

390
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,320
I understand. And besides,
Kita’s at his tennis lesson now.

391
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,280
You don’t have to watch him all the time.

392
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,440
Thank you for understanding me.

393
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,720
Everyone has their own obligations.

394
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,040
I’m not heartless enough
not to see someone else’s problems.

395
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,320
I’ll hurry back to take care of Kita.

396
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
No need.

397
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,960
I’ll pick Kita up myself.

398
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,000
You go handle Teacher Rawee’s matter.
See you at home.

399
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,800
Okay.

400
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,960
Finally.

401
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,840
I thought we were in trouble.

402
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,600
Did Mr. Ki suspect anything?

403
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,800
- Probably not.
- Good thing we met at this café,

404
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,240
and Mr. Ki walked in while we were
still talking about Teacher Rawee.

405
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,560
So what about Lookwa?

406
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,240
Ever since
she took the blame for Miss Nunnalin

407
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,160
and posted bail, she’s vanished.

408
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,560
Reporters can’t reach her
for an interview.

409
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,960
I even went to her house,
but couldn’t find her.

410
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,240
Mrs. Kanisorn must be keeping her hidden.

411
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,480
Prae, please keep digging.

412
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,000
I’m not going to let this case end
with the guilty walking free.

413
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,240
How's that possible?
Someone already picked Kita up?

414
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,200
I told Teacher Ve to call the school
and say I was coming to pick him up.

415
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,760
Uh, I didn’t know. The person
who came said he was the father too.

416
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,520
It’s done, sir.
What do you want me to do next?

417
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,720
Yes, sir.

418
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,280
Kita’s missing?

419
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,640
What about the CCTV?

420
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,680
The school’s cameras are broken.

421
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,240
The staff are looking, but can’t find him.

422
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,880
I’ll try to contact Kita.

423
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,640
How?

424
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,080
I gave him a GPS watch.

425
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,760
Kita, do you remember
how to answer when I call?

426
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,920
- Yes. Press here.
- Good.

427
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,960
While you’re at your lesson,
don’t take it off, okay?

428
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,800
- Okay.
- Let's go.

429
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,880
- He’s not answering.
- Maybe he doesn’t know how to pick up?

430
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,480
I taught him everything.

431
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,000
He’s a smart kid, he can do it.

432
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,280
But his location hasn’t moved at all.

433
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,240
Could something have happened?

434
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,400
Dad. Teacher Ve.

435
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,040
Dad. Teacher Ve. Help me.

436
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,160
Dad. Teacher Ve.

437
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,040
Teacher Ve.

438
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,320
Kita.

439
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,480
Kita. He picked up.

440
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,760
Kita.

441
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,880
<i>- Kita, can you hear me?</i>
- I can.

442
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,680
Do you know where you are?
Who are you with?

443
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,680
I'm in a van alone.
There’s nobody. I’m scared.

444
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,680
Don’t be scared. Dad and I are coming.

445
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,560
Do you remember the story I read you
last night? The one about courage.

446
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,040
Yes.

447
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,360
The prince searches
for the Fruit of Courage.

448
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,800
Then think of that story now.

449
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,600
Look at the door and see if it opens.

450
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,720
How is it, Kita? Can you open it?

451
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,400
<i>I can.</i>

452
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,440
Good boy.

453
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
Kita, listen to me.

454
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,400
Someone’s coming.

455
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,520
Kita. Kita.

456
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,880
Hey. How’d the door get open?

457
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,200
What?

458
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,880
What?

459
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,080
Where’d the kid go?

460
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,040
Sir. I’ve lost the kid.

461
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,160
I saw him sleeping,
so I just went to the bathroom.

462
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,680
When I came back, he was gone.

463
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,240
I found him, sir!

464
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,200
Where are you going, kid? Come here!

465
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,920
I told you to stay in the car!

466
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,040
Do you want to die?!

467
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,920
- Kita.
- Let him go!

468
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,199
- Ow! Damn it!
- Kita.

469
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,320
- Kita.
- You little…

470
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,880
- Why did you take my son? Who sent you?!
- Let go!

471
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,800
Hey!

472
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,480
Kita. Kita.

473
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,960
Are you okay?

474
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,040
Miss Ve! Miss Ve!

475
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,199
Kita, come with me.

476
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,320
Miss Ve!

477
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,360
Sir.

478
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,679
- Let’s go now.
- What the hell? Get in.

479
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,639
Go.

480
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Napat?

481
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,760
Miss Ve.

482
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,120
Why did you follow them? It’s dangerous.

483
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,280
I’m fine. But the culprits got away.

484
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,000
I saw someone pick him up.

485
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,640
Kita.

486
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,720
You did great.
You don’t have to be scared anymore.

487
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,160
Dad’s here. Teacher Ve’s here too.

488
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,800
It’s okay now.

489
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,600
Yes.

490
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,200
Come on. We’d better leave.
I’ll file a report.

491
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,000
I think we shouldn’t.

492
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,320
Let’s go home first.
I have something to tell you.

493
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,680
I’ve put Kita to bed.

494
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,520
Now that he’s back home
in his safe room, he’s calmer.

495
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,360
You said you’d tell me something
when we got back.

496
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,360
What happened?

497
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,360
If you know who took Kita,

498
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,520
tell me.

499
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,360
When I ran to get help for you,

500
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,920
I saw the culprit
get into Mr. Napat's car.

501
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,560
You bastard!

502
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,160
Mr. Ki!

503
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,160
Why did you hurt Kita?

504
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,520
What are you talking about?!

505
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,560
- No!
- What?

506
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,240
- I don't know anything.
- You don't know?

507
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,320
- Mr. Ki.
- You don't know?

508
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
You don't know?

509
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,600
- Mr. Ki. Mr. Ki!
- Hey!

510
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,160
If anything had happened to Kita…

511
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,080
Stop right now!

512
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,160
- Stop!
- Mr. Ki.

513
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,080
What is this?

514
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,640
I don’t know anything.
Why would I do that?

515
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,640
I saw you drive the culprit away.

516
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,480
You’re telling me you didn’t know?

517
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,920
I want to know why Uncle Pat did this.

518
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,280
Besides your words,

519
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,040
what proof do you have that you saw him?

520
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,120
If there's no proof,
why should we believe her?

521
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,400
If she wants to frame someone,

522
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,200
she can just say she saw this
or that person. You’d believe her?

523
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,440
If she said your mother was a thief,
you’d believe that too?

524
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,160
Blaming others
to cover your own crime, aren't you?

525
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,520
You want me to kidnap Kita?

526
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,680
I had people check the place.

527
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,000
Just pay them
and have someone help make it easy.

528
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,040
Make Kita disappear for a few hours.

529
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,360
Then Ki will see
how careless that teacher is.

530
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,760
He loves his son so much. After this,

531
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,040
he’ll definitely fire her.

532
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,560
It’s my fault?

533
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,760
My grandson was kidnapped
because of your negligence.

534
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,960
You’re the one who meddled,
sending him outside,

535
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,960
finding some random school.

536
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,320
You couldn’t even keep a small child safe.

537
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,800
That’s why this happened.

538
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,520
No wonder you slandered me before.
It already happened once.

539
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,040
Nobody believed me.
Do you see now, Mr. Ki?

540
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,120
But because of Teacher Ve,

541
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,320
I got my son back.

542
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,680
And I don’t believe
she lied about seeing Uncle Pat.

543
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,200
You’re still siding with her?

544
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,040
Don't you know
she’s lied about everything,

545
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,640
even her own background?

546
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,200
You think I don’t know?

547
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,560
Pat, has the person
I told you to find arrived?

548
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,040
Yes.

549
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,160
What is this now, Mom?

550
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,120
It’s about what she's been hiding.

551
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,840
I want to know who you really are.

552
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,080
What are you talking about?

553
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,440
She's here, Mrs. Sorn.

554
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,320
<i>Why did you lie</i>
<i>about living at Baan Sukkwan?</i>

555
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
I'm firing her.

556
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,000
<i>And I hope we never meet again.</i>

557
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,240
Hey, are you filming me?
Delete that video now.

558
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,640
Is there something I can help with?

559
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,120
<i>Singha, the only son</i>
<i>of powerful politician, Sajja.</i>

560
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,920
<i>Don’t tell me Sajja</i>

561
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,520
and his son are interested in
the Suttha Group’s business.

562
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,080
When the fire broke out at Baan Sukkwan,
one child died.

563
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,600
<i>And this is the girl</i>
<i>Teacher Rawee said died that night.</i>

564
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,800
<i>How is that possible?</i>

565
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,880
Could Hathai still be alive?

566
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,840
