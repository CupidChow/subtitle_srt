1
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,960
<i>If you want me</i>
<i>to really take care of Kita,</i>

2
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,360
<i>I'll need to move into your house.</i>

3
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,280
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,280
<i>I can see right through you.</i>
<i>You're the type that likes to seduce men.</i>

5
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,560
<i>Is that because</i>

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,160
you're the same kind of woman?

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,320
<i>He clearly doesn't want to interact,</i>
<i>yet you still force yourself on him.</i>

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,480
Do you want to be an aunt or a mother?

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,760
What's that supposed to mean?

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,080
Am I right?

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,240
Alright!

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,480
Let go of me!

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,360
- Let go of me!
- Let go!

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,440
‪-You want a fight?!
‪-You're crazy!

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,600
Let go of me!

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,800
- Kita!
- Let go!

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,320
Kita.

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,360
You crazy bitch.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,800
Are you okay?

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,640
What are you two doing?

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,720
It's her fault.
Kita fell into the pool because of her.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,360
It wasn't me!

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,440
It was you!

24
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,600
What exactly happened, Miss Ve?

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,080
How did Kita fall in?

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,920
Was it an accident?

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,040
I told you to watch Kita.

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,360
If I stay in the pool too long,
I get cramps.

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,800
Mrs. Sorn, I was busy massaging my leg

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,920
because of the cramps.

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,240
I was preparing Kita's snack.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,360
But I didn't know
I couldn't trust you with anything.

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,920
Are you ready to admit

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,800
that it was your negligence
that led to my grandson falling in?

35
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,920
I left to prepare Kita's snack,
as Miss Gingploy ordered.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,440
When I got back, I saw them fighting,

37
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,400
while Kita was in the water
and no one cared.

38
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,160
How dare you accuse my guest like that?

39
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,760
I'm just telling the truth.

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,200
And if you really care
about Kita's safety,

41
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,360
you wouldn't defend
someone irresponsible who blames me.

42
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,040
Don't try to lecture me.

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,720
You're the one who was careless.

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,680
Stop shifting the blame.

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,360
I gave birth to his child.

46
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,520
So I want to know
what rights I have in this house.

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,560
Huh?

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,040
Do I really have to wait
until he divorces his wife?

49
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,000
And what if something
suddenly happens to him?

50
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,640
Alright.

51
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,680
What are you going, Hathai?

52
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,200
Dad.

53
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,680
Where's Sorn?
Why'd she leave you alone with the baby?

54
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,880
I don't know.

55
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,920
When I came out, the stroller
was about to fall into the pool.

56
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,760
What did you say?

57
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,080
Is something wrong?

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Why did you leave the baby by the pool?

59
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,200
Do you know she almost fell in the pool?

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Is that what you told him?

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,520
I know you and your mom hate me,

62
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,880
but accusing me like this is too much.

63
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,440
You said

64
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,200
you'd watch the baby
while I went to the bathroom.

65
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,520
You planned to push the stroller
into the pool and blame me, didn't you?

66
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,960
You're a kid. You couldn't
have thought of that yourself.

67
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,880
Did your mom tell you to do it?

68
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,000
Hathai.

69
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,200
Did your mom tell you to do this?

70
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,760
No.

71
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,400
I know you love your mom,

72
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,880
but this is going too far, Hathai.

73
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,560
I'll talk to Nee myself.

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,680
How nosy.

75
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,360
You think he's going to believe you?

76
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,680
How many times
do you need to learn your lesson?

77
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,160
Please calm down, Auntie.

78
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,280
I'm really sorry, Pete.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,080
I don't think she can continue
taking care of my grandson anymore.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,880
You said it yourself.

81
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,920
If you didn't do your job right,
I could fire you.

82
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,600
Remember?

83
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,640
Kita already told me what happened.

84
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,560
And I reviewed the CCTV footage too.

85
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,600
It's exactly as Kita said.

86
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
It wasn't Miss Ve's fault at all.

87
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,800
There's a camera there?

88
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,760
After Miss Ve said
she'd teach Kita how to swim,

89
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,520
I installed extra cameras

90
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,280
for safety.

91
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,640
I meant to tell you, but I forgot.

92
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,080
Then why did you wait
for Kita to speak up?

93
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,160
Why didn't you check the footage first?

94
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,640
I wanted Kita to learn to speak the truth

95
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,880
and stand up for people
who didn't do anything wrong.

96
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,800
Kita is fine. So I won't press charges.

97
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,800
But next time, no one's allowed
to give Miss Ve orders beyond her role.

98
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,840
There won't be a next time.

99
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,280
Wanvela must leave this house.

100
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,360
Pack your things and get out now.

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,880
Mom.

102
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,560
Mom.

103
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,960
It's still her fault.

104
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,800
She still left Kita with Mint and Ploy.

105
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,800
I think she did it on purpose.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,240
Mom.

107
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,640
That was fast.

108
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,800
Good you didn't cry for mercy.

109
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,920
If you were any slower, I would've had
someone drag your suitcase out for you.

110
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,040
Mom.

111
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,680
- If I ask--
- I won't change my mind.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,360
I don't need to call a car for you, do I?

113
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,840
And what if I ask you, Mrs. Sorn?

114
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,680
Good morning.

115
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,760
Grandma.

116
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,880
I talked to Ki about the company,

117
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,040
and found out what Ploy did here.

118
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,560
Kita has a good teacher,

119
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,080
but she's in trouble because of Ploy.

120
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,240
I don't think it's fair.

121
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,320
Anyway,

122
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,560
can you reconsider?

123
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,920
You don't know the full story.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,840
Please don't take sides
with someone you barely know.

125
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,039
Ever since Ging passed,

126
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,280
I may not visit often,

127
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,080
but I stay updated

128
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,240
about my great-grandson
with my grandson-in-law, Mrs. Sorn.

129
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,440
And as for Teacher Ve,

130
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,920
I've reviewed everything,

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,720
education, work history.

132
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,760
Go put your suitcase away.
I'll speak to her.

133
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,640
Thank you.

134
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,560
Thank you, Grandma.

135
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,840
Thank your mom.

136
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,640
At least she still listens to
what I say about Miss Ve.

137
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,000
If I have time,

138
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,000
may I drop by to visit Kita sometime?

139
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,040
You never have to ask.

140
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,240
You're welcome any time.

141
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,720
If you want me to bring Kita over,

142
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,200
just tell me.

143
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,400
Thank you for always treating me kindly.

144
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,360
Of course.

145
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,520
Let's go, Ploy.

146
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,520
So, Miss Ve isn't fired?

147
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,560
No. My mom respects Grandma Manee,

148
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,080
so she let her stay.

149
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,320
At least
there's still some justice in the world.

150
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,560
You seem to care about Miss Ve.

151
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,040
Well,

152
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,920
I asked her to work with me.

153
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,880
And I brought her here.

154
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,040
I didn't want her to face this.

155
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,080
Kita.

156
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,240
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,880
Why are you apologizing, Kita?

158
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,000
I should be thanking you
for telling the truth.

159
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,200
Your dad already told me everything.

160
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,480
I haven't said anything yet.

161
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,040
You haven't?

162
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,480
No.

163
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,480
I'm sorry I didn't help you.

164
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,840
At least he apologized to you.

165
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
He'll open up more with time.

166
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,960
I know you're straightforward.

167
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,800
If you want to thank me, just say it.

168
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,040
Thank you for trying to help me.

169
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,800
But I guess you had some benefit
to gain from all this too, right?

170
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,400
Aren't you being a bit too cynical?

171
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,480
Just the fact that you secretly
installed a camera by the pool,

172
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,200
I already can't think good of you.

173
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,520
I installed it for my son's safety.

174
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,720
But you're suspicious of me,

175
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,680
thinking I'm trying
to monitor your every move?

176
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,480
Or are you hiding something

177
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,120
and afraid I might find out?

178
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,920
- Mr. Ki, let go of me.
- Hm?

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,840
Don't move, or you might fall again.

180
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,480
- Unless you want to fall again.
- Don't.

181
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,280
Hey! Mr. Ki!

182
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,080
Then stay still.

183
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,200
I didn't do it.

184
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,400
Mom didn't tell me to.

185
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,240
I never wanted to hurt the baby.

186
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,720
I believe you.

187
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,560
Honestly, you're scared
of falling into the water, aren't you?

188
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,800
Or is there some trauma about it?

189
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,720
I'm not scared. I can swim.

190
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,640
People who say they fear nothing

191
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,640
are usually hiding their fear.

192
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,440
But I guess that's not me.

193
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,680
Anyway,

194
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,920
thanks for trying to help Kita.

195
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,720
Whatever doubts you have,

196
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,520
I did everything with a clean conscience.

197
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,840
You helped Kita.

198
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,680
I helped you in return.

199
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,760
That's all.

200
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,560
He's probably just like his mother.

201
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,440
Yes?

202
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,880
Let me know the time and place.

203
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
I'll see you there.

204
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,560
Everyone's been driving me crazy lately.

205
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,680
That Manee woman

206
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,240
suddenly develops some love
for her great-grandson

207
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,080
and takes Wanvela's side,

208
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,280
like she wants to be my enemy.

209
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,120
Or maybe Mrs. Manee
suspects something about Ms. Gingyok?

210
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,640
Don't talk about the dead.

211
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,680
I don't like it.

212
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,800
From what I know,

213
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,400
Ms. Ging wasn't healthy

214
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,640
and had chronic health problems,
even before marriage, right?

215
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,320
Yes.

216
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,800
Ging had a pacemaker
since before the wedding.

217
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,120
That's why I never
questioned anything when she died.

218
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,000
But then I found out she transferred
all her shares in Jade Biz

219
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,800
to Kirin without ever saying a word to me.

220
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,760
And the Liangsuttha family

221
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,720
kept trying to take over my business.

222
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,560
So I started thinking

223
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,520
that maybe Ging's death

224
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,800
wasn't so natural after all.

225
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,680
So that's why you helped me keep my job?

226
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,320
In exchange for you to help
investigate the truth

227
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,080
about Ging's death.

228
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,920
To see if there's something
hidden behind it.

229
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,960
And why would I agree to help you?

230
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,960
You think I know nothing about you?

231
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,160
And I think

232
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,440
you wouldn't want anyone else
to know about your past either.

233
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,560
Especially Kanisorn.

234
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,120
Why isn't Grandma answering?

235
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,080
Who's she talking to?
Is it that important?

236
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,480
Grandma.

237
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,640
Yes.

238
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,000
What?

239
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,920
Grandma.

240
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,720
Oh, Ploy. What are you doing here?

241
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,160
Why are you talking with this guy?

242
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,960
What do you mean by that?

243
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,319
I have a name, you know?
Show some respect.

244
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,160
Oh, want me to call you by name?

245
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,600
Your talk with "Mr. Peril".

246
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,400
Oops, I mean Mr. Pipop.

247
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,040
What's it all about?

248
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,240
I invited Mr. Pipop to discuss

249
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,440
co-investing
in a child development center.

250
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,800
If you're not here to help,

251
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,800
then don't interrupt.

252
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,360
Grandma.

253
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,880
Huh? So Mrs. Manee's
getting suspicious about you?

254
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,560
What did she say?

255
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,160
You're an orphan,

256
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,760
but you left that out
on your job application

257
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,760
as if you wanted to hide it.

258
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,320
For someone like me,

259
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,920
if I want to dig into your past,

260
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,440
it's really not that hard.

261
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,120
And why dig into it at all?

262
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,120
Because a person's eyes

263
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,480
reveal what's in their heart.

264
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,440
That's why I like to learn
about people from their eyes.

265
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,440
And when I looked into yours,

266
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,560
I could tell right away

267
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,000
that you hate the Liangsuttha family,

268
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,600
especially Kanisorn.

269
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,040
If I'm right,
then maybe we can work together.

270
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,040
Just because we share an enemy

271
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,800
doesn't mean we share the same goal.

272
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,040
Let me think about it.

273
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,080
Hello, Mrs. Manee.

274
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,960
Oh, yeah.

275
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,560
I'm not late, am I?

276
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,040
You're right on time.

277
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,320
I just finished another meeting.

278
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,080
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

279
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,440
Excuse me.

280
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,040
Mrs. Manee really is something else.

281
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,080
She's trying to use your past
to force you into working for her?

282
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
I don't believe

283
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,760
she'll find out anything more about you.

284
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,920
She's probably just bluffing.

285
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,240
Do you think I should
make friends instead of enemies?

286
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,000
You're really going to help her?

287
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,640
If I cooperate,

288
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,440
she'll stop digging into my past

289
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,800
about who I am, where I'm from,
and what I want.

290
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,680
She only wants someone
to investigate about her granddaughter.

291
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,600
But we've already got almost no evidence

292
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,960
about your father's death alone.

293
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,240
And if Ms. Ging
was also actually murdered in that house,

294
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,360
what will you do?

295
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,200
Aunt Kob, where's Teacher Ve?
I just got back and found Kita alone.

296
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,360
She left right after class ended.

297
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,640
Oh.

298
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,600
Did she say where she went?

299
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,000
I asked her where she was going,
and she just said

300
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,560
"I won't answer. It's after work hours."
Can you believe her?

301
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,040
Well, she's not wrong.

302
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,600
It's her personal time.

303
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,000
How nosy.

304
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,680
You think he's going to believe you?

305
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,640
How many times do you need

306
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,880
to learn your lesson?

307
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,360
But you lied to Dad about everything.

308
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,520
Yet he still believed me.

309
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,720
Has he ever believed you?

310
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,840
Never.

311
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,800
One day, he'll know the truth.

312
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,840
You think you're tough?

313
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,560
- You're tough, huh?
- Don't hurt me!

314
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,680
Come here.

315
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,080
Huh.

316
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,960
It's over now.

317
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,800
You're not that same
scared little girl anymore.

318
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,200
Why would I mix up the thing
about Hathai and Teacher Ve?

319
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,080
But we've already got

320
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,520
almost no evidence
about your father's death alone.

321
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,840
And if Ms. Ging
was also actually murdered in that house,

322
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,920
what will you do?

323
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,160
Honestly, you could just

324
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,320
teach Kita English yourself.

325
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,800
Learning with a native speaker
would be more effective.

326
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,400
That way, Kita can build

327
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,360
a strong foundation in listening,
speaking, reading, and writing.

328
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,480
Are you upset with me?

329
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,960
Why would I be?

330
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,400
You're not evil.

331
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,200
Not a murderer for me to despise.

332
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,560
A murderer?

333
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,120
I'm no saint,

334
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,040
but I'm not the kind of man
who could take a life.

335
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,640
It was just a figure of speech.

336
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,760
I'm sorry if it offended you.

337
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But if it's not true,

338
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,520
then no matter what anyone says,
you wouldn't be angry, would you?

339
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,440
Let go of me.

340
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,040
You're scaring me.

341
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,480
I think you didn't come here
just to work and support yourself.

342
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,800
You came for a man.

343
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,360
And I just found out
you came here just to find me?

344
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,600
You're a bit full of yourself, aren't you?

345
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,120
Why would I come looking for you?
I came to see Ki.

346
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,760
Then why are you wasting your time on me?
Why don't you go see Mr. Ki instead?

347
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,960
Because I've seen your behavior
behind everyone's back in this house.

348
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,680
No wonder Auntie tried to kick you out
and you just wouldn't leave.

349
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,600
You're clinging on like a leech.

350
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,240
Using Kita's tutoring as an excuse

351
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,080
when in fact, you just want to get close
to Ki. I'll tell Auntie and Nun.

352
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,440
Why don't you take the time you use
to snoop into my life

353
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,680
to take care of your own
mental health instead?

354
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,120
Stalker-like behavior,
secretly watching and following people,

355
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,480
no man can tolerate that.

356
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,040
The one who needs treatment
should be the one going to the hospital.

357
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,360
A problematic person shouldn't harass

358
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
or hurt others so badly
they end up hospitalized instead.

359
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,920
Are you saying I'm mentally ill?

360
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,360
There are plenty
of security cameras in this house.

361
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,520
Before using violence,
try using your brain.

362
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,280
Maybe then
you'll look better in Mr. Ki's eyes.

363
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,880
Oh, Mint.

364
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,160
- Mrs. Sorn.
- Hm.

365
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,160
Are you okay? Is something wrong?
You don't look so good.

366
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,000
I have to tell you something.
Earlier, I saw--

367
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,880
What did you see, Mint?

368
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
Actually, I realized

369
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,280
last time, I acted poorly
towards you and Ki.

370
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,560
So this time,
I want to sincerely apologize.

371
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,760
Don't overthink it, dear. Last time,
Ploy was the one who started with you.

372
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,520
No one's blaming you,

373
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,320
right Ki?

374
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,960
Oh?

375
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,080
Whose is this?

376
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,840
Wow.

377
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,520
So beautiful. It must be expensive!

378
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,600
Oh. Oops.

379
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,600
Uh.

380
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,080
Is this yours?

381
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,720
It's not mine.

382
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,960
Aunt Kob,
have you seen my crystal necklace?

383
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,080
Here it is.

384
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,680
Puth bought it for me. If it went missing,
I'd never hear the end of it.

385
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,920
Who the hell did this?

386
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,600
Why did it break like this?

387
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,040
Do you even know how much it cost?

388
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,400
- Uh. Well, Miss Nun.
- Was it you?

389
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,160
Uh…

390
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,360
I'm the one who broke it.

391
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
You?

392
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,600
I'll go have it replaced
with a new one at the shop.

393
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,800
So you broke someone else's stuff

394
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,440
and now you're showing off your wealth?

395
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,000
Someone like you?

396
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,440
You think the salary Ki pays you

397
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,160
could afford this necklace?

398
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,520
Oh?

399
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,960
Is it that expensive, Miss Nun?

400
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Of course.

401
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,400
People who've never had anything

402
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,680
probably think it's just
cheap trash like they're used to.

403
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,560
I'll get it replaced.

404
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,600
Don't worry, Miss Nun.

405
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,800
It's expensive. Why would you help me?

406
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,000
Did you just want to show off
like Miss Nun said?

407
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,360
I wasn't showing off.

408
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,360
I'm not even rich.

409
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,280
But if I broke it,

410
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,600
I should be able to take responsibility.

411
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,440
So you think I'm poor?

412
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,160
That I can't afford to pay her back?

413
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,440
I've worked here for a long time.

414
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,720
Miss Nun may be upset,

415
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,160
but I just broke a little thing.

416
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,360
Mrs. Sorn would still feel for me.

417
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,280
You've worked with Mrs. Sorn for years.

418
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,840
That must mean she trusts you
and tells you everything about the house.

419
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,840
Not exactly.

420
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,200
I came in after Mr. Terd passed.

421
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,400
If Jit hadn't resigned,

422
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,440
she would've been
the closest person to Mrs. Sorn.

423
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,120
Everyone else

424
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,520
came after.

425
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,760
They come and go.

426
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,560
Now I'm the longest-staying one.

427
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
Why did Jit resign?

428
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,000
Mrs. Sorn seems so kind to everyone.

429
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,960
I don't know. Ask Mr. Pat.

430
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,560
He's the one who manages
the hiring for Mrs. Sorn.

431
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,840
Mr. Napat?

432
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Mr. Pat.

433
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,560
Since we started letting
under-20s into the bar,

434
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,920
this month's revenue is up

435
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,640
nearly 30% compared to last month.

436
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,200
Excellent. That's what I want to hear.

437
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,040
Well,

438
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,560
you're selling bootleg liquor too.
You must be rolling in cash.

439
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,000
They say shady businesses

440
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,680
bring in huge profits.

441
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,840
But it still doesn't beat your luck.

442
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,080
- What luck?
- Well.

443
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,440
The widow taking care of you.

444
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,680
Widow, husband dead, lonely.

445
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,960
She'll believe anything you say.

446
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,520
That's how you got the money
to open this place, right?

447
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,560
Anyway, this bar

448
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,960
is not that hard to run.

449
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Whatever you want,

450
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,320
you just use some charm in bed
and get it all,

451
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,080
right?

452
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,800
Right, Manager?

453
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,720
Take him and beat him up.

454
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,080
Bro.

455
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,200
- Hey.
- Go.

456
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,120
Get up!

457
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,080
- Go!
- Smart mouth, huh?!

458
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,080
Go!

459
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,640
Go!

460
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,960
Nothing to see here. Please enjoy.

461
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,200
Eat this!

462
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,120
You've got a smart mouth, huh?

463
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Boss.

464
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,800
Mr. Ki is here.

465
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,720
Hello, Mr. Ki.

466
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,480
You should've told me you were coming.

467
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,120
I would've told the staff
to take care of you.

468
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm not here for fun.

469
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,640
I just came to see where
my mom's investment money is going.

470
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,000
It's her personal fund,

471
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,560
but if anything shady comes from it,

472
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,840
I'll deal with it.

473
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,960
Then feel free to take a look.

474
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,840
Everything here is good

475
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,000
and legal.

476
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
After bringing your friend here tonight,

477
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,360
maybe you'll enjoy it
and want to come back.

478
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,000
Are you sure you want
my friend coming here often?

479
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,600
Uh, I just mean if my friend is demanding

480
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,239
or likes to find fault,

481
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,320
you might be in trouble.

482
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,280
I mean, you might have to work harder.

483
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,880
It looks like an ordinary bar.

484
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,800
If nothing's off, I'll be at ease.

485
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,040
I just don't want Mom
investing in anything

486
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,360
illegal.

487
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
Then I guess we'll be here a while.

488
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,000
I'll use the restroom.

489
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,480
I didn't expect you
to be in a place like this.

490
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,840
Well, if you can be here, why can't I?

491
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,040
I have a social life too.
I meet up with friends.

492
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,040
I hope you're not one of those bosses

493
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,200
who forbids employees from having a life.

494
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,200
Miss Ve?

495
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,040
What a coincidence. You're here too?

496
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,000
I own the place.

497
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,280
- Of course I'm here to manage it.
- Really?

498
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,760
I didn't know you had a business too.

499
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,600
I'm just waiting for a friend,
but she hasn't arrived yet.

500
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,280
Then let me keep you company.

501
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,520
Special service from the owner.

502
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,480
And drinks are on me too.

503
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,840
Hey, what did you do in there?

504
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,000
Hey, wait!

505
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,520
- Oh.
- Aw. What the hell?

506
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,040
The restroom's here, sir.

507
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,720
Yes?

508
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,800
The police are coming?

509
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,720
Okay.

510
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,120
Boss.

511
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,120
Yot doesn't seem good, boss.

512
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,320
He's having a seizure. What do we do?

513
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,760
I'll handle it.

514
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,400
I'll come back and sit with you soon.
It won't be long.

515
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,320
Alright.

516
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,200
Boss.

517
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,640
What now?

518
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,840
The police are coming.

519
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,760
Why are they here?

520
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,480
Everyone, please remain calm.

521
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,040
We'll now begin ID and bag checks.

522
