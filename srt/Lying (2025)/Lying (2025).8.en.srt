1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,840
<i>They said the houses that burned</i>

2
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,360
<i>each received</i>
<i>several hundred thousand baht.</i>

3
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,200
<i>You arranged this?</i>
<i>Why didn't I hear about it?</i>

4
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,680
<i>I already know</i>
<i>you sent that package to me.</i>

5
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,160
<i>What do you want?</i>

6
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,560
I only wanted you
to remember my dead granddaughter

7
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,960
on your special day.

8
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,160
Before she passed, she seemed stressed

9
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,920
about the company shares
and about her mother-in-law.

10
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
Was it Kanisorn's doing?

11
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,120
Ki, I hit someone with my car.

12
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,960
Ki, help me. Where are you?

13
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,920
PREVIOUSLY

14
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,120
Is she still breathing, Nun?

15
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,160
No. She's not breathing anymore.

16
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,920
What? Then she's dead?!

17
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,480
I told you not to drive if you couldn't.

18
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,280
This has nothing to do with me!

19
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,720
How can you blame me?

20
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,840
You told me to drive you.

21
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,400
If we hadn't come this way,

22
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,240
this wouldn't have happened.

23
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,880
It's your fault!

24
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,040
- Don't blame me, Nun!
- Hey!

25
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,120
Oh.

26
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,680
- Miss Nun.
- Uncle Pat.

27
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,320
Uncle Pat, where's Ki?

28
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,880
Where's Ki?

29
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,000
Mrs. Sorn sent me to handle this.

30
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,960
But are you okay?

31
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,080
And when it happened, did anyone see it?

32
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,560
I… I don't know.

33
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,680
By the time I realized it,
I'd already hit her.

34
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,960
It's alright.

35
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,480
You go home.

36
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,760
- Get her home now.
- Yes, sir.

37
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,400
- Go, Miss Nun.
- This way, please.

38
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,520
Please.

39
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,040
Wait for me!

40
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,000
You can't just leave me like this.
I won't take it!

41
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,120
Nun.

42
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,640
Nun. Nun.

43
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,400
Nun, what happened?

44
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,480
You asked me to come help,

45
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,840
but why did you come back
with Uncle Pat's men?

46
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,680
After I called you,

47
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,960
I called Mom.

48
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,720
Uncle Pat said

49
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,360
Mom would handle everything
and told me to come back right away.

50
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,400
And the person you hit?

51
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,760
She's… probably dead.

52
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,720
What did you say?

53
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,360
I… I don't know.

54
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,760
Wa asked me to give her a ride.

55
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,440
Then suddenly a woman ran out
in front of my car

56
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,840
and I didn't see her.

57
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,480
I really didn't see her.

58
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,320
Then… then why did you rush back?

59
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,720
Why didn't you wait for the police?

60
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,160
I… I didn't know.

61
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,400
I didn't know what to do, Ki.

62
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,680
But Puth can probably help me.

63
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,520
I… I'll call Puth.

64
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,400
Stop right there, Nun.

65
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,720
Mom.

66
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,800
I'm scared.

67
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,720
If you're scared, then don't do anything.

68
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,760
Act as if nothing happened.
Do you understand?

69
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,320
Mom.

70
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,240
Things have gone this far.
How can we act like nothing happened?

71
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,680
Ki, are you really worried
about your sister?

72
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Why wouldn't I be?

73
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,120
Then don't bring this up again.
I'll take care of the rest.

74
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Hello?

75
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,120
What?

76
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,600
The police are coming here?

77
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,520
I'm sorry to disturb you so late,

78
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,400
but we received a report that
a car with Miss Nunnalin's license plate

79
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,040
was involved in a fatal hit-and-run.

80
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,080
Miss Nun hit someone?

81
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Uh…

82
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,440
There must be some misunderstanding.

83
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,840
My daughter's been home
since early this evening.

84
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,040
She's asleep now.
How could she have hit anyone?

85
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,760
Right?

86
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,200
Uh… yes.

87
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,320
Oh.

88
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,120
What's the matter, Mom?

89
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,520
Why are you waking me up?

90
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,360
See?

91
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,680
So what time did you
arrive home, Miss Nunnalin?

92
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,600
At… uh… around…

93
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
- Oh, around…
- Miss Nun.

94
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,560
Are you alright?
Why are your clothes covered in blood?

95
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
Are you okay?

96
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,520
Mrs. Sorn, look.
Her clothes are full of blood.

97
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,320
Uh… I cut my hand on a wine opener.

98
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,560
Is the cut deep? I'll bandage it.

99
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,320
What are you doing?

100
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,200
I saw that she just came home

101
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,640
and her clothes are covered in blood,
so I was worried.

102
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,720
So did you just get home,

103
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,200
or have you been home
since early this evening?

104
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,800
This has nothing to do with you.
Leave now.

105
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,800
Miss Nunnalin, please come
to the station for further questioning.

106
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,760
Hey!

107
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,120
I told you to stop!

108
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,800
You deliberately tried to get the police
to take Nun to the station, didn't you?

109
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,880
What are you talking about?

110
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,160
I don't know anything.

111
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,360
And I didn't even know
why the police came here.

112
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,520
You're plotting this.

113
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,520
Ever since you moved here

114
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,200
you've been trying to ruin me.

115
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,120
Why? Why?

116
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,640
Why would I do that?

117
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,080
Do we have some conflict with each other?

118
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,240
Oh.

119
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,240
Or is it because
you've wronged so many people

120
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,040
you're afraid someone
will come back for revenge?

121
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,760
Get out of my house right now!

122
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,680
- Mom
- I won't tolerate this anymore, Ki.

123
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,080
You've seen
how she's made everything worse

124
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,240
and she's dragging Nun down.

125
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,480
And what did Miss Nun do wrong

126
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,520
that you have to be so afraid?

127
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,440
If she did nothing wrong,
no one can do anything to her.

128
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,120
Nun did nothing wrong.

129
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,960
As for you, name your price. I'll pay it.

130
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,600
Then pack your things
and leave my house right now.

131
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,320
You're throwing me out?

132
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,760
I don't have to repeat myself.

133
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,880
Miss Ve,

134
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,640
I'll talk to Mom myself.
Please go back to your room.

135
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,080
I have nothing else to say.

136
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
But if Kita finds out you're firing her,

137
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,600
how will he feel?

138
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,080
- Kita.
- You're mean, Grandma!

139
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,920
Where are you sending Teacher Ve?

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,280
Oh, Kita. Don't cry, alright?

141
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,720
Don't go anywhere
even if Grandma fires you.

142
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,840
Come here.

143
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,400
There, there.

144
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,720
Kita.

145
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,360
Miss Ve,

146
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,240
please take Kita back to his room.

147
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,000
Let's go.

148
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,040
You see,

149
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,200
you can't fire Miss Ve now.

150
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,920
Kita has improved so much,

151
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,080
and I won't let my son
go back to how he was before.

152
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,360
Where's Nun?

153
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,280
Since she got back,
she hasn't left her room.

154
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,720
It's good the police didn't question
the blood on her clothes last night.

155
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,040
But when they interrogated her,

156
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,040
she must've been terrified,
so she didn't say a word.

157
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,640
Maybe saying nothing is better.

158
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,720
At least the reporters
don't have anything to write about,

159
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,000
other than the car
being registered to her.

160
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,200
Oh, Kita.

161
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,160
Why?

162
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,440
Afraid you wouldn't get to study?
You came to fetch me yourself.

163
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,000
- Let's go to class, Teacher.
- Alright, let's go.

164
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,800
If it weren't for Ki and Kita,
I would've kicked her out last night.

165
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,560
But in any case,
we must resolve Miss Nun's issue first.

166
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,560
Then hurry up and finish it.
No matter what it takes,

167
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,880
she must not be implicated.

168
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,800
I will never allow
my daughter to go to jail.

169
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,240
Yes, Mrs. Sorn.

170
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,040
How are you feeling? Tired?

171
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,040
No.

172
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,920
- Hungry?
- Yes.

173
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,720
You're soaked.

174
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,440
Kita,

175
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,360
let me talk to Teacher Ve a bit.

176
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,680
Go wait in the classroom, okay?

177
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,200
Kita.

178
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,840
Wait for me there. I'm not going anywhere.

179
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,600
Looks like he's really attached to you.

180
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,360
I don't actually want him
to be too attached to me.

181
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,880
I already told you before.

182
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
That's right.

183
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,880
You even threatened
to raise your wages on me.

184
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,600
Is that

185
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,280
why you always dare to provoke my mother,

186
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,520
including last night?

187
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,400
Are you saying I'm using Kita as a shield

188
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,160
against Mrs. Sorn?

189
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,920
Well, are you?

190
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,320
I know you can help Kita.

191
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,800
But if you're using him
for your own benefit,

192
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,080
I can't allow it.

193
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,640
And what about you?

194
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,360
You act all righteous in front of others,

195
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,640
but when it comes to your own family,
you turn a blind eye.

196
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,440
You refuse to see what's right or wrong.

197
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,280
- You…
- Or am I wrong?

198
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,720
So did Miss Nun really run someone over?

199
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,040
Can you confirm that truth for me?

200
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,960
Well? I'm waiting for your answer.

201
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,800
If you can't give me an answer,
then look at yourself first

202
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,400
before accusing me.

203
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,600
Are you really not
choosing family over justice?

204
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,600
What?

205
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,160
Are you seriously upset
by what Mr. Ki said?

206
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,440
I'm not upset.

207
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,440
If you weren't affected,

208
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,960
you wouldn't look so tense and gloomy.

209
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,840
Come here, let me help.

210
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,000
You don't need to be stressed.

211
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,480
What are you doing? I'm angry now.

212
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,840
Yes, I got into that house
because of Kita,

213
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,920
but I never used him as a tool.
You know that.

214
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,960
So what?

215
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,760
That Kanisorn woman
is trying every possible way

216
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,560
to get you thrown out of there anyway.

217
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,200
If you had used Kita as a tool,
it wouldn't matter.

218
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,280
I can take care of myself.
I don't need a child to help me.

219
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,320
Oh? Could it be that our dear Teacher Ve

220
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,000
has fallen for her student? Hm?

221
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,200
No matter how much I want Kanisorn
to face the consequences,

222
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,840
I'd never take it out on Kita.

223
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,840
- Okay, okay. I believe you. Calm down.
- Ugh.

224
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,040
Hm?

225
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,640
What's wrong?

226
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,319
Looks like the person
you wanted punished most

227
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,240
just got her daughter off the hook.

228
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,599
Here, news just came in.

229
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,800
<i>Miss Lookwa, can I get an interview?</i>

230
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,400
<i>What happened that night?</i>

231
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,160
That night,
someone came to pick up Nun first.

232
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,080
She left her car there,

233
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,800
so I drove it and got into the accident.
Please excuse me.

234
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,000
So, you were the one driving?

235
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,960
Yes. I was driving,

236
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,160
and Nun wasn't in the car.

237
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
<i>It was my fault.</i>
<i>I'll take responsibility for everything.</i>

238
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,280
- <i>Wait, Miss Lookwa.</i>
- <i>Please wait.</i>

239
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,800
<i>Miss Lookwa.</i>

240
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,560
Paid hush money
and let her friend take the blame, huh?

241
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,680
Yeah.

242
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,960
The news says the dashcam was broken,

243
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,240
and that stretch of road had no CCTV.

244
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,680
Honestly,

245
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,440
was it missing, or made missing?

246
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,640
Someone like Kanisorn
would never let her daughter go to jail.

247
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,120
She's just using
the same tactics she did with the fire.

248
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,680
And you?
Do you have a way to deal with this?

249
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,360
I won't let this incident
disappear quietly like before.

250
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,280
There must be evidence from that night.

251
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,840
I saw the news, Nun.

252
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,520
Mom arranged everything.

253
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,080
But you also wanted it this way,
didn't you?

254
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,120
That's why you let your friend
take the blame.

255
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,160
And what do you expect me to do?

256
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,000
Try putting yourself in my shoes.

257
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,200
If it were me…

258
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,640
I'd face the truth.

259
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,080
Think about it. If you spoke up now,

260
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,320
things might not turn out
as bad as you imagine.

261
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,240
I even consulted a lawyer.

262
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,040
If you did what I said,

263
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,880
everything Mom planned would collapse.

264
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,320
I already told Mom

265
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,240
I'll marry Puth.

266
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,800
What?

267
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,480
Mom said if I get married,

268
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,280
this whole mess will end.

269
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,680
And after thinking about it,
it's better to get married soon.

270
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,560
That way, Puth can take care of me.

271
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,120
I won't have to struggle anymore.

272
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,040
Nun.

273
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,080
So you'll just keep running
from problems like this?

274
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,280
How many more times
will you have to run away in the future?

275
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,480
Think it through.

276
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,280
Tomorrow, Puth and his father

277
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,080
are coming to discuss
the wedding date with Mom.

278
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,040
There's nothing more
for me to think about.

279
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,280
It seems only good news
keeps happening in this house.

280
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,600
First, she avoid
responsibility for the case.

281
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,040
Now there's the marriage,

282
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,000
even after she loudly
rejected the idea before.

283
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,360
What are you trying to say?

284
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,800
What can I say?

285
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,400
If only good things keep happening,

286
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,760
then, like you, I'm speechless with joy.

287
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,560
I know you're trying to scold me,

288
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,040
but I insist

289
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,040
that I'll handle the problems in my family
the best I can

290
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,320
without hurting anyone.

291
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,560
I understand you love your sister deeply.

292
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,040
But for me,

293
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,320
if I want to teach a child
discipline and responsibility,

294
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,920
positive reinforcement isn't enough.

295
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,640
They need to learn consequences too.

296
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,520
Cheer up, Nun.

297
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,520
Puth and Mr. Wittaya are coming
to discuss your wedding today.

298
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,840
Someone who's forcing themselves

299
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,080
won't be able to smile, Mom.

300
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,560
Don't ruin this moment
with your words, Ki.

301
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,720
Nun,

302
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,400
I really want you
to think this through once more.

303
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,920
I told you not to ruin things, didn't I?

304
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,800
Mr. Wiputh and Mr. Wittaya are here.

305
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,320
Oh, please come in. Hello.

306
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,040
If you're not going to help the family,
then stay quiet.

307
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,720
- Welcome, welcome.
- Hello.

308
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,280
I was so glad when Wiputh told me

309
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,680
that Nun agreed to marry him.

310
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,320
At first,
I was a little worried about the news,

311
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,280
but now that everything seems settled,
I feel relieved.

312
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,640
Yes.

313
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,800
I told you she had nothing to do with it.

314
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,480
That's right, it was a misunderstanding.

315
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,960
That night, she wasn't driving,
nor was she even there.

316
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,760
But as for drunk drivers like that,

317
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,440
it's better you never get involved again.

318
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,960
Nun was never that close
with Lookwa anyway, Dad.

319
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,520
She was just kind enough
to lend her the car.

320
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,520
Right, Nun?

321
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,560
Yes.

322
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,880
Good, then I'm reassured.

323
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,240
Shall we discuss the wedding now?

324
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,040
We can talk about the dowry, Mrs. Sorn.

325
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,040
I'm ready.

326
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,440
Today, Mrs. Sorn must be
grinning wider than this whole plate.

327
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,800
Mr. Wiputh really seems to love Miss Nun.

328
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,920
Of course he does.

329
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,080
He bought her such expensive gifts.

330
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,440
But without the news about
who was responsible for the car accident,

331
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,480
I doubt he would've come
to propose so quickly.

332
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,560
I thought he loved her enough
not to care about gossip.

333
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,120
Don't be naive.

334
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,800
Why would people with wealth
and status like that

335
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,600
let their son marry a kill--

336
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,560
Someone involved in a scandal?

337
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,000
Even if she were just as crazy rich,

338
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,800
social standing comes first.

339
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,240
PRAEPAI: I'VE GOT THE THING YOU WANT

340
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,880
That's right.

341
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,600
If they knew the truth
of what really happened, what then?

342
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,280
What truth are you talking about?

343
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,040
As for the dowry and wedding ring,

344
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,560
I won't let you or Nun be embarrassed.

345
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,120
At the wedding,
I'll prepare ten million baht in cash,

346
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,080
100 baht weight in gold bars,
and how many carats of diamonds?

347
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,320
I'd like the wedding ring
to be the one you gave to Mom.

348
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,960
Of course.

349
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,600
What about you, Mrs. Sorn? Any objections?

350
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,560
None.

351
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,280
Who's sending something
at a time like this?

352
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,840
Is she still breathing, Nun?

353
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,360
No.

354
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,160
You go home.

355
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,440
- Get her home now.
- Yes, sir.

356
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,400
- Go, Miss Nun.
- This way, please.

357
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,960
What is it, Puth?

358
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,000
What is it? Show me.

359
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,600
Is this…?

360
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,360
I never imagined

361
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,600
your family could lie
and cover up your crimes like this.

362
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,520
Oh.

363
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,960
What's going on?

364
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,600
It's your daughter.

365
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,400
She's the one who hit and killed someone,

366
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,680
but the whole family
puts on innocent faces.

367
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
You even made someone else take the blame.

368
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,320
Mr. Wittaya, what are you saying?

369
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,280
See for yourself.

370
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,800
This is fake.

371
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,560
Nun didn't really do this, she--

372
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,000
It's this clear,
and you still call it fake?

373
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,080
Please, Mr. Wittaya,

374
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,720
- listen to me.
- I won't listen to anything.

375
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,680
If you want me to believe you,

376
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,000
drag the editor
who edited this video to me,

377
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,520
then I'll believe it.

378
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,960
As for everything we discussed today,
I'm canceling all of it.

379
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
I will never allow my son

380
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,960
to marry a woman
with a criminal case hanging over her.

381
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,960
Mr. Wittaya, please listen to me.

382
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Wiputh, we're leaving.

383
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,520
Puth.

384
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,920
Puth.

385
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
Puth.

386
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,880
Mom…

387
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,480
What do I do?

388
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,800
Who leaked that video?!

389
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,040
Oh.

390
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,320
I was just about to bring out the dessert.

391
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,960
Never mind. The guests are gone.

392
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,880
- Go do something else.
- Yes.

393
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,320
Why did the meeting end so quickly?

394
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,040
So when's the wedding?

395
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,040
Hey.

396
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,440
What are you doing?

397
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,920
You sent that clip to Wiputh, didn't you?

398
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,200
What are you talking about?

399
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,760
What are you doing? Hey.

400
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,120
Hey.

401
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,840
You must've erased
all the evidence by now.

402
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,080
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

403
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,240
Someone sent Wiputh a video
that Nun was the one driving that night,

404
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,320
not Lookwa.

405
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,520
Something like that happened?

406
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,720
Whether it's real or fake, I don't care.

407
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,960
But I hope it wasn't you.

408
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,560
I wouldn't even have the ability
to fake something like that.

409
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,240
Besides, I work here nearly all the time.

410
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,280
When would I have the time
to go find clips and send them to people?

411
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,280
So who leaked it?

412
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,240
Didn't you say there were no cameras
and no evidence there?

413
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,800
Um…

414
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,560
It was very dark.
Maybe I missed something.

415
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,000
Careless. How can I ever trust you again?

416
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,560
I'm sorry.

417
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,760
Sorry doesn't fix anything.

418
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,480
Did anyone else see that clip?

419
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,480
Just Mr. Wiputh's family.

420
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,600
But they won't spread it,
not if it hurts them too.

421
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,440
And what if they leak it somewhere else?

422
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,160
Find out who leaked it,

423
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,800
before it spreads further.

424
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,960
Yes, ma'am.

425
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,280
<i>That house must be in chaos now.</i>

426
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,480
Who would have thought

427
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,600
someone would leak a clip
of Nunnalin running someone over.

428
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,640
Thanks to you, we have
the evidence of what happened.

429
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,320
Like they say,

430
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,280
what is done by night appears by day.

431
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,560
Cases without evidence,

432
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,080
most of the time, it's because
the evidence was hidden away

433
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,320
or destroyed.

434
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,720
Yeah.

435
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,880
Kanisorn probably thought
that once someone took the blame,

436
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,480
no one would keep digging.

437
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,840
She underestimated this Praepai.

438
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,920
I will never let
wrongdoers live in comfort.

439
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,040
What they've covered up will haunt them

440
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,040
until they get
the punishment they deserve.

441
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,480
What was that?

442
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,400
Please come see Miss Nun.

443
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,440
Nun.

444
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,000
- What? Nun!
- Nun.

445
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,280
- Nun!
- Nun!

446
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,360
- Hey.
- Nun. Hey.

447
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,320
Nun.

448
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,720
- Nun.
- Nun.

449
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,800
- Nun.
- Wake up, Nun.

450
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,600
- Nun.
- Nun.

451
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
- Nun. Nun.
- Wake up.

452
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,000
- Wake up.
- Mom,

453
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,440
let's take her to the hospital.

454
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,800
Yeah.

455
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,840
Nun.

456
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,400
Nun.

457
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,160
Doctor, how's my daughter doing?

458
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,600
She's safe now.

459
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,720
No complications.

460
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,440
But she should stay in the hospital
for observation for a while.

461
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,480
Yes.

462
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,280
Thank you very much, Doctor.

463
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,280
No problem.

464
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,960
Why did you have to go this far, Nun?

465
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,720
Mrs. Sorn, how is Miss Nun?

466
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,160
She's safe.

467
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,680
But the reporters are waiting for you
outside the hospital now.

468
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,360
News travels fast.

469
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,560
Mom, why don't you leave for now?
I'll stay with her.

470
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,240
I won't hide.

471
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,760
Uh…

472
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,880
Mom, where are you going?

473
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,800
Mom.

474
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
Mom.

475
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,960
It's a good thing
Mr. Ki brought her in time.

476
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,440
This is because of me, isn't it?
This is why Nun ended up like this.

477
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,840
It's not your fault.

478
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,920
But it's this bad because of me.

479
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,200
Ve…

480
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,200
You're just emotional right now.

481
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,600
Your mouth says you want revenge

482
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,120
and want the guilty punished…

483
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,520
but you still feel bad
for your own little sister, don't you?

484
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,120
If you're going to blame someone,

485
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,920
blame Mrs. Kanisorn.

486
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,000
She drove her own daughter to this point.

487
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,760
Hey, Mrs. Kanisorn is here.

488
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,040
- Mrs. Kanisorn.
- Excuse me.

489
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,960
Just a moment.

490
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,600
Is it true that Miss Nunnalin
attempted suicide?

491
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,400
It's true.

492
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,240
What kind of problems led her to that?

493
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,400
I can't say much right now,

494
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,960
but I'll tell you what I can.

495
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Someone is trying
to destroy my daughter's reputation.

496
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,880
Oh…

497
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,760
The pressure became unbearable,

498
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,000
so she tried to kill herself.

499
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,960
Let me speak as a mother.

500
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,120
I want to send a message

501
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,199
to whoever is hurting my daughter,
please stop.

502
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,159
Mm.

503
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,159
- Mrs. Sorn.
- Oh.

504
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,560
I'll even kneel if I must.

505
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,120
I beg you.

506
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,440
Please stop.

507
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,679
Don't let it get to the point
where someone's life is lost.

508
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,480
I'm truly begging you.

509
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,159
Uh…

510
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,080
Mom.

511
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,880
Mrs. Sorn, please stand up.

512
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,680
Mr. Ki.

513
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,680
Please sit.

514
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,240
I must look pathetic to you.

515
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,160
That's why you rushed over to help.

516
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,600
I really am useless.

517
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,480
I couldn't help my sister.

518
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,200
I couldn't help my mother.

519
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,360
I really am pathetic.

520
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,080
If you keep blaming yourself
and being weak like this,

521
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,880
then yes, it's pathetic.

522
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,840
But I know you're not that kind of person.

523
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,360
Every problem has a way out, Mr. Ki.

524
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,760
You just can't see it yet.

525
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,600
You just have to let it be for now.

526
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,120
Please don't go yet.

527
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,680
Stay with me.

528
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,640
Think of me

529
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,000
as Kita,

530
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,080
wanting to be spoiled.

531
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,520
Oh.

532
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,080
Are you here to visit the patient?

533
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,200
She's awake now,
but she's talking with her mother.

534
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,880
- Yes.
- Yes.

535
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,480
Even though you're feeling better,
you must pretend to still be very ill.

536
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,320
Why do I have to do that?

537
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,160
Because of that damn clip.

538
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,720
If it ever goes viral online,

539
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,040
it won't just be you who suffers.

540
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,840
Your brother and I will suffer too.

541
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,880
Act gravely ill
so people feel bad for you.

542
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,160
I even

543
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,080
kneeled in front of the media
to win public sympathy.

544
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,840
If the clip goes online,

545
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,480
people will think it's fake,
an attempt to smear us.

546
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,000
Do you understand?

547
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,800
Hathai?

548
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,360
NEXT EPISODE

549
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,480
<i>Without Teacher Rawee, I wouldn't be</i>
<i>in New Zealand with my adoptive parents.</i>

550
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,040
Who could've known that when I came back
she would be sick like this.

551
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,480
But for Kita,

552
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,120
please let me make decisions myself.

553
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,480
Looks like

554
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,560
kicking Teacher Ve out won't be easy now.

555
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,440
No matter what,
I must get her out of this house.

556
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,920
<i>Kita's missing?</i>

557
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,120
Dad. Teacher Ve. Help me.

558
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,200
Dad. Teacher Ve.

559
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,920
