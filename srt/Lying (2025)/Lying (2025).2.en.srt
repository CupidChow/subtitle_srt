1
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,840
<i>If someone wasn't behind the scenes,</i>

2
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,240
<i>who would dare go this far?</i>

3
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,280
Find out who else is involved behind this.

4
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,760
<i>And find out who Wanvela is.</i>

5
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,080
<i>You think I'm too stupid</i>
<i>to realize who you really are?</i>

6
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,480
PREVIOUSLY

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,320
<i>It's been 20 years. Everyone in that house</i>
<i>has probably forgotten me.</i>

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,120
<i>I've already sent someone</i>
<i>to negotiate with them.</i>

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,720
But it turns out
our people have been hurting them.

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,000
<i>I want a teacher</i>
<i>who can come to our home and teach him.</i>

11
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,960
<i>And I want someone</i>

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,440
<i>who really understands a child like Kita.</i>

13
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,360
Miss Ve?

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,520
This is Teacher Wanvela.

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,960
I see that Miss Ve
has relevant experience.

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,520
She worked in an early childhood
development center overseas before.

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,000
So I thought she'd be great
to take care of Kita.

18
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,480
Hello.

19
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,400
Kita.

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,120
Kob.

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,160
Take Kita back to his room.
Nun, go with them.

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,640
Yes, ma'am. Let's go.

23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,920
‪Come, Master Kita.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,680
Come now. Come with me.

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,080
Didn't you hear your grandma?
Come with me.

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,320
Let's go.

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,520
Is something wrong, Auntie?

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,400
No, nothing at all. Thank you, Pete.

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,520
But let me speak directly
with the person you brought.

30
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,080
We won't trouble you any further.

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Mom and I will speak
with Miss Ve ourselves. You can go.

32
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,920
I can handle the interview myself.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,320
Then I'll take my leave.

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,520
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,760
Here's my résumé.

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,680
The folder contains
my education background,

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,560
training history, and experience working
in early childhood homeschool programs.

38
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,960
I had no idea you had experience
with small children.

39
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,840
No need to look at any of that.

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,360
Why, Mom?

41
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,800
I never intended to let this woman in.

42
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,400
You're still mad that I didn't
accept money as your apology, aren't you?

43
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,120
Even if you refused my petty cash,
I couldn't care less.

44
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,560
And I don't owe you any apology.

45
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
You acted suspiciously from the beginning.

46
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,760
If Pete hadn't been the one to bring you,

47
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,040
I'd have kicked you out already.

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,480
Get out.

49
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,160
Why is the interview over so fast?

50
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,280
Aunt Kob said you were going
to be Kita's teacher.

51
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,560
But judging by the look on your face,
I'd say you didn't pass.

52
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,640
I haven't even said anything.
You can tell already?

53
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,560
It's not hard to guess
from your expression.

54
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,440
If you want the job,

55
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,360
I can help you.

56
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,240
What kind of work do you want?
How much salary are you looking for?

57
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,280
Then let me think about

58
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,000
what kind of job
and what kind of price I should ask for.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,720
Uh, wait.

60
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,440
Oh.

61
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,600
I'll give you a ride.

62
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,720
I already called a car.
It should be here soon.

63
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,200
Was it a coincidence,
or did she come here intentionally?

64
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,640
I apologize, Auntie,

65
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,040
for bringing someone
you didn't approve of.

66
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,520
It's fine. That's why
I came to pick someone myself.

67
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,680
Let's go with this teacher instead.

68
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,280
Alright.

69
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,920
Oh.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,840
Here she is. Teacher Ying.

71
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,440
This is Kita's test.

72
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,760
Kita is a very smart boy.

73
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,200
I believe homeschooling
won't be an issue at all.

74
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,560
Right.

75
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,000
This house will never know peace.

76
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,360
Nun.

77
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,000
By the way, where's Kita?

78
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,800
He's playing with his nanny
in the rec room.

79
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,840
Then let him enjoy himself a bit longer.

80
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,880
No need. That's a waste of time.
We need to get going.

81
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,120
Mom, now that Kita has a tutor,

82
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,280
why don't we have the teacher
drop him off at home?

83
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,000
We'll be late for our spa appointment.

84
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,360
And after that,
I have a date with Puth too.

85
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,360
- Oh.
- Whatever you say.

86
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,640
Kita, what's wrong?
Why did you stop walking?

87
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,520
Trying to get attention again?
We're in a hurry.

88
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,080
Hey, Kita.

89
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,480
You're getting rebellious, aren't you?

90
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,760
Why? just because you don't have a mother,
you're going to become a delinquent?

91
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,480
Come with me now.

92
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,120
I said come with me!

93
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,800
What's wrong?

94
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,640
What is it?

95
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,440
You're just as selfish as your mother.

96
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,760
Why?

97
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,680
Can't you give anything
to your husband or your child?

98
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,680
Why hold on to all those company shares?

99
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,560
You think you can
actually manage any of it?

100
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,960
Why are you crying, Kita?

101
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,640
Excuse me.

102
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,040
Kita, sweetheart, why are you crying?

103
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,320
Tell me, okay? What's wrong?

104
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,120
Hello? Ki, where are you? Come get Kita
right now. No one can handle him.

105
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,960
Quiet. Be quiet!

106
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,840
Be quiet right now.

107
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,799
I said be quiet!

108
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,880
Kita, what's wrong?

109
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,200
Come with me.

110
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,920
Stop right there. What gives you
the right to talk to my grandson?

111
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Kita, take a deep breath.

112
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,160
Count to ten with me, okay?

113
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,400
- Kita.
- Come on.

114
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,000
- One.
- One.

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
- Two.
- Two.

116
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,800
- Three, four.
- Four.

117
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,720
- Five.
- Five.

118
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,680
- Six, seven.
- Six, seven.

119
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,280
- Eight, nine, ten.
- Eight, nine, ten.

120
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,600
How do you feel?
Are you feeling better now?

121
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,480
Tell me. How are you feeling?

122
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,600
I feel bad for throwing
that thing at Grandma.

123
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,560
Why did you throw it?

124
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,520
I was angry at Grandma.

125
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,480
It's okay to be angry or upset.
That's not wrong.

126
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,960
What matters is how we deal with it.

127
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,520
We need to learn
how to manage our emotions.

128
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,160
Do you understand?

129
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,320
Yes.

130
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,120
Good job.

131
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,400
Now let me wipe your tears.

132
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Okay.

133
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,840
Good boy. No more crying, alright?

134
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,320
Hey.

135
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,760
Did you get a job at Pete's school?

136
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,920
If you want to thank me, just say so.

137
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,360
Where or whether I got a job
has nothing to do with you.

138
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,240
Or are you like Mrs. Sorn,

139
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,920
unable to say thank you and sorry?

140
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,680
Thank you for teaching Kita.

141
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,800
If we teach children,
then adults should be role models too.

142
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,840
Please let your mother know
to control herself

143
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,200
and her emotions when she's around Kita.

144
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,240
His behavior is affected by many things,

145
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,920
especially the sudden loss of a loved one.

146
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,880
And the emotions of adults around him
have a big impact.

147
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,240
I'll try to talk to Mom

148
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,160
about letting you tutor Kita.

149
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,320
Do you think you can?

150
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,920
You seem to follow her orders pretty well.

151
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,120
Maybe you even think

152
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,480
the same way she does.

153
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
You…

154
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,880
You're not mad at me, are you?
I'm just being honest.

155
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,800
Is your migraine acting up
because of stress?

156
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,880
I just took Kita out for a moment.

157
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,080
I thought nothing would happen,
but I was wrong.

158
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,680
And the moment something goes wrong,
that woman shows up again.

159
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,440
But Miss Ve was the only one
who could calm Kita down.

160
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,440
If we hired her to teach at home,

161
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,360
- it would--
- No way.

162
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,120
I'll never let her set foot
in this house again.

163
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,480
Mom.

164
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,600
What now?

165
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,880
Someone filmed us at Pete's school.

166
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,960
Be quiet!

167
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,960
I said be quiet!

168
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,480
There are almost 100,000 views now.

169
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,200
People are calling you names.

170
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,080
"Cruel old hag."

171
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,320
How could Pete let this clip
leak from his own school?

172
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,760
I'll call and complain to him myself.

173
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,160
So, what should we do, Mrs. Sorn?

174
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,640
Get the lawyers. Have the clip taken down.

175
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,960
If any sharer refuses to delete it,

176
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,760
sue them until they go bankrupt.

177
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,040
Yes.

178
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,400
- Mrs. Kanisorn!
- Mrs. Kanisorn, can we get an interview?

179
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,240
- You're not allowed in here!
- Please, just a quick interview.

180
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,000
‪-Please let us in. Excuse me.
‪-We need answers.

181
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,200
Who let the reporters in?

182
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,960
We tried to stop them.
We don't know how they got up here.

183
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,920
Is that clip of you
hurting your own grandson real?

184
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,600
Is that why you won't give an interview?

185
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,800
Violence in families,
especially involving children,

186
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,320
is something society takes very seriously.

187
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,400
You're all misunderstanding.

188
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,640
Why would I ever harm my own grandson?

189
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,120
But once the clip went public,

190
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,480
people began to question the image
of a high-level executive like you.

191
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,040
How are you going to handle this?

192
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,840
Or are you just going to sue people
into silence again?

193
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,800
What do you say?

194
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,720
I believe we need to
address the root cause.

195
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,920
Right now, my son

196
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
is dealing with
the trauma of losing his mother.

197
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,640
It's created a lot of stress for him.

198
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,320
But my mother has already hired
a qualified teacher to care for my son.

199
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,320
As you can see, we shouldn't judge
a situation just from a single video clip.

200
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,320
And my mother would never

201
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,640
use violence against my son.

202
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,200
This teacher seems to
really understand your grandson.

203
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,720
That's right.
And my mother personally selected her.

204
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,920
Mrs. Kanisorn,

205
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,880
you're handling corporate responsibilities
while closely caring for your grandson.

206
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,520
You truly are a commendable grandmother.

207
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,520
Thank you so much.
I've done my best to resolve this matter.

208
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,480
Please write the article in a way
that deescalates

209
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,160
the clip's impact. Can you do that?

210
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,280
Of course.

211
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,840
I spoke to Pete. He said you still haven't
taken a permanent job anywhere.

212
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,960
And so what?

213
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,480
I want you to take care of Kita.
I don't think Mom would oppose it now.

214
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,440
But I do.

215
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,240
You think I didn't see the article?

216
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,920
You did the interview in the morning.
By afternoon, it was published.

217
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,200
"Suttha Group CEO."

218
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,080
"No matter how heavy the workload,
still the perfect doting grandmother."

219
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,240
And there was a clip of me,
used without my consent.

220
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,000
But it was full of compliments, wasn't it?

221
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,800
You just used me
to help clean up your mother's image.

222
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,200
If you want more salary,

223
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,680
I'm happy to double
what Pete originally offered.

224
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,200
So in the end, you fix everything
with money, just like your mother.

225
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,120
I'm sorry.

226
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,000
I really want you to care for Kita.

227
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,280
You're the only one Kita allows near him.

228
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,840
The only one he listens to.

229
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,000
And I know you can help my son
become his cheerful self again.

230
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,440
If you want me
to really take care of Kita,

231
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,920
I'll need to move into your house.

232
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,240
You're moving into my house?

233
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,120
Yes.

234
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,200
MATHEMATICS

235
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,960
Mom.

236
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,400
Yes, dear?

237
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,920
Hm?

238
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,440
You're right on time.

239
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,960
You must be dying to move in here.

240
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,880
Well, I wanted
to move in as soon as possible.

241
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,960
What is your face made of?

242
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,800
How dare you shamelessly say you want to
live in someone else's house?

243
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,480
If I come live here quickly,

244
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Kita will have someone caring for him.
Isn't that a good thing?

245
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,880
Let me make one thing clear.

246
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,280
Neither I nor my mother
welcomes you into this house.

247
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,360
And if you make even a single mistake,

248
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,600
you'll be out of here immediately.

249
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,120
Thanks for the warning.

250
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,600
Now can I go to my room?

251
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
Sure. Aunt Kob.

252
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,640
Take Kita's teacher

253
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,320
to the maid's room.

254
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,600
What? You can't stay there?

255
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,720
Want the storage room instead?
I'll have someone clear it out for you.

256
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,840
I can stay anywhere on the first day.
We'll talk about the rest later.

257
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,520
Oh, and one more thing.
I won't be starting work today.

258
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,000
She talks like she can just
move anywhere she pleases.

259
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,280
She's really something, isn't she?

260
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,360
Look. She left her luggage
for me to carry.

261
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,280
That's why I disliked her from the start.

262
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,760
We might need to
keep our distance for a while.

263
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,480
Why?

264
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,080
There's an outsider in the house now.

265
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,640
I don't want trouble with my son.
You understand, right?

266
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,000
Because of Miss Ve?

267
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,200
Once the news about Kita settles down,

268
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,720
I'll find a way to get
that woman out of the house

269
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,160
so things can go back to normal, okay?

270
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,560
Mr. Ki knows you have a problem with her,

271
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,800
yet he is still insistent
on letting her stay

272
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,080
as if he wants to defy you.

273
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,760
Why would Ki want to do that?

274
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,000
Your son's grown up now.

275
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,280
No grown man wants to live
under his mother's thumb forever.

276
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,200
For all you know,

277
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,760
he might be eager
to take over the Suttha Group soon.

278
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,200
He's pushing back on everything you say.

279
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
Does your leg hurt?

280
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,920
Wearing heels always does this.
I came for some balm but no one's here.

281
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,840
Oh.

282
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,080
I didn't realize you lived here too.

283
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,400
I come and go.

284
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,680
If I finish work late, I just stay here.
Mrs. Kanisorn gave me permission.

285
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
Here.

286
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,560
Thank you.

287
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,520
You're quite the diligent assistant.

288
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,920
Seems like you do almost everything
for Mrs. Kanisorn.

289
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,520
Need help with that?

290
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Uh…

291
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,240
Well.

292
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,880
What are you two doing?

293
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,200
Oh.

294
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,640
She needed some balm,
so I grabbed it for her.

295
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,120
If there's nothing else, I'll head to bed.

296
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,560
What are you trying to do?

297
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,160
This is the person
meant to care for a child?

298
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,560
Sorry, but it's outside of work hours.

299
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,080
Let's not mix work with personal time.

300
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,800
And there's no law
that says I have to work 24 hours a day.

301
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,880
Don't use personal time as an excuse.

302
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,680
You're already showing
your true colors on day one.

303
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,000
I can see right through you.
You're the type that likes to seduce men.

304
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,800
Is that because
you're the same kind of woman?

305
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
I'll fire you.

306
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,760
Then let me talk to Mr. Ki first.

307
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,320
Before I go, I'd like him to know
that this all started

308
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,560
when I saw Mr. Napat leaving your bedroom
before he came to me.

309
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,960
And claiming you were
just discussing work in that outfit?

310
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,720
No one's buying it.

311
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,640
I came here to care for Kita.

312
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,680
If you want to fire me
for failing at my job, go ahead.

313
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,040
But if you're firing me
before I even start,

314
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,920
then I…

315
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,120
Then what? What do you want?

316
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,560
Just let me do the job you hired me for.

317
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,280
Let's pretend today didn't happen.

318
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,240
I saw nothing. You saw nothing.

319
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,960
Deal.

320
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,680
Wait.

321
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,040
Tomorrow, I'd like to move
into the guest room, not the maid's room.

322
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,280
Mom. Mom.

323
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,280
I'm going to tell Dad
you stole Mom's stuff.

324
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,920
Stole what? I didn't steal anything.
I was just trying them on.

325
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,440
But you took Mom's clothes out
and hid her jewelry.

326
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,520
You were going to steal them.

327
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,080
You're accusing me?

328
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,960
You think Terd will believe you over me?

329
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,160
Daddy! Someone stole--

330
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,440
- What's going on, ma'am?
- Is anyone home?

331
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,480
No, ma'am. They're all out right now.

332
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,720
Good.

333
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,160
You're something, you brat.

334
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,560
If you dare run to Terd,
don't say I didn't warn you.

335
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,440
I'll tell him
what you've done behind his back,

336
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,920
to me and to Mom.
You don't belong in this house.

337
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,200
You mouthy little…

338
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,160
What are you doing?

339
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,280
If Mr. Terd asks, say she hurt herself.

340
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,960
Yes, ma'am.

341
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,120
Where is she?

342
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,240
She already moved into the new room.
But why would you

343
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,080
- agree to--
- Serve the coffee.

344
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,440
Yes, I'll go get it.

345
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,840
Here it is. I'll take care of it.

346
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,840
Ah!

347
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,560
Mrs. Sorn, are you okay?

348
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,680
It's alright. The coffee wasn't that hot.

349
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,800
I'm so sorry. It was clumsy of me.

350
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,600
But if it had been freshly boiled,
you might've gotten burned.

351
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,360
- I'll clean it up for you.
- No need.

352
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,800
What happened to Mom?

353
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,560
I accidentally spilled coffee on her.

354
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,760
Thankfully, it wasn't hot.
I'll go reheat it for you.

355
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,160
Oh, no need.

356
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,520
I hired you to be Kita's teacher.
You don't have to do things like this.

357
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,440
You should be sitting down, eating,
and then doing your job.

358
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,160
But I'm not really hungry.

359
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,680
Well, now that
you've adjusted to working here,

360
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,640
you'll need to adjust
your meal schedule too.

361
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,560
I eat breakfast at this time.

362
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,680
Eat now.

363
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,840
Kita's waiting.

364
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,840
Mom.

365
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,800
Hm?

366
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,000
Ugh.

367
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,080
I just found out
you arranged a room for her.

368
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,760
Did she put
some spell on you or something?

369
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,480
Mrs. Sorn probably just wants me
well-rested so I can perform well.

370
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,160
Thank you so much.

371
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,960
You look gorgeous today.

372
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,840
Prae, what about the thing
I asked you to handle?

373
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,800
I uploaded the story last night.
The view count's looking good.

374
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,480
The clasp is broken. Can you help fix it?

375
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,360
Please allow me to take a look.

376
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,080
Yes, the clasp is broken.

377
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,880
It was ordered under the name Kitinee.

378
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,000
What name?

379
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,400
Well, the system still shows it as

380
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,880
a bracelet ordered by Mrs. Kitinee, so I…

381
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,440
How outdated is that info?
Why wasn't it updated?

382
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,080
What a shame.
I've been a customer for years.

383
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,320
Maybe it's time I found a new place.

384
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,520
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.

385
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,400
You may leave.

386
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,440
- Mom.
- Hm?

387
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,880
Have you seen the news about Dad?

388
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,240
What news?

389
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,240
‪MURDER SUSPECTED AS REAL CAUSE
‪OF TYCOON TERDTHONG'S DEATH

390
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,000
Is something wrong, Mrs. Sorn?

391
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,440
Find out who posted that article.

392
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,560
Yes, ma'am.

393
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,880
This time, I won't let it go.

394
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,800
This is too much!

395
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,600
How could they report
that Mr. Terd was murdered?!

396
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,600
You're my lawyer. Be ready
to drag whoever spread this to jail.

397
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,680
That might be hard, Mom.

398
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,600
The article came from a fake news site

399
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,160
based overseas.

400
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,680
Tracking the source
will be extremely difficult.

401
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,480
But it's not true, right, Mom?

402
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,400
The news about Dad being murdered is fake.

403
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,920
How could it possibly be true?

404
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,520
If it's not true, you don't need to worry.

405
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,760
Fake news about public figures

406
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,400
is normal. It'll blow over.

407
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,440
Who knows?

408
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,120
There are plenty of idiots
who can't tell fake news from real news.

409
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,320
I won't let this tarnish
the company's reputation.

410
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,320
I won't let it go this time.

411
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,400
We'll find whoever spread it
and have them jailed.

412
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,480
Teacher Ve.

413
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,120
- Yes? All done?
- Yes.

414
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,800
Let's see…

415
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,400
Seven…

416
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,200
Hmm.

417
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,440
Every answer is correct.

418
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,440
Were you rushing so you could go swim?

419
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,920
- Yes.
- Okay, let's go then.

420
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Be careful, alright?

421
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,680
Are you Kita's new teacher?

422
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,960
Kita, say hello to her.

423
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,720
You're Miss Ploy,
Ms. Gingyok's younger sister, right?

424
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,760
You did your research, I see.
You even know who I am.

425
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,760
Kita, Auntie Ploy brought a brand-new
tablet for you. Do you like it?

426
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,480
I've missed…

427
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,360
Don't you like it, Kita?

428
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,239
I brought something for you too, Kita.

429
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,360
If Nun hadn't called me,

430
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,880
I wouldn't have believed
that you were teaching Kita.

431
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,320
What a coincidence.

432
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,840
Or did you do it on purpose?

433
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,280
Kita has swim lessons now.
Please excuse us.

434
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,040
Come on, let's go. Slowly now.

435
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,360
Wait. I came here today to spend time
with him. I'll take care of Kita.

436
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,280
And you, go buy some snacks.

437
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,880
Take it.

438
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,160
Don't worry about Kirin firing you.
I'll talk to him.

439
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,600
But if you don't go, I'll fire you myself.

440
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,440
Showing off, huh?

441
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,560
Well, I am Kita's aunt.

442
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,480
Not some stranger like someone here.

443
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,040
Let's go swimming, Kita.

444
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,280
Auntie Ploy's great at swimming.
I'll help you learn. Come on.

445
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,520
Nun has a lot of swimsuits,
so she let me borrow one of them.

446
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,560
Lots of people to play with Kita. How fun!

447
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,960
You can go now.
I'll take care of my nephew.

448
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,400
Yes, ma'am.

449
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,040
- Ki.
- You arrived?

450
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,280
Ki.

451
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,400
- I'm walking there. Wait a sec.
- Ki.

452
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,400
Maybe he walked right past you

453
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,360
because he thought
you were a plank of wood. Whoops!

454
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,360
Or maybe he saw the mile marker in the way

455
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,720
and just walked past it.

456
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,520
- Hey!
- Why?

457
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,560
I thought you were taking me
to relax and enjoy the poolside view.

458
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,240
So, who are you going to pick?

459
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,840
Your sister-in-law…

460
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,400
or the one your mom favors?

461
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,760
I called you here to talk
about Kita's teacher.

462
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,120
Nothing else.

463
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,960
Okay.

464
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,360
Ask away, then.

465
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,760
I want to know about the one
you sent to take care of my son.

466
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,520
Who is she really?

467
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,000
Miss Ve's parents live in New Zealand.

468
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,080
I met her in Auckland

469
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,600
while I was on a research trip
for the early childhood center.

470
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,560
She seemed to really understand kids,

471
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,120
so I asked her to work with me

472
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,600
if she ever returned to Thailand.

473
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,960
That's it?

474
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,200
Yeah, that's it.

475
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,960
Why? What's your concern?

476
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,360
I picked the best possible teacher
for Kita, you know. Why worry?

477
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,160
You've seen it yourself.
She handles Kita really well.

478
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,760
Aunt Kob, where's Kita?

479
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,760
He's with Miss Ploy
and Miss Mint by the pool.

480
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,000
Could you bring this to the pool for me?

481
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,720
I'm busy. Can't you see?

482
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,520
Kita, do you want to swim with Auntie?

483
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,840
Don't worry. I'll hold you up. Let's play.

484
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,840
He clearly doesn't want to interact,
yet you still force yourself on him.

485
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,000
Do you want to be an aunt or a mother?

486
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
What's that supposed to mean?

487
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,520
Why? Am I right?

488
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,960
Are you? Alright!

489
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,680
- Let go of me!
- Let go!

490
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,280
<i>Wanvela must leave this house.</i>

491
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,200
- If I ask--
- I won't change my mind.

492
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,960
<i>And what if I ask you, Mrs. Sorn?</i>

493
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,920
<i>You're an orphan,</i>

494
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,520
but you left that out
on your job application

495
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,960
as if you wanted to hide it.

496
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,760
<i>She's trying to use your past</i>
<i>to force you into working for her?</i>

497
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,640
Or maybe Mrs. Manee
suspects something about Ms. Gingyok?

498
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,640
Do you think I should
make friends instead of enemies?

499
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,360
<i>Let me know the time and place.</i>
