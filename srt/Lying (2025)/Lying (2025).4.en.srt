1
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,880
<i>Or maybe Mrs. Manee</i>
<i>suspects something about Ms. Gingyok?</i>

2
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,680
But then I found out she transferred
all her shares in Jade Biz

3
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,920
to Kirin.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,760
So I started thinking
that maybe Ging's death

5
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,440
wasn't so natural after all.

6
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,040
<i>Why would I mix up the thing about Hathai…</i>

7
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,800
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
<i>…and Teacher Ve?</i>

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,960
If Jit hadn't resigned,

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,840
she would've been
the closest person to Mrs. Sorn.

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,960
<i>Why did Jit resign?</i>

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,680
<i>Ask Mr. Pat.</i>

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,040
<i>Everyone, please remain calm.</i>

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,360
We'll now begin ID and bag checks.

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,520
Please cooperate.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,120
- Hey.
- Where are you going?

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,080
- Someone, block the back entrance.
- Get Yot out of here.

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,920
Before the cops find him.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,920
- Yes, sir.
- I’ll handle this myself.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,400
- Yes, sir. Let's go.
- Let's go.

21
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,080
Good evening, officers.

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,040
I believe we can talk this out.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,160
I’m just doing my duty.

24
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,480
If nothing illegal is happening here,
you’ve got nothing to worry about.

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
This doesn’t look good.

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,480
What? Where did Ki go?

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,520
Mr. Pat stomped him so hard. Is he dead?

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,200
Where should we take him?

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,120
Let’s take him to the hospital!

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,360
- Let's go.
- Go.

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Wait.

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,800
Pete?

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,720
What the hell are you doing here?

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,840
Come with me.

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,240
Now.

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,720
I told you to come with me,

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,600
not run off alone like this.

38
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,040
Soon the reporters
will flood the front of the place.

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,560
I didn’t run.

40
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,160
And what about Napat?

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,880
He got taken in.

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,680
Looks like this time it’s serious.

43
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,000
There were tons
of underage kids in the bar.

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,640
And who knows what else they’ll find.

45
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,320
Bag check, please.

46
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,840
And Miss…

47
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,880
What did you say?

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,720
Besides Napat,

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,360
did the police let anyone else leave?

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,040
Nope.

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,120
Even after checking my ID,
I still had to wait.

52
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,360
You suspect something?

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,240
Nothing.

54
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,680
You sure it’s nothing?

55
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,800
Yeah.

56
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,680
I think you and your mom

57
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,520
are going to be
in big trouble with this bar.

58
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,920
What your guy did was serious.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,320
Aren’t you going to do anything?

60
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,120
What do you want me to do?

61
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,080
I don’t want him in and out of this house,

62
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,600
and involved in the company anymore.

63
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,080
Pat has worked with me for years.

64
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,280
He’s always helped me, and you know that.

65
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,680
He’s known you since you were a child, Ki.

66
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,880
But he broke the law.

67
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,680
He seriously hurt someone.

68
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,280
And he lied to someone who trusted him.

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,960
It’s not that big of a deal.

70
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,680
Alright, I understand.

71
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,680
You’re worried about the company’s name,

72
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,000
about our family’s reputation.

73
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,360
But don’t worry. I’ll handle it.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,520
With your money again, right?

75
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,520
You’re protecting

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,480
someone who’s been hiding things from you.

77
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,959
Today it might be a small issue,

78
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,760
but next time
it could be something bigger.

79
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,800
That’s enough, Ki.

80
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Stop trying to drive a wedge
between me and Pat.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,640
If I were that easy to fool,

82
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,960
we wouldn’t have made it
this far as a family.

83
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,280
You should know that.

84
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,360
Mom.

85
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,760
Looks like Mr. Napat
means a lot to Mrs. Sorn.

86
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,440
Even her son’s words
don’t carry any weight.

87
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,400
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,920
I didn’t mean to eavesdrop.
I just happened to pass by.

89
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,400
When did you get back?

90
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,320
A bit before you. I’ll head to bed now.

91
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,160
I want to know how you got out.

92
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,560
The police weren’t letting anyone leave.

93
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,600
And you disappeared.

94
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,520
Did you vanish into thin air or something?

95
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,840
Why should I tell you?

96
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,080
I just want to know

97
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,040
what trick you used to escape.

98
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,200
Maybe I can use it too.

99
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,040
Or maybe you’re so well-connected

100
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,680
the police wouldn’t dare hold you.

101
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
If someone got out
before the cops allowed it,

102
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,680
what do you think that means?

103
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
I think there’s only one reason.

104
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
They must’ve been
the one who tipped off the police.

105
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,040
That’s how they got out first.

106
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,920
You should worry more
about you and your mom.

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,400
When you wake up,
tomorrow’s headlines might surprise you.

108
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,160
Don’t forget
money can’t silence every scandal forever.

109
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,680
Sounds like you want this
to become big news.

110
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,120
I’m just saying, just in case.

111
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,640
Nothing in this world is certain, Mr. Ki.

112
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,040
Even people we love and trust

113
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,200
can hurt us deeply.

114
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,280
You should understand that well.

115
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,040
I do.

116
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,040
And I’ll make sure the person I love

117
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,720
understands my love and care someday.

118
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,160
FAMOUS CLUB RAIDED, OPEN UNTIL DAWN,
PACKED WITH DRUGS

119
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,680
The news
didn’t mention you at all, Mrs. Sorn.

120
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,360
Thanks.

121
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,440
I told you it’s nothing.

122
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,560
It didn’t even mention my name.

123
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,400
Good. I just don’t want this
causing problems between you and Ki.

124
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,480
Just don’t let
something like this happen again.

125
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,240
Don’t worry. I won’t let it happen again.

126
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,520
And I’ll find out

127
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,600
who tipped off the cops to raid my bar.

128
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,200
FAMOUS CLUB RAIDED, OPEN UNTIL DAWN,
PACKED WITH DRUGS

129
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,480
So last night’s incident
isn’t making headlines?

130
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,920
Are you relieved it’s not big news

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,960
or are you disappointed?

132
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,240
Of course I’m relieved.
I don’t want to be in the news.

133
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,080
And I don’t want to lose my job either.

134
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,120
But the kids at my bar

135
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,440
said the cops let you out first.

136
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,679
What does that mean?

137
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,400
You were the one
who called the police, weren’t you?

138
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,840
I happened to know someone
who helped me out.

139
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,160
So I got out early.

140
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,560
But

141
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,320
I saw Mr. Ki
and Mrs. Sorn arguing about you.

142
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,800
It seems like
Mr. Ki really doesn’t like you.

143
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,680
He’s trying to nitpick about you.

144
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,880
Could it have been him?

145
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,400
That teacher Ve.

146
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,960
Since when was she close with Napat?

147
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,720
Ki, are you done with your meeting?

148
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah.

149
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,840
Then let’s get lunch.

150
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,000
You're meeting someone else?
Is that why you came all the way here?

151
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,200
Who else would it be? It's just Mint.

152
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,480
Well, you’re free now. Come with me.

153
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,200
Nun, stop playing matchmaker.

154
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,600
I’ve still got work to do.

155
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,280
But it’s just lunch.
And I already told Mint.

156
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,520
I'm busy.

157
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,640
Once I finish my work, I have to go back
and look after Kita.

158
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,800
Then please take care
of your Teacher Ve too.

159
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,040
Did you have a fight with her?

160
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,320
I wouldn’t lower myself
to get into it with her.

161
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,120
But I just felt like something was off,

162
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,960
so I thought I’d let you know.

163
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,720
What is it?

164
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,520
That teacher and Napat

165
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,000
seem a bit too close.

166
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,760
I don’t know.

167
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,320
Maybe she’s trying to charm him
to boost her own image.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,400
Are you just imagining things?

169
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,640
I’m not dumb. I can read people.

170
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,560
I even figured out things
about Mom and Napat.

171
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,680
I just don't want to say it.

172
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,440
I didn’t want to get scolded.

173
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,680
If what you said about her and that guy
is true, it would be a good thing.

174
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,280
I kind of want it to be true too.

175
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,320
Why?

176
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,400
Because I want Mom to see

177
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,360
that guy’s never been
sincere or loyal to her.

178
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,280
Behind her back, he’s ready
to chase after other women anytime,

179
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,040
even someone in the same house.

180
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,800
So that’s why

181
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,480
you won’t let Teacher Ve leave this house.

182
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,240
If she manages to make Mom
kick Napat out of our lives,

183
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,040
then she’s no longer useful to us.

184
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,440
Kita seems to be
in a really good mood today.

185
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,760
Art allows children to express themselves.

186
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,600
If they get to do something they love,

187
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,400
their emotional state
will shift in a positive direction.

188
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,680
Kita probably enjoys drawing.

189
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,240
That’s why he’s happy.

190
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,000
If anyone saw this,
they’d probably admire you

191
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,040
for how well you take care of Kita.

192
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,480
What are you trying to say?

193
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
I just came to give you a warning.

194
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,920
Even if you’re doing a good job with Kita,

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,720
it doesn’t mean

196
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,720
you can stay here as long as you think.

197
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,960
Especially if you get close
to the wrong person.

198
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,480
Thanks for the warning.

199
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,960
But I came here to work,

200
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,920
not to get close to anyone.

201
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,640
But if someone
turns out to be useful to me,

202
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,560
I might consider getting close to them.

203
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,800
Kita, once you’re done with the drawing,
let’s do math next, okay?

204
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,240
Kita.

205
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,280
Let me stay with you, okay? I want to know

206
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,440
what you’re learning.

207
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,400
You’re not just trying
to catch me doing something wrong?

208
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,400
I just want to be near my son.

209
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,960
Is there anything wrong with that?

210
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,200
Here.

211
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,160
- Dad.
- Hm? Yes?

212
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,200
You want me to look at this drawing?

213
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,120
Yes.

214
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,680
Oh, this one’s me, you, and…

215
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,520
Mom, right?

216
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,520
Did I say something wrong?

217
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,720
That’s Teacher Ve.

218
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,960
This is me, you, and

219
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,080
Teacher Ve?

220
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,080
Yes.

221
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,960
Kita,

222
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,400
you’re smiling.

223
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,840
Mom.

224
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,000
Why did you draw
Teacher Ve with your dad, Kita?

225
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,680
Did she tell you to do that?

226
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,960
Mom, it’s just a drawing.
And when he drew it,

227
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,240
I was there with him.

228
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,680
Think more critically, Ki.

229
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,280
Kids don’t just draw
other women instead of their moms

230
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,240
unless someone tells them to.

231
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,800
What is she trying to do?

232
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,160
Kita, don't draw anything like this again.

233
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,240
Understand?

234
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,760
Kita.

235
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,280
Kita.

236
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,480
Mom.

237
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,400
It’s just a drawing. Why are you
making such a big deal about it?

238
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,960
Of course I should be worried.

239
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,560
The other day Mint came over
and said some odd things to me.

240
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,800
What did she say?

241
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,840
Nothing direct.

242
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,280
Because Ki was there.

243
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But thinking about it, it’s like she was
trying to warn me about Teacher Ve.

244
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,720
Lately she’s gotten really close to Kita.

245
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,320
She might be using him as a bridge.

246
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,360
Even if she does have feelings for Ki,

247
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,520
he doesn’t care.

248
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,160
How can you be so sure?

249
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,680
Because Ki’s
never shown interest in anyone,

250
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,320
not Mint, not Ploy.

251
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
A plain girl like Teacher Ve

252
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,000
has nothing special.
Why would Ki be interested?

253
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,440
Eight, nine, ten.

254
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,760
Are you feeling better?

255
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,840
Great job.

256
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,040
You did much better than last time.

257
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,600
You didn’t throw a tantrum
or snap at Grandma.

258
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,560
Let’s go wash your face.

259
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,920
- Okay.
- Come on.

260
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,200
Kita.

261
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,120
Is this your mom?

262
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,240
And this is Grandma?

263
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,640
Wow, you drew this so well. Great job!

264
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,480
Go wait for me in the bathroom, okay?

265
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,680
Oh, Mr. Ki.

266
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,200
Where’s Kita?

267
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,200
Waiting to take a bath.

268
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,119
How is he doing?

269
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,760
Better. This time he managed his emotions
better than before.

270
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,720
Oh.

271
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,520
You’ve been with Kita all day,

272
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,720
even helping with his emotions.

273
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,000
I’ll take over from here. You should rest.

274
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,840
Alright.

275
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,320
I made you some tea.

276
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,560
It’s herbal, good for stress relief.

277
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,240
I didn’t ask for it.

278
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,600
Let’s just say it’s a gesture of care
from someone living under the same roof.

279
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,040
You used the wrong words.

280
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,080
This is my house.

281
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,920
But you

282
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,960
are just someone hired to work here.

283
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,080
Whatever you say. I don't mind.

284
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,560
Besides the tea,
I wanted to update you on Kita’s lessons.

285
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,720
Then speak.

286
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,760
Here.

287
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,720
I noticed
you were upset that Kita drew me.

288
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,880
So I wanted to explain.

289
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,000
Just because he drew me
doesn’t mean I’m important.

290
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,280
He also drew a lot of pictures
of Ms. Gingyok

291
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,400
and you, Mrs. Sorn.

292
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,680
When I asked him,

293
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,760
he said those were Ms. Gingyok and you.

294
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,240
I heard Ms. Gingyok was sick and frail.

295
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,640
Kita probably sees how well
you took care of her, so he drew that.

296
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,840
That might be true.

297
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,520
Anyway, I’m not too bothered
that my grandson drew you.

298
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,920
Because

299
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,480
outsiders can never be
more important than family.

300
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,760
That’s not always true.

301
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,920
Some outsiders deceive their way
to a position of importance,

302
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,040
robbing family members
of their love and trust in each other.

303
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I’m sure you’ve encountered
people like that before.

304
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,280
I won't bother you anymore.

305
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,720
I’m sure you have
many other things to deal with.

306
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,560
So you’re suspicious
about the picture Kita drew?

307
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,640
Yeah, but maybe I’m just overthinking.

308
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,160
Kids are like that.
They draw from their daily life,

309
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,120
what they see
and who they’re familiar with.

310
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,760
Don’t tell me you’re thinking
of helping Mrs. Manee now?

311
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,320
Is that why
your detective instincts are firing off?

312
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,240
Here.

313
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
One thing at a time.

314
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,320
We can't even expose Napat yet.

315
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,680
Well, they spent that much money.
How could he not get away?

316
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,000
I seriously want to know

317
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,080
how much money Mrs. Kanisorn
has already spent on that Napat guy.

318
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah, probably a lot.

319
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,280
But I’m telling you,

320
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,160
this is not the end.

321
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,280
I'm itching to get started.

322
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,400
Alright.

323
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,240
Here.

324
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,520
- Hey.
- Eat more.

325
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,680
The info’s solid, no fakes for sure.

326
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,160
I’m counting on you.

327
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,320
Got it.
If it’s solid, I’ll take care of it.

328
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,880
What’s going on?

329
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,960
Nothing.

330
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,360
I just recognized
the face of that woman earlier.

331
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,360
But I can’t remember where I’ve seen her.

332
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,760
So why did you ask me to meet?

333
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,920
I wanted to ask about Miss Ve.
How’s her work been?

334
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,840
In case I can help
solve things from my side too.

335
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,760
You're helping me, or her?

336
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,360
Both, obviously.

337
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,960
You’re my friend.

338
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,040
And she’s a colleague.

339
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,240
I even called Miss Ve,

340
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,160
asked her how she’s been

341
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,120
and told her I’d be meeting you today.

342
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,600
To get both sides of the story.

343
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,360
And what did she say?

344
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,200
I just got the proof that

345
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,000
the CEO of the Suttha Group

346
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,880
is the primary financier behind
the nightclub recently in the headlines.

347
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,240
I checked it. It looks real.

348
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,920
Editor, should I run with this story?

349
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,400
Mom, I overheard the reporter say

350
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,600
they’ve got evidence that you
are behind Napat’s bar.

351
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,120
I’ve already handed over
the info to my senior reporter.

352
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,200
And Mr. Ki showed up at the place
exactly as you said he would.

353
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,720
He’s probably already
reported back to his mom.

354
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,080
You take care of the rest now.

355
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,200
Thanks a lot, Prae.

356
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,280
Don’t worry. I’ll handle this myself.

357
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,200
Forget whatever Mr. Ki heard.

358
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Handle it?

359
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,200
And if the evidence
they talked about is real?

360
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,160
How are you going to handle it?

361
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,960
Mom.

362
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,320
Are we in trouble again?

363
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,400
Go home. I’ll take care of this.

364
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,280
And how many more problems are you
going to keep cleaning up after Napat?

365
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,240
And what if this one

366
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,760
can't be fixed?

367
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,920
Mrs. Sorn, the press
is back at our company again.

368
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,760
Bring them to the conference room.

369
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,480
I’ll do the press conference myself.

370
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,400
Yes, ma'am.

371
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,680
What are you going to tell them?

372
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,560
You’ll see soon enough.

373
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,240
Mom's talking to the press herself?

374
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,280
Yeah, but she didn’t tell me anything.

375
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,920
She just went off
and talked to Napat alone.

376
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,440
Excuse me.

377
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,440
Why are you here?

378
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,680
I went to get Ms. Nun’s necklace changed.

379
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,160
Someone said she was in here,
so I came in.

380
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,880
Is there some press event happening?
Why are there reporters everywhere?

381
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,480
This has nothing to do with you.
You can leave now.

382
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,480
Here she comes.

383
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,240
Mrs. Sorn is here.

384
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,880
Since everyone’s gathered,

385
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,560
let me give you
the full story all at once, in detail.

386
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,120
So the news about you being the investor
behind the bar under investigation,

387
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,480
is it true?

388
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,520
Yes, it’s true.

389
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,520
But I’ll let the actual owner
of the business explain the details.

390
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,560
I’m the one who asked Mrs. Sorn

391
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,520
to help invest in opening the bar.

392
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,400
She kindly helped

393
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,000
because I’d been working
at the company for a long time.

394
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,720
It was my mistake

395
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,640
to trust an outsider to manage the place,

396
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,360
which led to scandal
and damaged Mrs. Sorn's reputation.

397
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,040
I sincerely apologize.

398
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,800
I didn’t know anything about what happened

399
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,400
and didn’t mean to cover anything up.

400
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,880
The bar has been shut down,

401
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,720
and I’ve handed over the perpetrator

402
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,560
to face legal consequences.

403
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,200
Well, I guess this wraps it up nicely.

404
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,680
Mom wasn’t really involved.

405
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,400
She just put up the money.

406
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,120
And Napat gets off the hook again.

407
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,920
He let someone else take the fall.

408
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,600
I hope no one’s going to
question this anymore.

409
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,480
I’m a straightforward person.

410
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,840
Anyone who makes a mistake
must take responsibility.

411
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,200
I would never cover up for anyone.

412
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,080
And what about the death of our son?

413
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,320
Who will take responsibility for that?

414
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,720
- Oh?
- Who’s that?

415
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Yot, my son.

416
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,440
Why did your life end so soon?

417
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
My son.

418
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,240
Why did someone have to hurt you
and kill you?

419
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,160
- Who killed him?
- Who was it?

420
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,680
Who’s that, Ki?

421
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,080
That night,
someone was assaulted so badly,

422
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,440
but I didn’t think he'd died.

423
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,360
That night, my son went to that bar.

424
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,960
He was beaten until he was gravely injured

425
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,560
and then he died!

426
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,760
But there was no news.

427
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,320
No one tried to bring
the culprit to justice.

428
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,680
We’re here to demand justice for our son.

429
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,840
We won’t let him die in vain.

430
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,840
We’ll make sure someone pays!

431
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,800
Hey!
Don’t go around saying crap like that.

432
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,280
You don’t even have proof.

433
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,000
Someone else may have hurt him.
And you're trying to frame me?!

434
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,400
Even if you're old, I could sue you!

435
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,640
We wouldn’t be here
if we didn’t have proof.

436
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,600
Huh.

437
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,280
<i>Here!</i>

438
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,840
<i>You've got a smart mouth, huh?</i>

439
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,320
‪What was that?

440
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,680
Didn’t you say you had outsiders
running the bar, Mr. Napat?

441
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,560
But this video doesn’t
look like that’s the case.

442
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,240
The guy who attacked
the victim looks a lot like you.

443
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,160
That’s not me in the video.
I didn’t do it. I don’t know anything!

444
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,680
- Liar! It was you!
- Hey, what the hell?!

445
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,640
You killed my son! You killed him!

446
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,120
Somebody stop this!

447
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,320
- Help me! Help! Hold them back!
- You monster!

448
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,880
This is a disaster.

449
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,680
There’s been a death,
and there’s video evidence.

450
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,840
I don’t know how I can help you anymore!

451
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,840
Help me?

452
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,200
You're saving yourself. You had me
say it had nothing to do with you.

453
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,760
I already did that.

454
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,480
Even though someone died,
you’re in the clear now.

455
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,760
Try using your brain for once.

456
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,560
If my reputation gets ruined too,
then what?

457
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,480
Think for once, who am I, and who are you?

458
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,640
I’ve always been
the one helping you, haven’t I?

459
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,480
Or should I just shout it out loud

460
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,400
that I’m more than just your assistant?

461
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,000
Anyway, I’ll handle this myself.

462
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,240
I’ll find out

463
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,920
who recorded that clip
and caused all this mess.

464
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,120
What about the reporters?

465
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,960
They’ve all left.

466
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,320
I’ll try my best
to make sure no more bad press

467
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,280
gets out about the company or you, Mom.

468
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,040
Mom.

469
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,800
Mom, I think

470
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,600
you should go home and get some rest.
I’ll take you.

471
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,320
Okay, let’s go, dear.

472
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Let's go.

473
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,920
Who the hell are you guys?
Why are you doing this to me?

474
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,240
It was you, wasn’t it?

475
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,000
The one who started that report about me.

476
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,760
Where did you get that evidence?

477
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,640
I don’t know anything.
I… I was just doing my job.

478
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,000
Hey!

479
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,920
Who gave you that evidence?

480
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,160
I can’t say. I can’t reveal my source.

481
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
You can’t, huh?

482
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,080
Wait, wait!

483
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,480
- I’ll tell you.
- Who?

484
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,320
It’s…

485
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,040
my… my junior colleague.

486
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,480
- Name?
- She's a reporter too.

487
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,960
Her name is…

488
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,040
Praepai.

489
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,960
Beat him up.

490
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,240
Hey, no, please.

491
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,800
Please don’t!

492
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,600
- Don't hurt me!
- Praepai.

493
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,400
‪Please forgive me!

494
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,240
Do you think
we can really go against them?

495
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,920
The police said the clip
might not hold up as evidence.

496
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,240
It’s not enough
to prove my son died because of him.

497
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,440
Please don’t worry.

498
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,520
Even if that clip can’t be used to convict
the person who hurt your son,

499
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,760
I promise
I’ll keep fighting this case for you.

500
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,880
Thank you so much.

501
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,320
Someone already called
and threatened us to drop it.

502
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,320
You need to be careful too.

503
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,159
Don’t worry about me.

504
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,679
You should go inside now. And please

505
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,000
send my regards to your husband.

506
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,520
- I will.
- Thank you.

507
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,080
You’re the reporter
named Praepai, aren’t you?

508
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,679
Hey.

509
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,760
Where do you think you’re going, girl?

510
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,360
Go.

511
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,679
We’ve got her, boss.

512
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,719
We're taking her back to the bar now.

513
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,120
Follow her!

514
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
I'm going! Stop right there!

515
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,760
Hey, stop!

516
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,840
Tough girl, huh?

517
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,920
You won’t cooperate
until you get roughed up?

518
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,040
Come here!

519
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,760
Who the hell was that?!

520
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,240
Ve.

521
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,160
Let’s go.

522
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,600
Can you walk?

523
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,000
Sorry, boss.

524
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,240
Someone helped her. They were
covered up, so I couldn’t see who it was.

525
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,280
Damn it!

526
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,080
Ugh!

527
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,520
You all suck!

528
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,160
That reporter girl

529
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,800
must be working with someone.

530
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,800
I saw Mr. Ki
with Mrs. Sorn arguing about you.

531
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,720
It seems like
Mr. Ki really doesn’t like you.

532
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,640
He’s trying to nitpick about you.

533
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
Could it be Ki?

534
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,960
Did Napat really send people here
to find Prae?

535
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,840
I can’t step out the front door now.

536
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,640
Here.

537
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,480
They followed you all the way home.

538
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,080
They didn’t break in, probably
afraid someone would call the cops.

539
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,840
So I escaped out the back.

540
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,680
I think I’ll have to hide for a while.

541
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,400
But you need to be careful too, Ve,

542
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,040
even though
they don’t know who you are yet.

543
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,440
Let me know
when you’re somewhere safe, okay?

544
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,120
Alright. Oh, anyway,

545
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,400
I got the number of the doctor
who took care of Ms. Gingyok.

546
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,920
Thanks so much. I’ll reach out to him.

547
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,280
Take care of yourself, alright?

548
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,880
Miss Ve.

549
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,680
What are you doing here?

550
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,760
I came to see a friend.
I was just about to leave.

551
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,200
You sure have a lot of friends.

552
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,240
Most of your business
seems to be meeting friends.

553
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,200
Anyway, I’m heading home. Get in the car.

554
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,360
It’s fine. I can go by myself.

555
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,280
Why?

556
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,920
You afraid I’ll question you

557
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,920
until some secret slips out?
Is that why you refuse?

558
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,600
I don’t have any secrets.

559
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,640
Then get in the car.

560
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,120
The day Yot's parents confronted Napat,

561
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,760
you didn’t seem shocked at all.

562
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,840
Almost like you knew they were coming.

563
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,280
Well, they didn’t come to hurt me.

564
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,600
So I stayed calm.

565
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,080
I didn’t get too startled.

566
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,000
But what about you?

567
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,560
You should be worried about your mom.
Yet you still have time to interrogate me?

568
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,120
This sounds like prejudice to me.

569
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,040
You’re smart.

570
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,160
You always talk your way out of anything.

571
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,160
But don’t worry.

572
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,280
I’ve got someone looking into

573
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,320
who gave that clip
of Yot’s assault to his parents.

574
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,560
When we find out, we’ll see

575
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,480
whether or not I’m prejudiced.

576
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,800
What is it?

577
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,720
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

578
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
<i>I was ambushed by a dog,</i>

579
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,240
<i>one that lives inside the house,</i>
<i>so I didn't see it coming.</i>

580
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,200
Who are you calling a dog?

581
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,720
The person who intentionally
attacked me, obviously.

582
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,480
Shame I couldn't catch them.

583
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,400
<i>Miss Nun, help me.</i>

584
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,920
<i>Mr. Napat went into my room.</i>

585
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,760
It's more exciting to do it
in someone else’s house?

586
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,880
NEXT EPISODE

587
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,000
<i>You said you were just here</i>
<i>to investigate your father's death</i>

588
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,720
Why go this far?

589
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,320
Don’t worry about me.

590
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,440
<i>I promise I won't say a word.</i>

591
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,000
