1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,240
For someone who has almost nothing left,

2
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,200
I think this is more than generous.

3
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,400
<i>Then you better know this.</i>

4
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,200
<i>In love,</i>
<i>the one who loves first always loses.</i>

5
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,960
<i>So in the end, I'll lose</i>

6
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
and I'll be left broken, huh?

7
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,720
This is an agreement
that if you divorce Ki,

8
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,800
you'll have no claim
to any of his inheritance.

9
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,480
<i>Then why should I sign that?</i>

10
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,320
You!

11
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,080
PREVIOUSLY

12
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,240
Die now!

13
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,280
Die now! Die now!

14
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,320
So what you really want

15
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,440
is to see me dead, right?

16
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,680
It's come this far.

17
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,960
Then say it. Say it out loud,
you want me to die.

18
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,960
Yes!

19
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,800
I want to see you die.

20
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,960
But not like this, Mrs. Sorn.

21
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,160
Because this isn't
nearly enough to pay for what you've done.

22
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,800
Someone like you

23
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,320
deserves to live long enough
to witness your own downfall,

24
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,720
to see your own destruction
with your own eyes.

25
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,280
That's much more satisfying.

26
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,440
You're truly cold-blooded.

27
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,840
With someone like you,

28
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,040
I could do even worse.

29
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,640
<i>So what you really want</i>

30
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,080
- <i>is to see me die, right?</i>
- <i>Yes!</i>

31
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,160
<i>I want to see you die.</i>

32
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,960
<i>But not like this, Mrs. Sorn. Because this</i>

33
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,840
<i>isn't nearly enough</i>
<i>to pay for what you've done.</i>

34
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,760
You already talked to Mom, huh?

35
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,880
Why are your clothes wet?

36
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,200
What are you thinking about?

37
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,880
Or are you also wondering

38
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,400
why this whole situation feels so strange?

39
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,320
Yes. It's strange indeed.

40
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Someone like Mrs. Sorn
wouldn't suddenly do something like that.

41
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,080
Because before that…

42
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,600
Why? Did you speak with her
before it happened?

43
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes.

44
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,840
And she showed no sign
of wanting to end her life.

45
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,960
We'll need to wait until she's safe.

46
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
We'll know the truth then.

47
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,280
For now, Ki and Nun

48
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,160
must be under so much stress.

49
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,080
Yes.

50
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,560
The doctors
still haven't given us an update.

51
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,000
I understand how you feel, Ms. Ve.

52
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,600
I know what you're going through.

53
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
But since you're married to Ki now,

54
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,760
I believe my friend can take care of you.

55
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,040
You just need to be patient.

56
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,480
Trust him a little longer.

57
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,280
Do you really think I can trust him?

58
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,800
Honestly, I think you know him well.

59
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,720
But if you truly accepted

60
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,320
how you feel about him,
you wouldn't be asking me that question.

61
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,240
STAFF ONLY

62
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,560
Ki.

63
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,840
Mint.

64
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,320
You didn't have to come.

65
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,120
When I called you,

66
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,600
I was already on my way to the hospital.

67
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,360
How could I not come,
after what happened to your mom?

68
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,120
Your mom just gave me these earrings.

69
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,680
I didn't even get to wear them for her yet
before this happened.

70
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,160
You just met my mom?

71
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,320
Yes. She told me about all her problems.

72
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,400
But I never thought she'd do this.

73
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,920
If I'd known,
I would've told you right away

74
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,400
so this could've been prevented.

75
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,040
She was probably
under a lot of stress about work.

76
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,040
It's about both work and family,

77
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,280
especially because of
the trouble in your house.

78
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,360
What are you talking about?

79
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,040
I'm saying what needs to be said.

80
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,040
Because I didn't tell you
about your mom's problem.

81
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,800
That's why this happened.

82
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,280
Forgive me for being blunt,

83
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,760
but the woman you married
is the cause of all this.

84
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,600
Mint.

85
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,520
It could be worse than it seems.

86
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,520
Your mom told me herself
that woman wanted to see her dead.

87
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,880
<i>Don't worry about Ki.</i>

88
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,240
I'll do everything in my power
to make him divorce her.

89
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
And how will you do that?

90
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,800
That woman hates me.
She wants to see me die.

91
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,520
So I'll just wait and see if Ki can really
live with a woman who wants his mom dead.

92
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,600
Is that true?

93
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,520
That woman actually wants you dead?

94
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,600
Yes, Mint.

95
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,360
She told me herself

96
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,280
how vile that woman really is.

97
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,160
She can think like that
about her own mother-in-law.

98
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,200
You should go home, Puth.

99
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,600
I'll be fine on my own.

100
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Are you sure, Nun?

101
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,120
Yes.

102
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,480
I'll call if there's any update on Mom.

103
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,880
I'm worried about you.

104
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,280
If you need anything, tell me.
I'm willing to help.

105
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,600
Hey!

106
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,480
How dare you touch her, huh?!

107
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,800
Singha, stop!

108
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,360
Miss Nun.

109
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,040
Uncle Pat, please stop them.

110
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,400
Mr. Singha, please stop!

111
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,000
Hey!

112
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,480
Do you realize you just hurt Miss Nun?

113
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,840
I'm sorry, but it's because of him!

114
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,960
- Enough!
- No.

115
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,280
Everything's already a mess.

116
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,960
You should all leave.

117
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,640
He's been verbally attacking you
over and over.

118
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,720
He shouldn't even be near you.

119
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,280
I'm just worried about you.

120
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,840
It's none of your business.

121
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,640
Mr. Singha,

122
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,640
you'd better leave too.

123
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,360
If you can't control yourself,

124
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,920
then please stay away from her.

125
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,600
If she gets hurt like this again,

126
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,640
don't blame me
for not respecting you and your father.

127
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,960
Are you hurt anywhere?

128
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,960
I'm fine.

129
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,600
Uncle Pat,

130
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,880
can I ask you something?

131
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,160
Why would Mom do this?

132
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,200
You heard what I said,
yet you're still so calm.

133
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,320
I don't even know what to say anymore.

134
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,600
Thank you, Mint, for telling me.

135
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,320
So what now?
How are you going to deal with this?

136
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,840
Deal with what?

137
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,200
With the person who tried to harm Mom.

138
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,400
Who are you talking about?

139
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,360
- Mint, I think--
- You, of course.

140
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,680
Mint, enough.

141
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,760
Ms. Ve,

142
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,000
Kita's home alone.
Please go back and take care of him.

143
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,760
Nun and I will stay with Mom.

144
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,600
She's useless here, right?

145
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,360
You too, Mint. Go home.

146
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,400
You can't visit Mom anyway.

147
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,640
You're useless too.

148
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,280
You…

149
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,080
Mint, please. Just go.

150
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,760
Fine. I hope you think carefully
about what I told you.

151
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,120
Venomous creatures can never be tamed.

152
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,560
They always end up
biting the ones who get too close.

153
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,480
But I think those creatures
are smarter than people think.

154
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,360
They know how to strike first
at those plotting against them.

155
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,640
No matter how poisonous,
they're still nothing compared to

156
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,960
those who keep slandering other people.

157
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,200
Aren't you leaving?
Why are you still here?

158
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,000
You should have seen something now.

159
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,840
Anyway, I hope your mom's safe.

160
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,320
Did she say something to you about me?

161
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,840
It's nothing. You should go home.

162
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,160
I don't think
you want to stay here anyway.

163
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,840
Even though I wanted to
take everything back from her,

164
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,960
I've never done anything cowardly
behind someone's back.

165
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,800
Besides, I know exactly
how it feels to lose a mother.

166
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,840
I know what that pain is like
and I'd never wish it on anyone.

167
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,960
How's my mother's condition?

168
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
Her blood pressure just dropped again,

169
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,120
and her oxygen levels are falling.
Excuse me.

170
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,360
Ki.

171
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
I believe Mom's going to be fine.

172
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,920
- Are you satisfied now?
- Nun.

173
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,040
Seeing Mom in this condition.

174
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,240
Let's wait to hear
what the doctor says first.

175
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,800
You're still defending her?

176
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,680
No matter how good you think she is,

177
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,480
you saw it yourself

178
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,560
that she hates Mom.

179
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,960
I'm not too blind to not see
what kind of person she is.

180
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,120
What you wish will never come true.

181
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,000
You'll never get what you want.

182
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,520
Really?

183
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,360
If you're not as blind as you say,
then you should see that

184
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,240
if I really were the one who did it,

185
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,800
this wouldn't have been enough.

186
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,080
Why do you keep
trying to destroy me and my mom?!

187
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Because of you,

188
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,040
- Mom ended up like this!
- Hey, Nun.

189
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,760
Miss Nun!

190
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,640
Miss Nun.

191
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,320
- Miss Nun.
- Look at yourself for once.

192
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,920
- You!
- Hey.

193
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,000
Hey!

194
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,280
Mr. Ki. Mr. Ki.

195
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,200
What are you going to do to my wife?!

196
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,720
She hurt your sister!

197
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,240
He's so blinded by that woman,

198
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,320
he's forgotten I'm his sister.

199
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,760
Even with Mom lying in the ICU,

200
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,200
she still matters more than Mom!

201
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,440
You ungrateful son!

202
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,640
I'll assume
you're just stressed about Mom.

203
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,920
That's why you said it without thinking.

204
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,960
- Miss Nun.
- Nun.

205
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,600
Please calm down.

206
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,200
Miss Nun. Miss Nun.

207
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,480
Miss Nun.

208
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,000
Take a deep breath.

209
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,200
Hold on to me.

210
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,520
Calm down.

211
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,000
Take deep breaths.

212
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,880
I shouldn't have said that to Ki.

213
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,280
But what you said

214
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,280
was true, wasn't it?

215
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,520
Mr. Ki's made it clear

216
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,440
that he values outsiders
more than his own family.

217
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,000
Doctor, how's my mother?

218
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,640
Don't worry. She's stable now.

219
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,840
But we'll keep her
under observation for a while.

220
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,480
Won't your father be angry

221
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,319
knowing you're here with me like this?

222
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,240
If I go home like this,
it'll only cause more problems.

223
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,319
Hey,

224
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,440
the doctor said Aunt Sorn is safe now.

225
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,359
You don't have to worry anymore.

226
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,160
But the doctor said something strange.

227
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,480
What did the doctor say?

228
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,720
Mom took a large amount of sleeping pills.
If you hadn't acted fast,

229
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,560
she might not have made it.

230
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,920
But we found no trace
of sleeping pills in her blood.

231
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,840
It looks like she passed out
in the bathtub on her own.

232
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,040
There's only a bruise
on the back of her head.

233
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,200
It's as if someone staged the scene
to make it look like a suicide attempt.

234
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,160
But in truth, she might've been attacked.

235
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,720
Maybe don't jump to conclusions yet.

236
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,280
It could've been an accident.

237
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,760
When Aunt Sorn gets better,

238
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,720
we'll know what really happened.

239
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,720
Does it hurt much?

240
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,200
This?

241
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,880
That guy's punch wasn't that strong.

242
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,800
Really?

243
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,520
Ouch!

244
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,080
Mr. Ki.

245
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,920
I just tucked Kita into bed.

246
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,840
You want to go see him?

247
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,400
If he's already asleep,

248
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,680
then I'm not worried.

249
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,240
And…

250
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,280
You want to ask
about my mom's condition, right?

251
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,440
She's safe now.

252
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,320
Is there something more than that?

253
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,800
How did you get these cuts?

254
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,920
I don't think
you really want to know how I got it.

255
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,240
If you want to ask something,
just ask directly.

256
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,160
You got them
while you were with my mom, didn't you?

257
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,400
You didn't just go there to talk.

258
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,280
You're right.

259
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,560
Your mom did that
while I was talking to her.

260
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,120
So it was you.

261
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,680
You hurt my mom.

262
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,280
- Hey.
- Miss Nun.

263
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,920
- Nun, stop.
- Miss Nun.

264
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,520
No, Nun.

265
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,200
The doctor said there was a bruise
on the back of her head.

266
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,120
You tried to kill her!

267
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,440
I argued with her, yes,

268
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,160
but when I left the room, she was fine.

269
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,520
She was completely fine.

270
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,200
Then what did you argue about?

271
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,240
Why did it get physical?

272
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,240
<i>Heirs of the Suttha Group?</i>

273
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,600
Everyone knows Mr. Ki
is just Mr. Terd's stepson,

274
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,600
not a true heir of the Suttha Group.

275
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,840
And as for your daughter,

276
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,200
you know exactly who her real father is.

277
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,400
Don't you dare speak nonsense!

278
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,200
Nonsense?

279
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,040
Do you have any proof
that what I said isn't true?

280
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,480
- Tell me what were you fighting about!
- Nun.

281
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,560
- Why did you hurt her?!
- Nun.

282
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,840
Nun, enough!

283
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,880
I just want to know! If it's nothing,

284
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,520
then why hide it?
Why act like there's some secret?

285
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,000
You don't need to know.

286
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,800
Even if you did,
it wouldn't change anything.

287
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,680
Because I didn't hurt your mother.

288
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,000
I don't believe you.

289
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,200
Stop accusing me.

290
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,440
Go before anyone sees you here.

291
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,880
Miss Nun, wait here.
You'll need your milk when you wake up.

292
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,400
I'll go get it.

293
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,160
Daddy's little girl.

294
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,760
Did you miss me, sweetheart?

295
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,800
Hm?

296
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,840
Daddy missed you so much.

297
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,640
Are you the one

298
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,480
Sorn said she'd send to help me?

299
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,920
Yes, sir.

300
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,120
Well then, do your job properly.
You can get started.

301
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,680
Yes, sir.

302
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,840
Hathai.

303
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,000
What are you doing there?
Want to play with your little sister?

304
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,680
Come here.

305
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,560
You have a baby sister now.

306
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,120
What do you think, she's cute, isn't she?

307
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,280
She's very cute.

308
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,960
You're a big sister now.

309
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,360
Take care of her, alright?

310
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,880
Even though you have different mothers,
you must love each other.

311
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,320
The baby doesn't know anything.

312
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,920
Don't take out the hatred
of adults on her, okay?

313
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,040
Yes, Dad.

314
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,560
Dad.

315
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,680
Mom.

316
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,360
I'll try my best

317
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,720
not to take out my anger
on people who don't know anything.

318
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,360
I'll sleep with Kita.

319
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,800
Why didn't you tell me everything

320
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,080
about your argument with my mother?

321
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,760
Why did you hide it from me?

322
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,880
You already know I have issues with her.
Do I need to go over this again?

323
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,360
If you'd just told me you didn't hurt her,

324
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,120
I would've believed you.

325
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,120
And what if I tell you

326
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,320
your mother tried to strangle me,

327
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,920
that she tried to kill me?

328
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,520
Would you still believe me?

329
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
I know

330
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,120
my mom took everything
from you and your mother.

331
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,000
But I'm ready to make it up to you.

332
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,440
All I ask

333
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,120
is that you forgive my mom.

334
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,200
You still haven't answered me.

335
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,440
Do you believe me
that your mother tried to kill me?

336
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,320
You don't, do you?

337
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,040
That's why you can ask me
to forgive her so easily.

338
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,920
If you could just let some things go,

339
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,640
maybe things would get better.

340
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,920
Let go?

341
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,800
Do you really think what your mother did
to me is something I can just let go of?

342
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,960
I just want you to try
to let go of the anger,

343
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,800
the resentment, Hathai.

344
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,480
What are you doing?

345
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,920
How do you expect me to let go

346
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,800
when everything she's done is still here?

347
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,640
I never knew about this.

348
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,440
And now you should know

349
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,720
why I can't do that.

350
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,040
I can't forgive her
like you want me to, Mr. Ki.

351
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,080
I'll make it up to you.

352
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,160
Let me be the one
to make amends for everything.

353
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,480
Sorry.

354
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,360
I didn't mean to wake you.

355
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,920
Go back to sleep.

356
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,960
I know

357
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,520
how hurtful that wound is to you.

358
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,320
But from now on,

359
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,520
I'll help you heal.

360
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,240
I'll make it better.

361
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,720
Trust me.

362
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,200
Ah.

363
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,360
What's for breakfast today?

364
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,560
Shrimp porridge, your favorite.

365
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,960
Dad's favorite too.

366
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,480
Really?

367
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,200
Come, sit down.

368
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,000
Wow.

369
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,080
Alright.

370
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,600
Your coffee.

371
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,600
Thank you.

372
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,440
Right.

373
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,760
Dad bought me lots of new storybooks.

374
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,880
Hm? Do you like them?

375
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,160
I do.

376
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,760
Then tonight,

377
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,040
- can you read them for me all night?
- Hm?

378
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,560
Sure.

379
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,000
No, Kita, then how do I survive tonight?

380
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,880
Mr. Ki.

381
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,360
How about this?
Teacher Ve reads for one hour.

382
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,920
Three hours.

383
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,200
One and a half.

384
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,440
Two.

385
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,680
You're quite a negotiator.

386
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,960
Hm?

387
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,280
Let's eat.

388
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,160
Mom isn't even out of the hospital yet,

389
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,880
but everyone here looks so happy.

390
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,520
Didn't the doctor say

391
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,320
Mom's safe now?

392
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,680
You should relax a little.

393
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,000
I'll relax when she wakes up

394
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,120
and tells us what really happened.

395
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,000
Eat some porridge, Aunt Nun.
I remember it's your favorite.

396
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,680
Let me serve you.

397
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,000
Eat, Aunt Nun.

398
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,280
Is it good?

399
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,280
I think she likes it.

400
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,960
You eat too, Kita.

401
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,200
- Thank you.
- Sure.

402
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,480
Are you Hathai's friend? What's your name?

403
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,640
Teacher, it's me, Prae,
the smallest one in the house.

404
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,240
But you're big now, not small.

405
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,560
That's true, she's really big.

406
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,280
Ve! You!

407
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
I'm kidding.

408
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,800
I'll rest for a bit.
I've been exhausted lately.

409
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,840
- Sure.
- Sure.

410
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,040
- Alright.
- Let me help.

411
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,960
You look happy today,

412
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,760
even after everything that just happened.

413
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,640
Is there

414
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,040
something I don't know about?

415
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,760
Hm?

416
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,080
Your eyes are sparkling.

417
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,840
You keep smiling.

418
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Honestly,

419
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,680
I've never seen you like this before.

420
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,800
Is it

421
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,280
because of Mr. Ki?

422
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,800
Maybe it's because
he promised to make it up to me

423
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,360
and I think he's actually trying.

424
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,639
You know,

425
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,320
when you trust someone too much,

426
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,000
it hurts so badly

427
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,199
when they're not
who you thought they were.

428
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,480
Hey,

429
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,400
I'm saying this because I care.

430
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,480
I want to trust him

431
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,480
the way I trust you, Prae.

432
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,360
Then I hope you're right about him, Ve.

433
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,679
Mm.

434
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,240
How did you know
I like the cake from this shop?

435
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
I've seen you post it on Instagram.

436
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,160
So you've been stalking me?

437
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,200
Let's call it studying behavior.

438
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,600
Studying behavior?

439
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,480
Still, thank you

440
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,680
for sneaking me out of the hospital.

441
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,960
It feels like I just escaped from prison.

442
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,000
It's so good.

443
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,200
You had cream on your lips,
so I wiped it off.

444
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,320
You're out of the hospital already?

445
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,320
You sneaked out, didn't you?

446
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,840
If Grandma Manee finds out,
I wonder what she'll say.

447
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,720
Wait, what's her number again?

448
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,720
What are you doing?

449
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,720
- No.
- Let go.

450
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,600
- Don't do it.
- Let go. I said

451
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,120
- let go!
- Hey.

452
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
Miss Mint,

453
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,920
don't turn this into a big deal.

454
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,320
I'll do whatever I want. So what?

455
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,840
Dad?

456
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,040
Yes, Dad.

457
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,080
What?

458
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,200
Ki's mom woke up?

459
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,960
Auntie.

460
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,600
I'm at the hospital now.

461
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,280
Miss Nun probably knows.
I'll wait for you inside.

462
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,040
The patient's awake,
but she's resting now.

463
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
Thank you.

464
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,960
Who would've thought
I'd see you like this?

465
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,920
Jit, have the driver prepare the car.

466
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,360
Please clean the floor.

467
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,800
Jit is the only one left in the house.
Everyone else has gone home.

468
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,560
I'll take Sorn to the hospital.

469
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,160
You want me to clean that?

470
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,280
There's no one else.

471
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,160
Just help for now.

472
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,120
But if you don't want to,

473
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,720
Hathai, can you help me?

474
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,200
I can't hold it anymore.

475
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,760
Let's go.

476
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,520
Oh, Hathai, stop.

477
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,200
Dad asked me to do it. You don't need to.

478
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,080
Mom…

479
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,040
It's alright, dear.

480
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,560
I'm strong enough

481
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,800
to get through this.

482
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,640
And you must be too.

483
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,480
No matter

484
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,240
how painful it gets,

485
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,440
you must use it

486
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,440
to make yourself

487
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,160
stronger.

488
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,440
Because of you,

489
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,720
I had to become strong
like my mom taught me to be.

490
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,640
But I still don't know

491
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,000
whether keeping all this pain inside

492
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,480
or letting it go…

493
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,080
would hurt less.

494
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,760
You…

495
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,560
Please, don't hurt me! I'm scared!

496
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,200
<i>This woman really tried to kill her.</i>

497
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,160
<i>You want to see me die, right?</i>

498
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,120
<i>Yes!</i>

499
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,680
So you really did hurt my mom

500
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,240
and tried to make everyone
believe she attempted suicide?!

501
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,880
<i>That woman is no different from a demon.</i>

502
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,960
She's capable of anything
as long as she wins.

503
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,360
Right now, I don't have
any evidence to clear myself.

504
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,320
Ms. Ve.

505
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,360
<i>If there's anything I can do to help,</i>
<i>please just tell me.</i>

How much longer do I have to
pretend to be a patient?
