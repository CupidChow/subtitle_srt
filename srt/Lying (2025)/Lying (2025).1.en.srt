1
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,440
Oops, I'm sorry.

2
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,560
It's alright.

3
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,960
Welcome, everyone,

4
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,840
to the launch event
of our eco-condominium project

5
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,520
that caters to modern urban living
with the concept

6
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,640
of energy and environmental conservation,
brought to you by the Suttha Group.

7
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,440
Now, please welcome Mrs. Kanisorn,
the esteemed CEO and my mother,

8
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,640
to share the story behind this project.

9
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,720
Hello, everyone.

10
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,240
Thank you all so much
for being here with us today.

11
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,160
This project was born
from my personal belief,

12
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,120
a desire to give back to society

13
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,480
and to bring a better quality of life

14
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,520
to the heart of our city.

15
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,560
EVIL CAPITALIST
MURDERER

16
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,600
- A suicide!
- Someone just jumped off the building!

17
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
What?!

18
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,120
It's because of you, Mrs. Kanisorn.

19
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,080
You're behind the forest burning scheme.
That's why he ended up dying like that.

20
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,680
So you got rich
off the death of innocent people!

21
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,360
- You're a murderer!
- Murderer!

22
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,680
- Hey! Wait, wait. Hold on.
- Murderer!

23
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,560
- Murderer!
- Please calm down.

24
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,520
- You're the reason he died like that.
- We won't let this go!

25
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,720
- This is a misunderstanding.
- Murderer.

26
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,000
- We won't let this go!
- We won't let this go!

27
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,120
This has nothing to do with us.

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,560
Nun, take care of Kita.

29
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,720
- We won't let this go!
- We won't let this go!

30
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,320
We never got justice!

31
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,320
- Mom, let's get out of here.
- What did we do wrong?

32
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,680
- Yes!
- We won't let this go!

33
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,720
- We won't let this go!
- We won't let this go!

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,880
- We didn't get justice!
- Yes!

35
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,800
We won't let this go!

36
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,080
- That's right!
- Kita, come with me.

37
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,840
Hey, this is not the time to be stubborn.
Come on, Kita. Come with me.

38
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,040
Kita.

39
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,720
No, no! Please calm down.

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,000
Stop. Please stop.

41
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,400
Calm down, please. What are you doing?

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,880
Hey!

43
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,920
Hey! Don't!

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,960
Stop! Stop! Calm down!

45
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,120
Mom, are you alright?

46
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,880
I'm okay, honey. But what about Kita?

47
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,360
Um, it was all chaos, Mom.

48
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,600
Nun! You left your nephew behind?

49
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,360
They wouldn't hurt Kita, I guess.

50
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,200
Mom, they're coming.

51
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,200
- Hey, there they are! Hurry! Hurry!
- Hey!

52
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,760
- Get in the car.
- Found them! Quick!

53
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,360
But Ki's car is blocking ours.

54
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,800
- What do we do now?
- Ma'am.

55
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,480
You should come this way.

56
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,560
Let's go.

57
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,320
- Hurry!
- Mom!

58
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,640
This way might be safer.

59
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,360
The exit's here? Okay, go!

60
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,840
Don't touch me! You're filthy!

61
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,520
Are you okay, Nun?

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,800
- Ugh!
- Come on.

63
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,560
Go, dear, hurry!

64
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,760
Mom. Nun.

65
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,000
Are you both safe?

66
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,760
We're fine.

67
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,120
And about the person
who jumped from the building…

68
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,720
Did anyone capture anything?

69
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
Definitely not.

70
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,080
I had our people block the area,
no outsiders allowed.

71
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,080
But everyone at the event saw it.
Someone really did jump.

72
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,040
It wasn't what it looked like, Miss Nun.

73
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
Then what was it?

74
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,960
After the protesters left,
I went to check the site.

75
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,880
Yeah?

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,040
Look.

77
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,000
It was a dummy, not a real person.

78
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,880
What? So we were tricked?

79
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,440
But the reporters

80
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,920
already reported that someone
jumped during our condo launch event.

81
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,000
Someone must be trying
to sabotage the Suttha Group.

82
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,880
Those dumb protesters couldn't have
come up with this themselves.

83
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,080
Where's Kita?

84
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,280
Um…

85
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,120
Kita, come to Daddy.

86
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,280
Nun.

87
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,120
Kita normally
doesn't let anyone touch him.

88
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,600
Even getting close is difficult.

89
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,920
He must've been scared.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,480
When someone's in danger,
they'll accept help.

91
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,160
Nothing strange about that.

92
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,880
He's probably still frightened.

93
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,480
Kita,

94
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,400
Daddy's here.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

95
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,200
Are you okay, son?

96
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,560
Who are you? Which department
are you from? Who's your supervisor?

97
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,920
I'll make sure to talk about your bonus.

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,720
My name is Wanvela.

99
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,160
I don't work for the Suttha Group.

100
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,560
I was just attending your condo launch.

101
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,240
Then I must thank you even more
for helping us today.

102
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,080
I don't help people
expecting anything in return.

103
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,640
Then let me at least treat you to a meal.

104
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
Please don't say no.

105
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,200
In that case, I'd be happy to.

106
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
CONDO GRAND OPENING ENDS IN HORROR
AS SOMEONE JUMPS OFF BUILDING

107
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,040
SUTTHA GROUP'S CONDO LAUNCH

108
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,120
Didn't you say you handled the reporters?

109
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,520
Then why didn't you tell them
that what they saw

110
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,640
falling off the building
was not a man but just a dummy?

111
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,640
I took care of everything.

112
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,320
But some reporters didn't believe me.
They accused us of covering it up.

113
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,120
Almost all of our condo bookings

114
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
got canceled, Mom.

115
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,120
It hasn't even been a full day.

116
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,520
If we can solve the issues for the people,
I think the situation will improve.

117
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,800
I'd like to form a special task force

118
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,560
to help everyone affected.

119
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,440
This is just a convenient excuse.

120
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,560
It's obvious there's someone behind this.

121
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,720
Most likely C-In Company, our competitor.

122
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,520
They've been bitter ever since
we acquired the land for this project.

123
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,840
I think the same.

124
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,920
Mr. Ki, you're probably just too naive.

125
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,320
You're falling for their tricks.

126
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,880
If you're going to be
the future head of the company,

127
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,840
you need to learn to be quick-witted.

128
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,240
Go deal with the press.

129
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,880
Do whatever it takes

130
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,840
to regain customer trust
in our project. Go.

131
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
Yes, ma'am.

132
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,280
Um…

133
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Mrs. Sorn, don't stress too much.

134
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,919
Oh,

135
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,000
don't forget to arrange a dinner for her.

136
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,600
Invite her to our house
whenever she's free.

137
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,760
We still don't really know who she is.

138
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,640
She saved me and Kita.

139
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,360
There's nothing wrong
with inviting her to dinner to thank her.

140
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Just do as I say.

141
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,880
Yes, Mom.

142
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,320
Wanvela speaking.

143
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,560
<i>My mom</i>

144
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,080
asked me to call and invite you
to dinner at our home.

145
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,280
Oh, Mr. Kirin.

146
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,600
Would Saturday around noon

147
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,720
work for you?
If so, I'll send someone to pick you up.

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,440
I'd rather go on my own.

149
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,960
I don't want to trouble you.

150
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,880
<i>Just send me the location.</i>
<i>I'll be there on time.</i>

151
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,080
Please thank Mrs. Kanisorn for me again.

152
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,760
See you soon.

153
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,040
EVIL CAPITALIST
MURDERER

154
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,120
Was it a hassle to get here?

155
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,520
Not at all.

156
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,000
It feels like I've come back
to somewhere familiar.

157
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,320
You say that like

158
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,760
you've lived here before.

159
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,160
I meant coming back to Bangkok.

160
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,800
Oh, so you've been living upcountry?

161
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,360
Which province?

162
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,280
I studied abroad for several years.
I just recently returned.

163
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,840
Ki.

164
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,320
Hi, Nun.

165
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,160
There you are, Mint.

166
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,720
Ki, I invited Mint here.

167
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,040
Since we're having lunch anyway, right?

168
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,520
Did I just hear someone talking
about studying abroad?

169
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,680
Oh, that was Miss Ve. She…

170
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,920
Oh,

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,400
Nun already told me

172
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,520
that you saved Mom and Kita,

173
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,240
so she wanted
to treat you to a nice meal to thank you.

174
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,760
So, which school did you graduate from?

175
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,400
Ivy League? Russell Group?

176
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,720
Or maybe Go8?

177
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,000
I didn't graduate from
any prestigious universities in the US,

178
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,720
the UK, or Australia.

179
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,880
I studied in New Zealand,
at the University of Auckland.

180
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,480
Mint.

181
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,600
Ve's not here for a job interview.
It doesn't matter

182
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,360
where she graduated from.

183
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,760
Why don't we all head inside?

184
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,800
Sure.

185
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,840
Could she actually have studied abroad?

186
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,840
Anyone can go overseas these days, Nun.

187
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,000
People sneak in illegally,

188
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,520
some even end up in prostitution.

189
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,120
Then they lie about getting a degree.

190
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,040
Let's go.

191
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,040
Is something bothering you?

192
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,520
I'm just surprised.

193
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,160
Why isn't Mr. Terdthong
in any of your family photos?

194
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,720
Mr. Terdthong Liangsuttha.

195
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
You know my father?

196
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,880
The Suttha Group is a big company.
Of course I did some research.

197
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,680
It's been about 20 years

198
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,080
since my father passed away.

199
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,480
My mother was devastated.
She couldn't cope.

200
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,800
So she had all his photos removed.

201
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,280
I was very saddened too. Even though

202
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,120
I wasn't his biological son,

203
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,120
he was very kind to me.

204
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,080
You're very lucky.

205
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,080
Yes,

206
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,320
I admit I was lucky to have known him.

207
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,720
So you want to hold onto
that luck forever, don't you?

208
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,360
Too bad forever doesn't really exist.

209
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,520
Today I hope you don't mind
me joining for a meal.

210
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,080
Of course not, dear.
We're all like family here.

211
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,360
It feels like something's missing, though.

212
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,960
Here it is.

213
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,280
Let me serve this dish myself.

214
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,720
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,680
To thank you for saving me and Kita,

216
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,440
I had the chef
prepare this dish especially for you.

217
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,600
Thank you.

218
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,120
Hey! Mom!

219
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,840
Mom, what are you doing?!

220
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,640
Why would you do this to me?

221
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,360
You think I'm too stupid
to realize who you really are?

222
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,080
People are dragging my name
all over social media.

223
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,520
My reputation and everything I've built

224
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,880
was ruined because of you.

225
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,840
Ah.

226
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,880
Mom.

227
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,960
- Pat!
- Yes.

228
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,920
I had someone investigate what happened
that day, but we haven't found anything.

229
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,200
It might be one of our competitors.

230
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,560
If someone wasn't behind the scenes,
who would dare go this far?

231
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,120
Find out who else is involved behind this.

232
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,040
And that woman, Wanvela,

233
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,320
find out exactly
who she is and where she's from.

234
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,520
You suspect that woman too?

235
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,320
I never trust anyone.

236
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,320
People who claim to do good
without wanting anything in return

237
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,280
don't exist.

238
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,840
Let her see.

239
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,600
This woman
might be connected to C-In Company,

240
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,840
our competitor.

241
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,240
I had someone dig deeper
and got this photo.

242
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,640
You paid those protestors,

243
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,400
then pretended to help me and Kita.

244
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,560
You thought
I wouldn't trace it back to you?

245
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,400
So that's how it is.

246
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,560
So you're just a two-faced hireling?

247
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,600
I think you misunderstood me.

248
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,920
What now?
You're going to play the victim again?

249
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,000
The photo you saw…

250
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,800
Yes, I gave money
to the protesters that day.

251
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,960
But it was to help those in need.

252
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,520
His wife has chronic lung disease

253
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,960
since your condo construction started.

254
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,240
She had to be hospitalized.

255
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,120
Oh, is this a new drama?
What channel is it airing on?

256
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,400
That day, when I gave
money to the villagers,

257
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,720
I asked someone to record it.

258
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,040
Because it was money
from the foundation I work with.

259
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,240
I needed proof.

260
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,200
This was a donation from the foundation.

261
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,520
Thank you.

262
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,000
I hope your wife recovers soon.

263
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,120
That's my hope too.

264
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,200
But what would really help is
if the foundation

265
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,040
could also stand up for our rights.

266
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,079
Mom.

267
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,560
I think you've misunderstood Miss Ve.

268
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,480
Even though I work
to support local communities,

269
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,040
I also understand
your business perspective.

270
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,040
And I never support violence
or harm as a way to solve problems.

271
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,319
All I hope is that your company

272
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,240
can give back to the community
and resolve these issues

273
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,880
as you publicly declared.

274
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,280
Anyway, thank you for the meal.

275
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,880
Pat.

276
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,840
Miss Ve! Miss Ve.

277
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,760
You should wash up first.

278
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,800
You can't go back like this.
I'll have our driver take you home.

279
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,320
It's alright. I came here on my own.
I can leave on my own.

280
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,120
Then please let me apologize
on behalf of my mom…

281
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,040
Don't worry.

282
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,280
I'm sure your mom understands now
that I wasn't lying.

283
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,360
You don't need to apologize.

284
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,680
LIANGSUTTHA

285
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,120
It's been 20 years.

286
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,160
Everyone in that house
has probably forgotten me.

287
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,280
Mom. Let me out.

288
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,400
Bear-bear!

289
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,200
Here.

290
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,920
Glass-glass!

291
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,200
I win again.

292
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,480
Wow! How are you so fast
and remember everything, sweetie?

293
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,360
I'm not playing anymore.

294
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,280
If we keep going, I'll just lose again.

295
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,640
I made this

296
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,680
so we can eat together
after the game, Mom.

297
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,840
You're growing up so fast.

298
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,200
And so talented too.

299
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,600
You're learning to do things on your own.
I don't even have to teach you.

300
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,880
I made some for Dad too.
He'll be hungry when he gets home.

301
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,760
Of course.

302
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,160
Whose luggage is that?

303
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,560
Who did Dad bring here?

304
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,680
You!

305
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,320
Have you ever once thought about me
and our child's feelings when you do this?

306
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,560
What do you expect me to do?

307
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,880
The baby Sorn is carrying is my child too.

308
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,400
She's about to give birth.

309
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,600
I want to take care of her
and our baby the best I can.

310
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,840
Why are you here?

311
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,880
I told you I'd handle this.

312
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,680
I didn't want you and Mrs. Kitinee
to get into a fight.

313
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,960
Don't worry. I can take care of myself.

314
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,440
If you could really do that,

315
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,520
then how shameless and immoral you are

316
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,760
to let a married man take care of you?

317
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,120
Nee.

318
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,840
How could you possibly
take care of yourself, and Kirin too?

319
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,320
Even if he's not my biological son,

320
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,520
I still want to raise him as my own.

321
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,560
I told you not to be this good to me.

322
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,680
And now things have gotten out of hand.

323
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,000
Mrs. Kitinee.

324
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,600
I'm truly sorry.

325
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,320
Once I give birth, I'll be on my way.

326
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,400
Are you alright, Sorn?

327
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,440
I'm fine.

328
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,520
Even after you give birth,

329
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,400
I won't let you leave.

330
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,760
Hathai!

331
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,680
Hathai.

332
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,000
Hathai, does it hurt?

333
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,240
Why do we have to run, Mom?

334
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,240
Someone wants to kill us.
We have to hurry.

335
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,600
Hurry.

336
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,560
Can you keep going, honey? Are you okay?

337
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,480
Let's go that way.

338
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Let's go.

339
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,560
Come on.

340
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,000
Hathai, hide here for now.

341
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,480
If you hear anything, do not come out.

342
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,920
Okay?

343
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,360
Where are you going, Mom?

344
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,640
Promise me.

345
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,840
If I don't come back,

346
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,200
don't leave this spot.
Don't call for anyone.

347
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,760
Promise me.

348
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,920
Please.

349
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,360
Mom…

350
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,080
Mom! Mom!

351
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,480
Captain! There's a child here.

352
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,600
Are you okay, little one?

353
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,680
How was it at their house?

354
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,320
Just like you said.
Kanisorn doesn't trust anyone.

355
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,320
You know,

356
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,840
I was secretly filmed
while helping the villagers.

357
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,520
But don't worry.

358
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,280
No way the Suttha Group

359
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,440
will be able to trace
what really happened on launch day.

360
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,280
Anyway,

361
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,840
this is the press release they put out.

362
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,120
<i>Concerning the incident, I affirm that</i>

363
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,320
<i>someone deliberately attempted</i>
<i>to tarnish the Suttha Group's reputation.</i>

364
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,160
<i>Once we have solid evidence,</i>

365
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,400
<i>we'll pursue legal action</i>
<i>to the fullest extent.</i>

366
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,760
<i>Thank you to everyone who's supported me</i>

367
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,880
<i>and believed in who I truly am.</i>

368
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,000
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

369
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,400
And it wasn't just that clip.

370
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,840
Kanisorn also sent statements
to every media outlet,

371
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,160
claiming the incident didn't affect
consumer confidence at all.

372
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,000
They even fabricated
soared condo bookings afterward.

373
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,880
All lies and image control
just to protect her public image.

374
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,880
In the end,

375
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,800
money always has the power
to turn black into white.

376
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,200
But one day,
everyone will see who she really is.

377
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,440
Yes.

378
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,680
It's me.

379
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,680
Just send me the time and location.

380
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,240
Who just called you, Ve?

381
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,320
Mrs. Sorn asked me to give you this

382
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,920
as compensation for misunderstanding you.

383
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,000
For Mrs. Sorn, giving away money
is easier than saying sorry, right?

384
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,600
You're still upset with her, aren't you?

385
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,240
Well, maybe I'm partly to blame too

386
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,160
for giving her the wrong information.

387
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,800
If you want an apology,

388
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,640
then let me be the one to say it.

389
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,120
I'm sorry.

390
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,640
Then I'll just take your apology.

391
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,600
Please tell Mrs. Sorn
that kindness is enough for me.

392
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,400
Wait.

393
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,360
Don't you want to at least
look at the number on the check?

394
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,560
It's not a small amount.

395
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,960
You must've met people
who get wide-eyed at big numbers

396
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,240
and quickly change their minds.

397
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,000
But for me, it'll be a bit harder.

398
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,800
Even if it's six or seven-figures,
I'm not interested.

399
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,400
The harder the challenge,
the more interesting it is.

400
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,000
Mr. Ki.

401
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,800
How's the community?

402
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,640
I've already sent someone
to negotiate with them.

403
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,800
But it turns out
our people have been hurting them.

404
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,680
I'm afraid this will escalate,
so I wanted to inform you first.

405
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,080
You ordered the attack
in the community, didn't you?

406
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,880
This guy is tricky.

407
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,560
He was planning to go public
and slam our company.

408
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,720
So, to be proactive,
I sent people to teach him a lesson.

409
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,880
I was just trying to help
lighten Mrs. Sorn's burden.

410
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,720
Next time,
don't overstep your role again.

411
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,320
You're just an employee
of the Suttha Group.

412
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,360
You don't have the right to make decisions
on behalf of the executives.

413
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,360
Are you sure
I'm just an employee?

414
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,360
That's enough!

415
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,440
Leave us, Pat. I'll talk to my son alone.

416
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,320
So, you're upset
about what Pat did to the villagers?

417
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,480
I'll tell him not to do it again.

418
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,360
About solving the issues in the community,
do what you need to do

419
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,080
since you'll soon become the CEO
of the Suttha Group in my place.

420
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,880
Mom.

421
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,800
Do you really think that man
is sincere towards you?

422
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,720
I don't want you to be deceived,
fooled by some man.

423
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,040
Don't talk like I'm some fool again.

424
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,480
Is there a problem, teacher?

425
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,360
Kita got in trouble at school again?

426
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,280
Alright, I'll be right there.

427
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,400
Kita.

428
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,880
Your teacher told me
that you were provoked first,

429
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,000
but still,
you shouldn't respond with violence.

430
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,440
Okay.

431
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,120
You!

432
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,800
I'm telling you. This isn't over.

433
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,160
Yeah! If my child is hurt, we feel it too.

434
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,320
I'll post this on Facebook

435
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,720
so everyone knows
what your son did to mine.

436
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,640
Just because you're from a rich family,
I'm not scared.

437
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,200
But the teacher and others already said
your son started it.

438
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,600
Still, your son went too far.

439
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,800
I hear he's had issues with several kids

440
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,560
and even had to transfer schools.

441
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,480
He looks innocent,
but seems to be a troubled kid.

442
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,800
You.

443
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,800
I've got the CCTV footage
from the school cameras.

444
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,920
If you say
your son didn't do anything wrong,

445
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,480
let the public decide
if he went too far or not.

446
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,560
Why make this a big deal?

447
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,760
Delete the clip, and we're done.

448
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,680
Honestly, kids fight
and by tomorrow they'll forget.

449
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,120
Delete it now.

450
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,360
Okay, okay.

451
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,840
It's deleted.

452
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
Kita.

453
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,239
I love you.

454
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,200
If I hadn't been there,

455
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,280
our family would've become
neighborhood gossip nonstop.

456
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,200
The company scandal,
and now Kita's issues.

457
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,720
So you used money to fix it?

458
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,600
And did it work?

459
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,200
You see how Kita
is getting more rebellious.

460
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,920
That's how kids
without a mother's guidance are.

461
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,160
Mom.

462
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,520
Ki, it's been two years
since Ging passed away.

463
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,480
When will Kita get better?

464
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,680
Everyone's already saying
that Liangsuttha has a messed-up grandkid.

465
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,120
I want Kita out of school.

466
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,920
No more of these problems.

467
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,520
Mom.

468
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,440
Kids these days
don't need to attend school.

469
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,000
He can be home-schooled.

470
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,440
No more trouble outside.

471
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,960
We'll hire four or five private tutors

472
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,800
if it will help Kita.

473
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,040
I'll do everything I can
to raise him right, Ging.

474
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,920
My early childhood center
just opened not long ago,

475
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,240
but we've got great programs

476
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,840
for kids Kita's age.

477
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,240
But my mom wants Kita to do homeschool.

478
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,000
I want a teacher
who can come to our home and teach him.

479
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,480
And I want someone

480
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,920
who really understands a child like Kita.

481
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,760
Perfect timing. My school is hiring
lots of new teachers right now.

482
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,200
I'll look for one for you.

483
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,600
You can trust me.

484
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,320
Thanks a lot, Pete.

485
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,040
By the way,
when do you want my staff to reach out?

486
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,840
The sooner the better.

487
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,280
Ki, is Kita's tutor coming today?

488
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,760
Yes, Pete said they'd be here today.
Should be arriving soon.

489
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,000
Good. The sooner someone's here
to take care of Kita, the better.

490
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,800
If we do nothing,

491
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,640
he's really going to become
a problematic child.

492
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,120
Hello, Auntie.

493
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,720
- Oh, you're here.
- Hello.

494
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,480
I brought Kita's tutor
that I told you about.

495
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,760
Miss Ve?

496
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,160
I never intended to let this woman in.

497
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,360
If Pete hadn't been the one to bring you,

498
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,600
I'd have kicked you out already.

499
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,840
You're the only one Kita allows near him.

500
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,880
I really want you to care for Kita.

501
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,120
If you want me
to really take care of Kita,

502
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,240
I'll need to move into your house.

503
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,440
Mom.

504
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,320
Someone filmed us at Pete's school.

505
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,600
Is that clip of you
hurting your own grandson real?

506
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,280
Is that why you won't give an interview?

507
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,960
I want to know about the one
you sent to take care of my son.

508
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,360
Who is she really?

509
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,400
