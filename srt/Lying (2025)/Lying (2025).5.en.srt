1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,880
<i>We can't even expose Napat yet.</i>

2
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,000
<i>They spent that much money.</i>
<i>How could he not get away?</i>

3
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,360
<i>This is not the end.</i>

4
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,280
<i>I'll find out who recorded that clip</i>

5
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,960
<i>and caused all this mess.</i>

6
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,680
<i>My junior colleague.</i>

7
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,720
<i>You're the reporter</i>
<i>named Praepai, aren't you?</i>

8
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,640
PREVIOUSLY

9
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,520
Ve.

10
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,240
That reporter girl
must be working with someone.

11
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,280
Could it be Ki?

12
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,720
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

13
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,880
Mr. Ki.

14
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,480
Run. Don't wait for me.

15
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,320
Go.

16
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,720
Get out of the car.

17
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,320
Run!

18
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,080
Hey!

19
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,440
Mr. Ki!

20
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,040
Miss Ve.

21
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,640
Go!

22
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,280
ROADWORK AHEAD

23
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,800
Mr. Ki, who did you mess with?
Why were they after you?

24
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,760
Maybe they were just robbers.

25
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,720
Robbers?

26
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,360
They didn't even ask for valuables.
Clearly they were after you.

27
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,920
Hey, they're over there!

28
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,480
Hide. Go.

29
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,840
Take that woman.

30
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,320
- Go.
- Hey!

31
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,440
Mr. Ki.

32
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,240
Hey!

33
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,800
I'll handle this one myself.

34
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,600
Miss Ve!

35
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,640
Come here.

36
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,000
Take him to the hospital.
I'll take it from here. Go!

37
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,160
Ugh.

38
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,720
That bitch was scared to die,
so she ran off on her own

39
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,040
and left you here.

40
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,320
In that case, you can rot right here.

41
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,240
What? He got stabbed in the neck?

42
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,520
And who was the woman with Ki?
How did she manage to fight you guys off?

43
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,160
Fine, get him to a doctor.

44
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,480
What about Ki? He didn't get away, right?

45
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,480
Good.

46
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,440
He must be scared to death by now.

47
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,800
I'll handle the rest myself.

48
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,680
- Help! Help! Help!
- What?

49
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,080
- Miss Ve?
- Mr. Pat.

50
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,720
What are you doing around here?

51
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,560
Mr. Ki and I were attacked by thugs.

52
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,600
- Please go help Mr. Ki.
- Uh…

53
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,680
Okay. Let's go.

54
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,960
If you die here,

55
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,920
it'll take days
before anyone finds your body.

56
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,960
This way!

57
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,520
Hey! Stop right there!

58
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,840
- Mr. Ki. Mr. Ki.
- Mr. Ki!

59
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,720
Does it hurt a lot, Ki?

60
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,880
I'm okay now, Mom.

61
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,040
But the doctor still wants him
to stay overnight for observation.

62
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,240
I'll have the police hunt down
the thugs who did this to you.

63
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,600
Pat.

64
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm counting on you.

65
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,120
Yes, ma'am.

66
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,080
If Pat hadn't been there,

67
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,680
I don't even want to imagine
what would've happened.

68
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,200
You should really thank him.

69
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,960
There's no need to thank me.

70
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,600
I've known you since you were a kid.

71
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,080
I've always served

72
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,560
Mrs. Sorn's family with loyalty.

73
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,160
We're practically family.

74
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,280
And if Mr. Pat
manages to catch the culprits,

75
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,760
you'll owe him even more, Mr. Ki.

76
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,720
Yes.

77
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,360
I'll do my best, no matter what.

78
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,680
Thank you so much, Pat.

79
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,320
Of course.

80
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,600
You didn't have to bring Kita, you know.

81
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,960
Kita insisted on seeing you.

82
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,360
So I had to bring him.

83
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,800
Besides, if he sees you're okay,
it'll put him at ease.

84
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,560
Thank you.

85
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,160
Wow, you can thank me so easily,

86
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,240
but not Napat?

87
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,560
I should thank you more.

88
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,679
You were the one who ran to get help.
You saved me. Not him.

89
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,480
I thought you'd be mad I left you behind.

90
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,680
Why would I be mad?
Honestly, I was relieved that you ran.

91
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,280
You were surprisingly calm
when facing those thugs.

92
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,080
You even fought back and escaped.

93
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,680
Did you study martial arts or something?

94
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,880
I've been on my own since I was little.

95
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,080
There was no one to protect me.

96
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,080
If I didn't fight,
I wouldn't have survived.

97
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,360
No! Give it back!

98
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,080
Please don't take my stuff!

99
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Stop it! Don't hurt her!

100
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,920
A new kid?

101
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,080
Don't act so bold when you're new.

102
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,520
Hey, I heard her mom

103
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,320
got shot by robbers.
That's why she ended up here.

104
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,400
Hey! What are you looking at, newbie?
Got a problem?

105
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,480
Beat her up. Show her who's in charge.

106
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,520
- Come here.
- Let me go!

107
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,560
Stop it!

108
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,080
Hey, it's Teacher Rawee!

109
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,200
Teacher, there's a fight over here!

110
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,520
Are you hurt?

111
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,800
Where's Teacher Rawee?

112
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,240
If I hadn't said that,
they wouldn't have left.

113
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,600
Thanks for helping. What's your name?

114
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,200
Praepai.

115
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,720
Prae!

116
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,760
You tricked us?

117
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,400
Run!

118
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,560
- Hey! Get them!
- Stop!

119
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,440
Sis.

120
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,560
Sis? Me?

121
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,040
That's what they call seniors around here.

122
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,880
Sis.

123
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,320
Thanks for helping me.

124
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,960
Sure.

125
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,040
- Let me help you.
- It's okay, Sam. I got this.

126
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,600
It's fine. Let me help.

127
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,800
We're both Thai.
We'd better stick together.

128
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,400
What are you doing?

129
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,600
Don't do it.

130
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,040
They all say the same thing.

131
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,440
But in the end…

132
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,560
Well, not everyone, I guess.

133
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,920
You bitch!

134
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,000
Don't ever do that again
if you don't want to die.

135
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,440
There was a teacher who once told me

136
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,560
"If you don't want problems around you
to grow stronger, don't be weak."

137
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,600
I should start telling myself that.

138
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,760
Here.

139
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,200
- Let me help.
- Oh, it's fine. I…

140
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,160
Teacher Ve.

141
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,040
I assume your other hand still works fine?
I think I should take Kita home now.

142
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,320
Of course.

143
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,560
Come on, say goodbye
to Daddy and let's go.

144
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,400
Sleep tight, son.

145
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,400
- Good night.
- Good night.

146
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,360
Let's go.

147
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,160
How's your neck?

148
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,960
- Still alive. It's far from the heart.
- Yeah.

149
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,480
Glad you're okay. We should go.
Boss is waiting. Come on.

150
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,840
- <i>We should go. Boss is waiting.</i>
- <i>Alright.</i>

151
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,320
Those thugs were Napat's men,
weren't they?

152
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Ki, I was actually going to visit you
at the hospital yesterday,

153
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,000
but Mom said not to.

154
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm fine. See?
I was discharged in just a day.

155
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Stay here and look after your brother.
I'll see if lunch is ready.

156
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,720
Sure.

157
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,400
- How are you? Where's the wound?
- Here. Just a small one.

158
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,240
Welcome home, Mr. Ki.

159
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,000
I had Aunt Kob boil pennywort for you
to reduce internal bruising.

160
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,520
You should drink some.

161
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Because when I came to help you,

162
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,040
it looked like
the outside wounds weren't much,

163
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,280
but the internal ones
must've hurt real bad.

164
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,800
Of course. I was ambushed by a dog,

165
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,320
one that lives inside the house,
so I didn't see it coming.

166
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,800
Naturally, it hurt badly.

167
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,200
Who are you calling a dog?

168
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,040
The person who intentionally
attacked me, obviously.

169
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,200
Shame I couldn't catch them.

170
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Uh…

171
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,480
Uncle Pat, I think maybe

172
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,640
you should leave and let Ki rest.

173
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,080
He's suspicious of me?

174
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,440
Dad.

175
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,960
I'm home now.

176
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,000
What's she doing in there?

177
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,600
See that, Mrs. Sorn?

178
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,400
I caught her red-handed.

179
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,640
What are you doing in my storage room?
And what are you taking?

180
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,120
Those are all toys.

181
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,640
These are Hathai's toys.

182
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,880
Who took them out?

183
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,960
I did.

184
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,080
I saw that they were still usable,

185
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,360
so I thought it'd help
with Kita's development.

186
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,400
Do you think you own this house?

187
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,160
You think you can take
whatever you want, whenever you want?

188
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,040
You should've asked me first.

189
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,480
I apologize
for not asking your permission.

190
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,800
I didn't think some old toys
would upset you this much.

191
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,120
Or did these toys stir up
something unpleasant in your heart?

192
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,000
Those belong to the dead.

193
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,160
You think I want my grandson
playing with a dead girl's toys?

194
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,839
Maybe the dead don't cling
to their possessions that much.

195
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,160
There's nothing to be afraid of.

196
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,240
I'm not afraid.

197
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,880
But I don't want the name of the dead
to be associated with this house.

198
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,480
- And these too. Kob, put them away.
- Yes, ma'am.

199
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,360
I'll tell Dad
what you've done behind his back,

200
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,440
to me, and to Mom.
You don't deserve to live in this house.

201
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,720
Mr. Ki. Thank you.

202
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,360
If there's nothing else,
I'll go check on Kita now.

203
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,880
She acts like she's more
than Kita's teacher each day.

204
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,840
Mom, maybe Miss Ve
didn't mean anything by it.

205
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,280
She doesn't know our family history.
And the toys are still in good condition.

206
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,920
Stop defending her.

207
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,160
You know very well I don't want anyone
in this house to dwell on the past,

208
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,720
whether it's about Mr. Terd
or that girl Hathai.

209
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,840
But Mom, both of them
have been dead for ages.

210
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,120
You're the one who told me

211
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,120
that after Dad's ex-wife
and her daughter left the house,

212
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,200
they were robbed and shot to death.

213
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,120
That was like, 20 years ago.

214
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,400
It has nothing to do with you.

215
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,800
Exactly.

216
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,560
Even though Mr. Terd
and Mrs. Kitinee had their issues,

217
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,920
I came into the picture afterward.

218
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,800
But Dad loved you.

219
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,920
So I don't think you did anything wrong.

220
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,840
Dad chose you and me.

221
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,160
As for the other two,
they left this house on their own as well.

222
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,080
Miss Ve, are you alright?

223
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,080
I'm fine.

224
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,400
I so sorry
for meddling with things in your home

225
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,120
and bringing up
painful memories for Mrs. Sorn.

226
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,040
Still, it's a shame that Mr. Terd's wife
and daughter both died so young.

227
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,840
No one wanted it to happen.
My mom still feels guilty

228
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,040
and deeply regrets it.

229
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,080
I feel sorry for Mrs. Sorn.

230
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,640
But Mrs. Kitinee
and Hathai were victims too.

231
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,600
They were the owners of this house.

232
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,200
They were part of Liangsuttha as well.
If they were still alive,

233
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,680
I would return everything to them.

234
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,640
Oh.

235
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,640
Mr. Ki.

236
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,760
Mrs. Sorn is going to burn those toys.

237
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Mom.

238
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,880
Why are you doing this?

239
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,080
I don't want to see these things anymore.

240
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,600
Is it because of Miss Ve?

241
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,960
Did she remind you of Hathai?

242
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,640
Stop saying that girl's name.
I don't want to hear it again.

243
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,000
I really want to know

244
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,080
if you feel guilty
toward Mrs. Kitinee and Hathai

245
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,760
or you just hate them.

246
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,560
I know

247
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,480
I did a lot of wrong things to those two.

248
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,600
That's why I feel guilty
every time I think about it.

249
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,920
Or do you want me to die like those two?
Would that make you happy?

250
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,360
I should've burned
this stuff a long time ago.

251
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,600
The only reason I kept it this long
was because of you.

252
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,440
But now that someone wants to dig up
things I'd rather forget,

253
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,040
I don't want to keep it anymore.

254
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,760
After I finish teaching Kita tomorrow,
do you have time to meet me?

255
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,640
Here you go.

256
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,040
Just a cup of coffee to say thank you?

257
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,440
Is this the reward I get for helping you?

258
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,880
Yes. Did you expect something more?

259
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,680
Come on. You invited me out.

260
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,680
I think there's more to it.

261
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,160
Like maybe…

262
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,440
I can came over tonight.

263
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,640
I don't want to deal with another scandal
with Mrs. Sorn like last time.

264
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,160
It's not a big deal. I can handle it.

265
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
I'm here, as we agreed.

266
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Uh.

267
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,280
Don't be so hasty.
I'm not ready right now.

268
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,720
Mrs. Sorn thinks I went out.
I don't want anyone to see me now.

269
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,640
I have to go see Kita.

270
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,720
He was whining for his storybook.
If I don't bring it, he won't sleep.

271
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,320
It won't be long.

272
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,720
Alright then. I'll wait.

273
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,480
- Don't take too long.
- I won't.

274
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,760
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?

275
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,200
I'm sorry, Miss Nun.

276
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,480
I was just trying to survive.
I didn't see you there.

277
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,640
Trying to survive?
What are you even talking about?

278
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,080
Mr. Napat went into my room.

279
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,240
Please, Miss Nun, help me.

280
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,200
I don't know what to do anymore.

281
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,160
Miss Nun.

282
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,400
The room's owner came and told me

283
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,600
someone went inside. So I came to check

284
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,000
if she was lying.

285
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,800
Excuse me.

286
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,280
Where are you going, Uncle Pat?

287
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,080
Mom's on her way up.

288
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,440
I told Ki to go bring her here.

289
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,360
Mrs. Sorn.

290
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,080
Please don't get the wrong idea.

291
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,840
You were in Miss Ve's room,
and she clearly didn't consent to it.

292
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,040
I don't think this is
a misunderstanding, do you?

293
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,800
Could it be that

294
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,680
it's more exciting to do it
in someone else’s house?

295
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,920
Everyone's distracted in my room.

296
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,040
If I find any documents about bribery,
I'll send them to you.

297
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,960
SPECIAL PAYMENT REQUEST FORM

298
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,880
WILL

299
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,680
Father's will? "In the event of my death,

300
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,320
I hereby bequeath all of my assets

301
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,440
to

302
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,360
Mrs. Kanisorn Liangsuttha,

303
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
and her alone."

304
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,960
<i>You have to help me.</i>

305
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,160
Mr. Terd refuses to divorce his wife.

306
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,640
If this keeps up,

307
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,640
my son and I will end up with nothing.

308
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,480
I'll find a way to help you.

309
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,600
Then do what you say for once.

310
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,520
Stop feeding me empty promises.

311
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,560
Mr. Terd already started talking to me

312
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
about wanting to write a will.

313
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,240
You can trust me.

314
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,360
<i>What?</i>

315
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,720
Attorney Kittisak passed away?

316
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,720
When?

317
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,920
Almost 20 years ago.

318
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,080
Could you tell me how he passed away?

319
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,920
Suicide.

320
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,880
I was only 15 then.

321
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,680
I still don't know why he did it.

322
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,280
But how do you know my father?

323
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,520
Uh…

324
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,640
He used to work with my dad.

325
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,600
I lived abroad for years
and just recently came back.

326
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
I wanted to visit him once.

327
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,520
I'm sorry for your loss.

328
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,680
Attorney Kittisak.

329
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,520
After finalizing the property transfer,

330
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,840
he committed suicide?

331
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,800
Isn't that a little too convenient?

332
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,360
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY

333
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,960
Dad's blood test results.

334
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,960
NORMAL RANGE: 3.5-5.1

335
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,360
Share this among everyone.

336
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,760
And when cooking, avoid using these
ingredients. Don't serve them to Mr. Terd.

337
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,040
Yes, thank you.

338
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,120
Dad can't eat these things?

339
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,520
He has a heart condition.

340
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
He should avoid anything
high in potassium.

341
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,200
Too much potassium
can worsen several of his conditions.

342
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,840
Dad.

343
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,720
Dad. Dad.

344
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,640
Dad! Dad!

345
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
Dad! Dad!

346
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,200
Someone, help him!

347
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,360
Dad, can you hear me?!

348
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,560
Dear.

349
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,320
Huh?

350
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,400
Because of you,
Mr. Terd ended up like this!

351
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,000
The doctor said his potassium level
was dangerously high.

352
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,520
That made his heart condition worse.

353
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,200
You're the one who picked his meals.

354
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,120
You drugged him on purpose.

355
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,600
Why?

356
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,760
If you didn't love him anymore,
why didn't you just divorce him?

357
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,920
It wasn't me.

358
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,720
You won't confess unless there's proof?

359
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,520
Fine. I'll search your room.

360
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,760
I'm sure I'll find the evidence
of how you did this to him.

361
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,000
We can put her in jail, right?

362
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,440
If we have strong witnesses and evidence,

363
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,760
she won't get away with it.

364
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,960
So you're all conspiring to frame me now?

365
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,880
I'll tell Mr. Terd everything.

366
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,000
He'll never believe you.

367
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,520
If you don't want your child
visiting you in prison,

368
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,120
sign the divorce papers and get out.

369
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,280
Where are we going, Mom?

370
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,360
And why do I have to go too?

371
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
If we don't go,

372
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,400
Kanisorn will make sure we're separated.

373
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,800
If I take you far away
and never come back,

374
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,480
would you be sad, Hathai?

375
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,880
I'll go wherever you go, Mom.

376
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,760
Thank you so much, Hathai.

377
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,960
Hathai, wait here for a bit, okay?

378
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
Okay.

379
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,160
Hathai!

380
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,720
Will we ever see each other again?

381
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,800
Come on, Hathai. Let's go.

382
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,320
Jit just called.
Kitinee and her daughter are leaving.

383
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,400
Pat, go take care of them.

384
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,040
Please listen to me, Mrs. Sorn.
It's a misunderstanding.

385
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,320
Stop making excuses.

386
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,680
Nothing you say will help your case now.

387
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,960
And where is that woman?

388
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,320
Why isn't she here with us?

389
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,960
I'll go find her myself.

390
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,880
I'm sorry.

391
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,720
I was scared, so I didn't dare come in.

392
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,640
But after thinking about it,
I should speak up and tell you

393
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,480
not to harass me like that again.

394
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,320
You're the one
who was flirting with me, teasing me.

395
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,640
You said you'd reward me.
And you called me to your room.

396
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,520
You're a man.

397
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,840
Stop blaming a woman
for something you caused.

398
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,400
Even when I tried
to avoid trouble with Mrs. Sorn,

399
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,440
you still wouldn't stop.

400
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,560
Or are you going to use the CCTV footage
and the coffee bill as evidence now?

401
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,880
You little witch! You!

402
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,880
Hey!

403
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
- Hey, Ki.
- Mr. Ki.

404
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,960
Stop right there, Pat!

405
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,480
You couldn't get away, so you hit a woman?

406
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,199
What are you going to do
about this, Mrs. Sorn?

407
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,120
Apologize to Teacher Ve

408
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,239
and promise never to do this again.

409
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,120
Now!

410
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,640
I'm sorry.

411
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,560
I won't do this to you again.

412
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,280
Mrs. Sorn.

413
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,880
Mrs. Sorn, please listen to me. Mrs. Sorn.

414
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,320
Ugh!

415
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,720
If you want something different,
go buy it elsewhere, not in my house.

416
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,680
- I really was tricked.
- Don't give me that.

417
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,960
I don't care
whether she tricked you or not.

418
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,560
In the end, you were selfish, shameless,

419
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,560
and foolish for doing what you did.

420
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,280
I promise

421
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,640
this won't happen again.

422
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,400
And I'll make it up to you

423
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,520
by getting her
out of this house as soon as possible.

424
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,880
SPECIAL PAYMENT REQUEST FORM

425
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,840
Someone who was just harassed
shouldn't be smiling at her phone already.

426
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,720
That's a bit strange.

427
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,560
Everything's fine now.

428
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,680
I got an apology and a promise from
Mr. Napat that he won't harass me again.

429
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,520
But what's strange is

430
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,240
even after all he's done,
Mrs. Sorn still won't punish him.

431
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,680
He must be really important to Mrs. Sorn.

432
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,640
Seems like you want my mom
to have issues with Uncle Pat.

433
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,120
Why would I want that?

434
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,000
Well, the drama at Uncle Pat's bar,
and now tonight's incident,

435
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,720
got me thinking maybe

436
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,840
you didn't come here just to teach Kita.

437
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,920
Maybe we should all go to bed.
It'll stop the overthinking.

438
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,800
I know Uncle Pat's personality.

439
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,480
If he really liked you,

440
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,520
he wouldn't recklessly do
something like that in this house.

441
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,360
Unless

442
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,840
someone gave him the opportunity.

443
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,400
I can come over tonight.

444
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,920
I don't want to deal with another scandal
with Mrs. Sorn, like last time.

445
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,960
It's not a big deal. I can handle it.

446
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,160
You didn't seem uncomfortable at all
when you were with him at the coffee shop.

447
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,800
If you think I'm untrustworthy,
you can fire me.

448
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,000
I didn't even say anything.
You're jumping to conclusions.

449
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,240
I just want to know what you really feel
about Uncle Pat.

450
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,200
I don't feel anything.

451
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,560
Everything I did
was just to protect myself.

452
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,200
But if you don't believe me,

453
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,680
then I don't know what else to say.

454
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,640
Mr. Pete, you scared me.

455
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,520
I wanted to talk to you,
but I didn't want anyone to see.

456
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,920
I overheard Aunt Kob gossiping
about Mr. Pat going into your room.

457
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,440
I'm the one who tricked him.

458
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,080
Didn't you say you were just here
to investigate your father's death?

459
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,440
Why go this far?

460
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,000
Don’t worry about me.

461
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,080
But if you're afraid that
Mr. Ki will find out you helped me,

462
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,600
I promise I won't say a word.

463
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,440
<i>How could this happen?</i>

464
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,040
At the very least, we should
say we'll offer some compensation.

465
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,760
Why should we compensate them?

466
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,480
Then how about we help as philanthropists?

467
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,560
<i>And here these are the items</i>

468
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,280
<i>Mrs. Kanisorn Liangsuttha</i>
<i>puts up for auction today.</i>

469
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,480
I didn't put
that necklace set up for auction.

470
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,040
Two million.

471
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,200
NEXT EPISODE

472
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,560
<i>Who are you? He claimed he has evidence</i>

473
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,800
that could expose our company.

474
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,080
<i>If you don't want this exposed,</i>
<i>give me 20 million.</i>

475
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,280
I want to know who he is.

476
