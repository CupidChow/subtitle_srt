1
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,080
<i>Prae, is it because of me</i>

2
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,880
<i>that Teacher and Im had to die?</i>

3
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,320
<i>If Ms. Ging really was poisoned,</i>

4
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
<i>shouldn't there be some kind of evidence?</i>

5
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,440
<i>Ging's medicine.</i>

6
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,320
<i>I'm appointing Nunnalin</i>

7
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,840
<i>as the next president of the company.</i>

8
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,080
PREVIOUSLY

9
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
<i>Look. It's Mr. Kirin and his wife.</i>

10
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,000
<i>- Huh?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

11
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,600
I didn't come here today

12
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,200
just as Mr. Ki's wife.

13
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,480
I'm Hathai Liangsuttha.

14
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,040
As far as we know, Mr. Terdthong
and Mrs. Kitinee's child

15
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
had already passed away.

16
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Not yet.

17
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,600
I changed my name to Wanvela
before moving to New Zealand.

18
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,720
And now, I've returned
to let everyone know

19
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,800
that the heir of the Liangsuttha
is still alive.

20
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,880
Did Mr. Kirin and Mrs. Kanisorn
know about this?

21
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,440
Did they?

22
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,960
Ms. Ve.

23
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,040
Even if you try to stop me,

24
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,880
I'll go in anyway.

25
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,000
It's time I face your mother.

26
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,160
But you shouldn't go in alone.

27
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,440
Who said I'm going in alone?

28
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,200
You're coming with me.

29
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,200
I'm giving you one more chance

30
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,240
to do the right thing.

31
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,320
Come with me into the event

32
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,760
and confirm to everyone who I really am.

33
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,240
- I knew.
- Wait, what?

34
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,920
I knew Ms. Ve was Hathai

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,079
before we even got married.

36
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,200
- Oh.
- And I'd like to return

37
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,959
everything that belongs to Liangsuttha

38
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,360
to its rightful heir.

39
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,400
I'm sorry, Mrs. Kanisorn,

40
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,440
for keeping this a secret.

41
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,440
That's all I came here to announce today.

42
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,960
Could you share more details
about your disappearance?

43
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,440
I'll arrange
a press conference another time.

44
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,480
But I think today,

45
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,200
you should focus
on what's happening onstage.

46
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,000
- Oh, right.
- Yes.

47
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,920
- Yeah.
- Ms. Nun! Please talk to us!

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,520
- Can you answer the question?
- Please.

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,640
- Mr. Ki.
- Was it true, Ms. Nun?

50
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,640
- It's time your sister faces the truth.
- Ms. Nun! Please!

51
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,320
Please respond to the press, Ms. Nun.

52
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Please say something.

53
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,880
- Ms. Nun!
- Please give us answer.

54
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,200
- What happened?
- Mom, let's go.

55
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,400
Please say something.

56
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,760
That's enough! No filming.

57
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,360
- Enough. Stop!
- Ms. Nun.

58
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,320
- Hey.
- They just left like that?

59
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,240
You didn't tell me about Lookwa's video.

60
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,720
So what?

61
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,120
Why is your family so afraid of the truth?

62
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,080
Or is it that when your family's at fault,
you choose to look the other way?

63
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,960
Ki, get out. I need to talk to her.

64
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,680
- Mom.
- Go.

65
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,360
- Get out.
- Oh.

66
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
Ah.

67
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,560
Mom. Mom.

68
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,760
Mom! Ms. Ve!

69
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,280
Why are you so angry, Mrs. Sorn?

70
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,400
Weren't you eager to see me?

71
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,320
Well, here I am, in front of you.

72
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,200
No more sneaking around,
spying on your son.

73
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't think

74
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,360
you'll get anything back.

75
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,360
You won't get even a single baht.

76
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,400
Why not?

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,800
I'm Dad's only daughter.

78
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,640
Or would you like me to take a DNA test
to prove I'm truly Hathai?

79
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,920
And are you

80
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,000
even brave enough to let
your daughter take the DNA test too?

81
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,360
Don't think

82
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,400
that just because
you've revealed yourself today,

83
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,840
you're going to get away.

84
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,480
You still have an open case.

85
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,360
If you don't die, you'll go to prison.

86
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,880
You don't have to worry about me.

87
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,280
If this goes through the justice system,
I'm confident I'll come out clean.

88
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,160
I didn't do anything to you.

89
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,560
But you.

90
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,000
I have plenty of evidence

91
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,760
of all your misdeeds.

92
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,040
You!

93
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,480
- Mrs. Sorn!
- Die now.

94
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,800
You want to die that badly, huh?

95
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,840
What are you smiling at?
Why are you smiling?

96
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,080
Open it. This room.

97
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,960
Mom! Mom!

98
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,800
Mom, stop. Mom.

99
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,960
Mom, what are you doing?

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,560
Why are you stopping me?!

101
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,280
Huh? You ungrateful son!

102
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,280
You're teaming up with her to hurt me
and your sister.

103
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,520
So we mean nothing to you anymore, Ki?!

104
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,720
Huh?! Do I mean nothing to you now?!

105
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,120
That's not it, Mom.

106
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,400
It may not be just Ki

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,480
that will have nothing left.

108
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,560
Seems like you and Nun

109
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,360
are about to have everything reclaimed

110
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,320
by the true heir of Liangsuttha.

111
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,720
When did you become my sworn enemy

112
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,600
to the point of
obsessively messing with me?

113
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,720
Since the day you used me.

114
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,280
I was afraid I'd go down too,

115
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,320
for helping you frame Ve,

116
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,920
only to find out
she's Mr. Terdthong's daughter.

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,640
Then I won't drag you
into this any further.

118
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,280
As for you, shut your filthy mouth.

119
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,320
Stay out of my way.

120
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,240
You better mean that.

121
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,559
Because everything we discussed,
I recorded it all.

122
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,000
If I get dragged down,

123
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,840
those recordings
go straight to the police.

124
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,760
And you'll be finished.

125
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,880
Then let's all go down together, shall we?

126
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,640
You think I don't know
what's going on with your family?

127
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,320
I've looked into it.

128
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,800
Your father's been frustrated
and hesitant to invest with me

129
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,360
because he's broke.

130
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,080
Please. Running around trying to
build credit, pretending to be rich?

131
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,040
That's why you've been
chasing Ki like a hawk.

132
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,400
You think I don't know?

133
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,280
What do you think will happen

134
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,880
if people know your family's bankrupt?
I really want to know.

135
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,000
What else do you want me to do?

136
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,280
Anything else I can do

137
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,640
to help you hurt my family?

138
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,360
Sarcasm won't help you.

139
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,400
But I can tell you that

140
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,800
there are many more things
you'll come to regret

141
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,440
because of your family.

142
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,800
What else is there for me to regret?

143
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,520
What are you going to do?

144
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,680
Just say it.

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,960
Yes, Pete?

146
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,360
Uncle Pat's been hospitalized?

147
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,720
Okay, I'm on my way.

148
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,280
Pete called. Uncle Pat was hit by a car.

149
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,720
I'm going to the hospital.

150
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,200
I'll call you.
And if you still want a divorce,

151
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,440
please answer my calls.

152
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Ve.

153
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,120
Are you alright?

154
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,720
I'm fine. Thank you so much for today.

155
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,760
So what should I do next?

156
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,280
Well, the lawyer said

157
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,280
<i>you turned yourself in</i>
<i>and got out on bail.</i>

158
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,520
<i>Now you just need evidence</i>

159
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,760
to support your case.

160
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,120
And I believe
Mintra definitely has something.

161
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,760
I hear you're having issues
with Mrs. Kanisorn.

162
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,080
You.

163
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,920
You're a reporter, aren't you?

164
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,840
If you need help, feel free to contact me.

165
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,680
We just have to wait
for those two to really fall out.

166
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,440
Mintra will definitely come to me.

167
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
Let's hope so.

168
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,240
And what about you and Ki?

169
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
Are you really going to divorce him?

170
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,360
Do you think

171
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,920
there's any hope for me and Mr. Ki?

172
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,400
I don't know.

173
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,120
I'm just an outsider.

174
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,480
When it comes to marriage,

175
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,000
in the end, only the two people involved

176
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,280
really know.

177
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,440
THE MISSING HEIR OF LIANGSUTTHA
CONFESSION CLIP: WHO DROVE THE CAR?

178
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,080
Ms. Nun, someone's here to see you.

179
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,840
Puth?

180
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,400
Why are you here?

181
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,320
I saw the news from yesterday.
I was worried.

182
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,080
You don't have to worry.

183
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,520
Please leave.
You should go before Singha arrives.

184
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,880
Why are you so afraid of him?

185
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,360
I just came to visit.
It's not like we did anything wrong.

186
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,000
Why didn't you tell me
we had a guest, Nun?

187
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,880
I came on my own.
I didn't tell her in advance.

188
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,400
I saw the news yesterday and got worried.

189
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,760
It's nothing.

190
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,240
It's probably just an edited video.

191
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,160
And that daughter of Uncle Terd

192
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,360
is probably a con artist.

193
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,880
My dad and I can handle this nonsense.

194
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,200
Now that I know someone's helping Nun,
I'm relieved.

195
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,280
She's my wife.

196
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,240
Of course I'll help her.

197
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,360
Singha.

198
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,200
You saw it, right?

199
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,120
Puth just came to visit.

200
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,760
There's really nothing
going on between us.

201
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,240
I saw it.

202
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,200
But I don't believe it!

203
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,440
Where are you going?

204
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,960
TRUE LIANGSUTTHA HEIR REVEALED
AFTER OVER 20 YEARS DISAPPEARANCE

205
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,960
The news from that day is everywhere.

206
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,560
Pat.

207
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,120
Napat!

208
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,160
He can't clean up the mess you made.

209
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,960
He's unconscious now.

210
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,720
And you?

211
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,600
Have you ever done anything
to help me and your sister?

212
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,120
Or are you only trying to help her?

213
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,680
You knew

214
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,720
she was Hathai, didn't you?
Why didn't you tell me?

215
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,560
And you still married her?

216
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,280
Did you really not know

217
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,960
she was Hathai?

218
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,280
You hated her so much
and did everything to kick her out.

219
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,400
Wasn't it because you already knew?

220
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,600
No.

221
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,520
I didn't know.
I hated her because she deceived you.

222
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,080
I used to believe that too.

223
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,760
And I never believed you were capable
of something so evil as murder.

224
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,800
That's why I tried to end all this

225
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,640
by taking us away from here.

226
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,400
But you wouldn't stop.

227
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,000
Why?

228
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,560
Did you really think it would all end
if we gave everything back to her?

229
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,960
You already saw

230
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,000
what disaster she brought to us.

231
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,400
If I do nothing,

232
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,360
how will my children survive?

233
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,280
How would I protect my children?

234
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,560
I'm willing

235
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,560
to get my hands dirty

236
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,680
to protect my children.

237
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,240
But did I ever ask you to do that?

238
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,200
If you insist you did it all
for me and Nun,

239
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,920
then please stop right now.

240
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,880
Hello? Yes, Nun?

241
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,440
<i>Mom…</i>

242
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,840
<i>I want to come home, Mom.</i>

243
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,720
<i>Please help me…</i>

244
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,080
Why? What happened?!

245
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,480
What's going on with Nun?

246
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,480
It's nothing. Stay out of it.

247
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,359
Mom.

248
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,720
- Huh? Nun.
- Mom…

249
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,240
- Mom…
- Nun.

250
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,680
- Mom, help me.
- Nun.

251
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,880
- Mom.
- My girl.

252
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
- My girl.
- Mom, please take me home.

253
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,320
I don't want to be here anymore.

254
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,800
Okay, okay.

255
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,800
Nun. Hey.

256
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,320
Singha really did this to you?

257
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,240
Huh?

258
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,200
Singha.

259
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,240
You said you loved her so much.

260
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,880
Why did you do this to my daughter?!

261
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,280
Husbands and wives argue sometimes.

262
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,480
Besides, you know how your daughter acts.

263
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,000
She even had Wiputh come see her.

264
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,840
Mom, I want a divorce.

265
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,560
I want a divorce.
Please take me home, Mom.

266
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
- Take me home.
- You're not getting a divorce.

267
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,640
And you're not leaving either.

268
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,880
I'll call the police.

269
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,360
This house has cameras.

270
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,960
I have proof you hurt me.

271
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,240
You think I'd keep evidence
that incriminates me?

272
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,480
I destroyed all those cameras.

273
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,400
And by the way,

274
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
I've helped you many times.

275
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,280
You should know what kind of person I am.

276
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,400
Don't make me angrier than I already am.

277
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,920
Mom…

278
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,280
Mom…

279
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,440
Kita.

280
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,360
Yes, Dad?

281
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,720
I know I've been busy lately.

282
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,080
Please understand me.

283
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,760
I know.

284
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,480
I won't cause you any more trouble.

285
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,760
Why are you zoning out?

286
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,080
You're thinking about Mr. Ki?

287
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
No.

288
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,280
I'm thinking about Kita.

289
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,520
Ever since it happened,
I worry how he's doing without me.

290
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,720
Oh? Didn't Mr. Pete say
he found a replacement teacher for him?

291
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,720
Stop worrying about Kita
and worry about yourself.

292
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,320
And worry about your friend here too.

293
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
Well.

294
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,720
You're so good at everything.
What's there to worry about?

295
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,080
Well, it just sucks.

296
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,240
Even Kita matters more than I do.

297
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,200
But you know? To me,
you're the most important person.

298
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,440
In the end,
I'm just your white blood cell.

299
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,840
What's that supposed to mean?

300
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,080
Ugh. Well, when we die,

301
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,560
all our organs stop working.

302
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,160
Only white blood cells

303
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,960
keep functioning for another 12 hours.

304
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,680
So… if one day you're left all alone,

305
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,720
you'll still have me by your side
until your very last moment.

306
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Wow, that's so ridiculously deep,

307
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Prae.

308
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,360
Hey. But I made you smile, didn't I?

309
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,120
See? You're smiling again. Look.

310
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,320
You're smiling.

311
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,600
Finish your food.
You'll need your strength. Eat up.

312
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,600
Nun.

313
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,960
Please endure it a little longer.

314
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,080
We still have to rely on Singha.

315
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,000
For your case,

316
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,800
and for my work too,

317
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,160
okay?

318
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,280
Listen.

319
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,960
Just try not to make him angry,

320
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,760
alright?

321
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,080
So you're telling me to endure it?

322
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,200
Just a little longer.

323
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,040
It won't be long. I'll come get--

324
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Mom.

325
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,480
Do you even know what I've been through?

326
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,320
Mom…

327
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,760
Nun.

328
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,040
He hurt you this much?

329
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Mom…

330
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,560
What did I do in my past life

331
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,880
to deserve this?

332
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,200
<i>I agreed to confess,</i>

333
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,920
and I'd still get punished.

334
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,360
I wouldn't get to see my mom anyway.

335
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,360
Your mom's responding well to treatment.
She's getting better.

336
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,680
You don't need to worry.

337
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,680
If it weren't for you,

338
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,760
I would've lost my mom.

339
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,600
I took the blame for Nun.

340
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,680
Ever since I was jailed,

341
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,560
they never cared about me again.

342
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,200
I called for help when Mom
needed emergency surgery

343
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,320
and they ignored me.

344
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,760
If this case is reopened,
please tell the truth like you told me.

345
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,240
Don't take back your words.

346
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,000
Just like you love your mom
and your family,

347
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,360
the victim's family does too.

348
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,400
They deserve justice too.

349
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,080
The real culprit must be punished.

350
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,040
Not a paid scapegoat like you.

351
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,760
How was it?

352
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,640
Lookwa insists she won't take it back.

353
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,240
That's a relief.

354
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,840
So now we have the dashcam footage,

355
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,760
and a key witness.

356
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,600
If we add public pressure,

357
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,680
we should be able
to reopen the case, right?

358
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,960
Absolutely.

359
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,800
If both of you are ready

360
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,480
to move forward
on behalf of the victim's family,

361
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,360
they're ready

362
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,400
to proceed with reopening the case.

363
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,160
I know what you're thinking.

364
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,720
Stop it. Your compassion
is getting ahead of you.

365
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,040
Even if you see Nunnalin
as a younger sister,

366
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,800
she, as a culprit, must be punished.

367
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,760
What about Mr. Terdthong
and Ms. Gingyok's cases?

368
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,400
We can talk about that later.

369
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,000
Then I'll take my leave.

370
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,600
Why didn't you tell him
your decision about those cases?

371
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,920
I don't have clear evidence yet about Dad.

372
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,880
As for Ms. Gingyok,
I should ask Miss Ploy first.

373
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,640
That's true. Since it's her sister,
she should decide.

374
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,080
But Ms. Gingyok's case

375
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,000
doesn't just involve her decision alone.

376
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,600
Ms. Ve said you wouldn't answer her calls.

377
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,640
So you rushed over
to get me to answer instead?

378
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,680
I came because I'm worried about you.

379
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,080
I know you're upset about your sister.

380
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,840
You can talk to me.

381
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,520
Why would I?

382
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,120
Because right now
I'm the only one who cares.

383
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,360
You can't even talk
to your grandma about it.

384
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,680
If you were me,

385
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,880
what would you do?

386
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,320
I'd tell Ki the truth.

387
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,680
Even if he married Ms. Ging
because of Aunt Sorn,

388
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,040
he once told me

389
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,200
Ms. Gingyok was the joy in his life.

390
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,880
And if Ki was involved in her death?

391
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,600
I wouldn't be able to take it
if the man she loved the most…

392
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,600
caused her death.

393
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,160
If that's true,

394
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,520
I'll help you send him to jail.

395
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,080
The person who caused her death
must be punished.

396
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,000
Even if you don't trust Ki,

397
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,360
please trust me.

398
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,560
These are Ging's pills I kept.

399
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,600
LAB TEST RESULTS

400
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,600
What are you trying to say, Ploy?

401
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,960
Grandma had Ve investigate Ging's death.

402
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,320
She never believed it was an accident.

403
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,760
No wonder you and Grandma
seemed to have some kind of deal.

404
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,960
I found the doctor who treated her.

405
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,480
He told me

406
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,280
her condition worsened suddenly,
even though she had been stable.

407
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,480
These pills tested positive for potassium.

408
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,240
You should know

409
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,200
what happens when a heart patient
gets too much potassium.

410
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,720
That should be clear enough.

411
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,160
Someone switched her meds.

412
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,280
These pills

413
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,280
might still have
the culprit's fingerprints on them.

414
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,480
What will you do now, Ki?

415
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,520
I'm sorry, Ploy.

416
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,160
I won't judge anything

417
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,200
until we have proof,
like the fingerprints you mentioned.

418
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,440
Are you accusing me of
falsely blaming someone in your family?

419
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,280
This is about Ging's death.

420
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,360
I won't jump to conclusions
until everything's clear.

421
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,800
If you still hope
Aunt Sorn wasn't involved,

422
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,240
I'll show you the truth myself.

423
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,000
Miss Ploy.

424
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,920
Miss Ploy probably
didn't mean to say it like that.

425
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,320
I understand her.

426
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,320
I'm just as heartbroken.

427
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,520
If Ging's death…

428
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,560
was murder, not an accident,

429
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,600
that means

430
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,920
I failed to protect her.

431
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,720
I've never been able to protect anyone.

432
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,360
I understand how you feel

433
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,600
because I…

434
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,400
I've never been able
to protect those I love either.

435
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,240
I have to go now.

436
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,800
Ve.

437
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,080
Are you okay?

438
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,560
The one who's probably not okay is Ki.

439
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,240
Are you softening toward him again?

440
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,000
I just feel sorry for him.

441
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,480
But I've come too far
to let my heart soften now.

442
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
Ve.

443
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,160
You don't have
to force yourself like this.

444
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,200
I know you're hurting
just as much as Mr. Ki.

445
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,520
You love him.

446
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,520
No matter how much you try to hate him,
you can't.

447
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,800
Didn't you say you were rational?

448
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,800
We agreed on this already, right?

449
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,080
Don't be stubborn.

450
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,160
Try to understand how Ki feels.

451
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,160
I'm sorry for how aggressive I sounded.

452
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,520
From your perspective,

453
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,600
no one would want to
believe something like that easily,

454
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,880
especially when it's about
their own family.

455
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,760
What you said was right.

456
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,960
There needs to be evidence.

457
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,360
Thank you so much

458
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,320
for understanding me, Ploy.

459
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,200
Ve!

460
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,000
Prae!

461
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
Hey!

462
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,680
Hey! Stop!

463
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,600
Let's go! Now!

464
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,080
- Hey!
- Prae!

465
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,440
- Prae!
- Stop!

466
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,200
Ms. Ve. Miss Prae!

467
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,200
Mr. Ki, please help Prae. Please help her.

468
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,520
You're okay, right?

469
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,120
I'm fine,
but you need to stay strong, Prae.

470
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,280
Mr. Ki already called an ambulance.
Hang in there, Prae.

471
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,880
Prae… Prae…

472
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,560
Miss Prae, the ambulance's on its way.

473
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,560
I guess this is all
I can do for you now, Ve.

474
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,000
I'll leave the rest to Mr. Ki.

475
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,840
Don't say that. Don't leave me, Prae.

476
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,440
Teacher, there's a fight over here!

477
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,080
Thanks for helping. What's your name?

478
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,720
Praepai.

479
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,800
You're friends now,

480
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,240
Hathai, Prae.

481
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,200
Stay by each other's side.
Don't leave each other.

482
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,360
I'll be by your side.

483
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,000
Me too.

484
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,080
TEACHER RAWEE'S ORPHANAGE

485
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,600
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>I'm just your white blood cell.</i>

486
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,880
What's that supposed to mean?

487
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,400
When we die, all our organs stop working.

488
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,760
Only white blood cells
keep functioning for another 12 hours.

489
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,560
So… if one day you're left all alone,

490
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,440
you'll still have me by your side

491
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,840
until your very last moment.

492
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,280
Prae. Prae…

493
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,880
Prae!

494
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,760
Prae!

495
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,320
Prae, wake up!

496
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,760
So, did Ve die yet?

497
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,720
She survived.

498
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,200
But her friend's dead.

499
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,840
Come on.

500
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,400
Consider it as if I've chopped
one of her limbs off for now.

501
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,920
I'll take care of her again next time.

502
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,400
In that case,

503
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,680
may I take Nun back home for a while?

504
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,639
Why should I move my toy somewhere else?

505
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,760
Did you just call Nun a toy?

506
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,840
Oh?

507
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,679
Honestly,

508
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,080
I've always dreamed of having

509
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,239
a spoiled and arrogant socialite
like Ms. Nun as a wife.

510
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,719
And the look on her face

511
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,960
when she begged me for her life…

512
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,360
was so damn priceless.

513
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,960
I forgot to mention.

514
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,880
She even got down and bowed to my feet.

515
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,560
Nun is not anyone's toy!

516
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,840
Ve.

517
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,520
Maybe you should go get changed.

518
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,600
I'm sorry about your friend.

519
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,280
You.

520
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,720
Singha sent those men.

521
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
What do you want by telling me this?

522
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,440
If you want evidence,
come to Singha's house.

523
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,720
<i>Come alone.</i>

524
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,240
Where's Ms. Ve?

525
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,920
I came with you. How would I know?

526
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,120
Ploy.

527
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,040
Where's Ms. Ve?

528
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Oh?

529
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,760
I just gave her clothes to change into,

530
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,760
but she's not in the bathroom.

531
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,480
Hey.

532
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,520
What's going on?

533
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,000
She took my car.

534
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,200
She's in here, officer.

535
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,360
She's here.

536
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,240
<i>Whoever murdered my son</i>

537
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,200
<i>will have to pay. I'll make sure of it!</i>

538
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,480
Even if Ki never said it,

539
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,120
I know

540
