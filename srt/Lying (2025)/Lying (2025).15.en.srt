1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,200
<i>I want all of Gingyok's shares</i>
<i>in Jade Biz back</i>

2
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,080
before I accidentally

3
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,160
leak Kirin's test results.

4
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,600
<i>I nominate Miss Nunnalin</i>

5
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,800
to be the new president of Suttha Group.

6
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,600
Wait.

7
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,440
Allow me a moment to speak with my mother

8
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,720
and grandmother.

9
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,240
You did it to my son?!

10
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,280
- Were you trying to kill my son?!
- Mom.

11
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,800
<i>Did she cost her the position?</i>

12
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,480
Can you help me again?

13
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,040
PREVIOUSLY

14
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,880
Ah.

15
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,920
<i>We've got that woman, boss.</i>

16
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,800
Good. I'll head there now.

17
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,640
I've already sent Ve's photo.

18
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,200
She's heading to meet Ki
at the restaurant now.

19
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,880
<i>I'll send someone</i>
<i>to take care of it from here.</i>

20
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,040
Thanks a lot, Singha.

21
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,600
If this works out,

22
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,720
I won't forget my promise.

23
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,560
Mom…

24
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,600
What were you talking
with Mr. Singha about?

25
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,240
- Just ignore it.
- But

26
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,600
I saw you send
Wanvela's photo to Mr. Singha.

27
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,360
What are you two planning?

28
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,080
Whatever I'm doing, stay out of it.

29
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,320
Pretend you don't know anything.

30
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Mom,

31
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,760
please don't take it any further.

32
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,720
Nun.

33
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,040
If I hadn't done what I did, would you
be living a good life right now?

34
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,519
Hm?

35
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,720
Mm.

36
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,640
Mom,

37
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,440
why are you taking my phone?

38
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,200
Stay off your phone for a while.

39
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,280
No social media, no contact with anyone

40
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,040
so your stress doesn't flare up again.

41
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,120
If you still see me as your mother,

42
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,400
stay out of it.

43
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,400
But if you want to see me in trouble,
want to see me dead, go ahead.

44
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,440
Do whatever you want.

45
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,160
Why does Kita need another tutor?

46
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,320
I think now that Ms. Ve's
already married to Ki,

47
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,040
she should be able to
care for him like before.

48
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,400
Just in case.

49
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,840
I don't know how much longer she'll stay.

50
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,640
Why?

51
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,720
Because nothing in life is certain.

52
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,520
What if they break up

53
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,320
or something happens?

54
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,040
Kita needs someone
to look after him regardless.

55
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,800
But they seem fine to me.

56
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,640
Besides,

57
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,840
they just got married not long ago.

58
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,120
Why are you being so pessimistic?

59
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,600
You're not from this family.

60
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,880
You wouldn't understand.

61
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,240
Just find Mom a new tutor.

62
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
Besides,

63
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,200
don't bring anyone
who's just out to marry rich

64
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,240
to climb the social ladder again.

65
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,320
Here.

66
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
Consider this your payment

67
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,200
for helping find someone new for Mom.

68
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Nun.

69
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,160
Why did you say that to Pete?

70
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,600
Because it's true.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,320
If money can solve it,

72
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,960
I'm willing to pay.

73
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,040
Take it, Pete.

74
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,680
- Kita.
- Yes?

75
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,320
Is there anything in particular
you'd like to eat today?

76
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,680
Yes. I want to eat everything.

77
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,600
Let's go sit over there
by the garden, Dad.

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,360
Hey, I'm at the restaurant now.

79
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,920
You know, Kita's so happy

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,760
that we're all having a meal together.

81
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,960
I have a quick meeting at Jade Biz.

82
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,040
I'm happy too,

83
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,000
that I get to eat with you and Kita.

84
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,280
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

85
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,680
Once I finish here, I'll come right away.

86
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,800
You're having dinner

87
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,280
with Ki and Kita?

88
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,760
Yes.

89
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,280
Mr. Ki wants to take Kita
to his favorite restaurant.

90
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,560
Oh, that place?

91
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,680
Actually, it's not just Kita
who likes that place.

92
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,080
My sister liked it too.

93
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,920
I see.

94
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,120
Anyway, thank you

95
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,400
for returning
all of Ging's shares to Kita.

96
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,080
I never wanted anyone else's things.

97
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,320
And I never planned to
replace anyone either.

98
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,920
But there's something I must accomplish.

99
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Once I do,

100
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
I'll leave this place on my own.

101
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,880
Leave Ki?

102
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,800
If that's really how you feel,

103
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,680
then once you're gone,

104
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,200
I'll be the one to take care
of Ki and Kita.

105
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,480
That's up to you.

106
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,640
Here's the document you wanted.
I've signed it.

107
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,760
I'll be going now.

108
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,320
Does Nun think I'm that money-hungry

109
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,080
to throw a check in my face like that?

110
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,520
If money can solve it,

111
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,720
I'm willing to pay.

112
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,520
Take it, Pete.

113
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,880
WANVELA

114
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Wanvela?

115
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,880
Is something wrong, Pete?

116
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh.

117
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,920
It's nothing, Auntie.

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
I'll get going now.

119
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,080
- Goodbye.
- Alright.

120
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,360
I don't want to hurt anyone anymore.

121
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,440
But this is all I can do, Pob.

122
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Oh.

123
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,760
Wan…

124
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,800
‪PETE

125
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,800
Hello?

126
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,960
Who are you?
Why are you answering Ms. Ve's phone?

127
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,400
You recognize the phone's owner's voice,

128
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,440
but not mine?

129
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,360
With that annoying tone,

130
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,920
<i>it can only be one person,</i>

131
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,840
Miss Gingploy.

132
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,000
Hey.

133
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,800
Is Ms. Ve with you?

134
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,480
No. She forgot her phone here.

135
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,080
Where did she go?

136
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,480
<i>Is it urgent?</i>

137
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,640
You seem desperate to reach her.

138
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,440
Just tell me where she is.

139
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,160
Everything else
has nothing to do with you.

140
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,480
Why do you even care?

141
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,520
Fine. You're not gonna tell me?

142
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,560
Then go find her yourself.

143
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,680
Bye.

144
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,160
<i>Hey, wait.</i>

145
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,800
Well.

146
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,720
<i>Okay, I'll tell you.</i>

147
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,560
I'm at Ki's house.

148
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,400
Nun wrote Wanvela's name
on the back of your check?

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
<i>Why?</i>

150
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,400
Wanvela's supposed to have dinner with Ki.

151
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,240
I know where that restaurant is.

152
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,840
I'll send you the location. Okay.

153
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,000
How about ordering now
and waiting for her?

154
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,800
No, I'll wait for her, Dad.

155
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,680
Alright.

156
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,960
I'll call her and check

157
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,880
where she is.

158
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
Okay.

159
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,200
Here are the flowers
for Ms. Ve that you ordered.

160
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,800
I was worried they'd be delivered late,

161
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,480
so I ordered early
and dropped them off here.

162
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
Hm?

163
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,840
Dad got flowers for Teacher Ve too?

164
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
- Mr. It, please watch Kita for me.
- Yes?

165
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Sure.

166
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,840
Where are you going, Mr. Ki?

167
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,880
Ms. Ve.

168
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,440
Hey. Ms. Ve!

169
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,280
Hey!

170
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,400
We've got that woman, boss.

171
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,840
Good.

172
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,920
I'll head there now.

173
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,560
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,000
What?

175
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,120
Put her here for now.

176
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,680
Watch her. I'll be back.

177
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,760
And send a photo to Boss.

178
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,000
Mr. Pete.

179
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,160
What are you doing?

180
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,000
I just want to talk to you
before you go in to see Ki.

181
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,920
What is it?

182
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,640
Why scare me like that?

183
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,880
<i>It seemed like Nun wanted</i>
<i>to tell me something about you.</i>

184
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,520
<i>So I had to come find you.</i>

185
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,960
Shall we go?

186
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,560
Kita.

187
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,920
Where's Mr. Ki?

188
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,360
I'm not sure either.

189
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,240
He suddenly walked out of the restaurant

190
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,800
and called to say that if Kita
finishes eating, I can take him home.

191
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,680
But his voice didn't sound good.

192
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,840
Like something's wrong.

193
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,720
Um, Mr. It,

194
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,760
please take Kita home.

195
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,760
I'll get in touch with Mr. Ki myself.

196
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,960
Okay. Oh,

197
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,840
Mr. Ki also ordered flowers for you.

198
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,720
Mm.

199
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,440
Then please

200
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,840
take them home for me, Mr. It.

201
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,840
Alright, sure.

202
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,760
Let's go, Kita.

203
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,640
See you at home.

204
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,720
Miss Ploy suddenly disappeared,
and now Ki's missing too.

205
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,120
I can't reach Miss Ploy at all.

206
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,000
Hey.

207
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,440
Mr. Pete, it's Miss Ploy's cardigan.

208
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
Help!

209
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,640
You told me earlier

210
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,640
that my phone was with Miss Ploy, right?

211
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,840
Yes.

212
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,520
Then please call Mr. Ki

213
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,520
and ask what's going on.

214
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,880
I'll figure out how to find Miss Ploy.

215
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,040
Okay.

216
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,760
She's kind of pretty.

217
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,240
Ow!

218
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,760
- Dammit!
- Help!

219
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,880
So the one I saw

220
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,880
was Ploy?

221
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,120
<i>I'm sure it was.</i>

222
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,200
I saw her cardigan on the ground

223
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,160
and I couldn't contact her either.

224
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,000
Why would they take Miss Ploy?

225
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,840
I've found my phone's location.

226
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Then send the location to Ki.

227
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,400
He's probably closer
to Miss Ploy than we are.

228
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,920
Okay.

229
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,360
HEAD SOUTH

230
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,600
Hey! Where are you running off to?!

231
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,600
Hey! Stop right there.

232
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,400
Hey, I said stop!

233
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,200
Boss said,

234
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,120
if you give us too much trouble,

235
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,840
we can just hide your corpse here.

236
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,640
- Hey, wait.
- What?

237
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,200
Let me have some fun with her first.

238
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,440
Hey!

239
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,320
Ow! Damn it!

240
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,200
Playing hard to get, huh?

241
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,920
Then die here.

242
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Hey, what the hell?

243
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,560
Ploy.

244
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,400
Kill him.

245
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,240
You're so tough, huh?

246
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,920
Hey! The police are coming!

247
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,480
You're not getting away!

248
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Let's get out of here.

249
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,800
- Mr. Ki.
- Miss Ploy.

250
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,720
Are you okay?

251
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,280
I'm fine, but Ploy…

252
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Blood?

253
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,800
You idiots!

254
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,840
Still don't realize
you got the wrong person.

255
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,040
We saw the photo you sent.

256
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,760
We thought it was her.

257
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,120
But don't worry, boss.

258
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,760
We didn't mention your name at all.

259
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,080
So what?

260
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,760
If your slip-up exposes me,

261
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,240
I won't let you live.

262
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
I'm sorry, boss.

263
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,040
You're sorry? Huh?!

264
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,200
How am I supposed
to explain this to Aunt Sorn?!

265
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,520
Because of your stupidity,

266
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,360
this is all messed up!

267
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,200
Damn it!

268
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,560
I shouldn't have let
Miss Ploy get involved.

269
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,080
She's with the doctor now. She'll be okay.

270
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,520
Are you sure you're not hurt?

271
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,360
Want to get checked just in case?

272
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,480
You're worried about me too?

273
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,280
Miss Ploy really didn't deserve this.

274
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,200
It's all my fault.

275
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,120
She got kidnapped

276
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,120
because those thugs

277
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,840
took the wrong person?

278
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,160
Yes.

279
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,600
I'm sure they didn't mean
to take Miss Ploy.

280
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,960
They must've thought she was you.

281
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,000
Even when I first saw her
get dragged away,

282
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,520
I thought it was you.

283
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,600
I'll report this to the police.
They need to find out

284
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,720
who they are and what they want.

285
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,320
No need.

286
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,960
I already have an idea who's behind this.

287
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,400
I said come out!

288
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,760
What do you think you're doing?

289
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,720
Ah!

290
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,240
You know who they are?

291
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,160
I'm sure I know who did this.

292
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,120
And I won't let things
end quietly like last time.

293
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,240
Why did Singha suddenly disappear?

294
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,080
What exactly did you ask him to do?

295
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,280
Stay out of it.

296
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,000
But Ki still hasn't come home either.

297
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,840
I'm worried about him.

298
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,000
Ki's fine. Singha's not an idiot.

299
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,320
What are you doing?

300
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,600
I'm taking back my phone.

301
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,920
Where is it, Mom?

302
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,680
- Mom.
- Nun, stop.

303
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,640
I'm calling Singha.
I'm telling him to stop everything.

304
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,760
I don't want anyone to get hurt anymore.

305
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,040
Are you even my daughter?

306
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,960
You're taking the side
of someone who's my enemy.

307
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,440
I don't like her either.

308
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,080
But I just don't understand
why you hate Wanvela so much.

309
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,680
She's already married to Ki now.

310
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,640
But I won't accept her. I never will.

311
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,880
I'll find a way
to get her out of our lives,

312
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,600
just like her mother.

313
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,000
Wanvela's mother?

314
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,440
Who is her mother?

315
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,440
Ki.

316
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,640
Why are you only just getting back now?

317
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,160
How could Singha mess this up?

318
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,080
You probably
won't be able to sleep tonight.

319
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,880
Nothing turned out the way you expected.

320
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,960
What are you talking about?

321
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,200
There's no one else around.

322
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,960
No need to keep pretending
like you don't know what I mean.

323
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,360
It's not convincing at all.

324
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,880
You.

325
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,280
You want me dead that badly, don't you?

326
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,440
Why?

327
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,640
Are you trying to accuse me
of something again?

328
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,800
You ordered Singha to have people hurt me.

329
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,760
Too bad they failed.

330
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,800
I guess I'm just too lucky to die.

331
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,800
If anyone wants me dead,

332
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,840
I'll just keep on living
and won't die easily.

333
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,360
Let the ones with bad intentions

334
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,640
destroy themselves.

335
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,920
I hope you keep up
that confidence forever.

336
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,240
I'd really like to know

337
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,880
how long your luck will last.

338
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,760
But I'm not so sure

339
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,560
how much longer
you'll be around to see it.

340
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,320
Because the one who suffered in my place
was Miss Gingploy.

341
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,480
And I believe that

342
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,880
when Miss Gingploy wakes up,

343
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,240
she won't ever let the person

344
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,160
who hurt her that badly get away with it.

345
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,000
Ki.

346
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,920
What happened?

347
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,640
Someone tried to hurt Ms. Ve.

348
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,640
But Ploy took the hit instead.

349
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,960
She still hasn't woken up.

350
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,760
Nun,

351
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,960
Pete told me about the check you wrote.

352
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,400
Why did you write Ms. Ve's name
on the back of it?

353
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,480
Do you know something?

354
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,960
Really?

355
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,200
I have no idea what I wrote on it.

356
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,640
Nun,

357
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,960
just tell me if you know something.

358
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,640
We can fix this together.

359
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,240
If you still see me as your mother,

360
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,600
stay out of it.

361
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,520
But if you want to see me in trouble,
want to see me dead, go ahead.

362
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,400
Do whatever you want.

363
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,800
I don't know anything.

364
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,760
Maybe Pete misunderstood.

365
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,880
I'm going to bed.

366
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,960
Miss Ploy.

367
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,960
Please wake up soon.

368
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,240
Wake up so you can yell at me again.

369
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,560
You…

370
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
Ms. Prae?

371
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,480
I heard about Miss Gingploy from Ve.

372
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,920
So I wanted to stop by and visit.

373
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,200
And I also wanted to talk to you.

374
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,000
Could you tell me what exactly happened?

375
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,360
From what I know,
you're a reporter, not a cop.

376
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,640
So,

377
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,760
you're just going to let
this story disappear?

378
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,280
Manager, what's going on here?!

379
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,280
I've been waiting to sign
a 100-million-baht contract

380
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,240
and I've been kept waiting
for almost an hour!

381
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
Uh…

382
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,240
Mr. Wiputh said he'd be just a moment.

383
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
It's been way more than a moment!

384
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,120
So tell me, does Vutprapa
still want to partner with us or not?

385
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,120
I'll speak to Mr. Sajja
and Mr. Singha myself.

386
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,720
- You can go.
- Yes, sir.

387
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,840
Is this

388
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,120
how you treat an investment partner?

389
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,920
You're the only son
of the Vutprapa family,

390
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,280
and this is how you manage
the family business?

391
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,160
I really wonder
if Mr. Wittaya, your father,

392
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,920
is even afraid
the company will go bankrupt.

393
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,960
My father's not afraid.

394
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,000
Because if we're going
to choose someone to partner with,

395
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,800
we have to select carefully.

396
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
We can't just partner with anyone.

397
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,000
What's that supposed to mean?

398
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,400
Looks like you haven't seen the news.

399
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,520
Excuse me.

400
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,560
<i>Socialite kidnapped</i>

401
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,440
<i>and assaulted last night.</i>

402
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,640
<i>Witnesses spotted</i>
<i>a suspicious vehicle at the scene.</i>

403
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,080
<i>Turns out it belongs to the hot-headed son</i>

404
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,720
<i>of a powerful businessman</i>
<i>with a notorious reputation.</i>

405
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,240
<i>Once the victim wakes up,</i>
<i>the truth will come out.</i>

406
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,680
It's pretty clear
who the news is talking about.

407
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,600
Mr. Sajja,
do you really think I can do business

408
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,880
with someone involved in a case like this?

409
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,800
Uh… please wait.

410
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,480
This might just be a misunderstanding.

411
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,720
Or maybe someone is trying

412
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,480
to frame my son.

413
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,920
I don't care.

414
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
There will be no signing
of any contract today

415
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,760
until this news
about your son is cleared up.

416
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,680
So you made me and my father wait

417
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,360
just to say this?

418
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,200
Please excuse me.

419
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,480
Dad.

420
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,880
Well…

421
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,480
Do you even realize what you've done?!

422
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,480
I told you not to do anything

423
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,320
until I signed the contract with Vutprapa!

424
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,760
Do you know

425
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,080
how much I've lost

426
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,120
if I don't get this contract signed?!

427
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,760
Damn it!

428
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,880
HOT NEWS

429
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,280
But this kind of evidence
won't do much against Singha.

430
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,360
Still, with this news,

431
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,280
his reputation's already taken a hit.

432
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,480
The major media outlets
will likely run with this.

433
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,280
Yeah, the editor just called me.

434
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,240
He told me to go cover the story
on Singha and Miss Ploy seriously.

435
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,480
So you don't need to do
those underground reports anymore?

436
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,320
Why would I?

437
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,960
The mainstream media already picked it up.

438
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,280
Much bigger impact.

439
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,560
The more coverage Singha gets,

440
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,560
the sooner the mastermind behind him
will have to face the music.

441
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Mrs. Sorn.

442
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,680
Were you the one who told my son, Singha,

443
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,480
to do all those awful things?

444
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,920
About that… I--

445
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,880
Let me ask you seriously.

446
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,160
If you needed help,

447
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,080
why didn't you just come to me?

448
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,640
Why did you have to go through my son?

449
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,680
And now look.

450
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,400
Journalists have been calling me

451
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,360
nonstop every day.

452
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,200
I'm losing my mind here.

453
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,520
It's just baseless gossip.

454
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,960
It'll go quiet soon enough.

455
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,880
Go quiet?

456
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,640
Do you know how much damage
this has done to my business?

457
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,800
Everything I'm working on is now on hold.

458
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,160
I never thought
it would blow up like this.

459
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,080
You need to fix this immediately.

460
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,280
Otherwise,

461
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,120
I won't go down alone.

462
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,120
And the business deals we discussed,

463
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,240
consider them all canceled.

464
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,120
Oh,

465
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,200
and that favor you asked me
to help lobby the board of directors.

466
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,160
Who knows?

467
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,600
That might become a headline too.

468
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,440
Oh, Singha.

469
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,960
People like to believe

470
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,320
karma will take care of things
without them having to lift a finger.

471
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,240
But for me,

472
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,440
nothing comes without action.

473
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,560
That includes punishing bad people.

474
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,840
The news about Singha,
was that your doing?

475
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,480
And Miss Ploy hasn't woken up
because of you, right?

476
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,560
If you answer me, I'll answer you.

477
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,160
But someone like you
wouldn't confess so easily,

478
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,880
would you?

479
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,640
Strange, isn't it?

480
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,920
That you agreed to meet me today.

481
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,880
Usually,

482
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,800
you can't even stand to see my face.

483
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,280
I need to ask you something.

484
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,880
What is it?

485
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,360
About Singha.

486
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,080
I was about to do business with Mr. Sajja,

487
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,320
but then this news about his son came out.

488
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,800
For your business,

489
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,240
there's nothing I can help you with.

490
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,200
Excuse me.

491
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,040
I want to know if you're still seeing him.

492
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,520
Why?

493
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,600
Why do you even care?

494
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,560
We broke up.

495
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,360
I'm a bad person.

496
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,120
So why would you care about who I see?

497
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,560
But he's dangerous.

498
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,160
You shouldn't be around him.

499
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,360
I'm worried about you.

500
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,520
What are you doing to her?

501
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,840
Is he bothering you?

502
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,640
Didn't you say it was over?

503
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,520
Why are you still hanging around?

504
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,120
I think you're the one hanging around her.

505
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,000
With all your criminal behavior,

506
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,120
why would she want anything
to do with you?

507
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,480
Sounds like you missed the news.

508
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,120
I never committed any crimes.

509
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,680
That woman Gingploy,

510
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,640
I have nothing to do with her.

511
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,080
I was just going to see Aunt Sorn.

512
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,680
Let's go together.

513
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,280
Why are all these reporters
camping outside so early?

514
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,440
What's going on, Mom?

515
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,760
Ki, go tell the reporters to leave.

516
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,720
I don't want to see them.

517
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,280
I had nothing to do with Ploy.

518
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,760
Why are they still here?

519
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,840
Getting rid of the reporters
won't be so easy now.

520
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,480
If there weren't anything
worth digging into,

521
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,560
they wouldn't be here.

522
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,719
You're the only one

523
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,000
who's always accusing me of things!

524
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,120
Are you the one

525
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,560
- who told the press?!
- Mom.

526
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,960
She doesn't know anything.

527
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,080
You think she knows nothing?!

528
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,120
I don't want you
to misunderstand her again.

529
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,560
Last time, you misunderstood her

530
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,480
when I was drugged.

531
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,120
I don't want you
to get the wrong idea again.

532
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,639
Right.

533
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,880
Maybe you misunderstood about me.

534
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,560
But when it comes to you and Singha,

535
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,600
I don't think
it's just a misunderstanding.

536
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,040
Oh.

537
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,239
You don't know, do you?

538
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,360
Miss Ploy's awake now.

539
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,840
Hey.

540
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,440
But if you're scared,

541
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,200
go ahead and grovel at my feet.

542
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,200
Maybe I'll help you out of this mess.

543
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,360
You did it, right?

544
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,560
Huh?

545
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,360
You broke Mr. Terd's vase, didn't you?

546
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,720
Do you know how much he loved that vase?

547
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,200
If he finds out,

548
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,360
he'll be furious.

549
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,640
- I didn't do it.
- Oh?

550
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,400
Then who did?

551
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,040
Don't tell me your mother did it.

552
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,920
It was your mom, wasn't it?

553
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,600
Your mom did it, right?
I'm going to tell Mr. Terd.

554
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,080
Please don't blame my mother.

555
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,080
She's already suffering enough.

556
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,000
Do you want my help?

557
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,080
I can make this go away.

558
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,320
But first, you need to beg me.
Grovel at my feet.

559
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,200
I'll help you.

560
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,920
Grovel at my feet!

561
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,440
You!

562
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,080
Let go of me!

563
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,320
Who are you telling to grovel to whom?

564
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,520
Singha.

565
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,600
You still have the nerve
to show your face here?

566
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,040
Why wouldn't I?

567
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,000
I brought some treats
from a famous bakery for you.

568
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,120
And I just happened to run into Miss Nun,

569
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,200
so we came back together.

570
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,960
You don't seem fazed at all
by what you've done.

571
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,720
Or are you just pretending to be calm?

572
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,920
I haven't done anything wrong.

573
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,040
Why should I be scared?

574
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,200
If you don't believe me,

575
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,680
why don't you hear
from Miss Gingploy herself?

576
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,440
I hear Gingploy's awake

577
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,240
and she's giving
an interview to the press.

578
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,760
Ooh.

579
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,240
Miss Gingploy's here.

580
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,800
Miss Gingploy!

581
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,320
Miss Gingploy.

582
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,360
Can you tell us what happened

583
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,120
when you were kidnapped and assaulted?

584
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,760
I wasn't kidnapped.
It was all a misunderstanding.

585
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,320
But someone saw
Mr. Singha's car at the scene.

586
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,160
I don't know about that.

587
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,840
But as for me disappearing
and getting hurt,

588
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,280
no one was involved.

589
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,920
I just had an accident
and lost consciousness.

590
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,920
The news reports were inaccurate.

591
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,760
- But--
- That's all I'll say.

592
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,560
Nurse.

593
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,560
Excuse me.

594
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,120
<i>I wasn't kidnapped.</i>
<i>It was a misunderstanding.</i>

595
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,800
<i>No one was involved.</i>

596
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,240
<i>I just had an accident</i>
<i>and lost consciousness.</i>

597
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,640
<i>The news reports were inaccurate.</i>

598
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,080
That should make it clear now.

599
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,920
It was just a misunderstanding.

600
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,320
If Gingploy says so,

601
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,800
no one else
will dare say otherwise, right?

602
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,560
Don't think that
just because Miss Ploy didn't expose you,

603
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,240
this is all over.

604
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
Wouldn't it be better if we all got along,

605
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,240
Ms. Ve?

606
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,520
What you should do now is divorce her.

607
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,960
I can't do that, Mom.

608
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,000
Don't worry about Ki.

609
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,600
<i>I'll do everything in my power</i>
<i>to make him divorce her</i>

610
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,000
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

611
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,560
Then you'd better hurry and do something.

612
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,760
Because you'll be the one

613
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,520
<i>that Kanisorn gets rid of first.</i>

614
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,400
<i>I won't be the one to fall first.</i>

615
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,280
