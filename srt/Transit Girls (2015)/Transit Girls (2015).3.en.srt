1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,540
How is it going with Takeshi?
It's not. We broke up.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,940
After all, your first kiss should be
with someone you love.

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,700
Is Nao-kun really just your childhood friend?

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,900
You really have no feelings for him?
I have NO feelings for him.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,300
Tsubuan? Koshian?
Enough!

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,100
We can't use that, so put it away.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,100
Come on, let's go.
See you tomorrow.

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,200
Wait, Nao!
I'm telling you I won't go!

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,700
Why not go?

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,560
Mirai?

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,570
W-what is it?
Doing what Nao-kun does.

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,400
What?!
Enough already, stop it!

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,570
I won't stop until you talk to me.
Fine, I'll talk, I'll talk. Jeez!

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,580
I've been with Nao since I was born.

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,580
It'd be weird if we suddenly started acting all formal.

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,300
But I really wouldn't mind
if Mirai and Nao started going out.

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,520
Shouldn't you try

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,820
telling Mirai-chan everything you just told me?

19
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,530
Is she the type of person who
wouldn't understand even if you explained?

20
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,530
No... she's not.

21
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,350
Say...

22
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,530
Do you like both?
Both men and women?

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,540
I don't know.
But there is something I know.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,300
I want to know you better.

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,450
When I look at you,
I want to touch you.

26
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,540
I think...
I'm probably in love with you.

27
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,900
Morning.
Good morning.

28
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,400
Morning.

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,900
Morning.
Morning.

30
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,550
Oh, fried eggs?

31
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,200
I'm sorry for such a
substandard breakfast.

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,100
Fried eggs are
my absolute favorite.

33
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,560
Isn't it said that the simple things
are the most difficult to make.

34
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,570
Oh no, now I'm getting nervous.
No, it's alright.

35
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,570
It looks tasty.

36
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,300
Itadakimasu!

37
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,520
Oh! Delicious!

38
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,520
They're just how I like them.
Really?

39
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,720
Aren't they ordinary?

40
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,220
No, the egg yolk is runny
and the egg white is slightly crispy.

41
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,530
It's delicious.

42
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,750
They're ideal.
I'm glad.

43
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,540
Other than salt and pepper,
what do you like with your eggs?

44
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,300
Soy sauce, I guess.
Soy sauce?

45
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,700
You wouldn't like mayonnaise?
Mayonnaise?!

46
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,700
But mayonnaise is made from eggs.

47
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,450
I didn't think of it like that.

48
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,300
Egg on egg is a bit weird.

49
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,560
Thanks for the meal.

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,700
Ah... should I have made breakfast with rice after all?

51
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,560
No, it's not like that.

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,300
I'm sorry about the leftovers.
It's fine.

53
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,300
Such a waste...
I'll take it.

54
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,000
Do you feel sick? Are you alright?
I just feel like I have a slight cold.

55
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,810
Do you want medicine?
I'm fine.

56
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,300
I'm heading out.

57
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,200
Will she be alright?
Yeah...

58
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,490
Sayuri says she's staying home with a cold.

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,200
I see.

60
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,500
You're still angry?
About what?

61
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,600
You are!
Not really.

62
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:23,500
Sayuri wants things to go well
for you and Nao.

63
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,000
100%.
I know.

64
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,520
What do you want your
relationship with Nao to be like?

65
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Would you like him to call you <i>manju</i> like Sayuri?

66
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,520
You wouldn't want that, would you?
I wouldn't, but...

67
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,830
But in shoujo manga, childhood friends
like Sayuri and Nao-kun

68
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,400
no matter what happens, they always
end up together in the end, right?

69
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,200
Then maybe you should give up on Nao.

70
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,040
I don't want to...

71
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Then there's no point feeling jealous of Sayuri.

72
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,300
I get it already...

73
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,800
Lend me your phone?

74
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Ok.

75
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,100
Teach me the problem we talked about yesterday ♥

76
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,600
Ah, no, wait...!

77
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,400
I'd like you to teach me the problem
we talked about yesterday.

78
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,530
Fine, fine, send it.

79
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:16,300
Sorry for being useless yesterday.
I don't think you were useless.

80
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,300
I'm prepared today, so any time is fine!

81
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,600
You should at least send Sayuri
a get well message as well.

82
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,500
Alright.

83
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:47,100
It shows you read my message! - Read and ignored it.
- Hey! - I feel feverish. Could be a cold. Not coming today.
I thought idiots didn't catch colds?

Did you follow me here?

86
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,180
That's messed up.

87
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,690
Are you okay?

88
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
I said I was fine, didn't I?

89
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,800
But...

90
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,630
Anyway, could you please go home?

91
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,940
Do you want to order me to go to school?

92
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,640
I'm neither your parent
nor your teacher.

93
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,150
You're not my older sister either.

94
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't see you as my younger sister.

95
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,900
What?!

96
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,900
Seriously, what is this?
Give it a rest!

97
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,600
What do you even mean when you
say you're probably in love with me?

98
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,970
I really don't understand you!

99
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,700
Since the day you came,
everything's been messed up!

100
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,300
Because of you my body feels heavy,
and my throat burns...

101
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,100
Since a while ago, even my joints hurt.
And I have a throbbing headache...

102
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,800
It's absolutely awful!

103
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,420
Please leave me alone!

104
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,300
I understand, but...
Are you alright?

105
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,700
You should go home and rest.

106
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,300
I'm fine now.

107
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Just... thanks.

108
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Say...

109
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
About the eggs...

110
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,200
The fried eggs from this morning.

111
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,470
I think your father
was just being considerate.

112
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,700
They were ordinary, right?
My mom's eggs.

113
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:59,200
Your mother's eggs
must have been delicious.

114
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
And yet...
Don't.

115
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,440
What?

116
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,640
Don't try to read my feelings.

117
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Sorry.

118
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,300
You know, my real father...

119
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,260
He left the year I started
elementary school.

120
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,970
He left on Christmas.

121
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,900
That is why I hate Christmas.

122
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,920
But it's not that big of a deal.

123
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,100
My father was a man who
was always busy with work.

124
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,600
I hardly have any memories

125
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,800
of us playing or eating together.

126
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,200
That has nothing to do with
the conversation about eggs...

127
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,600
I'm sorry.

128
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,000
It was...

129
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,750
a bit dry.

130
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,300
The yolk.

131
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,600
Mom's was creamier.

132
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,900
I see.

133
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,300
But egg whites were solid,
like they should be.

134
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,910
They were really delicious.

135
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
But...

136
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,600
it's not like Madoka-san's
weren't tasty.

137
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,640
It's fine. I understand.

138
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,900
But it's so unusual,
Sayuri getting sick.

139
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Yes... I wonder if it is because her
environment suddenly changed.

140
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,290
I think we are responsible, too.

141
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,800
She isn't that sensitive.

142
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,300
She doesn't let you see,

143
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,300
but I think Sayuri is surprisingly sensitive.

144
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,100
Ah, good evening.
Oh, Nao. - Huh?

145
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,100
Ah, good evening.

146
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Who is this?

147
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,400
Madoka-san, you haven't
met Nao before? - No.

148
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,700
Nice to meet you. I am Fukasawa Nao
from the house next door.

149
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,000
I see, from Fukasawa-san's place. - Yes.

150
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,700
He is the same age as Sayuri.
Oh? So handsome.

151
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,500
He used to be so tiny
but he suddenly grew tall.

152
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,600
You've become a fine man.

153
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,200
Since I started playing basketball,
I've grown quite a bit.

154
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,900
Are you dating Sayuri-chan?
No, that... I...

155
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,300
If it's Nao-kun, that would be alright.
I've always thought that, too.

156
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,100
Nao, how about Sayuri?

157
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,600
Ah... I heard Sayuri has a fever.

158
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,900
That's right. It's unusual, right?

159
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,100
And so I brought the stuff she likes.

160
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,290
Thank you. But I think
she might be sleeping now.

161
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,600
I see... Well, then, if she's sleeping,
I'll leave it in the fridge.

162
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,100
Thanks for everything.
It's fine. Excuse me.

164
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,900
Was Sayuri-chan awake?

165
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,900
Ah, she was sleeping.

166
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
Even though you came especially
to see her. I'm sorry.

167
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,500
Well then, I'll leave this in the fridge.

168
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,300
Okay.

169
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,700
Thank you.
