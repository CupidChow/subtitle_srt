1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,600
I love you.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I have someone I've liked for a long time.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,200
You're strange today.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,300
I love you.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,300
Will you

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,200
go out with me?

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,800
I'll go home, then.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,000
You don't have to answer me right away.

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,300
See you.

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,300
Huh?

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,300
Yui.

12
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,200
Can I sleep there today?

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,400
Sure.

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,000
What's wrong?

15
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,900
Nao confessed to me.

16
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
I see.

17
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,300
You're not surprised?

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Because I've been wondering
if he's in love with you.

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,800
He said I don't have to answer him right away, but...

20
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,100
I don't know how to act when I see him tomorrow.

21
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,400
You shouldn't worry about that.

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,000
I think Nao-kun would want you to be yourself.

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,600
Nao has always been with me,
since I was born, for 18 years.

24
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,500
Yeah.

25
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
We've always been like siblings.

26
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,300
I thought he'd be by my side in the future, too.

27
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,700
I somehow thought our relationship
would never change.

28
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,700
Yeah.

29
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,400
Maybe it's selfish of me,

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,500
but I want us to keep this relationship forever.

31
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,300
But that may be impossible now.

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:51,600
But Nao-kun confessed to you even
at the risk of breaking that relationship.

33
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,800
He was really prepared for anything.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,900
I guess there's nothing that
won't change over time.

35
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,500
I won't.

36
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
What?

37
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,500
I will never change.

39
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,300
Morning.

40
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,400
Morning.

41
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,310
Could it be that you...

42
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,220
don't have your anko filling?

43
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,800
I don't! Because I'm not a manju!
Ow ow ow! Sorry.

44
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,100
I'm starting to get tired of being teased as a manju.

45
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Morning.
Morning.

46
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Morning.

47
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,550
I saw it this morning...

48
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,700
The two of you sleeping together.

49
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,000
I've been wondering about that ever since.

50
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
It's fine if you were just playing around,

51
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,300
but it didn't seem that way.

52
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,300
Sayuri is a girl and she's even your sister...

53
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,300
But I don't need to tell you that.

54
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,900
Are you serious?

55
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Yui,

56
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
even though you're not related by blood,

57
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,000
we are trying to become a family.

58
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,540
What you are doing

59
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,040
could make this family break apart.

60
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,400
Think hard on whether you're prepared for that or not.

61
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,300
I was dumped.

62
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,100
You must have heard from Nao-kun.

63
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,200
Yeah.

64
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But when he clearly said
"I have someone I like"

65
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,700
he was really cool.

66
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,540
And you've finally realized that Nao-kun
has feelings for you, haven't you?

67
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,540
Ah... yeah.

68
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,500
You know, in shoujo mangas I've read,

69
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,700
childhood friends like you and Nao-kun

70
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,490
in the end always get together.

71
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
And you two won't date?

72
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
No.

73
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Why?

74
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Why...?

75
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Could it be that you have someone else you like?

76
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,300
You're kidding!

77
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,900
Who and where from?

78
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Oh, I see.

79
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,000
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

80
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,000
Despite having someone you like,
you've been acting that way towards Nao-kun?

81
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
What way?

82
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,100
You don't even like him,
and yet you're being so flirty.

83
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,300
What?! Me?

84
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,000
Acting like you didn't even realize it makes me really angry.

85
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,300
Always watching you flirt,
I've wondered what you're playing at.

86
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,300
Ah, I'm so annoyed!

87
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,800
I'm sorry. I'm small-minded.

88
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,450
I'm sorry, too.

89
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,600
Isn't this bad?

90
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,800
If this were a shoujo manga,
you'd be a character everyone hates.

91
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,300
Yes.

92
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,800
I don't know who the person you like is
or where they're from, but...

93
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
More importantly, does
Nao-kun know about that?

94
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
You've been too spoiled by his kindness.

95
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,500
Nao-kun may be Superman,

96
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,400
but even Superman has things that can hurt him.

97
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,900
I really don't like the way you are right now.

98
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,300
I'm home.

99
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Welcome back.

100
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Welcome back.

101
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,800
I bought Sayuri's favorite cream puffs.

102
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,900
You'll make me fat again!

103
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,800
You don't have to eat them, then.

104
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,900
No, no, I'll eat, I'll eat.

105
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,300
Should I make coffee too, then?

106
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,300
I'll take black.

107
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,100
And you, Sayuri?
Well then, I'll just have black, too.

108
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Okay.

109
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Eh? Why are there two?

110
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,800
You should take one of these to Nao.

111
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,700
What, now?
Yes, now.

112
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,100
Shouldn't you go before it gets too late?

113
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,600
I'd feel bad for Fukasawa-san.

114
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,450
Okay.

115
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,750
But that Nao,

116
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,250
lately he suddenly became quite manly.

117
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,600
Did he?

118
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,000
You're childish, so you haven't noticed.

119
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,000
Yui-chan, Nao is quite a nice man, right?

120
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,600
I think so.

121
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,300
It would be nice if he'd take you for a bride.

122
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Right, Sayuri?
What?

123
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,200
Aren't you saying that just because you
don't want to part with Sayuri-chan?

124
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,700
If she's next door, you can see her all the time.

125
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,600
You don't even have a boyfriend,
marriage is far off in the future, I guess?

126
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,800
You keep saying unnecessary things today.

127
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,900
Yui-chan, do you have a boyfriend?

128
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,800
I don't.
Really?

129
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Even though you're so beautiful.

130
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
The men in this world are so sloppy.

131
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,100
But I do have someone I like.

132
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,500
Oh, I see.
Then, bring him over sometime.

133
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I wonder what dad would think
if he knew about us.

134
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,950
I'm sure it hasn't even occurred to him.

135
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Somehow...

136
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,950
We've become more like a family lately.

137
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,300
Dad seems happy, too.

138
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,100
But I wonder if things can stay like this.

139
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,200
Are you scared?

140
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
I'm sorry for saying such things.

141
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,900
It's alright for us to love each other, right?

142
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,600
Yes.

143
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,200
Can I hug you?

144
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,750
Yeah.

145
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,700
That hurts, Sayuri.

146
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,300
It's fine.

147
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,900
Is it done?

148
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,500
Did we take it properly?
I wonder.

149
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Shall we take another one?
Let's.

150
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
It's almost Christmas.

151
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,600
Yeah.

152
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,800
It's the first Christmas we'll spend together.

153
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,800
Yeah.

154
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,100
You said you hate Christmas,
since it's the day your dad left.

155
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,300
You remembered.

156
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,000
I won't leave.

157
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,300
I'll be with you.

158
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,300
Okay.

159
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,500
I hope you'll stop hating Christmas.

160
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,100
Thank you.

161
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,600
I'm off.
I'm off.

162
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,100
You took one, didn't you?

163
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,100
You were too close!

164
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,600
Enough!

165
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,050
Want to take one?
Yeah.

166
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Here I go.

167
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,600
Done?
I took it.

168
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,000
Let me see, let me see.

169
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Oh! This is amazing! So pretty!

170
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,470
You look beautiful in photos.
Like a pro.

171
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,600
Winter suits you.

172
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,900
Because I'm a manju?

173
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,200
You said it yourself.

174
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
Shall we go?

177
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,100
What is it?

178
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,300
First of all, please lift your head.

179
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Madoka-san!

180
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
Please don't be shocked.

181
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,100
Here.

182
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,400
It was unreasonable to hope you wouldn't be shocked, I suppose.

183
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,700
In the past, Yui dated men,
like everyone else.

184
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,100
I couldn't believe it myself, but...

185
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,800
When we came to this house,
Sayuri was high-strung, right?

186
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,600
But slowly the mood improved and I stopped worrying.

187
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Lately, they were often together,
so I thought they were getting along really well.

188
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,600
But then the other day, somehow,
I felt something was strange

189
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,100
and I tried talking to Yui.

190
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,200
I thought I put a stop to it at the time.

191
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,900
It was completely naive of me.

192
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,700
I'm sorry.

193
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,800
What did Yui-chan say?

194
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,400
She said she was serious.

195
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,600
We can no longer live together, can we?

196
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,800
Welcome back.

197
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Do you both have a minute?
