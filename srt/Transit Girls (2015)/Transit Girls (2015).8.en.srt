1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,400
I am serious about this.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Sayuri is so cute
and important to me.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,300
I don't want to lose her.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,000
Yui...

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,700
left.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,700
Yui was always finding me

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,600
and I couldn't find her.

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,000
What Christmas present would make Sayuri happy?

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,700
Tiffany's double heart.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,600
What do you want, Yui-chan?

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,600
Present from uncle-Santa.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Hey, what are you doing for Christmas?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,200
I don't have time to celebrate that!

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,400
What are you doing for Christmas, Sayuri?

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,700
It'll probably just be me and my dad.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,900
What? What about mom?
T/N: She means Madoka.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,800
She left too.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,200
Are you keeping in touch with your sister?

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,100
No.

20
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,650
But oh well, things are just back to how they used to be.

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,450
Don't make that face, manju.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,100
Anko will leak out.

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,600
Oh no.

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,900
Ow!

25
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:21,000
Eh~ Wouldn't it be nice if before Christmas
a cool guy moved to a house next door to me too.

27
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,900
I didn't think we'd meet in a place like this.

28
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,700
Thank you for bringing flowers.

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,600
Mom loved those flowers, so I think she would be happy.

30
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,700
We came during your exams and
caused a commotion. I'm sorry.

31
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,200
You have no reason to apologize.

32
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,500
Neither does Yui.

33
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,600
I was glad you both came.

34
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
Thank you.

35
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,850
Say...

36
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,850
Why did you leave?

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,600
What?

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,200
I think Yui left because she wanted
you and dad to stay together.

39
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,350
And yet you left too.

40
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,350
You understand Yui very well.

41
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,700
Yui is a person who doesn't really say unnecessary things.

42
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,600
That is why I actually never knew what she loved or hated.

43
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,500
But when I asked her about you

44
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
she said she was serious.

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,100
That was the first time she stated her feelings so clearly.

46
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,500
Honestly, it made me happy a little.

47
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Maybe it's wrong, but

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,500
as long as Yui is happy... it's fine.
I felt that in my heart.

49
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,300
That's why I couldn't stop it.

50
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,950
Here.

51
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,500
Actually, I came today to apologize to your mother.

52
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,080
And then I go and do something like this.
I don't really understand it myself.

53
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,800
But I think your mother would probably do this too.

54
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,600
T/N: It's an address in Yokohama.

55
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,300
Yui's new sister.

56
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,700
Yui is having a day off today.

57
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,900
I didn't need her for anything important.

58
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,600
It's totally fine. See you.

59
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,400
If you'd like, at least have some coffee.

60
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Do you take sugar?
Yes.

61
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,500
Ah, no. I'll have black, after all.

62
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,750
Here.

63
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,600
Thank you.
Please.

64
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,850
Living with Yui and her mother didn't work out?

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,650
What?

66
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,000
I heard Yui started living on her own recently.

67
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,850
When I asked her about you before,
she said you were cute

68
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,050
so I thought you were getting along well, surprisingly.

69
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,800
If you have a message for her, I'll relate it.

70
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Ah, no, it's alright.

71
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,900
Do you have plans for Christmas?

72
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,200
No, I don't.

73
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,600
Are you spending it with Yui?

74
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
She refused me again this year.

75
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,200
Even when we were dating,

76
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,400
she wouldn't spend Christmas with me.

77
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,400
What?

78
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,400
I don't know why, 

79
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,700
but she said she decided long ago
that she'd always spend it alone.

80
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,000
About Sayuri-chan and Yui...

81
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,400
What they're feeling,

82
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,700
it could be just a phase

83
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,900
but I still think we should take it seriously.

84
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
It could be a temporary delusion.

85
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:56,600
But even so, I've been thinking
I'd like to embrace it.

86
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,700
I'm sorry for being so indulgent.

87
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,800
I've taught Sayuri

88
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,800
that the one thing she mustn't do is hurt others.

89
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,300
Aside from that, I said I would support her choices.

90
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,400
Right now, they are hurting each other,

91
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,600
but they are not hurting

92
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
or bothering anyone.

93
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,900
So in that case...

94
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,000
You will support them?

95
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes.

96
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
One other thing.

97
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,000
Would you please come back?

98
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,800
I can now do 80% of my old exam questions right.

99
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,700
Good job.
Yeah.

100
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,650
In the end, you're joining the literature department?

101
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,700
I sent in my application, but...

102
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,800
I still haven't found what I want to do.

103
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,500
But, unlike you or Yui, I don't have a dream.

104
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,100
I don't have anything, so...

105
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,500
I've decided all I can do right now is do my best.

106
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,800
Yeah.

107
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay, now let's deal with English.

108
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,600
What is it? I won't do anything!

109
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,550
Say...

110
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,300
Are you really okay with

111
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,000
leaving things with Yui-san as they are?

112
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,800
I hurt her very much.

113
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,000
She told me her father left her on Christmas.

114
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,900
Yeah.

115
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
That's why she hates Christmas.

116
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,300
I promised her we'd spend it together this year.

117
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Yeah.

118
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
But then...

119
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,800
I let go of her hand, when she took mine.

120
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
Yui said that she was

121
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
proud to love me, and yet...

122
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,400
I wasn't proud of it at the time.

123
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,850
Lame, right?

124
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Lame.

125
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,200
Yeah.

126
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,900
What do you want to do now?

127
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
What?

128
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Whining about it like this is also lame.

129
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,300
Stop that already.

130
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Even if...

131
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,300
you're a tsubuan or a koshian,
I will always love you.

132
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
Come on...

133
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,700
Go to Yui-san.

134
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,600
And...

135
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,800
If she breaks up with you,
you should cry some more

136
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
and sleep, snoring loudly.

137
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,700
If that happens, I'll be by your side.

I'm home.

140
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,700
Huh?

141
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,300
What is it, at this hour?
What about the restaurant?

142
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Merry Christmas.

143
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,400
Huh? Thanks.

144
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,200
Do your best in your exams.
Okay.

145
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,500
Can I open it?
Go on.

146
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,700
What?

147
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,100
How did you know about this?

148
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,700
I heard about it from Yui-chan.

149
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,900
Yui?

150
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Actually, I saw Yui-chan the other day.

151
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,500
Ah, but... I never told Yui that I wanted this.

152
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,500
Is that so?

153
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,000
That's what she told me when she visited.

154
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
She came when the restaurant was closed.

155
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,400
She came especially, to apologize.

156
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,800
She's a good girl, straightforward.

157
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,200
That's right. She is, isn't she.

158
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,700
And so, I also asked her.

159
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,500
What she wants for Christmas.

160
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And then?

161
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,750
She said...

162
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,900
she wanted me to wish you a Merry Christmas.

163
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Are you leaving?
Yeah.

164
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,000
Bring Yui-chan back home.

165
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,850
Thank you.

166
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yui!

167
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,000
That hurts, Sayuri.

168
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,800
It's fine.

169
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,650
I've hurt you so much.

170
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
I'm sorry.

171
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
It's alright.

172
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I missed you.

173
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,500
Yeah.

174
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,400
I wanted to kiss you again.

175
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,500
Okay.

176
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,700
Prayer; Name: Shida Yui
May Sayuri find me some day.

177
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,000
T/N: There's a scene after the credits, keep watching~

178
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,400
Can I...

179
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,500
Hold your hand?

180
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,600
Yeah.

181
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,700
Ah, and I'd alredy found my necklace.

182
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,400
So I have two of the same.
