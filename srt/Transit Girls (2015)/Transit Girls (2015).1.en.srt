1
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,960
Prayer
Name: Hayama Sayuri
May I find: my fated person, dreams,
Tiffany's double heart pendant

2
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,460
Sayuri, do you want some
tea, too? - I do.

3
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,920
You're ironing? Lucky you.

4
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Thanks.
I love doing it.

5
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,340
Here.

6
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,940
What?

7
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,940
There something you
want to tell me, right?

8
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,240
Say it.

9
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,950
Just say it already.

10
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,250
I met someone important to me.

11
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Someone that often comes to my restaurant.

12
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,070
Are you saying you'll remarry?

13
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,970
I...

14
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,270
am.

15
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,180
Thank you.

16
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,530
Sayuri, do you have a moment?

17
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
Hello, Sayuri-chan.

18
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,260
Hello.

19
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,970
Hold on, what's going on?

20
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,170
First of all, I'll introduce you.

21
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,910
Madoka-san and Yui-chan.

22
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,410
Yui-chan is 20...
21.

23
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,700
3 years older than you.

24
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,910
Ok Sayuri, for now, let's sit, alright?

25
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,220
I have stuff to do.

26
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,350
What is it?

27
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,060
I don't need an older sister.

28
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,900
I don't mind living with you.

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,230
Morning.
Good morning.

31
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,230
Morning.

32
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,930
Ah, thanks.

33
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,540
This is for Keigo-san.

34
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
Morning.

35
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,240
Itadakimasu.

36
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,950
Ah~ Smells nice.

37
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,390
Yui, I hear Sayuri-chan
always makes dashi.

38
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,190
Yui-chan.

39
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,200
Doesn't Sayuri make nice dashi?
She does.

40
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Cooking is the only thing I can teach her.

41
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,600
Right?

42
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,900
Yui-chan, is someone
teaching you photography?

43
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,210
No. Since I quit university, I've been working
as an assistant to a professional photographer.

44
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,210
I want to become a professional, too.
Nice, at just 21.

45
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,810
Remarkable.

46
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,220
But when she was in high school,
Yui didn't know what she wanted either.

47
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,800
Sayuri, what's your preferred school?
I'm telling you, I haven't decided yet.

48
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,250
With your grades, you should make it into Keio's
literature department, just barely.

49
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,180
Yeah.
Are you interested in literature?

50
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,190
Not really.

51
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,190
For now, the most important thing is
picking the name of the school.

52
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,490
As an adult, all that matters is
the name of your school.

53
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,190
No one really asks
your department, right?

54
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,200
Calculating.
It's fine, even if it is.

55
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,500
Even so, if you get in,
it's a big deal.

56
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,040
I didn't wanna take the entrance exam,
so I'll study abroad.

57
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,210
Nao-kun, what medical department
are you interested in?

58
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,210
As long as it's a medical department.
I don't care what university it is.

59
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,210
Isn't that in itself kinda stupid?
Hey!

60
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,800
What field is your father in?
Neurosurgery.

61
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,600
But I want to get into pediatrics.

62
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,500
You like children?

63
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,220
It's not that I like or dislike them.

64
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:25,230
I want to try to save the lives of
as many kids as I can.

65
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,400
That superman personality
hasn't changed since way back.

66
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,900
"I'll save the world!" or something.

67
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,500
Hey, are you making fun of me?
Sorry.

68
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,240
I'll call you a manju.
Sorry, sorry!

69
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,840
Hey, Nao.
Huh?

70
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,180
I don't understand any problems
from this section. - Which one?

71
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,890
Ah, these are probably using
the Schwartz formula.

72
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,200
As expected of Nao-sensei.

73
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,200
Even though you're studying abroad
you have to study math?

74
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Huh, don't I need it?

75
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Ah, here.

76
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,200
Sorry, I'll head back first.
Huh?

77
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,500
Sayuri started dating.
What?

78
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,220
Takeshi-kun's been interested
in Sayuri for a while.

79
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,220
I know about Takeshi,
but I didn't know she liked him too?

80
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,320
But I do get how Sayuri feels, too.
Yeah.

81
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,350
Her own home suddenly
became unbearable, right?

82
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,550
And it's just 2 years since
Sayuri's mom passed away.

83
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,050
Maybe she feels abandoned?

84
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,170
What's up with her.

85
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,180
Nao-kun, how do you feel about Sayuri?

86
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,280
How... She's a childhood friend from
the house next door. That's it.

87
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,400
You have no feelings for her?

88
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,900
I have NO feelings for her.

89
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,400
What the hell is that?

90
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,210
A hat on top of a hat?

91
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,210
This is a hat, but this is a hat, too.
This is a hat, too? Must be hot.

92
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Must feel hot, right?
Yeah.

93
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,000
Ooh~ They seem nice, those two.

94
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,220
Should we take a photo, too?

95
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,220
Huh?
We won't, we won't.

96
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,120
Why not? A photo
to celebrate going out.

97
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,250
Huh? There's really no need.

98
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,160
My face is all oily and...
It's fine.

99
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,170
Really, I'm good.
It's fine.

100
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,470
No, I'm good, I'm good...
Tadaima.

101
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,200
Hello.

102
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,070
I'll make some tea.

103
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,170
Or would you prefer juice?
Ah, either.

104
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,180
Hey, Sayuri.
Who is that pretty girl?

105
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,180
No idea.

106
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,200
Morning.

107
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,350
Ugh, what?
Let's go eat something.

108
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,360
I got hungry playing basketball.

109
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
I'll get fat if I eat now.

110
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,360
You're a manju anyway, right?
Shut up.

111
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,370
Then, how about studying at my place?
The day after tomorrow is the English test.

112
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,370
Last time I got 95 points,
so I'm good.

113
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,470
Sayuri.

114
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,300
That hurts.

115
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,380
Ah, sorry.

116
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,390
I know you have a lot going on.

117
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,730
Huh?

118
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,000
But what's up with going out
with a guy you don't even like?

119
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,340
Who says I don't like him?

120
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,640
Well then, what do you like about him?

121
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,900
Why should I tell you?

122
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,900
You can't answer
cause you don't like him, right?

123
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,900
I won't answer cause it's none
of your business. - Wait!

124
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's not like you.
What?

125
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,360
If you have something to say,
I'll listen to whatever it is.

126
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,360
What is this?

127
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
We even live next door.

128
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
So...

129
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,370
If anything happens, talk to me.

130
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,500
I ended it.

131
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Huh?

132
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,580
I'm telling you I ended it with Takeshi-kun.

133
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,200
He got kind of annoying.

134
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
I see.

135
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,800
So you wanna go eat something?

136
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,330
Ramen?
Eh~ if we split, then fine.

137
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,330
No way. I'm hungry.

138
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,330
Then eat one and a half.

139
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,330
Fine.
Seriously?

140
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,350
Here.
Thank you.

141
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,350
Are you mocking me?
I'm not!

142
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,350
You are!
It just sounded like that.

143
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,900
Your sister?

144
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
See ya.

145
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
New sister?

146
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,320
Yes... desu.

Who said you could come in?

149
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,420
The man just now, he's called Saeki-san.
He sends his regards.

150
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,320
Was there a need to come and tell me that?

151
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,100
If you're done, could you leave?

152
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,550
Don't look.

153
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,350
Did I do something wrong?

154
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,350
Does it bother you your father remarried?

155
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,360
Don't you want
your father to be happy?

156
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,250
Get out!

157
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,300
Always acting like
you know everything.

158
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,900
Your whole attitude is annoying.

159
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
Just leave me alone.

160
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,900
Get out!

161
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm telling you to get out.
