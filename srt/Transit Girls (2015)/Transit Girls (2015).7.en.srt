1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,100
It's alright for us to love each other, right?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,800
Yes.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,000
Are you serious?

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,500
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,400
What did Yui-chan say?

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,400
She said she was serious.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,500
Welcome back.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Do you both have a minute?

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Sayuri...

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,700
I still don't really understand.

11
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,100
What is the meaning of this?

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,500
Are you seriously...?

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,000
Sayuri, I won't understand if you keep quiet.

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Are we doing something wrong?

15
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,400
Is it because we're both girls?

16
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,900
Or because we're sisters?

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,900
We aren't doing anything wrong.

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
I am serious about this.

19
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,800
Sayuri is so cute

20
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,400
and important to me.

21
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,300
I don't want to lose her.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I want to be proud

23
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
of my love for Sayuri.

24
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,200
Yui.

25
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,300
Stop.

26
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Just stop.

27
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,750
Prayer; Name: Hayama Sayuri
May I find: my fated person, dreams, Tiffany's double heart

<i>The person you have dialed can't take your call now...</i>

31
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,200
Why weren't you at school today?

32
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,700
My sister...

33
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,500
Did something happen to your sister?

34
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,800
Yui...

35
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,700
left.

36
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,100
Are you okay?

37
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Here.

38
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,800
Thanks.

39
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
What do you mean she left?

40
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,300
Don't be shocked, ok?

41
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,700
Don't be weirded out.

42
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,500
What is it?

43
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,000
You see, I...

44
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,300
It's okay.

45
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,600
Even if you say "I'm not actually a manju,
I'm a melon bread," I won't be surprised.

46
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I...

47
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,100
love my sister.

48
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Yeah.

49
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,300
I noticed, somehow.

50
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
What?

51
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,400
I've been watching you since we were kids.

52
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,700
So it's not really surprising.

53
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,200
Right.

54
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,050
That's right.

55
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,200
But it's over already.

56
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,000
I see.

57
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,800
I hurt Yui a lot yesterday.

58
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,350
When I woke up this morning, she was already gone.

59
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,650
I can't reach her phone, either.

60
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,600
I went looking for her

61
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,600
but I couldn't find her.

62
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,400
Yui was always finding me...

63
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,800
and I couldn't find her.

64
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,200
I keep losing everyone I care about.

65
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,650
Sayuri.

66
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,500
I may not be the person you care about...

67
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,650
but I'm not going anywhere.

68
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,150
If you need someone by your side,
if it can be anyone,

69
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,300
I'll be there for you.

70
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,900
I'll always be there for you.

71
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,400
After all, I'm Superman, right?

72
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,650
Another.

73
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
You know, yesterday...

74
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,100
You were snoring.

75
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
I didn't!

76
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
You didn't.

77
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,000
Ow!

78
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,100
You know, my body is stiff from sleeping
on the floor to begin with!

79
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,650
Thank you.

80
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,650
And also...

81
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,400
I was unexpectedly dumped yesterday.

82
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,650
Sorry.

83
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,650
You're very cheeky for a manju.

84
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,100
You're using that line way too often.
My face has changed recently.

85
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,200
Morning.

86
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,900
Morning.

87
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,100
Morning.

88
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,700
Mirai, I need to talk to you when we get to school.

89
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,400
It won't take long.

90
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,300
Please.

91
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,880
What did you want to talk about?

92
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,100
It's about our conversation from before,
about the person I like.

93
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,300
Huh? Why are you bringing that up now?

94
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,100
"In the end, Nao was always by side."

95
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
"I realized I love him," is that it?

96
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's not.

97
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,200
You may think it's weird, but...

98
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,600
It's my sister.

99
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,200
The one I love is my sister.

100
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
I'm sorry, I don't understand you at all.

101
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,800
That's right. How could you.

102
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,000
But, she left the house

103
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,000
and I lost sight of a lot of things.

104
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,400
Nao happened to know about it,
so he kept me company, that's all.

105
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,700
I couldn't think of anyone other than myself.

106
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,100
I'm sorry.

107
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,700
I don't understand at all, but...

108
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Not being able to think of anyone other than yourself when you fall in love...

109
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
That I understand.

110
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,600
And I don't think it's weird.

111
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,900
Huh?

112
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,100
Your sister is extremely beautiful.

113
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,200
I can somewhat understand why you like her.

114
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,400
And such things aren't unusual these days.

115
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,700
But...

116
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,300
I'm annoyed about the situation with Nao-kun.

117
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,700
I'm sorry.

118
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,200
Can I do it once?

119
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,200
Ow ow ow ow ow!

120
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,200
Your voice cracked.

121
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Good afternoon.

122
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Yui-chan!

123
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,300
What's wrong?

Thanks for waiting.

126
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,700
What's the matter?

127
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,800
I'm sorry about the other day.

128
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,800
It was my fault in the first place.

129
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,600
It's not something that's any one person's fault.

130
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,700
If this is about Sayuri,
she's going to school every day.

131
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,500
Is that so.

132
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,100
I don't know how to say this,

133
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,300
but thank you for caring about Sayuri.

134
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Okay.

135
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,900
About Sayuri...

136
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,300
Please don't worry.

137
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,200
I'm not keeping in touch with her.

138
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
I see.

139
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm sorry.

140
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,500
Even I still don't know
what is the right thing to do.

141
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,300
Don't be.

142
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,100
Say...

143
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,400
What Christmas present would make Sayuri happy?

144
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,200
I have no idea what a 3rd year high school girl wants.

145
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,900
Tiffany's double heart.

146
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,100
Double heart?

147
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,900
I think it's a necklace.

148
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,700
Oh, I see. Thank you.

149
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Well then, excuse me.

150
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,900
I'm sorry for bothering you at work.

151
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Say...

152
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,600
What do you want, Yui-chan?

153
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,800
What?

154
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Present from uncle-Santa.

155
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,000
It was a short time,
but thank you for taking care of us.
Miso soup was delicious.
