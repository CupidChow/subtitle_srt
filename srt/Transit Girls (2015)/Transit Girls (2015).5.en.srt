1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,900
I don't even recognize myself anymore.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,400
Doesn't this mean
that you love me too?

3
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,700
Come in.

4
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Can I come to your room today?

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Can I look at the photos?
Sure.

6
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,300
Oh! Pretty!

7
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,300
Right now, I'm taking photos with praying as the theme.

8
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,400
Oh?

9
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,900
Say...

10
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,800
When did you decide you
wanted to become a photographer?

11
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,800
I wonder...

12
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,100
When I chose my university,

13
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,800
I was already thinking I
wanted to do photography,

14
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,510
so I entered a university
where I could study it.

15
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,300
So you entered the university
knowing what you wanted to do?

16
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Yeah.

17
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Are you having trouble deciding
on your career path?

18
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Rather than having trouble deciding

19
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,000
I have no idea what I want to do in the first place.

20
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Why did you quit university?

21
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,300
After meeting Saeki-san,

22
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,800
I felt that his photos had
everything that mine did not.

23
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,000
I was very drawn to them.

24
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,300
Saeki-san told me it's alright to
come and work at his place...

25
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Somehow, I'm doing all the talking.

26
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I'm sorry.
Don't be. I wanted to know.

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,000
I wonder if I'll find something I want to do.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,500
Sayuri-chan, you're good at studying

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
so you have a lot of options, right?

30
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,100
Just Sayuri is fine.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And you don't need to
use formal language anymore.

32
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,530
Okay.

33
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,500
There's something I've always wanted to do.

34
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,400
Huh?

35
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Can I take a photo of you?

36
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,600
Yeah.

37
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,400
Here I go.
Okay.

38
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,100
Well then, I'm off.
Take care.

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,900
Morning.
Morning.

40
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,300
You've become more and more sisterly.

41
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,500
Really? Is that how it seems?

42
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,300
Are you going to the park today?

43
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,300
Today?
Yeah.

44
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Hmm...

45
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,400
What is it? Do you have plans?

46
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:28,950

47
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,100
Eh? It's Nao!

48
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,300
Nice shot!

49
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,700
Hey.

50
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Where's Sayuri?

51
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,500
It seems she has plans with her sister today,
so she went home.

52
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,800
She sent a LINE message just now.

53
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,200
I need to get going, too.
I have a date with Ryo-chan.

54
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Do you have time?

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,700
Can I watch you play just a little longer?

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,500
Sure, but...

57
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,400
Isn't it boring to just watch?

58
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,300
It's fine.
Really?

59
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,800
I worked up a good sweat for the first time in a while.
Thanks for keeping me company.

60
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,400
No problem.

61
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,600
Ah, but since you're a third year,
you retired, right?

62
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,400
Yeah.

63
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,100
That's why I play from time to time,
before exams and such, when the gym is free.

64
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,800
What do you want to do?
Go to the park and study?

65
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,200
Eh? Is that ok?

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,800
What?

67
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,100
Just the two of us.

68
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,900
Why? It's totally fine.

69
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,100
But, it's almost certain you'll
get a recommendation, right?

70
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,900
Well... I guess.

71
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,100
If I had a certain recommendation,
I wouldn't study.

72
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,700
It's commendable.

73
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,100
I do it because...

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,500
I want to see you.

75
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,500
What?

76
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,100
I study because I want to see you.

77
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
I...

78
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,700
love you.

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,200
You are all I think about,

80
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,500
you are all...

81
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,100
that my eyes can see.

82
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,600
Am I not good enough?

83
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,000
Thank you.

84
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,700
But...

85
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,800
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,800
You won't even...

87
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,000
consider it.

88
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
I have someone I've liked for a long time.

89
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,000
Manju?

90
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,100
Yeah.

91
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
I see.

92
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,800
You must be wondering why, right?

93
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
I am.

94
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,600
Of course you are. Who wouldn't.

95
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,000
I lied. I'm not.

96
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,600
How do you want to get back?

97
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,800
Do you want to go together or do
you want to head back first?

98
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,300
I'll be fine on my own today.

99
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,600
Yeah.

100
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,300
It's ok, it's fine.

101
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Okay.

102
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,500
Dad said they're going out for dinner tonight.

103
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,100
Do you want to get in with me?

104
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,500
What?

105
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,900
I was just thinking this was fun.

106
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,000
Your thoughts are always
so easy to read on your face.

107
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,500
Well since your face won't show anything.

108
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,900
You still won't call me by my name?

109
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,100
Yui..

110
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,100
san.

111
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,100
Yui.

112
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,100
You seem embarrassed.

113
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
But...

114
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,300
Is this okay?

115
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,900
What?

116
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,300
Well, we're sisters, right?

117
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
We're family, right?

118
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,900
Are you scared?

119
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
There are times when I wonder
if it's alright to be doing this.

120
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,600
And not just that...

121
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
What?

122
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,300
I wonder how it works with two women.

123
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
You have...

124
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,400
slept with men before, haven't you?

125
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,400
Yeah.

126
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,300
That's right. You're worried.

127
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,200
Do you know how two women
are supposed to do it?

128
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I don't know.

129
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
And also...

130
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Is it alright for me to be your first?

131
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
Well look here...

132
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,300
I wouldn't mind it.

133
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,900
Okay.

134
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Rather than not minding

135
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,300
it's more like...

136
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Come here.

137
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,900
Yesterday...

138
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,500
Did you have plans with your sister?

139
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,200
Huh? No... Well, kind of.

140
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,300
Do you have time after school?

141
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,400
Do you want to go visit your mom's grave?

142
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,250
What? No, I don't. Why do you
want to go visit mom's grave?

143
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,700
It's a while until her 3rd death anniversary.

144
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,200
Well, then a preliminary visit.

145
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
What is that?

146
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Look here...

147
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,800
It's all over me.

148
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,300
Seriously!

149
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,800
More importantly,
it's mom's grave, so clean it carefully.

150
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
I am!

151
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,600
Does it feel good, mom?

152
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,400
She's saying,
"Hasn't Nao-kun become handsome!"

153
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,700
Uh, no she's not.

154
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
But I think she's happy you came.

155
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Yeah.

156
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
Okay.
Here.

157
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,300
The thing is, I don't know
what to do during a grave visit.

158
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Anything is fine. As long as
your feelings are there.

159
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,100
I see.

160
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,900
What were you saying to mom?

161
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,200
What?

162
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
You were praying for quite some time.

163
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,300
I was praying you don't become
even rounder in the future.

164
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:42,800
What?!

165
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,400
Who cares what it was?

166
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,300
Ah, that reminds me.
What do you think about Mirai?

167
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,100
Nothing at all.

168
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
There you go again!

169
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,100
I'm not letting you pretend you haven't noticed.

170
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,600
No, really, how long do you
plan to avoid it? It's Mirai!

171
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,400
What problem could you have with such a cute girl?

172
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,500
Yesterday, she told me she loves me.

173
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Oh! And then, and then?

174
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,500
I said I was sorry.

175
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,900
What?

176
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,200
Hold-- Hold up!

177
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,100
I don't understand you at all!

178
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,000
She's too good for you to begin with!

179
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,800
You shouldn't say "Sorry!"
You should say "Thank you!"

180
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,100
Are you an idiot?

181
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Maybe.

182
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,600
Maybe I am an idiot.

183
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What? That's awfully honest.

184
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,600
I'm staying over at your house today.

185
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,100
You can, but...

186
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Huh? Wai-- Wait up!

187
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:26,900

188
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,400
I'll go clean up my room,
so wait for just a bit.

189
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,300
Okay.

190
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,400
Sorry to disturb you.

191
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,500
Welcome.

192
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
I don't need a drink or anything.

193
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,200
Really?

194
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,300
Take your time, okay?

195
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,900
Did you go somewhere?

196
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,300
We went to visit Sayuri's mom's grave.

197
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Is that so?

198
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
I wish I'd gone with you.

199
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,800
I wanted to go alone with Sayuri today.

200
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,800
I made a promise to Sayuri's mom
before she passed away.

201
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,600
Sorry to keep you waiting.

202
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,600
What's wrong?

203
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,600
No, it's nothing.

204
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,600
What did you talk to my sister about?

205
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,600
Nothing.

206
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,200
Eh?

207
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,600
You're strange today.
What's wrong?

208
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,300
Before your mom passed away

209
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,800
she told me, "Please take care of Sayuri."

210
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,200
What? She said that?

211
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,500
Well, it's because she liked you.

212
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
That's why...

213
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,980
Today I went to ask her

214
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,500
to entrust you to me.

215
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,800
What?

216
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,500
I love you.

217
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Will you

218
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,300
go out with me?
