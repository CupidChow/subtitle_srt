1
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,620
What's going on?
First of all, I'll introduce you.

2
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,620
Madoka-san and Yui-chan.
I don't need an older sister.

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,430
I don't mind living with you.

4
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,630
Sayuri started dating.

5
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,630
Maybe she feels abandoned?

6
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:39,640
Nao-kun, how do you feel about Sayuri?
She's a childhood friend from the house next door.

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,640
That's it.
You have no feelings for her?

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,640
I have NO feelings for her.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,140
Sayuri.

10
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,650
It's not like you.
What?

11
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,350
If anything happens, talk to me.

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,150
I ended it.
Huh?

13
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,250
I'm telling you I ended it with Takeshi-kun.

14
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,350
Does it bother you your father remarried?
I'm telling you to get out.

15
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,810
It's delicious.

16
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,220
Well I am kind of a pro.
It sure is different.

17
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,220
Yeah, delicious.

18
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,220
Morning.

19
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,230
Morning.

20
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,930
Good morning.

21
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,230
Morning.

22
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,840
What's wrong?
What?

23
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,160
I mean, did something happen,
since you didn't get up.

24
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,160
I made dashi.
Ah... thanks.

25
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,890
Sayuri-chan, you're studying for exams

26
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,890
and waking up early every day to make dashi.
Must be tough, right?

27
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,890
I'm no good at it, but maybe I should sometimes make it in the morning?

28
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,890
That would be good.

29
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Is plain rice ok?
I don't need it.

30
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,410
Sayuri,

31
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,910
if something is bothering you, tell me.

32
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,910
I'm heading out.

33
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,620
So childish...

34
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,620
Childish, but cute.
I'm sure she is enduring a lot, too.

35
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,930
Yui-chan, I'm really sorry.
It's fine.

36
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,880
Tekiou, ouyou:
Application.

37
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Correct. Kiroku:
Document.

38
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,890
Aoi-san, naughty girl!
Sorry, sorry.

39
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,890
I have it just in case.

40
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,890
But that's good, better than getting
 lost in the heat of the moment.

41
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,190
The other day, Mako-chan's 
boyfriend didn't have one

42
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,900
and she tells me they got into a big fight.

43
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,900
Despite not having one,
he got carried away.

44
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,600
Ryo-kun wouldn't do that, right?
It wouldn't be like him.

45
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
But when the time comes, who knows.

46
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,810
In that situation, you'll know 
if he treats you right or not.

47
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,910
Hey, hey, hey!

48
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,410
Speaking of which, Sayuri,
how is it going with Takeshi?

49
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,920
It's not. We broke up.
Huh? Already?

50
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Speedy break-up?
So, you didn't do anything?

51
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,920
For now.
Not even kiss?

52
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,320
For now.
Good, good.

53
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,950
After all, your first kiss should be
with someone you love.

54
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,870
Mirai, haven't you had
 someone like that lately?

55
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,870
It's not like I haven't,

56
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,870
but the recommendation exam is soon

57
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,370
and I'm not in the mood for
such things now, so I declined.

58
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,680
It's not because of the recommendation exam,
but because you have someone you like, isn't it?

59
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,880
Huh?

60
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,580
What, what?
You have someone you like?

61
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,700
Ehh, who, who, who?

62
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,890
Is it someone I know?
Yes, it's someone you know.

63
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,900
It's your next door neighbor.

64
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,900
You like Nao?!
Yeah.

65
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
Ehh?!

66
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,310
Even I noticed that!
Ah, wait, seriously?

67
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,310
He's not good enough for you.
That's not true!

68
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,310
He's cool and kind...

69
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:53,010
Uwah, he'll get all cocky!
It kind of pisses me off.

70
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,820
Is Nao-kun really just your childhood friend?
You really have no feelings for him?

71
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,760
I have NO feelings for him.

72
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
The exact same response as Nao.

73
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,770
So... it's alright not to see you as a rival?
Yes, yes.

74
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,770
Uwah, he'll get all cocky~

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is a free fansub by Sanashi @ D-addicts
Not for sale or rent! Don't upload to streaming sites!

76
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,650
Ah... welcome.

77
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,950
Hello.

78
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,760
Isn't her sister extremely beautiful?

79
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,760
She's not related to Sayuri,
so it's not surprising.

80
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,960
Hold on, I'll bring out something.
It's fine, I'll do it.

81
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,160
I'll help.
It's fine, I will.

82
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,770
It's like a second home to me, anyway.

83
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,980
Is this plate okay?
A bigger one is better.

84
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,990
Here.
Thanks.

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,800
A plate for manju.
Shut up! Stop bugging me.

86
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,500
Tsubuan? Koshian?
(types of manju fillings)

87
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,000
Enough!
We can't use that, so put it away.

88
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,940
Are you in university?

89
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,950
No. I dropped out of university

90
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,950
and now I am an assistant
to a professional photographer.

91
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,950
So you'll be a photographer?

92
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,950
Yeah. I'd like to be.

93
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,650
Is the person you're working with
a famous photographer?

94
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,960
It's the man we saw the other day, right?
Ah... yes.

95
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Ehh, a boyfriend?
Her boyfriend is quite tall,

96
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,570
and he looks Spanish...

97
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,770
The two of them make
 such a good-looking couple.

98
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,170
Eh? He's Spanish?
He's not Spanish... - So cool!

99
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,970
Compared to me, he's this tall.

100
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,780
So tall!
He was so tall!

101
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,780
So he's not Spanish... maybe biracial?

102
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,980
Biracial people are nice.

103
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,380
What's wrong?

104
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,640
Nothing.

105
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,650
Come in.

106
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,950
Hold on.

107
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,280
Thanks for waiting.

108
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,700
What were you thinking?

109
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,030
Huh?
Yesteday.

110
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,930
Would you do that with just anyone?

111
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,940
Even though you have a boyfriend...
I can't believe it! - Saeki-san is...

112
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,940
You're the worst!

113
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,960
Okay, that's it.
Thanks for your hard work.

114
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,660
Thanks for your hard work.
Thank you.

115
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,960
Thanks for your hard work.

116
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,970
When we're done here, I'll drive you home.
Thank you for everything.

117
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,980
How was it, after that? At home.
Huh?

118
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,000
It's unusual to start living
 with someone at that age.

119
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,920
Especially when the other person is you.
It must be hard on both of you.

120
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
What do you mean?

121
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,930
You don't really show your true feelings.

122
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,930
New sister... Sayuri-chan, was it?

123
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,930
The other day, she completely ignored you.

124
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,940
She's very cute.
Is she? Well, she is at that age.

125
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,940
Alright, load the luggage first.

126
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,340
Okay.

127
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,350
How about

128
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,750
we casually ask if he has a girlfriend?

129
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,950
But really casually.

130
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,250
You don't need to ask that.
He definitely doesn't have one.

131
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,550
Why not ask about his Christmas plans?
Nao is definitely free.

132
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,650
Suddenly asking about Christmas?
Isn't that getting ahead of herself?

133
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,660
Ah!

134
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,170
Ah, there he is.

135
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,970
Thanks for waiting.
We weren't waiting, though.

136
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,570
Aoi and I are done for today.
We're going.

137
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,770
Then I'm also good for today.

138
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,510
Mirai-chan, what about you?

139
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,910
Mirai was waiting for you
to explain some things to her.

140
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,920
Oh? What?

141
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,420
Ah, this.

142
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,320
Oh. I don't understand this one either.

143
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,920
Huh?

144
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,930
If tomorrow is okay for you,

145
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,930
I'll teach you everything I know.

146
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,930
Useless superman.

147
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,940
Like you're the one to talk!
So predictable.

148
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,940
Shut up.

149
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,940
Somehow, I got hungry by looking at your face.

150
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,940
Let's drop by that curry place.
Huh?

151
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,950
What the hell? You asked me to go with you.

152
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,950
No, there's no need anymore.
Why?

153
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,950
I just wanted to collect points!
(for the point card)

154
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,960
Didn't you say you can only use it this month?

155
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Ah... No, but I don't need the points.
I don't need them.

156
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,260
What the hell. Come on, let's go.

157
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,960
See you tomorrow.
Wait, Nao!

158
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,970
I'm telling you I won't go!

159
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,670
Why not go?

160
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,910
Mirai?

161
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,910
It... It's not like that!
It's not!

162
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,350
I mean...
Sayuri.

163
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Whatever you say now, it's pointless.

164
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,550
I'm coming in.

165
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,150
I'll turn on the light, ok?

166
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Dinner is almost ready.
I'm not hungry.

167
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,590
Is it about your friend?

168
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,890
It's not.

169
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,890
Really?

170
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,900
Anyway, could you please leave?

171
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
Well...?

172
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,850
Mirai-chan, from before...

173
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,850
She likes Nao-kun, doesn't she?

174
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,860
I was thinking that maybe
something happened regarding that.

175
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,870
Maybe it's none of my business.

176
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,870
Should I leave, after all?

177
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Ah! Ow! W-what is it?

178
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Doing what Nao-kun does.
What?! Wai- It hurts!

179
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,300
Tsubuan? Koshian?
What?! Enough already, stop it!

180
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,900
I won't stop until you talk to me.
Fine, I'll talk, I'll talk.

181
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,400
Jeez!
What was that. Jeez...

182
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,840
I have a lot going on.
Yeah.

183
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:05,350
I had a misunderstanding
with Mirai and Aoi.

184
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,850
In the end, I think it was my fault.

185
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,860
But, I don't know what to do next.

186
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:26,870
There are parts of my and Nao's
relationship that can't suddenly change.

187
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,880
I've been with Nao since I was born.

188
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,880
It'd be weird if we suddenly started acting all formal.

189
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,890
But I really wouldn't mind

190
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,390
if Mirai and Nao started going out.

191
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,830
Shouldn't you try

192
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,830
telling Mirai-chan everything you just told me?

193
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,840
Is she the type of person who
wouldn't understand even if you explained?

194
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,840
No... she's not.

195
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,850
Okay then, I'm going.

196
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,860
If you get hungry, come down.

197
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,360
Hey...!
Yes?

198
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,860
Would you do it with anyone?
That.

199
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,870
Kissing and stuff.

Would you do it with anyone?
That.

202
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,630
Kissing and stuff.

203
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,440
Even though you have a boyfriend?

204
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,740
I don't have one now.

205
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,650
Even with a girl?

206
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,950
It was a first.

207
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Even so, it's not like
I was teasing you.

208
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,960
But...

209
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,760
I'm sorry if I made you feel bad.

210
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,680
Wait!

211
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,980
Say... Do you like both?

212
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,980
I mean.... both men and women?

213
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,920
I don't know.
You don't know...?

214
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,230
Have you dated a woman before?

215
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,630
Only men...

216
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:15,240
But I feel like my heart was
 locked away somewhere.

217
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,950
Huh?

218
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,950
This is the first time.

219
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,950
The first time it's not like that.

220
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,260
I'm sorry.
I can't explain it properly.

221
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,960
I don't really understand it myself.

222
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,970
But there is something I know.

223
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,980
I want to know you better.

224
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,920
When I look at you,
I want to touch you.

225
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:08,920
I think...
I'm probably in love with you.
