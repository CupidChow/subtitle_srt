1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Seriously, what is this?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,500
What do you even mean
when you say you're probably in love with me?

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,300
Since the day you came,
everything's been messed up!

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,370
About the eggs...

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,370
Mom's were creamier.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,370
They were so delicious.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,380
But... it's not like Madoka-san's
weren't tasty.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,380
It's fine. I understand.

9
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,400
Morning.
Good morning.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,300
Are you alright?
You should rest today.

11
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,050
No, I have a test soon.

12
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,900
You do? Don't ovedo it.
Okay.

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,800
Ah, I made dashi.

14
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,100
Could I leave the rest to you?

15
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,400
You won't be eating breakfast?
As expected, I have no appetite.

16
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,900
I'm heading out.

17
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,400
Take care.
I will.

18
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Morning.

19
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Sorry.

20
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,100
Morning.
Morning.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,100
Did something happen with Sayuri-chan?

22
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,300
Why?
It's just that...

23
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,300
You took care of her when she was sick, so
 I thought you started acting sisterly, and yet...

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
But I guess things can't work out overnight.

25
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
It's hot.

26
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,600
Hey, you'll catch a cold!
Then don't pass it on to me.

27
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,100
Anyway, put this on.
Thanks.

28
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Did something happen at home?

29
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,100
Why?

30
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,900
It's just that you haven't stayed over lately.

31
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,870
Yeah...

32
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,400
It's comfortable here.

33
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,400
What?! Move, move!

34
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,900
What is it?
Found it!

35
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,300
I've been looking for it for ages!
I'm so glad!

36
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,600
Don't forget your stuff here, like a lover.

37
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,300
What if my girlfriend had said
"Hey, Nao-kun, what is this?!"

38
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,800
What would you have done?

39
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,300
Girlfriend? Where? Where?

40
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,300
Shut up!

41
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,800
Well, there may be plans to
get you one soon. A girlfriend.

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,400
What kind of plans?

43
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,800
What kind of face is that?

44
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,600
Handsome?

45
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
Apologize to all the handsome men in the world!

46
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,300
Should you be saying stuff like that?

47
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Face your manju punishment!
No! Ow ow ow!

48
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,100
Seriously.

49
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Ow! No way!

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,200
What is it with you?

51
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,000
That's dangerous.
Go to sleep.

52
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,100
You damaged your manga, didn't you?
You... seriously.
Incoming call: Shida Yui

53
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,300
You should sleep because you had a cold.
Incoming call: Shida Yui

54
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,600
Incoming call: Shida Yui

55
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,300
How's it been since your dad remarried?

56
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,800
What do you mean?

57
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,330
They're good people at heart, right?

58
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,330
Both your new mother
and sister.

59
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,000
Speaking of which,
your dad got himself quite a catch.

60
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,600
Your new mother is very beautiful.

61
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,600
I guess.

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But...

63
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,000
How should I say it...

64
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,850
I can't figure out that person.

65
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,650
Yui-san.

66
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,100
What is she like, honestly?

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,500
What is she...

68
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,600
She has a kind side.

69
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah.

70
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,700
She understands things about me...

71
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,100
Such as?

72
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,900
About mom and such.

73
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,300
I see.

74
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,200
But I'm not entirely sure...

75
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,800
Huh?

76
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,300
Is it fine the way things are?

77
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,300
Somehow...

78
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,300
She doesn't feel like an older sister at all.

80
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,000
I wonder who it is at this hour.

81
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,600
What happened?

82
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,380
Sayuri-chan is at your place, isn't she?

83
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,300
She is.

84
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,000
Thank goodness!

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Have you been looking for her this whole time?

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,600
Ah, no, it's fine.

87
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm sorry for coming so late at night.

88
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,900
Well then, good night!

89
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,000
She was seriously worried!

90
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Why didn't you tell her you'd be staying over?

91
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,400
Hey, are you listening?

92
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,300
Huh? Ah, yeah.

93
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,400
Is something wrong?

94
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,000
Say, Nao...
Yeah?

95
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,100
Have you ever kissed someone?
What?

96
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,900
So you haven't.

97
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,600
Of course I have!

98
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,200
Ooh? Who, who?

99
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,100
Well, you haven't either, have you!

100
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,700
What?

101
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,700
What?!

102
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,100
I haven't.
Yeah.

103
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,400
What I mean to ask is,
when do you normally do that?

104
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,900
When do you normally...

105
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,500
Would you like to try and see?

106
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,300
Don't be stupid!

107
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,400
Ok, I'll be sleeping downstairs.

108
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Thanks.

109
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I missed this smell.

110
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,100
In the past, we used to sleep side by side, right?

111
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,400
I'm turning off the lights.

112
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Night.
Night.

113
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,350
Here.
Thanks.

114
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,300
I've been thinking...

115
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,700
Yes?

116
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,800
Maybe we were being unreasonable.

117
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,370
What?

118
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,200
This house has become uncomfortable
for Sayuri-chan to live in.

119
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,400
Isn't that why she's staying over
at the house next door?

120
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,700
What's wrong with doing that
from time to time?

121
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,900
Keigo-san.

122
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,000
Look...

123
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,390
We don't have to be fixated on marriage, right?

124
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,800
I wouldn't mind us living apart.

125
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
Ah! Hey, do you mind if we go in?

126
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,650
Alright, let's go, let's go.

127
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,300
Ah, how cute!

128
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,600
Ah!

129
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,700
Wow, it's so cute!

130
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,200
What is this?
For the door?

131
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,900
How cute!

132
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,000
I've been thinking about
replacing my slippers.

133
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,200
Those are cute.
Right?

134
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,800
What's this?
What's that?

135
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Ah, it's a magnet.

136
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,100
The pink one is cute. Is this genuine?
Let me see.

137
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,300
Come in.

138
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,700
Welcome home.

139
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,900
What is it?

140
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
What?

141
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Take this.

142
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
What?

143
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
For me?

144
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,700
Can I open it?

145
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,400
Different color?

146
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,100
Because it's weird for you to
still be using guest slippers.

147
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
How cute.

148
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,500
Thank you, Sayuri-chan.

149
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
I'm off.

150
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,700
I'm off.

151
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,500
What should we do today?

152
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,300
It's been cold lately, so I don't
feel like going to the park.

153
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,700
But I don't feel like going straight home either.

154
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,500
Sorry, I have plans today.
I'll head home first.

155
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,300
Hey, didn't Sayuri have a skip in her step just now?

156
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
She did.

157
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,500
This is good.

158
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,050
Thank you.

159
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,570
I can't take photos like this,
but they're good.

160
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Saeki-san's photos
have incredible energy.

161
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,150
That is why I love them.

162
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,100
Just the photos?

163
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Even now,

164
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,800
my feelings for you...

166
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm home.

167
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
What?

168
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,970
How should I say it...

169
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:38,670
Yes?

170
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
Is Saeki-san just your boss?

171
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Aren't you actually dating?

172
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,500
I am not dating him now.

173
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,700
My mind is all muddled already!

174
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,500
What do you even want?
You're the only one acting indifferent.

175
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,400
First and foremost,

176
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
suddenly showing up at my house,

177
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,900
saying don't mind living with me,
suddenly kissing me...

178
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,200
saying you want to know me,
saying you want to touch me,

179
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,900
saying you love me.

180
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Always looking like you know everything.

181
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,400
Then actually really understanding
everything about me.

182
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,700
Going out to find me,
even though no one asked you to.

183
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,300
Steadily finding your way
inside my heart.

184
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,900
By doing that, you...

185
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,200
Maybe you were teasing me,
or having fun by doing that.

186
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,000
I've been feeling confused,
since the day you came.

187
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,300
It's driving me crazy!

188
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Ever since that day,

189
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,800
I can't stop thinking about the kiss.

190
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,000
I saw you with Saeki-san just now,

191
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,800
and I felt so annoyed.

192
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,300
What is this? Could this be jealousy?
I thought to myself.

193
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,900
I actually realized that I didn't mind kissing you.

194
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,300
Not at all.

195
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,300
I thought how I'd like to kiss you again.

196
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,300
See, I've already gone crazy, right?

197
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,100
I don't even recognize myself anymore.

198
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,800
Doesn't this mean...

199
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,000
that you love me too?
