- Arrest them! - Arrest them!

6
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:51,475
A case of fraud and embezzlement occurred.

7
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:53,945
A union representative committed fraud against...

8
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:55,804
the union members working on a public housing project.

9
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:59,445
The project had been approved by the head,

10
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:01,515
so they're holding JU Construction responsible.

11
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:03,484
The damage amounts to 3.4 million dollars.

12
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:06,984
The full amount was withdrawn on December 27 of last year.

13
00:01:07,585 --> 00:01:09,285
- Mr. Gu. - Yes?

14
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:11,695
Please tell us more about the public housing project.

15
00:01:13,695 --> 00:01:14,965
Well...

16
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:18,295
It's a part of our social contribution project.

17
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:21,604
It's a reconstruction project for low-income families,

18
00:01:21,804 --> 00:01:22,835
and...

19
00:01:24,035 --> 00:01:25,104
And...

20
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:26,835
The project scale is small...

21
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:29,045
and only the residents who want to participate take part.

22
00:01:29,545 --> 00:01:31,475
The advantage is that the project period is short.

23
00:01:31,645 --> 00:01:32,674
The benefits are good, too.

24
00:01:32,674 --> 00:01:34,244
You can get low-interest loans,

25
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:36,085
and there is a lot of support from the company.

26
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:39,085
Yes, that's right.

27
00:01:39,714 --> 00:01:42,585
So did they embezzle 3.4 million dollars of loan?

28
00:01:42,585 --> 00:01:45,625
How can a project with a union cost only 3.4 million dollars?

29
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:47,824
JU Construction takes on projects worth over 100 million dollars.

30
00:01:47,824 --> 00:01:49,725
To the union members, it's their entire fortune.

31
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:54,434
Let's start auditing.

32
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:56,835
We should catch the union representative...

33
00:01:56,835 --> 00:02:00,134
who broke the trust and stole the hope of the union members.

34
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:03,074
Isn't that the police's job?

35
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:05,175
We'll first interview...

36
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:07,945
the head of the Housing Team who approved the project.

37
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:10,585
Okay.

Mr. Shin.

44
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:54,025
Ms. Yu is here.

45
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,074
I'm the Audit Team's manager, Shin Cha Il.

46
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:14,315
Please consent to an interview.

(The Auditors)

49
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:35,104
An issue occurred with the public housing project...

50
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:36,364
which was pushed forward in January last year.

51
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:39,805
The union members are claiming the project funds disappeared...

52
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:42,975
and suspect a relationship between you and the union rep.

53
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:00,025
The union rep...

54
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:01,764
came to the office...

55
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:03,465
with a business plan that was stamped...

56
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:06,035
by the members.

57
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:08,465
There was no reason not to approve the withdrawal...

58
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:11,275
since they were entrusted by the union with the stamp.

59
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:13,275
That business plan was fake.

60
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:15,875
You didn't review it properly.

61
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,074
I was swamped that day with approving each division.

62
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:20,275
That's an excuse.

63
00:04:21,315 --> 00:04:23,414
I had no idea it would turn out this way.

64
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:26,285
I know those people struggle with their finances.

65
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,185
They were fooled by the union rep.

66
00:04:35,495 --> 00:04:37,225
How have you been, Cha Il?

67
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:40,764
- I was terribly worried. - Ms. Yu.

68
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:43,305
This is an interview on embezzlement.

69
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:45,275
I can't do it anymore.

70
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:47,745
Let's postpone it.

(Education: Sunghan University, Architecture, BA)

73
00:04:55,784 --> 00:04:57,344
Mr. Shin and Ms. Yu majored in architecture...

74
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:59,315
at the same university.

75
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:01,485
Mr. Shin is two years older than her.

76
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:03,985
My hunch tells me that the two...

77
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:05,995
either dated...

78
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,894
or had something going on.

79
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,594
Your hunch is not like before, Ms. Ok.

80
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:12,865
If everyone in the same major and university dated,

81
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:14,834
I should've dated Myung Sun from Marketing.

82
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:17,034
You all saw it earlier, right?

83
00:05:17,204 --> 00:05:19,305
The moment Ms. Yu saw Mr. Shin,

84
00:05:19,574 --> 00:05:22,605
she called out his name and teared up.

85
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:25,115
Hold on. If Ms. Yu cried,

86
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:27,485
it must've been Mr. Shin who broke it off.

87
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:28,514
I knew it.

88
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:30,784
- That... - Ms. Yu is married.

89
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:33,284
Isn't this silly talk bad manners?

90
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:35,625
We're just having a little chitchat, aren't we?

91
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,654
It's this kind of chitchat that causes rumours.

92
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:39,454
And rumours are like vicious comments.

93
00:05:40,224 --> 00:05:43,125
She's right. You went too far, Mr. Gu.

94
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,065
- What? - Don't spread rumours.

95
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:46,394
- I did? - Mr. Gu.

96
00:05:46,695 --> 00:05:48,505
Stop starting rumours.

97
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:54,445
Please come to the next interview.

98
00:06:10,154 --> 00:06:12,855
Mr. Shin. By any chance, are you going to the public housing?

99
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:15,125
- Yes. - May I tag along?

100
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:17,365
I'll be of help. I know that area well.

101
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:22,964
Look into Ms. Yu's company credit card details.

102
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:24,204
Understood.

103
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:33,344
Good grief. Mr. Shin sure is amazing.

104
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:34,945

105
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:36,945
He cares about none of them.

106
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:39,485
Gosh, what an honourable man.

107
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:41,755
He's simply cold-hearted.

108
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:44,495
It's nothing you should look up to. Seriously.

109
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:45,995

One, deny you didn't do so.

113

Two, admit doing so and apologize.

115
00:07:02,745 --> 00:07:05,274

It's the housing promotional flyer the union rep handed out.

154
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:31,395
I signed the paper because he said...

155
00:09:31,795 --> 00:09:34,395
I'd be able to live in such a dreamy house.

156
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:38,834

with the union rep?

163
00:09:53,645 --> 00:09:56,545
Isn't it obvious? He withdrew the money because...

164
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:57,854

165

That wasn't what Mr. Shin meant, sir.

166
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:02,185
If they worked together,

167
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,824
Ms. Yu shouldn't be coming to work.

168
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:05,454
Only then does your conclusion make sense.

169
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:07,295
It's because the bank account was accessible...

170
00:10:07,295 --> 00:10:08,425

00:10:56,344 --> 00:10:58,045
(Funeral Hall Entrance)

184
00:11:02,844 --> 00:11:05,214
- What is it? - I have high-level information.

185
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:07,315
Remember the commotion this morning?

186
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:10,555
Apparently, it's connected to the approval by Ms. Yu Mi Kyung...

187
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:12,895
- from the Housing Team. - Get to the point.

188
00:11:12,895 --> 00:11:14,055
All right.

189
00:11:14,594 --> 00:11:18,135
Ms. Yu and that Shin Cha Il attended the same university.

190
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,535
They used to be a thing.

191
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:23,305
Rumour has it that the two used to date.

192
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:27,604
(Funeral Hall)

193
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:29,974
Really.

194
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:32,744
MOLIT must indeed be scary.

195
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:35,584
Even so, you didn't have to attend...

196
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:37,415
the funeral of the Vice-Minister's grandma.

197
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:39,555
- How much did you pay? - Fifty dollars.

198
00:11:40,515 --> 00:11:41,655
You're joking, right?

199
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:43,655
Don't you know the Civil Servant's Improper Solicitation and Graft Act?

200
00:11:43,655 --> 00:11:45,795
But Hwang Gun Woong never went this far.

201
00:12:03,905 --> 00:12:06,515
(Jang Hye Eun, Kim Min Woo, Hwang Dae Woong)

202
00:12:10,185 --> 00:12:12,555
Oh, my. If it isn't Vice President Hwang.

203
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:16,254
You're heartbroken. It's only right of me to come.

204
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:17,354
Thank you.

205
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:19,224
The construction is going well, yes?

206
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:22,094
And the tower crane incident has been settled, yes?

207
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:24,094
Yes, sort of.

208
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:25,695
- Grandpa! - Hey.

209
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:28,364
I hope such accidents don't happen...

210
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:30,464
in the world my grandson lives in.

211
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:31,704
Gosh.

212
00:12:33,074 --> 00:12:35,474
He'll live without worrying about money.

213
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:37,474
There won't be any accidents whatsoever.

214
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:39,574
How about some pocket money?

215
00:12:39,574 --> 00:12:41,114
Thank you.

216
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:45,984
Here. This way.

217
00:12:56,094 --> 00:12:57,525
(Audit Team Junior Manager Ok A Jung)

218
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:59,935
- This is Shin Cha Il. - It's me, Ok A Jung.

219
00:13:00,065 --> 00:13:02,004
I looked into Ms. Yu's company credit card details.

220
00:13:02,004 --> 00:13:03,905
She only used the card for company get-togethers.

221
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:07,004
Just in case, I also interviewed the Housing Team members.

222
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:09,775
All of them stated the union rep stabbed Ms. Yu in the back.

223
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:11,344
Understood.

224
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,984
What happens if even Ms. Yu turns out to be deceived?

225
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:16,145
She's still responsible.

226
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:18,515
Responsible for approving a flawed project.

227
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:23,254
Does Ms. Yu have to make up for all 3.4 million dollars?

228
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:24,555
If it wasn't deliberate embezzlement,

229
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,354
JU Construction will compensate.

230
00:13:26,594 --> 00:13:27,994
But she must be disciplined.

231
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:30,065
And get sued if necessary.

232
00:13:43,374 --> 00:13:45,614
Please park the car for me. Then go home.

233
00:13:45,874 --> 00:13:46,915
Sorry?

234
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:49,185
What...

235
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:03,895
Aren't you curious about what Mr. Shin's interview is like?

236
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:39,094
I think Mr. Shin will catch us doing this.

237
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:41,704
Then we'll just tell him we're grabbing a cocktail together.

238
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:44,604
What do you want?

239
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:51,275
I feel like I can finally breathe.

240
00:14:53,474 --> 00:14:55,145
How have you been?

241
00:15:00,354 --> 00:15:01,754
I am conducting an interview right now.

242
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:05,854
How did you and the union rep meet?

243
00:15:09,094 --> 00:15:10,525
I haven't been doing that great.

244
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:11,935
This isn't a personal conversation.

245
00:15:12,594 --> 00:15:14,665
How did you and the union rep meet?

246
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:18,535
He...

247
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:20,675
called me to inquire about...

248
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:22,405
the public housing maintenance project.

249
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:25,045
We were struggling to meet the quarterly quota,

250
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:26,114
so we moved ahead with it.

251
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:28,744
When did you find out that he had withdrawn the money?

252
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:30,515
The police informed me about it,

253
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:32,315
so I went to the police station that day.

254
00:15:34,454 --> 00:15:36,525
I was frazzled because I was in utter shock,

255
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:39,994
but I told them everything I knew hoping I could be of help to them.

256
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:42,494
About the union rep...

257
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:45,895
Did you ever meet him in private?

258
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:48,734
Why would I meet him in private?

259
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:51,974
Cha Il, are you suspecting me now?

260
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:53,405
Did you ever meet him in private?

261
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:56,405
You know, I was happy and excited to see you again earlier.

262
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:59,214
Can't you treat me like you used to, even for just a few minutes?

263
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:01,945
Are you struggling financially?

264
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:03,185
What if I am?

265
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:05,354
Do you think I embezzled the money?

266
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:08,484
I know you've requested a transfer to the branch office in Florida.

267
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:14,425
I...

268
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:17,464
got a divorce,

269
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:20,265
so I wanted to just let it all go and leave.

270
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:24,635
You, of all people...

271
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:29,344
I really didn't want you to see any of this.

272
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:33,874
My gosh. She's crying again.

273
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:36,584
Mr. Shin made her cry again.

274
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,084
Isn't it illegal to conduct such a coercive audit?

275
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:44,795
I think it's more illegal to watch them in secret like this.

276
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,854
That's true.

277
00:17:00,805 --> 00:17:02,405
Thank you for walking me here.

278
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:05,474
I...

279
00:17:06,244 --> 00:17:07,874
will take responsibility for my mistake.

280
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:10,645
I will not avoid it.

281
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:14,155
So, let's talk about you now.

282
00:17:14,714 --> 00:17:16,785
How did you end up joining the Audit Team?

283
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:22,695
Do you know that you've changed so much?

284
00:17:23,224 --> 00:17:25,964
Back in college, you weren't scary at all.

285
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:30,604
You were sweet, caring,

286
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:33,135
and cool.

287
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:35,304
We'll perform a forensic analysis on your computer tomorrow.

288
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:00,835
My gosh.

289
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:03,405
Well, did you see that?

290
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,335
Can you believe it?

291
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,034
I didn't think Mr. Shin would blur the line...

292
00:18:07,034 --> 00:18:08,034
between work and personal.

293
00:18:08,034 --> 00:18:10,304
I think he's just taking her home because she's hurt.

294
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:12,544
No, there was definitely something.

295
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:14,774
You're drunk. Let's go.

296
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:16,345
No, I'm not drunk.

297
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,885
I'll wait here until I see him leave.

298
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,385
Well, I'm off.

299
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:23,754
What?

300
00:18:30,395 --> 00:18:31,425
Cha Il.

301
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:35,264
We had so much fun together back in college.

302
00:18:39,974 --> 00:18:42,375
Use a 30-degree blade for precise cutting.

303
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:44,875
It also helps you make detailed cuts.

304
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:50,915
Cha Il, why did you decide to major in Architecture?

305
00:18:52,655 --> 00:18:53,814
To help my father with his business.

306
00:18:54,585 --> 00:18:55,984
Don't use super glue...

307
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:57,885
because it can melt woodrock.

308
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:02,595
For me, it was because I wanted to live a life like a fairy tale.

309
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:07,564
To build a village and a house that you'd see in a fairy tale...

310
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,304
and meet a fairy-tale prince.

311
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:36,294
Two hundred thousand dollars per house?

312
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:41,234
Our old house in Yanghui-dong is involved in a redevelopment scam?

313
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,764
Yes.

314
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,375
Had we not moved, we would've fallen for the scam too.

315
00:19:46,004 --> 00:19:47,734
If Dae Woong hadn't gotten us this house, that is.

316
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,774
Dae Woong never finishes his food these days and seems irritable.

317
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,244
Is something going on at work?

318
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:15,635
So, what do you think of your new manager?

319
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:17,105
Is he stressing you out?

320
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:20,534
My gosh. The so-called president of the company...

321
00:20:20,534 --> 00:20:23,075
hired externally just to kick me out.

322
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:25,214
This darned company.

323
00:20:26,274 --> 00:20:28,044
I had no one to count on,

324
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:30,484
so I'm happy to know that you've got my back, kiddo.

325
00:20:31,244 --> 00:20:32,784
If anyone ever stresses you out at work,

326
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:34,314
tell me right away.

327
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:35,655
I'll teach them a lesson.

328
00:20:35,754 --> 00:20:37,425
All right, there.

329
00:20:38,224 --> 00:20:40,195
It's done. Is there anything else you need fixed?

330
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:41,895
Tell me so I can fix them all while I'm here.

Goodness. Way to go. Oh, boy.

339
00:21:35,185 --> 00:21:36,214
No way.

340
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:42,355
Mr. Shin Cha Il!

341
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,994
You said the interview came first.

342
00:21:45,994 --> 00:21:48,395
But it turns out that romance comes first.

343
00:21:48,825 --> 00:21:51,895
Stiff and rigid.

344
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:53,595
When you were dealing with Foreman Bae,

345
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:55,804
you were like a stiff robot.

346
00:21:56,004 --> 00:21:57,105
But with Ms. Yu...

347
00:21:57,105 --> 00:21:59,704
Smooth and soft.

348
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:02,204
Yes, you're...

349
00:22:02,675 --> 00:22:05,514
such a softie. Right?

350
00:22:06,244 --> 00:22:07,575
To me, you were like...

351
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:09,615
"You trust people too much."

352
00:22:09,615 --> 00:22:12,214
"Get out at once!" You said that to me.

353
00:22:12,554 --> 00:22:15,655
Oh, gosh. How could you do this after saying that to me?

354
00:22:18,695 --> 00:22:19,954
Mr. Shin Cha Il!

355
00:22:23,794 --> 00:22:27,734
You're a romantic after all.

356
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:31,234
But can't you...

357
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:34,905
love me too?

358
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,544
Please.

359
00:22:48,524 --> 00:22:51,425
Hey, Han Soo. Why the long face when we're just starting our day?

360
00:22:52,095 --> 00:22:53,695
It's part of your job to always keep a smile on.

364
00:23:00,294 --> 00:23:02,665
Hello. Is Mr. Shin not here yet?

365
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:04,105
He's meeting with the Ethics Committee.

366
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:05,375
Why?

367
00:23:05,504 --> 00:23:06,605
Check the forum.

368
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,405
Hurry up and read it.

(Reporting Audit Team Manager Shin Cha Il for sexual harassment)

371
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:18,615
- What? - What is this?

372
00:23:18,754 --> 00:23:19,855
Is this true?

373
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:30,125
Earlier this morning, Ms. Yu Mi Kyung called...

374
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:32,234
and said you forced her to drink last night,

375
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:34,335
using the interview as an excuse.

376
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:36,365
She also said...

377
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:38,405
you followed her into her home and sexually harassed her...

378
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,504
and that you would've raped her...

379
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:43,675
had she not managed to sober up.

380
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:48,274
She's in utter shock and is hospitalized at the moment.

381
00:23:49,484 --> 00:23:51,085
What's there to discuss?

382
00:23:51,085 --> 00:23:52,454
It's a clear case of sexual harassment.

383
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:57,685
I guess you still have feelings for your ex when she's moved on.

384
00:23:58,054 --> 00:23:59,054
Is this true?

385
00:24:03,494 --> 00:24:06,064
- No, it is not. - Of course, you'll play dumb.

386
00:24:06,234 --> 00:24:08,135
But there are pictures, you see.

387
00:24:10,835 --> 00:24:12,234
You're mulling over this?

388
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,075
Ms. Cho, is this something to mull over?

389
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:17,075
If we fail to get this sorted out internally,

390
00:24:17,075 --> 00:24:18,744
and if she decides to take legal action,

391
00:24:19,214 --> 00:24:21,014
the company's public image will be ruined.

392
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:23,615
The pictures are sufficient as evidence.

393
00:24:24,514 --> 00:24:25,585
Agreed.

394
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:29,484
If we can't get it sorted out by next week,

395
00:24:29,855 --> 00:24:31,685
Ms. Yu will be transferred to the branch office in Florida.

396
00:24:32,695 --> 00:24:33,925
Sort it out before then.

397
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:40,665
What was that?

398
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,105
That's not right.

399
00:24:43,105 --> 00:24:45,165
Ms. Yu is being audited.

400
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:47,004

402
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:00,885
Darn it.

403
00:25:02,054 --> 00:25:04,484
Don't you think it's weird?

404
00:25:04,855 --> 00:25:06,825
We saw them together yesterday.

405
00:25:07,254 --> 00:25:09,794
Mr. Shin and sexual assault? It just feels...

406
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,695
I can't believe it.

407
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:13,635
I cautiously suggest...

408
00:25:13,635 --> 00:25:15,534
- there was a misunderstanding. - Right?

409
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:16,964
What misunderstanding?

410
00:25:17,304 --> 00:25:20,575
Normal-looking people tend to have dirtier minds,

411
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:22,474

412
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:25,774

00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,554
Don't you know what happened?

417
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:40,195
(All I learned is...)

418
00:25:40,724 --> 00:25:44,494
All I learned is that you shouldn't mix cocktails with beer.

419
00:25:44,494 --> 00:25:45,695
I don't remember anything.

420
00:25:47,564 --> 00:25:50,605
Mr. Gu, come to the basement parking level with Ms. Yoon.

422
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:53,135
Mr. Shin wants to see us downstairs.

423
00:25:57,405 --> 00:26:00,274
Did you see anyone suspicious as you followed me yesterday?

424
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:02,044
Well...

425
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:03,845
I didn't.

426
00:26:03,945 --> 00:26:05,115
And you, Ms. Yoon?

427
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:07,254
I didn't either.

428
00:26:07,254 --> 00:26:08,415
I'm sorry.

429
00:26:08,415 --> 00:26:10,254
Try harder to hide if you're following someone.

430
00:26:10,355 --> 00:26:13,024
If I were an embezzler, you messed up badly.

431
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:27,704
I will start looking for whoever took the photos.

432
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:32,004
They'll be Ms. Yu's accomplice, right?

433
00:26:32,244 --> 00:26:33,544
That's very likely.

434
00:26:35,685 --> 00:26:38,415
I'm really sorry about last night,

435
00:26:39,615 --> 00:26:42,984
I need your explanation to understand...

436
00:26:43,984 --> 00:26:45,825

437
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:50,595

"The Ministry of Employment and Labour will get involved..."

439
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:01,905
"to thoroughly investigate workplace sexual assault..."

440
00:27:01,905 --> 00:27:04,774
"when the company fails to do so."

441
00:27:07,514 --> 00:27:10,345
If this gets out, we'll go down for sexual assault.

442
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:13,484
Why must we take that risk?

443
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:15,284
Who is he?

444
00:27:15,355 --> 00:27:17,685
Mr. Shin will handle that issue.

445
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:19,294
Focus on your own job.

446
00:27:19,294 --> 00:27:20,524

447
00:27:20,524 --> 00:27:24,464
I can't get my job done because that jerk keeps getting on my nerves.

448
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:28,935
It's me, isn't it?

449
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,865

453

454
00:27:44,814 --> 00:27:46,754

455

You're taking a risk.

457

If you want to...

458
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:58,165
keep your position even just a little longer,

459
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:01,264
I suggest you fire that scumbag first.

460

The angle tells me the photographer was stationary.

461
00:28:21,115 --> 00:28:22,585
The reflected lights say...

462
00:28:22,585 --> 00:28:23,885
it was taken from inside a car.

463
00:28:35,294 --> 00:28:36,365
I think this is the spot.

464
00:28:36,905 --> 00:28:39,034
We should find the car that was parked here last night.

465
00:28:39,105 --> 00:28:41,135
We can check nearby CCTV cameras.

466
00:28:42,474 --> 00:28:43,675
Mr. Shin.

467
00:28:50,244 --> 00:28:53,185
What's a sexual assaulter doing outside the victim's place?

468
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:56,054
Who are you?

The husband of this man's victim last night.

470
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:04,024
I think you're mistaken.

471
00:29:04,895 --> 00:29:06,964
Right. Our manager's not that kind of guy.

472
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:09,264
Can you kids keep your mouths shut?

473
00:29:11,905 --> 00:29:13,175
Did you take the photos?

474
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:14,534
Yes, I did.

475
00:29:16,304 --> 00:29:18,175
Did you plan this with Ms. Yu?

476
00:29:21,314 --> 00:29:23,885
I see you're quite imaginative.

477
00:29:24,415 --> 00:29:25,784
I have just one goal.

478
00:29:26,954 --> 00:29:29,155
To get you fired from my wife's job.

479
00:29:30,554 --> 00:29:32,655
I filmed you too, so stay away.

480
00:29:41,264 --> 00:29:44,135
Ms. Yoon. Go to the hospital and interview Ms. Yu.

481
00:29:44,234 --> 00:29:45,504
Cho Kyung Soo from the Ethics Committee...

482
00:29:45,504 --> 00:29:47,575
- will know where it is. - Okay.

483
00:29:47,835 --> 00:29:49,004
I'll come with you.

484
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:51,304
Ms. Yu's husband might be there.

485
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:53,345
Ms. Yu told me she was divorced.

486
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:55,814
Then was that guy...

487
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:57,214
her ex-husband?

488
00:29:57,314 --> 00:30:01,655
Ms. Yu's doing a lot of things to confuse the audit.

489
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,085
Look into the facts and report back.

490
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:05,724
Okay.

491
00:30:10,195 --> 00:30:11,695
Call when you're free.

492
00:30:12,264 --> 00:30:13,534
I need to make a call.

493
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:14,695
Okay.

494
00:30:18,764 --> 00:30:20,575
You think there was no sexual assault,

495
00:30:21,474 --> 00:30:24,274
and her ex-husband took the photos?

496
00:30:26,244 --> 00:30:27,445
Ms. Yu's divorced?

497
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:31,145
Okay, got it.

498
00:30:31,685 --> 00:30:32,885

When was business ever good?

502
00:30:53,504 --> 00:30:54,804
Didn't your company,

The Myeong Construction, work on a housing development project?

504
00:31:05,971 --> 00:31:07,971
Hey, stop. Wait.

- What's this? - Undersecretary Ahn.

00:31:15,511 --> 00:31:18,542
He signs off on all the repairs and permits of heavy machinery.

507
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:19,812
Lose the game to him...

508
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:21,481
and give him the clubs saying they're not for you.

509
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,481
We fought, but we still run a company together.

510
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:26,691
Why would I give him...

511
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:27,892
clubs I played with?

512
00:31:28,592 --> 00:31:30,161
That's how you don't get caught.

513
00:31:30,362 --> 00:31:32,792
These are worth 30 grand and almost brand new.

514
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,961
You gave him just 50 dollars at the funeral.

515
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:36,761
He thinks that's the fare to the golf course.

516
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,602
He'll expect another actual gift.

517
00:31:38,602 --> 00:31:39,872
We don't do that anymore.

518
00:31:43,572 --> 00:31:46,171
Tick him off and he'll say our machines are defective.

519
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,812
He did that once before and it messed us up bad.

520
00:31:48,812 --> 00:31:50,112
Time are changing...

521
00:31:50,112 --> 00:31:51,211
Darn it!

522
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:53,411
The times?

523
00:31:54,152 --> 00:31:55,652
They definitely are changing.

524
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:56,822
But...

525
00:31:57,521 --> 00:32:01,021
in our lifetime, sewage will only become muddy water.

526
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,622
That's the point.

527
00:32:29,521 --> 00:32:32,822
No, but you said they dated. That they were together.

528
00:32:32,822 --> 00:32:35,862
Where did the sexual harassment come from?

529
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:38,221
Ms. Yu had been having a rough time.

530
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:40,132
And Shin Cha Il is a manager now.

531
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:42,431
So he tried to use his title and power...

532
00:32:42,431 --> 00:32:44,701
to hit on his old girlfriend,

533
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:46,372
but Ms. Yu's married.

534
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:47,931
"Are you kidding me? No way."

535
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:49,441
Mr. Shin went, "Hey!"

536
00:32:49,441 --> 00:32:51,902
"Can't I still love you?"

537
00:32:52,572 --> 00:32:54,411
That's what happened.

538
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:56,782
I'll tell the vice president.

539
00:32:56,782 --> 00:32:58,481
Are you sure of this? You must be.

540
00:32:58,481 --> 00:32:59,882
You're definitely sure, right?

541
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,011
Go and report.

00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:03,481
See you.

543
00:33:16,231 --> 00:33:17,302
Mr. Shin.

544
00:33:18,302 --> 00:33:19,402
Why are you here?

545
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:22,501
What are you doing?

546
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:24,201
Ms. Yu is not in.

547
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:25,602
My team has the authority to do this.

548
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:32,481
Apologize.

549
00:33:32,582 --> 00:33:34,011
To Ms. Yu, and to us too.

550
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:35,951
You're insulting our whole team.

551
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:37,282
I won't be apologizing.

552
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:38,722
Then explain yourself!

553
00:33:38,822 --> 00:33:40,251
You sexually assaulted Ms. Yu.

554
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,251
He's right. You must apologize to Ms. Yu.

555
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:44,021
Put her stuff down and leave!

556
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:46,262
- Explain yourself! - What is going on?

557
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:50,802
What a mess.

558
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:54,171
Did the employees at the head office form a union?

559
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,902
How pathetic.

560
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:02,782
No wonder the Housing Team is underperforming.

561
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,141
Do your work.

562
00:34:05,012 --> 00:34:06,081
Get back to work!

563
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:24,132
You were stalked?

564
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,632
I got a divorce because he was too obsessive,

565
00:34:27,802 --> 00:34:29,202
but he still followed me around.

566
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,041
I tried reporting him, but it was no use.

567
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:34,972
He must have waited for me in front of my place yesterday.

568
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:37,641
As soon as Mr. Shin left, he demanded to know who it was.

569
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:40,182
I told him Mr. Shin was a colleague,

570
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:42,152
and he was set on stopping me from going to work.

571
00:34:43,652 --> 00:34:46,121
He threatened to kill me if I didn't listen to him.

572
00:34:46,421 --> 00:34:49,662
The whole company thinks Mr. Shin sexually harassed you.

573
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,592
Please tell him I'm very sorry.

574
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:55,592

Mr. Hwang.

579
00:35:25,662 --> 00:35:29,762
You've heard of Mr. Shin's sexual harassment case, right?

580
00:35:29,762 --> 00:35:32,601
He knew Ms. Yu was in a bind...

581
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:34,731
and tried to abuse his power...

582
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:36,171
for his own gain.

583
00:35:36,171 --> 00:35:38,871
Ms. Yu is married, so she probably tried to stop him,

584
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:41,271
but Mr. Shin is still a man although it's hard to believe.

585
00:35:41,271 --> 00:35:43,342
He probably tried to persuade her since they dated in the past.

586
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:46,211
I'm certain that is what happened.

587
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:47,311
You know,

588
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:49,751
I thought it was cliched...

Hello, Mr. Shin.

596
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:19,481
We just finished our interview with Ms. Yu.

597
00:36:20,452 --> 00:36:23,952
She's being stalked by her ex-husband.

598
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:26,251
She had no choice because she was threatened.

599
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:29,322
She wanted to apologize to you.

600
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:32,121
It's a means to distract the auditing process.

601
00:36:33,432 --> 00:36:36,202
There's no reason for Ms. Yu to go that far.

602
00:36:36,302 --> 00:36:38,632
Anyone would do that if they intend to embezzle money.

603
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,842
It starts with abusing trust.

604
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,242

Can you find out some information on Ms. Yu's husband?

Why did you let him leave?

615

I'm coming up.

616
00:38:06,222 --> 00:38:10,021
If she lied about everything like Mr. Shin said,

617
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:13,262
that means Ms. Yu worked with her ex-husband on it.

618
00:38:13,262 --> 00:38:15,162
Then what about the union rep?

619
00:38:16,632 --> 00:38:18,362
Maybe the three are accomplices.

620
00:38:19,032 --> 00:38:20,072
What?

621
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:22,731
We don't know the whereabouts of the union rep right now.

622
00:38:22,731 --> 00:38:24,972
It's likely that they have the money.

623
00:38:25,802 --> 00:38:27,871
But the problem is,

624
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:30,342
there can't be that much trust between Ms. Yu and the union rep.

625
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,012
We should look into the relationship between her ex-husband and the rep.

626
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:36,182
I see.

627
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:40,691
If there are three accomplices,

628
00:38:41,691 --> 00:38:43,691
it will really shock me.

629
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:46,331
How can you work in this team if such a thing shocks you?

630
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,561

643
00:39:34,342 --> 00:39:36,041
of embezzlement, so we're auditing her.

How dare she!

645
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:40,751

646
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:42,012

647
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,081

723
00:44:05,182 --> 00:44:06,581
(Mount Bukhan)

724
00:44:09,652 --> 00:44:11,521
They are indeed members of our club.

725
00:44:11,722 --> 00:44:13,191
But I don't know them well.

726
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:16,251
You look very close to them to say that.

727
00:44:16,592 --> 00:44:18,191
That's because we stood side by side.

728
00:44:18,191 --> 00:44:19,191
President.

729
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:21,231
Take a look at this photo.

730
00:44:22,891 --> 00:44:24,331
In order to buy a house,

731
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:26,532
this couple put off their wedding for ten years.

732
00:44:26,632 --> 00:44:27,771
But because of the loss due to embezzlement,

733
00:44:27,771 --> 00:44:28,932
they're about to break off their engagement.

734
00:44:29,902 --> 00:44:31,842
These union members planned to build a wheelchair-accessible house...

735
00:44:31,842 --> 00:44:33,472
for a man paralysed by a spinal injury.

736
00:44:33,472 --> 00:44:35,041
But they got conned.

737
00:44:35,771 --> 00:44:39,041
This elder. With the death benefit of his son and daughter-in-law,

738
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:40,311
he's living with his grandchildren...

739
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:42,081
Enough. That's enough.

740
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:44,552
You'll be sentenced to jail for three years...

741
00:44:44,552 --> 00:44:46,722
or to pay a fine of 5,000 dollars for sheltering a criminal.

742
00:44:48,421 --> 00:44:49,691
Mr. Oh Chang Sik.

743
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:51,961
Do you know where he is?

744
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:03,202
Chang Sik used to run a big restaurant.

745
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:05,641
But it went down.

746
00:45:06,302 --> 00:45:08,612
He was going to put it behind him through hiking.

747
00:45:08,842 --> 00:45:10,282
Show them the union rep's photo...

748
00:45:10,282 --> 00:45:11,581
and check the guests.

749
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:13,351
- Mr. Gu. - He called me a few days ago,

750
00:45:13,782 --> 00:45:15,512
asking if Ms. Yu was showing up at our club.

751
00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:18,152
Why would he ask that right now?

752
00:45:18,351 --> 00:45:19,751
So I told him to turn himself in.

753
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:22,492
As his friend, I couldn't report him to the police.

754
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:23,791
No. I've never seen him.

755
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:25,822
Chang Sik is in a mountain cabin on Mount Junghak.

756
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,132
Hi, sir.

757
00:45:28,132 --> 00:45:29,461
Have you seen this man?

758
00:45:29,691 --> 00:45:32,101
Is a man looking like this staying here?

759
00:45:32,132 --> 00:45:33,501
No.

760
00:45:34,371 --> 00:45:35,871
Have you seen this man?

761
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,072
No, I haven't.

762
00:45:39,441 --> 00:45:41,742
- Are you sure? - Yes.

763
00:45:46,141 --> 00:45:48,112
I hope he's here.

764
00:45:50,052 --> 00:45:51,052
Hold on.

765
00:45:54,891 --> 00:45:58,961
(Lodging House)

766
00:46:00,532 --> 00:46:02,162
Welcome. How many people?

767
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:03,961
Just one?

768
00:46:04,101 --> 00:46:05,601
- Sit over here. - Okay.

769
00:46:07,271 --> 00:46:09,032
Welcome.

770
00:46:09,871 --> 00:46:11,202
What would you like?

771
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:14,072
I'm at a tented restaurant. The union rep is here.

772
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:16,472
Hey!

773
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:18,242
- I... - Your order.

774
00:46:19,012 --> 00:46:20,581
I'd like banquet noodles.

775
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:21,952
Why are you so slow?

776
00:46:24,222 --> 00:46:25,481
One banquet noodles.

777
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:39,972
Stop. I put in your order!

778
00:46:39,972 --> 00:46:41,001
- It's okay. - Where are you going?

779
00:46:45,572 --> 00:46:47,271
Come on! Stop right there!

780
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:50,141
Union Rep!

781
00:46:58,322 --> 00:46:59,322
Darn it.

782
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:03,662
What's with you, mister?

783
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:04,921
Mister!

784
00:47:05,391 --> 00:47:06,461
Are you all right?

785
00:47:53,842 --> 00:47:54,871
Mr. Oh Chang Sik.

786
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:56,641
Let's head down.

787
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,811
Who are you people?

788
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:00,552
We're JU Construction's Audit Team.

789
00:48:16,092 --> 00:48:17,601
(Low-interest repayment loan calls are all scams.)

790
00:48:17,601 --> 00:48:19,061
(Texts impersonating family members and asking for money are all scams.)

791
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:27,871
He's so dead now.

792
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:30,941
- It's the union rep! - Give me back my money!

793
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:33,952
Give me back my money! Give it back!

794
00:48:34,282 --> 00:48:37,152
- That scumbag! - Where's my money?

795
00:48:37,152 --> 00:48:39,052
- Give me back my money! - Good grief.

796
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:40,052
Oh, my.

797
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:44,121
Thank you for catching the union rep.

798
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:47,092
We'll be able to get our money back, right?

799
00:48:48,891 --> 00:48:49,891
What?

800
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,231
You'll get it back after we question him.

801
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:54,972
Is that so? Is she right?

802
00:48:55,771 --> 00:48:57,572
Yes, you will get it back.

803
00:48:57,972 --> 00:49:00,472
Everyone! They said we would get our money back!

804
00:49:00,472 --> 00:49:02,342
- Thank you! - That's great!

805
00:49:03,512 --> 00:49:05,182
Give them a round of applause!

806
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:07,711
Great job. We'll get our money back.

807
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,921
- Goodness. - Thank you.

809
00:49:22,691 --> 00:49:24,501
He's pleading the Fifth.

810
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:25,932
He won't talk at all.

811
00:49:26,262 --> 00:49:28,501
At this rate, finding the money will be hard.

813
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:43,552
Mr. Shin.

814
00:49:44,452 --> 00:49:46,152
Goodness.

815
00:49:46,791 --> 00:49:48,592
Did you find our money?

816
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:50,362
The investigation will take longer.

817
00:49:51,061 --> 00:49:52,322
Wait at home.

818
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:55,932
What? Could he have used all the money?

819
00:49:56,902 --> 00:49:59,961
- My goodness gracious. - Sir.

820
00:50:01,771 --> 00:50:02,802
Oh, no.

821
00:50:07,512 --> 00:50:08,612
Good grief.

822
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:12,141
That money is the death benefit from the car accident...

823
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,512
Min Seok's mom and dad were in.

824
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:18,222
I shouldn't have been greedy.

825
00:50:18,222 --> 00:50:20,291
You'll surely get the money back.

826
00:50:20,391 --> 00:50:22,891
She's right. Don't worry, sir.

827
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:26,362
Goodness.

They're...

830
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:56,592
really the worst.

831
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:58,092
If the union rep doesn't talk,

832
00:50:58,362 --> 00:51:00,162
we must stop Ms. Yu from coming to work.

833
00:51:06,001 --> 00:51:07,101
Why aren't you in bed?

834
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:08,632
Are you going somewhere?

835
00:51:08,972 --> 00:51:12,041
The puppy is alone. We must go feed it.

836
00:51:12,101 --> 00:51:14,472
You mean the puppy at the union rep's house?

837
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,882
Gosh. You're so kind, Min Hee.

838
00:51:17,211 --> 00:51:18,981
I protected it.

839
00:51:19,481 --> 00:51:22,012
A scary guy was going to take...

840
00:51:23,782 --> 00:51:25,581
Who was that scary guy?

841
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:29,691
It's okay.

842
00:51:29,822 --> 00:51:31,891
But the guy told us not to tell anyone.

843
00:51:32,921 --> 00:51:35,132
I'll protect you two, so don't worry.

844
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:37,262
I will, too. Okay?

845
00:51:38,202 --> 00:51:41,432
Did you meet a guy while feeding the puppy at that house?

846
00:51:42,871 --> 00:51:44,501
A guy not from this neighbour?

847
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:51,182
I have a photo of him.

848
00:51:54,052 --> 00:51:56,412

Do you believe that man?

883
00:53:46,205 --> 00:53:48,775
You met the union rep at an alpine club...

884
00:53:48,775 --> 00:53:51,446
and suggested you two embezzle the project funds.

885
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:54,815
The union rep agreed as he wanted to get back on his feet,

886
00:53:55,016 --> 00:53:58,286
and with your approval, he withdrew...

887
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:02,056
the 3.4 million dollars that had been collected.

888
00:54:02,415 --> 00:54:05,156
Then you two headed to a bar to celebrate.

889
00:54:05,786 --> 00:54:07,455
The union rep returned home...

890
00:54:07,996 --> 00:54:09,855
only to realize the money was gone.

891
00:54:12,725 --> 00:54:14,335
Are you sure you left it here?

892
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:16,996
Yes, I'm sure. I don't understand.

00:54:16,996 --> 00:54:18,406
You're not lying, are you?

894
00:54:18,705 --> 00:54:19,966

895
00:54:20,835 --> 00:54:22,875
What? Steal your share?

896
00:54:23,435 --> 00:54:25,975
You said the 50-dollar bills were counted and sealed.

897
00:54:26,275 --> 00:54:29,145
That the serial numbers could be traced.

898
00:54:29,275 --> 00:54:30,446
Why would I steal...

899
00:54:31,986 --> 00:54:33,986
How could I steal money like that?

900
00:54:35,915 --> 00:54:38,685
Go into hiding until I call you.

901
00:54:39,085 --> 00:54:40,125
I must hide?

902
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:41,625
We must find the cash.

903
00:54:42,156 --> 00:54:43,996
You know everything leads to you, right?

904
00:54:45,025 --> 00:54:46,426
Don't do anything stupid.

905
00:54:47,065 --> 00:54:48,196
That cash.

906
00:54:48,696 --> 00:54:50,705
Your ex-husband took it.

907
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:55,306
The union rep gave a statement when he realized that.

908
00:54:55,806 --> 00:54:57,705
Ms. Yu flies to the US tomorrow.

909
00:54:58,246 --> 00:54:59,775
Her husband will soon follow.

910
00:55:01,475 --> 00:55:03,315
If you don't say anything,

911
00:55:03,315 --> 00:55:05,986
you'll end up taking the fall, Mr. Oh.

912
00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:11,585
The husband I divorced...

913
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,656
took the money?

914
00:55:13,656 --> 00:55:15,295
The fake divorce was for show.

915
00:55:16,455 --> 00:55:17,696
You copied what happened...

916
00:55:17,696 --> 00:55:20,736
at The Myeong Construction where Kang Myung Chul works at.

917
00:55:22,636 --> 00:55:25,105
The Myeong Construction covered up their employee's corruption,

918
00:55:26,105 --> 00:55:27,806
and you thought JU Construction would do the same.

919
00:55:30,475 --> 00:55:31,806
Where did you get that idea?

920
00:55:33,076 --> 00:55:35,176
He had nothing to do with this.

921
00:55:35,176 --> 00:55:36,475
There are witnesses.

922
00:55:38,315 --> 00:55:41,486
Someone saw Kang Myung Chul take the bag of cash.

923
00:55:52,966 --> 00:55:54,435
If you say you saw me,

924
00:55:54,766 --> 00:55:56,435
I'll take that dog.

925
00:55:56,935 --> 00:55:58,065
Okay?

926
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,406
They said he wore a black cap with the letter K.

927
00:56:01,335 --> 00:56:02,576
That baseball cap.

928
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:05,375
Didn't your husband wear it often?

929
00:56:07,105 --> 00:56:08,216
Ms. Yu.

930
00:56:08,315 --> 00:56:10,846
We have a statement and witnesses.

931
00:56:11,315 --> 00:56:12,986
Give up and return the money.

932
00:56:13,016 --> 00:56:14,455
Without that money...

933
00:56:16,656 --> 00:56:18,125
The residents will really struggle.

934
00:56:22,725 --> 00:56:23,855
Please, Ms. Yu.

935
00:56:27,395 --> 00:56:30,196
Housing Team head Yu Mi Kyung colluded with the union rep...

936
00:56:30,636 --> 00:56:32,935
and embezzled funds for the public housing development.

937
00:56:33,705 --> 00:56:37,105
You fabricated a scandal to delay the audit to catch your flight...

938
00:56:37,775 --> 00:56:41,145
and tried and failed to cloud things with a fake stalker story.

939
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,016
The airport...

940
00:56:45,145 --> 00:56:46,346
I must go to the airport.

941
00:56:46,846 --> 00:56:48,056
I have a flight to catch.

942
00:56:48,056 --> 00:56:50,315
Your transfer to the Florida office will be cancelled.

943
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:56,725
You have two options.

944
00:56:57,056 --> 00:56:59,295
One, admit what you did and turn yourself in.

945
00:56:59,295 --> 00:57:02,665
Two, keep denying and increase your sentence.

946
00:57:03,736 --> 00:57:06,306
I advise you to choose option one...

947
00:57:06,705 --> 00:57:09,375
and atone for your teammates whom you say you love.

948
00:57:10,576 --> 00:57:11,705
So that...

949
00:57:12,946 --> 00:57:14,216
they suffer less.

950
00:57:22,486 --> 00:57:24,225
I'll report to the president.

951
00:57:26,286 --> 00:57:28,625
Be prepared to answer questions from the police.

952
00:57:54,216 --> 00:57:56,786
I'll report the outcome of the housing project embezzlement.

953
00:57:59,386 --> 00:58:00,486
Ms. Yu.

954
00:58:00,486 --> 00:58:03,196
Help us recover the money, and I'll petition for lenience.

955
00:58:03,196 --> 00:58:04,326
Me too.

956
00:58:05,766 --> 00:58:08,136
You can bargain for a lesser sentence if you help.

957
00:58:08,565 --> 00:58:10,136
Ms. Yu, come with me.

958
00:58:10,806 --> 00:58:12,005
What's going on?

959
00:58:12,335 --> 00:58:14,176
The interview's not over. She must stay.

960
00:58:14,176 --> 00:58:16,136
Be quiet. It's the vice president's order.

961
00:58:16,136 --> 00:58:17,875
Come on, Ms. Yu.

962
00:58:19,105 --> 00:58:20,246
Hurry up.

963
00:58:25,315 --> 00:58:28,216
Did Mr. Shin rub off on you? Why don't you know your place?

964
00:58:36,996 --> 00:58:39,266
The vice president will deal with Ms. Yu.

965
00:58:39,826 --> 00:58:42,565
From now on, you report to him instead.

966
00:58:42,565 --> 00:58:43,795
Go do your duty.

967
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:47,105
Why did you...

968
00:58:47,906 --> 00:58:49,406
make that call?

969
00:59:11,196 --> 00:59:13,866
I heard all about it from The Myeong Construction's CEO.

970
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:17,705
Did you set it up thinking we'd turn a blind eye too?

971
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:23,005
You can relax.

972
00:59:23,236 --> 00:59:25,076
Do as I say,

973
00:59:25,346 --> 00:59:27,306
and you'll get what you want.

974
00:59:30,886 --> 00:59:32,386
You beat him at golf...

975
00:59:32,616 --> 00:59:34,145
and didn't give him the clubs?

976
00:59:34,755 --> 00:59:36,616
What were you thinking?

977
00:59:36,815 --> 00:59:38,556
The undersecretary is well ticked off.

978
00:59:39,455 --> 00:59:43,125
He'll carry out a special inspection of the machines at the Inpo site.

979
00:59:43,355 --> 00:59:45,966
With extra specifications on structural safety.

980
00:59:45,966 --> 00:59:47,065
If he does that,

981
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:49,435
we must stop building altogether.

982
00:59:50,136 --> 00:59:52,766
It'll threaten your lofty position.

983
00:59:53,335 --> 00:59:55,736
I'm meeting the undersecretary for dinner tomorrow.

984
00:59:55,736 --> 00:59:57,036
Ms. Yu's case.

985
00:59:58,346 --> 00:59:59,545
See,

986
00:59:59,545 --> 01:00:02,716
one wrong move, and we might end up taking the fall.

987
01:00:04,815 --> 01:00:06,085
Do as I say.

988
01:00:13,355 --> 01:00:15,596
(JU Construction)

989
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,625
- Hey. - Sir.

990
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:20,225
I got Ms. Yu out of the Audit Team office.

991
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:21,466
Take her to the airport.

992
01:00:26,335 --> 01:00:28,676
Sir. We're sure Ms. Yu stole from the company.

993
01:00:28,676 --> 01:00:30,705
- Be quiet. - You have the wrong information.

994
01:00:30,705 --> 01:00:33,105
I said be quiet. You don't know anything.

995
01:00:35,915 --> 01:00:37,076
Ms. Yu.

996
01:00:37,176 --> 01:00:38,915
Come on. Get in.

997
01:01:02,705 --> 01:01:03,935
This is Shin Cha Il.

998
01:01:03,935 --> 01:01:06,406
Mr. Yang took Ms. Yu to the airport.

999
01:01:07,545 --> 01:01:09,176
He said it was the vice president's order.

1000
01:01:09,616 --> 01:01:10,775
Are we going to let her go?

1001
01:01:11,746 --> 01:01:13,446
Why didn't you come to report to me?

1002
01:01:15,355 --> 01:01:16,585
(Audit Team Gu Han Soo, Mute)

1003
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:18,926
Didn't you hear from the president?

1004
01:01:21,395 --> 01:01:23,196
- The embezzlement... - Forget it.

1005
01:01:23,395 --> 01:01:24,866
This is my decision.

1006
01:01:24,926 --> 01:01:27,665
Ms. Yu is transferred as planned to the Florida office.

1007
01:01:28,136 --> 01:01:29,236
End of story.

1008
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:31,766
The company can't take a hit.

1009
01:01:32,435 --> 01:01:35,205
It's wrong to ignore an embezzlement case.

1010
01:01:35,906 --> 01:01:37,946
- Please change your mind. - I don't want to.

1011
01:01:37,946 --> 01:01:41,076
I joined because I was promised full authority to investigate.

1012
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:42,616
Please consider...

1013
01:01:43,975 --> 01:01:45,145
my decision.

1014
01:01:47,045 --> 01:01:48,216
It's annoying, isn't it?

1015
01:01:48,616 --> 01:01:49,815
But what can you do?

1016
01:01:50,156 --> 01:01:53,185
The authority you hid behind to carry out your duty...

1017
01:01:53,685 --> 01:01:54,855
now depends on me.

1018
01:01:59,065 --> 01:02:00,996
I know those people struggle with their finances.

1019
01:02:01,196 --> 01:02:02,835
They were fooled by the union rep.

1020
01:02:02,866 --> 01:02:04,435
We don't need a new house now.

1021
01:02:04,435 --> 01:02:06,165
Please just get our money back.

01:02:15,716 --> 01:02:16,846
Mr. Gu.

1024
01:02:17,346 --> 01:02:18,486
Yes.

1025
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:20,085
That's it.

1026
01:02:20,085 --> 01:02:23,486
You're Audit Team Manager Shin Cha Il who fights for justice,

1027
01:02:23,815 --> 01:02:26,056
but now I'm your direct superior.

1028
01:02:26,926 --> 01:02:28,255
You know what happens...

1029
01:02:28,326 --> 01:02:29,596
if you disobey, don't you?

1030
01:02:31,496 --> 01:02:32,565
Stop Ms. Yu...

1031
01:02:33,565 --> 01:02:34,996
from going to the airport.

1032
01:02:35,665 --> 01:02:37,395
Do whatever it takes to stop her.

1035
01:02:46,406 --> 01:02:47,475
You're fired.

(The Auditors)

1037
01:02:58,855 --> 01:03:01,196
(Special thanks to Jung Dong Hwan, Hong Soo Hyun, and Lee Shin Ki)

1038
01:03:19,775 --> 01:03:21,076
The embezzlement was orchestrated by an employee,

1039
01:03:21,076 --> 01:03:23,016
but you made it look like the union rep did it alone,

1040
01:03:23,016 --> 01:03:24,545
so we'll have to audit you, Mr. Hwang.

1041
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:28,016
Mr. Shin, what do you think of the vice president?

1042
01:03:28,355 --> 01:03:30,185
Do you think JU Construction needs him?

1043
01:03:32,326 --> 01:03:36,125
Tell us where the money is before you face more embarrassment.

1044
01:03:36,596 --> 01:03:38,665
- What the... - Mr. Kang, hand over the money.

1045
01:03:38,826 --> 01:03:40,395
I'll take your resignation letter...

1046
01:03:40,395 --> 01:03:41,895
as collateral for the 3.4 million dollars.

1047
01:03:41,895 --> 01:03:42,895
Get us back the money,

1048
01:03:42,895 --> 01:03:44,165
or you'll have to cough it up somehow.

1049
01:03:44,806 --> 01:03:47,136
I'll do my best to show everyone...

1050
01:03:47,466 --> 01:03:49,275
that it's a grave sin to betray someone's trust.
