Isn't he the head of the Audit Team?

19
00:02:20,044 --> 00:02:21,184
Did someone do something wrong?

20
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:23,044
- Who? - How should I know?

21
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:25,514
He's going into Mr. Kang's office.

22
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:36,025
What are you doing?

23
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:37,965
Do you want to do the interview here?

24
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:57,615
Please explain what this is about.

25
00:02:57,684 --> 00:02:59,455
I'm very busy with budget allocations.

26
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:16,504
You made a fake company seal, didn't you?

27
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:18,374
Pardon?

28
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:30,284
Are you saying I made this?

29
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:57,175
At 2:00pm on September 17,

30
00:03:57,245 --> 00:03:58,574
Head of Finance Kang Il Kwon made a fake account...

31
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:00,174
under the company's name...

32
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:02,284
at Namyeong Bank, Myeong-dong branch.

33
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:05,853
You designated a beneficiary with the trust department...

34
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:07,014
and deposited 20,000 dollars.

35
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:08,124
About that...

36
00:04:08,485 --> 00:04:10,424
I withdrew the money but paid it back in a month.

37
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:11,795
So you admit the embezzlement.

38
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:13,354
Mr. Shin.

39
00:04:14,064 --> 00:04:16,265
I'm suffering from something called thoracic aortic aneurysm.

40
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:18,265
It's very costly to treat.

41
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:19,764
Timing was everything,

42
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:21,603
so I got the treatment first with the company's money...

43
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:23,164
in order to stay alive.

44
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:25,434
I did that to stay alive.

45
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:27,275
I beg for your leniency.

46
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,514
You have two options.

47
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:37,045
One, you resign after your surgery.

48
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:38,283
Two, file an objection against the company...

49
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:39,455
for the discharge.

50
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:40,884
If you choose option two,

51
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:42,425
you'll be transferred to the police.

52
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,194
The money was returned.

53
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:48,624
I only borrowed it briefly.

54
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,125
The company is not a bank.

55
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:51,493
Make your decision.

56
00:04:51,494 --> 00:04:52,734
Is it option one or two?

57
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:54,304
It was for one month!

58
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:56,104
The money was returned within a month!

59
00:05:02,544 --> 00:05:05,543
I worked so hard for 20 years.

60
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:06,874
It's one mere mistake.

61
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,085
How could you be so heartless?

62
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:17,724
Mr. Shin.

63
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,065
My daughter is talented in ballet.

64
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:24,533
If I resign now,

65
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,364
I'd be taking away her dream.

66
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:29,264
No company would take me in at this age.

67
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:31,205
So, please...

68
00:05:31,904 --> 00:05:34,944
Please help me. Have mercy, Mr. Shin.

69
00:05:34,945 --> 00:05:36,404
Twenty thousand dollars...

70
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:40,344
I know that was only a rehearsal.

71
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:43,784
The real deal is...

72
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:57,664
A deposit for debt settlement...

73
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,435
worth 25 million dollars.

74
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:06,803
You knew the company would go bankrupt...

75
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:09,375
if it lost the deposit for debt settlement.

76
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:13,474
Yet you forged the company seal...

77
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:16,445
and opened a bank account without digital records.

78
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,085
You even rehearsed how the transfer would go.

79
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:24,293
Our company had its full trust in you, Kang Il Kwon,

80
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:25,654
but you completely betrayed it.

81
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,395
Mr. Shin, I...

82
00:06:38,575 --> 00:06:39,705
You...

83
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,005
were going...

84
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:46,445
to take away the dreams of all the daughters...

85
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,015
of our company's employees.

86
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,494
You rat.

00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,325
- What? - What's going on?

91
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:07,125
My eyes!

92
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:12,435
- Move! - Watch out!

00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,005
- Cheers! - Cheers!

94
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:52,673
Sir. Let's drink with my arms intertwined.

95
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:53,705
Jeez, you.

96
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:56,375
Gosh, brain freeze.

97
00:08:58,715 --> 00:09:00,473
Is it because this is my last get-together?

98
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:01,844
The beer is going down easy.

99
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:04,185
- Stop it. - Putting it like that makes me sad.

100
00:09:04,455 --> 00:09:05,883
Will you never see us again?

101
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:06,955
No, I will.

102
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:08,785
You've all worked hard.

103
00:09:09,185 --> 00:09:12,955
I may be leaving, but you have to last. Got it?

104
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:15,925
I have a lot to say.

105
00:09:16,024 --> 00:09:18,864
Listen. Mr. Hwang... Mr. Hwang, my foot.

106
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:22,263
Hwang Se Woong. The minute he got promoted, he made you,

107
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:24,334
the President's immediate Audit Team Head, quit...

108
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:26,074
by treating you like the fifth wheel as you weren't his right-hand man.

109
00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:27,773
It's absurd, isn't it?

110
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:29,474
But you'll become the head once I leave.

111
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,013
Wait. That's not what I'm saying.

112
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:34,714
I'm genuinely sad, you know?

113
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:36,244
It's making me upset.

114
00:09:36,415 --> 00:09:39,014
I heard this was all due to the war of nerves between...

115
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:41,285
Mr. Hwang Se Woong and Mr. Hwang Dae Woong.

116
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,154
Even if Hwang Se Woong is the President,

117
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:45,623
the Senior Executive Vice President is still the one with power.

118
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:48,564
Choose wisely on who to serve, all right?

119
00:09:48,565 --> 00:09:50,925
Then who should I serve?

120
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:54,094
Is it Hwang Se Woong or Hwang Dae Woong?

121
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:57,133
Either way, thanks to the brothers' dispute,

122
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:59,004
our Audit Team is taking the hit.

123
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:01,973
Come on, Ms. Ok. You have me.

124
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:04,103
- I'll support you with all I have. - Great.

125
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,874
- Gosh, Mr. Moon. - Yes?

126
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:07,344
You made the right choice.

127
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:09,714
Thank you.

128
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:12,383
Then I'll serve Mr. Yeom.

129
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:14,623
See that? Nice, Han Soo.

130
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:17,123
Han Soo. How can you skip me and go straight to him?

131
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:18,824
- That's only natural. - Ms. Ok.

132
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:20,754
Mr. Yeom is your superior, isn't he?

133
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:23,825
- Work hard. - What about you, Seo Jin?

134
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:26,593
Who I serve isn't important.

135
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:28,633
It won't change our corporate life.

136
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:29,634
Come on.

137
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:30,664
- How boring. - Right.

138
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:33,334
- You're a smart girl, Seo Jin. - Thank you.

139
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:35,774
Don't devote yourself to the company.

140
00:10:35,905 --> 00:10:39,044
- Or you'll end up like me. - What are you saying to the kids?

141
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:41,544
You should devote yourself to the company.

142
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:43,743
- He's here. - What took you so long?

143
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:44,815
Hey.

144
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:46,853
I heard you had to work overtime.

145
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,853
Even so, I should still make time to treat...

146
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:51,324
my leaving friend to a consolation drink. Right?

147
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:54,295
Gosh, what consolation drink? I'm not dead.

148
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:55,724
Make it a celebratory drink.

149
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,835
- Allow me to pour you a glass. - Sure.

150
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:02,733
As for snacks, here's some fried chicken.

151
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:06,634
Really. Han Soo sure knows how to make me happy.

152
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:08,644
Remember I taught him everything?

153
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:11,914
Take care of my friend even if I'm not at the company.

154
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:13,344
Of course. Don't worry.

155
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:16,644
- Come now. Let's drink. - Okay.

156
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:18,184
Cheers.

157
00:11:18,185 --> 00:11:19,784
- Congratulations! - A celebratory drink.

158
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:23,185
- A celebratory drink! - Cheers!

159
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:30,795
I didn't drink. I had to work overtime.

160
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,065
Goodness, are you my wife or daughter?

161
00:11:34,604 --> 00:11:37,004
Okay, got it. Bye.

162
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:39,973
What brought you outside?

163
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:41,404
Was that your daughter on the phone?

164
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:44,974
Yes. She nags a lot more after getting married.

165
00:11:46,474 --> 00:11:48,285
Look. She's my daughter. A beauty, right?

166
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:51,044
She's the prettiest when she smiles.

167
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:53,754
But she doesn't look like you one bit.

168
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:56,285
That's exactly why she's pretty. She takes after my wife.

169
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,954
It's cold. Let's go inside.

170
00:11:57,955 --> 00:11:59,353
No, I have to leave.

171
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:01,155
Everything has already been paid.

172
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:02,863
But we ordered a lot.

173
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:04,633
Good grief, it's okay.

174
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:06,065
- Thank you. - No problem.

175
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:08,664
Working overtime has been hard, right?

176
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:10,664
No. It's nothing new, after all.

177
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:11,904
I'm sure it's tough.

178
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:14,974
But it's a relief the tower crane accident settled smoothly.

179
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:18,114
Yes, you're right. Oh, right. Take this.

180
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:19,843
Didn't your shoes get ruined...

181
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:21,983
because you stepped on a nail at the site last time?

182
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:23,613
Wear this from now on. Here.

183
00:12:23,614 --> 00:12:25,815
Foreman Bae!

184
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:27,754
Wait. Is this bribery?

185
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:30,424
What's this? Are you going to report me?

186
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:31,494
Thank you.

187
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:33,524
Go back inside.

188
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:35,825
- Come with me. - I'm off.

189
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:39,065
- Thank you again, Foreman Bae. - No worries.

190
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:47,973
- Here. Open the door. - We should drink more.

191
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:49,343
- Use this for the fare. - Right then.

192
00:12:49,344 --> 00:12:51,414
- Let's meet again for sure, okay? - Sure.

193
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:52,773
- I'll get in touch. - Okay.

194
00:12:52,774 --> 00:12:53,774
Bye.

195
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:56,744
- Now then, Ms. Ok. - Yes?

196
00:12:57,014 --> 00:12:58,883
- Mr. Moon. - What are you doing?

197
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:01,425
Gu Han Soo. Yoon Seo Jin.

198
00:13:01,724 --> 00:13:04,593
Let's all go to round three like a choo-choo train.

199
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:05,594
Goodness.

200
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:07,454
Excuse me first. I need to catch the last train.

201
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,123
I'm calling it a day today as well.

202
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:11,024
- I'll give you the taxi fare. - Stop it.

203
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:14,534
Keeping kids behind for more drinks is not the trend these days.

204
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:16,064
- Let's go home for the day. - Gosh.

205
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:18,273
All right. Ms. Ok and Mr. Moon.

206
00:13:18,274 --> 00:13:20,174
- Wait. - Let's go for round three. Come on.

207
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,103
- No. Mr. Yeom. - Bye.

208
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:24,244
- Bye. - Careful on your way.

209
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:29,545
Oh, this?

210
00:13:29,844 --> 00:13:31,785
It's a gift from Foreman Bae.

211
00:13:32,315 --> 00:13:35,285
My shoes got destroyed at the site last time.

212
00:13:35,585 --> 00:13:38,454
Can an Audit Team member accept a gift from another worker?

213
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:41,964
But I also gifted Foreman Bae eel extract juice.

214
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:43,464
There isn't any intention.

215
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:45,034
It's simply give and take.

216
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:48,065
Don't we work for none other than the Audit Team?

217
00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:51,633
Even so, we, the youngest co-workers,

218
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:54,174
should work hard to keep this good vibe.

219
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:55,675
Love one's country, love one's co-worker.

220
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:00,914
Sure, love your country. But why love your co-worker?

221
00:14:00,915 --> 00:14:02,744
Aren't we working to earn money?

222
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,185
I'm leaving first to catch the last train.

223
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:07,614
Seo Jin. Hold on.

224
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:09,184
Use this for your taxi fare.

225
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:10,523
We have some expenses left.

226
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:12,524
You should use this only when you work overtime.

227
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:14,494
Well...

228
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,825
A get-together is a part of work.

229
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:19,364
Get home safely.

230
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:22,665
Yes.

00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:02,444
Are you skipping work because your head left?

234
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:04,075
I'll do that.

235
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:06,574
Get ready to go to work, Mr. Gu Han Soo.

236
00:15:06,575 --> 00:15:09,085
I will once I'm done with these, Mom.

237
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:12,984
By the way, won't your motivation to work drop...

238
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:16,084
if your company doesn't fill the manager position?

239
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:18,624
A manager isn't necessary for the Audit Team to operate.

240
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:19,853
It's okay.

241
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:22,764
I can't believe my son is all grown up and working.

242
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:24,964
It only feels like yesterday that...

243
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,034
you kicked up a fuss in high school, wanting to become...

244
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:28,305
a white hacker or cracker.

245
00:15:29,004 --> 00:15:30,435
I'm proud of you, Han Soo.

246
00:15:30,705 --> 00:15:31,734
Thanks.

247
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:35,273
What?

248
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:36,274
Distract her to...

249
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:40,243
Hey, Mom. So, I wanted to become a white hacker, right?

250
00:15:40,244 --> 00:15:42,484
I was immature back then.

251
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:44,314
Since it was during puberty,

252
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:46,613
I didn't listen to you and only caused you trouble.

253
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:47,684
Mom.

254
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:48,724
Mom?

255
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:51,084
Dad.

256
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:53,024
Who are you trying to pocket for this time?

257
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,424
Yesterday's rain made all the discarded boxes damp.

258
00:15:55,425 --> 00:15:56,425
It did.

259
00:15:56,426 --> 00:15:57,893
With ten dollars, Ga Young's grandmother...

260
00:15:57,894 --> 00:15:58,934
can live peacefully...

261
00:15:58,935 --> 00:15:59,993
- for three days. - He's right.

262
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:02,435
What about me? I've been suffering for 30 years because of you.

263
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:04,233
We receive pensions, don't we?

264
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:06,003
- Kyung Ryeol has to pay us back. - He does.

265
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:08,704
- And when is he coming back? - Mom.

266
00:16:08,705 --> 00:16:10,004
You're hurting Dad.

267
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:14,884
You thief! Stop right there!

268
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:38,805
JU Construction's stock price dropped to an all-time low today.

269
00:16:39,705 --> 00:16:42,004
- Is it all right? - It should be.

270
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:46,175
Gun Woong is breathing fine.

271
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:49,114
I got worried because it dropped to 90.

272
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:53,614
I need to go to work.

273
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:57,624
Mr. Hwang Dae Woong went on a business trip, right?

274
00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:03,024
Leaving a lot of work to someone like him is wrecking the company.

275
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:05,494
Don't give him work.

276
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:09,405
We'll kick him out once Gun Woong wakes up.

President Hwang.

279
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:20,513
Since I'm a temporary worker at the moment,

280
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:22,513
they said they'd compensate me if I didn't file for occupational injury.

281
00:17:22,514 --> 00:17:24,914
But I was promised a permanent position starting in March.

282
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:26,084
He's busy now.

283
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:28,224
I was told the senior managing director had already approved it.

284
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:29,884
I'll tell him later.

285
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:31,794
- Sir. - All right. We'll be in touch.

286
00:17:31,795 --> 00:17:33,754
I heard the senior managing director had already approved it.

00:17:35,824 --> 00:17:36,965
What was that about?

289
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:40,493
Oh, he was injured in the tower crane accident.

290
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:41,905
He's not pleased with the compensation.

291
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:45,635
I heard we were taking care of his medical expenses.

292
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:47,804

Oh, right. A new revolving sushi bar opened recently.

And the soup couldn't look more unappetizing.

334
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:34,044
We have to pay seven dollars for this?

339
00:19:45,455 --> 00:19:47,925
The cyber Audit Team reported them. How come there's no improvement?

340
00:19:48,465 --> 00:19:51,365
Mr. Gu, shouldn't the Audit Team get involved?

341
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:53,195
Well, we can't.

342
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:55,965
The ladies here worked hard to make all the food.

343
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:57,803
Let's try to understand and...

344
00:19:57,804 --> 00:19:59,605
The Audit Team should be blamed for a dereliction of duty.

345
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,543
I don't see a single ingredient list or a sign...

346
00:20:05,544 --> 00:20:06,773
saying where the ingredients are from.

347
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:08,415
The food tastes awful, and the portions are miserly.

348
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:09,885
I bet someone's embezzling funds.

349
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:13,514
And who are you?

350
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:15,084
I'm here for a job interview.

351
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:16,954
Cafeteria food reveals a lot about the company,

352
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:18,494
so I'm here to check it out.

353
00:20:18,955 --> 00:20:21,965
And I think JU Construction is doomed to failure...

00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:23,564

356
00:20:24,994 --> 00:20:28,404
Hey, man. If you're here for an interview, just do that and leave.

357
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:29,534
Why are you causing a scene here?

358
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:31,533
If you know who I am, you can't call me incompetent.

359
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:33,705
I'll soon be promoted to manager of the company's Audit Team.

360
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:37,145
This is my first time hearing someone call me incompetent.

361
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:39,875
Then it means everyone around you is also incompetent.

362
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,915
Are you really here for an interview?

363
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:44,114
We never heard someone was coming in for an interview.

364
00:20:44,115 --> 00:20:46,483
They didn't bother to tell you because they don't trust your team.

365
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:47,514
Excuse me?

366
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:49,783
Just ignore him, Ms. Ok. He's doing that on purpose.

367
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:51,425
He's provoking us to get information from us.

368
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,323
Look, there's something you need to know.

369
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:56,223
JU Construction never hires anyone...

370
00:20:56,224 --> 00:20:59,534
who speaks so rudely and is simply not a good person.

371
00:20:59,564 --> 00:21:01,905
When you're told to fix things, just figure out a way to do it.

372
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:04,465
What's the point of criticizing my character?

373
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,334
Clearly, you don't understand a thing about auditing.

374
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:10,744
How did you know we were from the Audit Team?

375
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:17,145
Hey, I'm not done talking. Wait!

376
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:19,855
You won't get the job, although I don't know which team it's for.

377
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:21,554
It's for the manager position of the Audit Team.

378
00:21:24,155 --> 00:21:26,794
- Manager of what? - Of the Audit Team.

379
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:28,465
That's complete nonsense.

380
00:21:31,195 --> 00:21:32,365
Gosh.

381
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:36,304
An external candidate after leaving the position vacant for a month?

382
00:21:37,205 --> 00:21:39,175
Darn it. It's embarrassing.

383
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:42,675
I know. President Hwang must have another plan.

384
00:21:43,744 --> 00:21:44,804
Hey, you.

385
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,345
Oh, hello.

386
00:21:47,274 --> 00:21:48,685
Am I invisible to you?

387
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,484
I had to check this report.

388
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:53,115
How dare you!

389
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:57,155
(JU Construction)

390
00:21:57,355 --> 00:21:58,655
So you see that piece of paper,

391
00:21:59,524 --> 00:22:01,054
but I'm invisible to you?

392
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,195
No, sir.

393
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,165
Tell my secretary your name and which department you're in.

394
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:07,064
I'm sorry, sir.

395
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:11,405
I'm sorry too.

396
00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:14,875
In the old days, I'd have kicked the likes of you in the shins.

397
00:22:15,744 --> 00:22:17,705
But I can't do that now as it'd affect my performance review.

398
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:20,044
Darn it.

399
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:25,284
Gosh.

400
00:22:25,915 --> 00:22:28,823
From my attitude to my performance and capabilities,

401
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:30,885
I'm perfect for the role. Why would they interview someone else?

402
00:22:31,024 --> 00:22:32,194
I mean, why?

403
00:22:32,195 --> 00:22:35,594
You guys, tell me. You never once doubted I'd be promoted to manager.

404
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:37,264
- Right? - It's so odd.

405
00:22:37,465 --> 00:22:38,894
I haven't heard a single rumour...

406
00:22:38,895 --> 00:22:40,594
that they were looking to hire externally for the role.

407
00:22:40,595 --> 00:22:41,965
Then it can't be true.

408
00:22:42,004 --> 00:22:44,705
It's impossible that your radar hasn't caught such big news yet.

409
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:46,934
I'm making a logical assumption...

410
00:22:46,935 --> 00:22:48,434
that he was mistaken.

411
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,675
- That's right. - Hold on.

412
00:22:50,004 --> 00:22:52,014
The interview is happening now, in the small conference room.

413
00:22:52,215 --> 00:22:53,415
For the Audit Team manager role.

414
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:55,743
So, your radar has finally caught this.

415
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,744
But why?

416
00:22:57,715 --> 00:23:00,784
It's possible they're interviewing him just for formality's sake.

417
00:23:00,984 --> 00:23:02,054
What do you mean?

418
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:05,723
He already knew we were from the Audit Team.

419
00:23:05,724 --> 00:23:08,764
That's probably because he heard Mr. Kim talk about the Audit Team.

420
00:23:08,895 --> 00:23:10,194
But he seemed confident.

421
00:23:10,195 --> 00:23:12,165
You do need some confidence to talk so rudely.

422
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:14,695
Rude? Not really. He was talking about work...

423
00:23:15,135 --> 00:23:16,165
when he mentioned dereliction of duty and fixing things.

424
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,574
Han Soo. Never mind.

425
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:22,304
- Actually, go there now. - Me?

426
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:24,973
Go and find out what's going on.

427
00:23:24,974 --> 00:23:26,375
- Hurry. Move. - Okay.

428
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:28,375
My goodness.

429
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:32,715
Why did you apply for this position?

430
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:34,885
I applied because I wanted to catch rats.

431
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:38,124
Pardon me? In this day and age, you can't find a single rat...

432
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,694
in buildings like this.

433
00:23:39,695 --> 00:23:41,624
And even if we had rats here,

434
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,894
we'd just hire a pest control company.

435
00:23:43,895 --> 00:23:45,465
Why should we interview...

436
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:46,865
What are you talking about?

437
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:49,264
There are many rats in JU Construction.

438
00:23:49,665 --> 00:23:52,175
If you let your guard down, they'll gnaw away at the company.

439
00:23:52,304 --> 00:23:55,345
Don't use metaphors, please. Just be direct.

440
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:58,644
In 2019,

441
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,773
they manipulated the system to embezzle 700,000 dollars.

442
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:01,914
In 2020,

443
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:03,784
another 900,000 dollars was embezzled with a fake company seal.

444
00:24:04,215 --> 00:24:05,354
In 2021,

445
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:07,314
a company executive embezzled 1.3 million dollars.

446
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:09,324
The rats are gnawing away at the company.

447
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:12,595
And you can stop it?

448
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:14,125
How?

449
00:24:14,324 --> 00:24:16,063
Weekly financial audits...

450
00:24:16,064 --> 00:24:17,993
can prevent system manipulation.

451
00:24:17,994 --> 00:24:19,233
A fake seal...

452
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:21,665
can be caught right away with in-depth account inspections.

453
00:24:22,105 --> 00:24:23,205
Company executives' embezzlement...

454
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:25,705
can be deterred with special audits.

455
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:28,803
You can't get anything done with such basic solutions.

456
00:24:28,804 --> 00:24:31,244
JU Construction is ignoring the basics at the moment.

457
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:32,875
My goodness.

458
00:24:34,244 --> 00:24:35,244
(Resume)

459
00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:37,514
You tend to switch jobs often. Is there a reason?

460
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:41,814
Once I'm done catching all the rats, I get a new job.

461
00:24:42,224 --> 00:24:43,524
At a place like JU Construction.

462
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:45,824
A place infested with rats.

463
00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:47,125
How dare you!

464
00:24:47,824 --> 00:24:50,064
Sir, do we have to keep listening to this baloney?

465
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:52,894
JU Construction was a pioneer in the construction industry...

466
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:55,564
and was the 12th largest company in the country.

467
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:57,264
If you want to restore the company's reputation,

468
00:24:57,834 --> 00:25:00,034
and if you don't want the employees to become jobless,

469
00:25:00,504 --> 00:25:02,304
you must declare emergency and conduct special audits.

470
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:07,974
Before it's too late, that is.

471
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,115
Hello.

472
00:25:15,885 --> 00:25:16,984
I heard...

473
00:25:17,324 --> 00:25:19,553
they were conducting an interview for the Audit Team's manager role.

474
00:25:19,554 --> 00:25:20,624
Is it true?

475
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,023
Yes, they're conducting the interview now.

476
00:25:22,024 --> 00:25:24,624
You're not here for a job interview. You're here to lecture us!

477
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:25,665
Get out!

478
00:25:26,435 --> 00:25:29,105
(JU Construction)

479
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:46,513
Hey, how did it go?

480
00:25:46,514 --> 00:25:47,514
What's going on?

481
00:25:47,784 --> 00:25:48,983
Hurry up and tell us!

482
00:25:48,984 --> 00:25:50,024
That guy...

483
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:52,994
They kicked him out.

484
00:25:53,824 --> 00:25:56,224
- I knew it! - We'll never see him again.

485
00:25:56,465 --> 00:25:58,095
See? I told you.

486
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:59,533
I told you.

487
00:25:59,534 --> 00:26:01,865
They'll make me manager. I'll be promoted to manager.

488
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,249
Hey, get back to work.

489
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:09,021
I hope you all have a great day.

490
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:10,920
Here's a word of encouragement for the day.

491
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:13,761
"Only I can make my life shine."

492
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,390
You're the only one who can make your life shine.

493
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:21,831
- Only I can make my life shine. - "Only I can make my life shine."

494
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:26,301
Only I can make my life shine.

495
00:26:36,811 --> 00:26:37,880
Thank you.

496
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:45,591
- Hello. - Hello.

497
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,720
Hello.

498
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:48,360
Hello.

499
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:50,630
Hello.

500
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:52,531
- Hello. - Hello.

501
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:57,571
- Hello. - Hello.

502
00:26:57,601 --> 00:26:58,940
Hello.

503
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,351
Excuse me.

504
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,190
You can't be here without permission.

505
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,460
The only people who know the passcode are...

506
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,889
If I know the passcode to the office and am sitting at the head's desk,

507
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,061
who could I be?

508
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,459
Mr. Gu Han Soo.

509
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,700
You must be the head of our team then.

510
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,570
But how did you know my name?

511
00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:34,070
In July of 2022, you barely managed...

512
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:35,510
to meet the requirements to secure a position at JU Construction.

513
00:27:35,511 --> 00:27:36,511
You were assigned here...

514
00:27:36,512 --> 00:27:37,670
through your connection with the team's former head.

515
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,310
Working in the Audit Team for three years...

516
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:40,540
will give you a chance to transfer to a branch in Florida.

517
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:41,880
So you've been here for six months.

518
00:27:42,551 --> 00:27:44,680
Did you do a background check on me?

519
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,150
I can finally leave in two years and a half.

520
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,261
The head of the Audit Team helped me get assigned here.

521
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,720
I won't forget your help.

522
00:27:57,491 --> 00:27:58,731
- Right? - Yes.

523
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,870
Good morning.

524
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:12,041
I'm glad everyone's here.

525
00:28:13,811 --> 00:28:16,811
He will work in the Audit Team with you starting today.

526
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,750
- He's Shin... Yes. - It's Shin Cha Il.

527
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:20,420
Mr. Shin Cha Il will be the head of your team.

528
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:22,820
He's the veteran of the team. Assistant Manager Yeom Kyung Seok.

529
00:28:22,821 --> 00:28:24,689
This is Junior Manager Ok A Jung.

530
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,389
I know of them. That's Supervisor Moon Sang Ho.

531
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,591
Ms. Yoon Seo Jin.

532
00:28:29,261 --> 00:28:31,929
All right. You can take your time to learn the ropes...

533
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,061
Let's have a meeting.

534
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,939
He reports to me. Why did he cut me off?

535
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,341
I really don't understand him. Seriously.

536
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:45,341
Bye, sir.

537
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:54,149
We had already met in the cafeteria.

538
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,920
Let me go straight to the audit schedule.

539
00:28:56,351 --> 00:28:59,290
On January 16, a tower crane toppled over at the construction site...

540
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:01,160
for Inpo Apartment. We'll audit the incident.

541
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,791
Why would we do that?

542
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,199
Right. The injured workers were treated.

543
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,830
We filed an insurance claim for the tower crane as well.

544
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,301
We've already handled the incident.

545
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,330
I guess you haven't been fully informed.

546
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:12,800
The construction has already resumed.

547
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:14,399
Auditing the incident now will be wasting our resources.

548
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,109
- Do you know why it toppled over? - Why it toppled over?

549
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,109
The news said that it was too windy, so it toppled over.

550
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,350
On January 16, there was a high wind warning.

551
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:23,480
But the wind speed around the time of the incident was...

552
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:25,010
below 10m per second.

553
00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:27,551
A tower crane wouldn't topple over by wind of that velocity.

554
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,120
Then why did the news announce that?

555
00:29:31,821 --> 00:29:33,660
Are you asking me that?

556
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,890
How complacent, incompetent,

557
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:39,831
and lazy...

558
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,731
you all are.

559
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:47,740
They covered up the cause of the incident...

560
00:29:47,741 --> 00:29:49,210
because there was an act of corruption.

561
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,240
Corruption always leaves behind telltale signs.

562
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:53,841
I will identify these signs and eliminate corruption.

563
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,450
Where do we start?

564
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,581
Let's start by interviewing the foreman.

565
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,980
But he's done nothing wrong. Why would we interview him?

566
00:30:01,981 --> 00:30:03,851
Where's your proof that he's innocent?

567
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,159
He's not the type to hide things from us or commit crimes.

568
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,459
I asked for proof.

569
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,531
My proof is...

570
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,629
that I trust him.

571
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,800
But I don't.

572
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:16,899
- But... - Based on your competence,

573
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,400
I will restructure the team.

574
00:30:18,571 --> 00:30:21,170
Gather all available information on this incident.

575
00:30:22,311 --> 00:30:24,240
What time frame should we set for our research?

576
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:25,609
From the first day of the construction...

577
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,980
to the day of the incident.

578
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:28,341
Mr. Gu. Come with me.

579
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,011
Me?

580
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,291
- Ms. Yoon. - Come on.

581
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,190
I didn't know you were the proactive type.

582
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:49,331
Well,

583
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,341
I sort of missed my chance earlier.

584
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,301
The foreman, Bae Young Sik,

585
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:57,910
has been working for the company over 20 years.

586
00:30:58,241 --> 00:30:59,780
The company had to welcome a new owner,

587
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:02,210
but it kept the same foreman because Mr. Bae is good at his job.

588
00:31:02,511 --> 00:31:04,251
- He's diligent. - Mr. Gu.

589
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:07,920
- Yes. - You're not cut out for this job.

590
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:09,920
Transfer to a different team.

591
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,561
- Pardon? - I'll give you a week.

592
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,091
Leave the team.

593
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:26,271
(Building Site for Apartment)

594
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,741
What? What did I do wrong?

595
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:35,210
Please tell me.

596
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:36,650
You must explain why. So I can...

598
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:47,190
(Safety together is a promise for future.)

599
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,690
Where's the foreman's desk?

600
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,761
- Hello. - Hello.

601
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,071
Who's asking? You showed up without an appointment.

602
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,101
He's the new head of our team.

603
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,700
Hello.

604
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:01,601
That's his desk.

605
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:05,011
What? What's going on?

606
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,180
Doesn't he have a desktop computer?

607
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:15,751
He uses a laptop.

608
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,591
What? Gosh.

609
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,120
What are you doing?

610
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:24,231
You can't search his desk when he's not present.

611
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,041
(Section 2, Inpo, JU Construction)

612
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,640
- What's going on? - Sir.

613
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:39,080
Who do you think you are? How dare you go through my desk?

614
00:32:39,081 --> 00:32:40,179
Sign an agreement that you gave me permission.

615
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,280
Let's do an interview.

616
00:32:41,281 --> 00:32:43,609
I have so much to do with the wall construction and all.

617
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,481
What are you yapping about?

618
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:52,150
Sir!

619
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:54,521
What's this fuss all of a sudden?

620
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,860
Get his laptop.

621
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,390
Sir!

622
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,930
Sir!

623
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,470
Sir!

624
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,670
Sir, where are you going?

625
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,771
Sir!

626
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:17,051
Sir! Hold on.

627
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,351
Hold on a second.

628
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,920
Get out of my way!

629
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:21,920
- Move. - Sir!

630
00:33:22,491 --> 00:33:23,619
Sir!

631
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,791
Please stop running!

632
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,491
Sir.

633
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,061
- Darn it. - Let's talk. Please?

634
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,531
Sir!

635
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,901
- Darn it. - Sir.

636
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,310
Why are you running away?

637
00:33:45,311 --> 00:33:46,441
Han Soo.

638
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,410
- How could you do this to me? - What?

639
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:52,081
Did you bring your new boss here, so he could audit me?

640
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,920
Gosh, that's not it.

641
00:33:53,921 --> 00:33:54,921
You!

642
00:33:54,922 --> 00:33:56,021
Don't come near me.

643
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,290
Sir, it's me.

644
00:33:58,291 --> 00:33:59,620
Don't get close.

645
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,921
Mr. Bae Young Sik.

646
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,300
Why did you conceal the reason that caused the crane to topple over?

647
00:34:15,941 --> 00:34:17,540
Why are you asking me that?

648
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:19,110
Because the construction site is your responsibility.

649
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:20,180
That's why I'm asking.

650
00:34:20,381 --> 00:34:22,509
I just did what I was told.

651
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,780
Who told you to do that?

652
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,151
The president of the company never approved of it.

653
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,760
Give me the laptop.

654
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,560
It's mine. Why would I give it to you?

655
00:34:37,561 --> 00:34:38,759
It's not yours.

656
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,001
It belongs to the company.

657
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:42,101
Let me.

658
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,631
Let me talk to him.

659
00:34:43,671 --> 00:34:45,171
He must have misunderstood...

660
00:34:49,271 --> 00:34:50,410
the situation.

661
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:54,611
Han Soo!

662
00:34:54,612 --> 00:34:56,509
Seriously. Why is he doing this to me?

663
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,881
Mr. Shin. Hear me out. Please?

664
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,820
Mr. Bae!

665
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,659
- Call 911! - Come here!

666
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,731
- Call 911! A person fell! - My phone... Hold on.

667
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:13,001
Isn't this our foreman?

668
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,731
- Sir! - Mr. Bae!

669
00:35:15,061 --> 00:35:16,771
- It's him! - Call 911!

(Emergency Room)

671
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,381
Even the police need a warrant to search his desk.

672
00:35:31,351 --> 00:35:32,921
How could you cause him to get hurt like this?

673
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,021
Are you okay?

674
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,989
We'll use digital forensics to retrieve the data.

675
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,691
We will audit the financial status of the construction.

676
00:35:45,861 --> 00:35:48,231
We will fully reinvestigate the tower crane incident.

677
00:35:48,861 --> 00:35:50,430
Mr. Bae's condition must stabilize first.

678
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:53,140
What's the cause of the tower crane incident?

679
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:54,900
Tell me the truth now.

680
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:56,170
If you do, I'll take it into account for your disciplinary action.

681
00:35:56,171 --> 00:35:57,410
Please stop it!

682
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,140
Must you ask him these questions now of all times?

683
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,480
I'll take you to the room...

684
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:06,751
where the other construction workers are.

685
00:36:06,921 --> 00:36:08,751
- Han Soo. - Yes.

686
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,820
I much prefer to have a private room.

687
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,049
Get me a private room.

688
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:15,021
Is there a reason you can't share a room with the other workers?

689
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:24,501
Answer me.

690
00:36:24,502 --> 00:36:26,339
Han Soo, this guy's going to kill me.

691
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,440
- Please take me to my room. - Could you help me?

692
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:29,441
Sure.

693
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:35,839
(Emergency Room)

694
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,550
The foreman is here?

695
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:39,080
Did he get injured?

696
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:40,351
It's nothing serious.

697
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,190
If he's the foreman, why is he avoiding his employees?

698
00:36:43,191 --> 00:36:45,520
Because he feels bad.

699
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:48,120
He promised to get us full-time jobs at JU Construction,

700
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:49,529
but he couldn't keep his promise.

701
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,461
Did he demand money or valuables in exchange for the said position?

702
00:36:55,231 --> 00:36:58,600
He's the type to give pocket money for our ride home after a team meal.

703
00:36:58,601 --> 00:36:59,900
He'd never demand anything.

704
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:01,170
He's the one...

705
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:03,670
who saved Mr. Choi who handles the tower crane.

706
00:37:03,671 --> 00:37:05,211
Where is the tower crane operator?

707
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,239
He was in a single room but was discharged.

708
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,440
Already?

709
00:37:08,441 --> 00:37:10,680
Since our foreman handled the situation well,

710
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,509
Mr. Choi only broke a leg.

711
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,751
You must be mistaken.

712
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,819
Our foreman is the one who asked...

713
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,720
the senior managing director to give us full-time jobs.

714
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:21,320
It didn't turn out the way we hoped,

715
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,831
but our foreman is a great man.

716
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:27,901
Han Soo.

717
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,601
I'm sorry about earlier.

718
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,271
I get scared whenever I hear it's the Audit Team.

719
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,010
What happened to my laptop?

720
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,640
It was completely broken, but Mr. Shin took it.

721
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,811
What happened?

722
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:43,651
You can tell me.

723
00:37:46,251 --> 00:37:49,520
Was there a different reason why the tower crane fell?

724
00:37:49,521 --> 00:37:51,950
No, that's not it.

725
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,520
If the cause is a natural disaster,

726
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:58,530
I hear we could be more speedy to resume the construction.

727
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,799
This was decided by the higher-ups.

728
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,631
I'd never decide on such a thing alone.

729
00:38:04,101 --> 00:38:05,131
This hurts.

730
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:06,699
- Han Soo. - Yes?

731
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,100
Please tell them I won't see any visitors at all.

732
00:38:09,101 --> 00:38:10,271
All right.

733
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,311
Gosh.

734
00:38:19,351 --> 00:38:20,450
Why did you do that?

735
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,180
Someone was hurt.

736
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,589
People come first before auditing.

737
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,889
The auditor was too complacent to begin with.

738
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:27,921
The tower crane...

739
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,860
He did that so they could resume the construction faster.

740
00:38:30,861 --> 00:38:32,190
He was given the order.

741
00:38:32,191 --> 00:38:34,430
- I'll interview him. - Let him rest.

742
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:39,970
Is this a request from him?

743
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,401
Pardon?

744
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,441
What are you talking about?

745
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:47,140
(Senior Managing Director Seo Gil Pyo)

746
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,751
Shin Cha Il speaking.

747
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,921
Yes. Understood.

748
00:39:10,771 --> 00:39:12,101
Your coffee is here.

749
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,771
Iced Americano hits the spot when it's tough.

750
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,140
You agree our work life is messed up, don't you?

751
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,410
- Of course. - Thank you.

752
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:22,540
Have a coffee.

753
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:26,251
How could he bring someone external as our department head?

754
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:35,960
Did something happen?

755
00:39:35,961 --> 00:39:37,390
Why the long face?

756
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,370
Who are you to dig into what we already resolved?

757
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:52,171
I'm auditing as there's corruption.

758
00:39:53,611 --> 00:39:54,640
"Corruption?"

759
00:39:55,211 --> 00:39:56,211
Inpo Apartment is under the jurisdiction...

760
00:39:56,212 --> 00:39:57,410
of the vice president.

761
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,521
It was his decision to call it a natural disaster!

762
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,120
It's not something you should mess around with.

763
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,521
When I meet the vice president,

764
00:40:05,691 --> 00:40:07,020
I'll let him know he made the wrong decision.

765
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:08,521
Gosh.

766
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:11,260
Enough of making a ruckus. Stop all you're doing...

767
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,901
and bring me Foreman Bae's laptop.

768
00:40:17,671 --> 00:40:18,671
How did you know...

769
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:21,601
I had his laptop?

770
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:24,870
- Did Foreman Bae tell you? - What if he did?

771
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,139
That proves there's a connection between you and Foreman Bae.

772
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,851
What? How dare you?

773
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:31,981
Gosh.

774
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:34,581
Do you know who I am?

775
00:40:35,521 --> 00:40:36,949
I gave my heart and soul to JU Construction...

776
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,920
since CEO Hwang's time.

777
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:41,021
Did you promise Foreman Bae...

778
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,260
that you'd hire his men full-time?

779
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:46,631
Was there a reward for it?

780
00:40:47,601 --> 00:40:49,870
My goodness, you drive me crazy.

781
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:52,231
Do you take me for a joke?

782
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,001
Just bring me the laptop!

783
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:58,240
Okay. I'll bring it to you.

784
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,739
We'll run it through forensics...

785
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,510
and study its contents closely before bringing it to you.

786
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,521
That punk.

787
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,159
Foreman Bae's 7th and 8th ribs...

788
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,800
as well as his shin were fractured.

789
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:22,360
He was mercilessly violent.

790
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:23,700
Do you know what he said to me?

791
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,270
He suggested that I switch departments.

792
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:26,739
He said being an auditor didn't suit me.

793
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,970
Isn't it ridiculous?

794
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,271
It's worse than I imagined.

795
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,610
What a headache.

796
00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:33,380
Where are my headache pills?

797
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:36,409
Nothing will stop him.

798
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,751
We should look into the reason why Foreman Bae ran away.

799
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,850
He got scared when the Audit Team suddenly dropped by.

800
00:41:42,851 --> 00:41:43,949
Of course.

801
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,890
When we dig, we're bound to find a bit of dirt.

802
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:49,290
He fell from the third floor because of Mr. Shin.

803
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:50,791
It might not sound very high, but...

804
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:55,460
I need all approval requests, proposals, and payment approvals...

805
00:41:55,461 --> 00:41:56,530
that were sent to Mr. Seo Gil Pyo.

806
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:00,271
Why the senior managing director?

807
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:15,650
He doesn't know a thing about auditing.

808
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:16,750
Why is he here?

809
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:17,920
What are your thoughts?

810
00:42:17,921 --> 00:42:19,920
- Am I right? - I never had such a tough day.

811
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:22,060
Today was the toughest day since I started my job.

812
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:24,290
Look. My eyeballs are about to fall out.

813
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,760
- My goodness. - Let me see.

814
00:42:26,131 --> 00:42:27,630
- They were always like that. - Gosh.

815
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:29,699
Well? How about a cold beer?

816
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,831
That sounds good. Are you in?

817
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,299
Did you hear what I said?

818
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,400
- Mr. Shin is a problem. - Good work today.

819
00:42:33,401 --> 00:42:34,940
- Listen to me. - Take care.

820
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:36,771
Gosh. They won't listen.

821
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:40,679
Don't worry.

822
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,610
I'll take care of it. I got this.

823
00:42:42,611 --> 00:42:43,780
- I'm leaving. - Bye.

824
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,081
- How do you get home? - By bus.

825
00:42:47,521 --> 00:42:48,521
Let's go together.

826
00:42:49,921 --> 00:42:52,651
Isn't it ridiculous?

827
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,120
How could they hire someone like him as the head of the Audit Team?

828
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,691
He's like a thug.

829
00:42:58,731 --> 00:43:01,501
The issue started when Foreman Bae ran away.

830
00:43:01,961 --> 00:43:03,331
I told you.

831
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:05,029
He was scared because...

832
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,970
Why is he scared if there's nothing to be scared of?

833
00:43:08,441 --> 00:43:10,711
Are you suspicious of Foreman Bae?

834
00:43:12,271 --> 00:43:13,581
What about you?

835
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,010
Do you trust him?

836
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,180
- Of course. - On what grounds?

837
00:43:19,251 --> 00:43:20,881
I think Mr. Shin is right.

838
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:23,421
You're not suited to be an auditor.

839
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,961
What? He wants to check Mr. Seo's work records?

840
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,940
He's asking for enemies.

841
00:43:39,941 --> 00:43:41,671
Does he want to die?

842
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,811
He's asking for it.

843
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,210
By the way, why did the president bring in external personnel?

844
00:43:48,211 --> 00:43:49,240
Why else?

845
00:43:49,381 --> 00:43:51,710
Everyone in the company is on the vice president's side.

846
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:53,420
So he brought a lunatic...

847
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:55,119
like Shin Cha Il from outside...

848
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,220
so he could get a grasp on the Audit Team.

849
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,120
What is the atmosphere like at the office these days?

850
00:44:00,421 --> 00:44:01,461
Isn't it a mess?

851
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,330
We have to kick Shin Cha Il out.

852
00:44:04,331 --> 00:44:07,759
That will naturally give you a chance.

853
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,770
Mr. Yang, don't you know who I am?

854
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:12,270
I worked in the Audit Team for four years.

855
00:44:12,271 --> 00:44:15,171
I could easily kick someone out once they become my target.

856
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:16,839
Let's cut to the chase.

857
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,639
We need to make a direct connection.

858
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,839
Shin Cha Il has Foreman Bae's laptop.

859
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,509
Go and collect it right away.

860
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:25,351
The laptop? I'll get it for you right away.

861
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,050
What a sweet talker.

862
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,751
Please trust me.

863
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,120
Let's see.

864
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,060
I'm back.

865
00:44:37,061 --> 00:44:39,560
Han Soo, come drink with Kyung Ryeol.

866
00:44:39,561 --> 00:44:43,000
Hey, Han Soo! Long time no see.

867
00:44:43,001 --> 00:44:44,200
Hello.

868
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,500
Ms. An! What's taking the food so long?

869
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:50,510
I'm delivering it, Mr. Gu.

870
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:52,540
Now that we're together,

871
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:54,680
it reminds me of the time we worked together.

872
00:44:54,881 --> 00:44:58,550
When Gu Seok Gu started to date his older superior at the office.

873
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,520
By the way, didn't you go to Vietnam?

874
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:04,819
That was what your mom thought.

875
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,820
He was searching for investors.

876
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:09,260
Luckily, it was sorted out. The factory's back in order now.

877
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:11,929
You didn't know anything,

878
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:14,760
- and you wanted to kill him... - Have some food.

879
00:45:15,131 --> 00:45:16,600
It's true. I deserved to die.

880
00:45:16,601 --> 00:45:18,331
I disappeared for two years.

881
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,839
If it wasn't for your 30,000 dollars,

882
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,800
I couldn't have met my investors.

883
00:45:23,271 --> 00:45:24,340
Thank you so much.

884
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:26,611
Thank you, Ms. An.

885
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:28,339
Just run your business well.

886
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,251
I really thought you wouldn't return.

887
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,510
You should trust people more.

888
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:34,521
Dad.

889
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:37,690
Did you know he would return?

890
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:40,220
Of course. Because I trust Kyung Ryeol.

891
00:45:40,461 --> 00:45:41,489
On what grounds?

892
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,861
I'm the one who decides how much I trust someone.

893
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:46,231
So on my grounds.

894
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:49,100
- Gosh. - That's so cool.

895
00:45:49,101 --> 00:45:50,671
It was what my boss said.

899

Do you know why it toppled over?

906
00:46:49,021 --> 00:46:51,089
The news said that it was too windy, so it toppled over.

907
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,230
But the wind speed around the time of the incident was...

908
00:46:52,231 --> 00:46:53,760
below 10m per second.

909
00:46:53,831 --> 00:46:56,030
Why did you conceal the reason that caused the crane to topple over?

910
00:46:56,131 --> 00:46:58,469
I just did what I was told.

911

01:02:14,488 --> 01:02:15,488
because you knew disciplinary action was unavoidable,

1078
01:02:15,489 --> 01:02:16,548
it was a bad move.

1079
01:02:17,088 --> 01:02:18,718
Because there is such a thing as additional penalties.

1080
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:20,987
Hey, Mr. Shin.

1081
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:22,127
- You... - Leave it.

1082
01:02:22,287 --> 01:02:23,827
Let's see how far you go.

1083
01:02:25,198 --> 01:02:27,896
You were the final decision maker on the tower crane purchase.

1084
01:02:27,897 --> 01:02:29,927
You used that power to purchase a tower crane...

1085
01:02:29,928 --> 01:02:32,068
without knowing when it was made at a normal price.

1086
01:02:32,138 --> 01:02:33,298
You took the difference in price...

1087
01:02:33,638 --> 01:02:35,568
through Myung Tower.

1088
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:38,838
That feeble tower crane eventually fell and hurt people.

1089
01:02:39,437 --> 01:02:40,807
To cover up for your corruption,

1090
01:02:41,977 --> 01:02:43,307
you said the cause of the fall...

1091
01:02:44,108 --> 01:02:45,247
was the wind?

1092
01:02:45,847 --> 01:02:46,948
Gosh.

1093
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,318
You're a funny person.

1094
01:02:51,457 --> 01:02:52,657
Can you prove it?

1095
01:02:52,658 --> 01:02:53,818
Give me the laptop.

1096
01:02:55,528 --> 01:02:57,227
How dare you talk about something...

1097
01:02:57,928 --> 01:02:59,497
you can't even prove in front of me?

1098
01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:02,528
I'm going to fire you from the board for defamation.

1099
01:03:02,727 --> 01:03:05,167
You will be remembered as the Audit Team manager...

1100
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:08,368
who I fired after the shortest amount of time.

1101
01:03:08,437 --> 01:03:09,667
Someone is hiding...

1102
01:03:10,008 --> 01:03:12,778
the injury of the tower crane driver.

1103
01:03:14,577 --> 01:03:16,548
I think it's Mr. Bae.

1104
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,948
What do you think?

1105
01:03:35,698 --> 01:03:37,028
Mr. Hwang is here.

1106
01:03:37,667 --> 01:03:39,037
You're done for.

1107
01:03:40,568 --> 01:03:41,667
Be careful.

1108
01:04:07,028 --> 01:04:09,568
Look who's here.

1109
01:04:12,397 --> 01:04:13,468
Gosh.

1110
01:04:15,368 --> 01:04:17,307
- Have you been well? - Yes, sir.

1111
01:04:18,477 --> 01:04:19,908
- This is Mr. Yang. - Hi.

1112
01:04:24,517 --> 01:04:25,548
Mr. Shin.

1113
01:04:25,618 --> 01:04:26,618
Aren't you going to greet him?

1114
01:04:26,678 --> 01:04:28,517
What are you doing? Say hello to Mr. Hwang.

1115
01:04:29,347 --> 01:04:30,387
Who is this?

1116
01:04:30,388 --> 01:04:32,787
He's the new Audit Team manager.

1117
01:04:33,988 --> 01:04:35,088
The Audit Team manager?

1118
01:04:42,127 --> 01:04:43,568
Why is he looking at me like that?

1119
01:04:54,408 --> 01:04:57,507
(The Auditors)

1120
01:04:57,508 --> 01:04:58,947
(Special thanks to Kim Hong Pa, Jeong Seok Yong, Lee Gyu Hoe, )

1121
01:04:58,948 --> 01:05:00,377
(Jung Hee Tae, and Jung In Ki for appearing.)

1122
01:05:17,528 --> 01:05:19,637
We'll audit everyone connected to the tower crane corruption.

1123
01:05:19,638 --> 01:05:20,996
Including the executives.

1124
01:05:20,997 --> 01:05:22,107
If you find nothing meaningful,

1125
01:05:22,108 --> 01:05:24,108
I'll make you pay for making such a fuss.

1126
01:05:24,207 --> 01:05:25,838
Those selected for the audit...

1127
01:05:26,408 --> 01:05:29,077
are either manipulating evidence or running off with evidence.

1128
01:05:29,147 --> 01:05:30,178
No, I swear.

1129
01:05:30,448 --> 01:05:32,048
Seriously, how could you do this?

1130
01:05:32,917 --> 01:05:34,817
Mr. Gu Han Soo will be transferred...

1131
01:05:34,818 --> 01:05:35,948
to a different department.

1132
01:05:36,347 --> 01:05:38,618
I was clueless.

1133
01:05:39,088 --> 01:05:42,287
I really will chop your head off.

1134
01:05:42,588 --> 01:05:44,258
I am Shin Cha Il, the manager of the Audit Team.

1135
01:05:44,997 --> 01:05:46,358
We will now begin the special audit.

1136
01:05:54,638 --> 01:05:56,468
Memory is imperfect.

1137
01:05:56,968 --> 01:05:58,377
He doesn't smile like this.

1138
01:05:58,477 --> 01:05:59,507
Are you an idiot?

1139
01:05:59,508 --> 01:06:01,107
Kang Hoo Young is like...

1140
01:06:01,108 --> 01:06:03,178
a little kid without a heart.

1141
01:06:03,608 --> 01:06:06,477
I bet he's never liked anyone.

1142
01:06:07,347 --> 01:06:08,347
I like you.

1143
01:06:08,348 --> 01:06:09,417
(Serendipity's Embrace)
