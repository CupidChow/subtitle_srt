leak company's important technology?

Yoon Woo.

00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:12,248
You are also an important member of the team.

No matter how capable they are,
people who bully others…

9
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,687

Don't you think so?

10
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:19,082
Thanks.

11

But.

12
00:01:22,903 --> 00:01:25,769
Have you always had a bad relationship
with Mr. Park?

13
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:27,988
Or was there some kind of trigger?

14
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:31,572
We need to look at the context…

15
00:01:31,596 --> 00:01:33,244

That's not really the case.

17
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:39,065
In fact, Mr. Park and I even did
pair programming together.

18
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:40,483
Pair programming.

19
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:42,995
Does that mean you wrote code
on one computer with him?

20
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,881
Then, there can be a lot of conflicts.

21
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,190
Is that why your relationship got worse?

22
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:48,753
No. We had no conflicts.

23
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:53,035
Oh, yes.

48
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,485
it seems like he bullied me more
and more since that day.

49
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:31,519

the reporting system once?

50
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:32,911
That's harsh.

51
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:34,941
Maybe he was actually involved
in illegal gambling.

52
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,691
That's why he was upset with you.

J-BIMS is an AI-based

We will apply the demo version
to the Goo Young Building construction site…

138
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:02,438
that cost of 70 billion won.

139
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:07,125
It is expected to reduce construction costs
by approximately 1.4 billion won.

140
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,256
In the future, it will drastically
reduce construction costs.

141
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,600
It sounds impressive in theory…

142
00:09:11,624 --> 00:09:15,759
but it seems like it's just about
reducing schedules, cutting costs, …

143
00:09:15,783 --> 00:09:17,021
and ultimately reducing staff.

144
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:20,492
Through J-BIMS,
unnecessary manpower can be reduced…

145
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,669
There is no such thing
as unnecessary manpower in construction.

146
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:25,243

147
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:26,421

148
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:30,794
management will talk about cost savings
and subsequent layoffs.

149
00:09:30,818 --> 00:09:34,631

00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:38,147
the future the CEO envisions for JU?

151
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:40,309
If it's necessary for the company, yes.

152
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,345
Especially…

153
00:09:42,203 --> 00:09:45,203
we will start by removing executives
who are hindering the company's growth.

154
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:47,155
By the way…

155
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:51,943
how many times have you visited
the construction site while working here?

156
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:52,500
Well…

157
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:55,484
If you have something to say, be specific.

158
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:59,059
How many people are needed for the pouring?

159
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,879
Do you not know what pouring means?

160
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:02,458
I'm talking about concrete placement.

161
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:03,762
For concrete placing boom…

162
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:05,871
the number of staff needed is…

163
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:08,079
0.49 person per 10 cubic meters
for reinforced structures.

164
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:09,899
0.49 person?

165
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:12,626
That's wild.

166
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,266
So you just cut a person in half?

167
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:18,299
Is this for winter or summer?

168
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:20,330
How about in rainy days?

169
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:23,177
- Sorry?
- When pouring concrete in an apartment setting…

170
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:25,848
you need two people for
the discharge area and hose…

171
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:27,262
one for the vibrator…

172
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:29,327
and two to three for finishing and
cleaning the surface.

173
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:31,636
That's at least 6 people.

174
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,097
In addition, if it's cold,
you'll need extra workers to heat the mix.

175
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:37,281
When it rains, you'll need additional
workers to cover the surface with plastic.

176
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:38,481
Understand?

177
00:10:39,342 --> 00:10:42,412
Such factors can be taken into account
and reflected in the program.

178
00:10:42,436 --> 00:10:44,326
There are many variables
in the construction site.

179
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,235
Are you going to rewrite the program
every time something changes?

180
00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:51,651
Let's adjourn the meeting.

181
00:11:07,174 --> 00:11:09,735
He may seem sophisticated,

182
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,474
but I can't trust someone
who relies only on machines.

183
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:13,699
You're right.

184
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:19,924
General Manager Ji Hoon looks like a person
who would stab people in the back.

185
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:21,971
He has the face of a traitor.

186
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:26,134
What kind of face do I have?

187
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:29,875
You have the face of a dragon.
It's a good sign.

188
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,923
You look like someone who will be king.

189
00:11:31,947 --> 00:11:35,423
Mr. Yang, you're very transparent.

190
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,829
That's why I like you.

191
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:40,446
Ah well…

192
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,969
I'm loyal to the company.
No, I mean…

193
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:47,843
My priority is to be loyal,
loyal and loyal to you.

194
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:49,741
Speaking of which..

195
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:52,266
Shin Cha Il doesn't really
have the right look either.

196
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,680
His words are so harsh and
he seems to be rambling about a lot today.

197
00:11:57,812 --> 00:11:59,585
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

198
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:04,764
It seems like something interesting
happened at the Audit Office today.

199
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:06,432
Something interesting?

200
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:08,717
Someone from the Audit Office…

201
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:11,325
reportedly confronted Mr. Shin,
alleging that there was a suspicion…

202
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:14,254
- of J-BIMS information leakage.
- Why?

203
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:17,825
Mr. Shin dismissed it,
saying there was no evidence.

204
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:20,099
I heard that the CEO ordered…

205
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:22,997
not to create any disturbances
before the event.

206
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:26,231
So, he probably covered it up.

207
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:32,621
Se Woong and Cha Il only seem
to work together to bully me.

208
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:34,961
But still…

209
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:38,591
Are you saying Cha Il covered it up?

210
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:44,880
I will go ahead first.

211
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:54,294
He must be in a hurry.

212
00:12:54,318 --> 00:12:56,169
I don't think so. He's just upset.

213
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:58,357
Everyone is dismissed for the day.

214
00:12:59,391 --> 00:13:02,098
- Let's go home.
- Yes.

215
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:03,170
- Okay.

216
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:06,490
We'll leave first.

217
00:13:07,842 --> 00:13:09,061
Goodbye.

218
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:20,363
Mr. Shin's expression didn't change at all
even after Han Soo left like that.

219
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,996
There may be suspicions,
but there's no evidence.

220
00:13:24,728 --> 00:13:26,828
Why do you think he's so certain?

221
00:13:26,852 --> 00:13:28,547
He's frustrated because
things aren't going well for his friend.

222
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:30,856
So he exaggerated his suspicions.

223
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,179
It wasn't that big of a deal anyway.

224
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:35,408
Geez.

225
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:37,583
Seo Jin, you should call and look after him.

226
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:39,252
I'll get going.

227
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,588
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

228
00:13:41,444 --> 00:13:42,370
Bye, Seo Jin.

229
00:13:42,394 --> 00:13:43,936
- Goodbye.
- Get home safe.

Someone who pushes people

254
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:40,797
<i>Mr. Shin, why do you keep doing this?
Why?</i>

255
00:15:50,412 --> 00:15:54,114
The CEO is focused
on the J-BIMS demonstration event.

256
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:58,302
That's why your team leader
can't do anything without evidence.

257
00:15:59,614 --> 00:16:00,957
No.

258
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:04,754
He isn't someone
who would overlook suspicions.

259
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:09,207
But how could he ignore the CEO's orders?

261
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:21,938
Then, I'll have to make him ignore it.

262
00:16:21,962 --> 00:16:23,396
What's up with you?

263
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,830
I think I found out
what these numbers mean.

264
00:16:24,854 --> 00:16:26,740
For real? What is it?

265
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:27,866
This is an ASCII code.

266
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,513

267
00:16:29,537 --> 00:16:31,217

293

but I wonder if he's really sick
or just being rebellious.

311
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:26,107
He's too kind to be rebellious.

312
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:29,770
Did he get sick because he was upset
about what happened yesterday?

313
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,192
Even if Han Soo was being unreasonable…

314
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:36,497
Mr. Shin could have at least tried
to smooth things over.

315
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:38,420
But he's being just as childish.

316
00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:41,520
You're more childish than them.

317
00:19:41,544 --> 00:19:43,845

As I've mentioned,

323
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:33,518

327
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:44,310
Okay.

328
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:51,403
Yoon Woo could you write…

329
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:02,516
I don't think we'll get a reply.

330
00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:13,721
Yoon Woo, you said Mr. Park
replied to that email.

331
00:21:13,745 --> 00:21:16,212
That must've been the invitation.

332
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:17,697
Won't that be in his PC?

333
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:18,845
I guess so.

334
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:21,271
But how do you plan to check his PC?

335
00:21:24,956 --> 00:21:25,914
Don't tell me…

336
00:21:25,938 --> 00:21:28,183
Yes. That's the only way.

337
00:21:33,044 --> 00:21:34,012
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

338
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:35,036
Goodbye.

339
00:21:35,743 --> 00:21:37,257
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

340
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:52,618
Are you sure there's no one here?

341
00:21:52,642 --> 00:21:54,545
Yes, I asked.

342
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:56,438
They need to stay overnight tomorrow…

343
00:21:56,462 --> 00:21:59,052
so they said they'll leave before 10pm.

344
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:01,396
All right. Let's go.

345
00:22:18,418 --> 00:22:20,003

What are you doing here at this hour?

348
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,804
That's because…

349
00:22:32,723 --> 00:22:36,662
Mr. Oh is a victim of workplace harassment
and he's on leave.

350
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:38,671
He's under the audit team's protection.

351
00:22:39,612 --> 00:22:43,309
We came to retrieve some personal belongings
that he left behind.

352
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,862
Okay. You may go in.

353
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:48,950
Staff from other departments…

354
00:22:48,974 --> 00:22:51,075
are not allowed to enter
outside of working hours.

355
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,999
I'm from the audit team.

356
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:01,347
Mr. Oh is currently in a very unstable state,
both mentally and physically.

357
00:23:01,371 --> 00:23:04,551
If we leave him alone and something happens,
will you take responsibility?

358
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:07,509
You need to be quick.

359
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:08,707
Okay.

360
00:23:09,803 --> 00:23:10,928
Wait.

361
00:23:12,765 --> 00:23:15,777
You need to put a security sticker
over you phone's camera.

362
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,958
Oh, right. Okay.

363
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,952
This is his desk.

364
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:33,039
Wait.

365
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:35,375
If the power is turned on,
an alert will go directly to Mr. Park.

366
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:37,983
Then he'll call the security office.
They'll come in immediately.

367
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:38,978
Two minutes?

368
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,335
No, it probably won't even take a minute.

369
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,723
I'll be as quick as possible.

370
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:45,454
Here I go.

371
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:10,220
<i>JU protect Security System App</i>

372
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:27,194
Yes, I'll check.

373
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:38,173
I found it.

374
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:49,779
It's a sample of J-BIMS demonstration version.

375
00:24:49,803 --> 00:24:54,007
He showed it to the buyers as a sample
to make them want to purchase it.

376
00:24:54,946 --> 00:24:56,483
Mr. Park seriously…

377
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:01,743
Okay, I will go and check.

378
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:09,263
What are you doing here?

379
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:12,805
I received a report that Mr. Park's computer
has been turned on.

380
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:15,337
Why did you touch his computer?

381
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:16,485
It was a mistake.

382
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:18,619
I thought it was my computer…

383
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:20,723
because we used the same computer
during pair coding.

384
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,086
I got everything.
We'll leave now.

385
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,211
Please wait here.

386
00:25:25,235 --> 00:25:26,728
Mr. Park is on his way.

387
00:25:26,752 --> 00:25:28,860
You may leave after he checks.

388
00:25:28,884 --> 00:25:30,478
No, we can't.

389
00:25:30,502 --> 00:25:33,040
Mr. Park is the perpetrator who harassed him.

390
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,287
They aren't allowed to meet. We will leave now.

391
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:37,021
- Let's go.
- You can't leave.

392
00:25:37,045 --> 00:25:38,900
We'll let you go after we have checked.

393
00:25:38,924 --> 00:25:40,435
Please stay still.

394
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:52,186
Can I at least make one phone call?

395
00:26:04,751 --> 00:26:05,984
Who the hell was it?

396
00:26:08,075 --> 00:26:09,400
Stop!

397
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,550
What is going on?

398
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:16,186
That computer is an important evidence.

399
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,305
Don't touch it until my team leader arrives.

400
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:20,022
- What are you talking about?
- Take another step…

401
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:22,406
and we will consider it as an attempt
to erase the evidence.

402
00:26:44,262 --> 00:26:46,971
Mr. Shin. I found the evidence.

403
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:00,962
I received a call from Mr. Park
regarding an issue in the R&D office

404
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,208
What's all this about?

405
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:06,800
We figured why Mr. Park bullied Yoon Woo.

406
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:09,359
What are you talking about when you tried
to snoop on someone else's computer?

407
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:11,710
Let's see if you can say that
after seeing this.

408
00:27:12,495 --> 00:27:14,014
What are you doing?!

409
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:15,290
You must be scared to see this, right?

410
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:16,473
The evidence is all right here.

411
00:27:16,497 --> 00:27:17,683
What are you talking about?

412
00:27:17,707 --> 00:27:19,194
Leave it.

413
00:27:19,218 --> 00:27:20,834
Mr. Lee?

414
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:27,462
I'm not sure what this is about but be quick.

415
00:27:28,674 --> 00:27:29,814
Yes, sir.

416
00:27:37,547 --> 00:27:41,290
Mr. Park started bullying Yoon Woo
because he thought he saw his email.

417
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,528
What's that email about?

418
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:48,120
This is the email.

419
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:55,882
<i>[Download permission is not available]</i>

420
00:27:58,726 --> 00:27:59,893
Give me a second.

421
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:01,437
<i>[Download permission is not available]</i>

422
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:03,057
This…

423
00:28:03,924 --> 00:28:07,052
It was definitely here a minute ago, Mr. Shin.

424
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:08,718
Is it okay…

425
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,273
for the audit team
to search the R&D office recklessly?

426
00:28:12,297 --> 00:28:14,882
I will report this matter directly to the CEO.

427
00:28:14,906 --> 00:28:16,140
No. Wait.

428
00:28:16,164 --> 00:28:17,822
No. I saw it.

429
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:19,046
The email was definitely here.

430
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,311
Mr. Goo, from this moment on
you will be excluded from this case.

431
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:23,764
- But Mr. Shin…
- I saw it too.

432
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:26,904
Mr. Oh, keep in mind that
this will only be detrimental to you.

433
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:28,003
Please go home immediately.

434
00:28:28,027 --> 00:28:29,951
We will contact you later.

435
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,638
Come out.

436
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:33,927
Mr. Shin, I saw it.

437
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:38,441
Mr. Shin, I swear I saw it.

438
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:40,063
Sorry for the trouble.

439
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:44,920
Mr. Shin!

440
00:28:55,369 --> 00:29:00,274
Why did you hack into Mr. Park's computer
in the R&D office?

441
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:02,026
To search for the evidence.

442
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,458
You said we needed proof.

443
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:07,805
I specifically told you yesterday…

444
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:10,882
to investigate discreetly.

445
00:29:12,254 --> 00:29:13,912
<i>We need evidence.</i>

446
00:29:13,936 --> 00:29:16,067
<i>It might be too late late by then.</i>

447
00:29:16,091 --> 00:29:17,750
<i>We need to investigate Mr. Park immediately!</i>

448
00:29:17,774 --> 00:29:19,911
<i>Don't let your emotions blind you, Mr. Goo!</i>

449
00:29:38,802 --> 00:29:39,966
<i>Mr. Goo Han Soo.</i>

450
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:48,672
<i>Is there something you want to say?</i>

451
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:54,996
<i>I couldn't talk about it
since it was a sensitive issue.</i>

452
00:29:56,132 --> 00:29:57,880
<i>What do you mean?</i>

453
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,297
<i>I suspect there is information leakage
from the R&D department.</i>

454
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,485
<i>I knew it.</i>

455
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:07,551
<i>You also think Mr. Park is
trying to leak about J-BIMS.</i>

456
00:30:07,575 --> 00:30:08,780
<i>No.</i>

457
00:30:08,804 --> 00:30:09,523
<i>What?</i>

458
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:12,712
<i>The person I suspect is not Mr. Park.</i>

459
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,909
<i>Then who?</i>

460
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:16,081
<i>General Manager Lee Ji Hoon.</i>

461
00:30:22,507 --> 00:30:23,455
<i>Hold on a second.</i>

462
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:24,334
<i>What is this about?</i>

463
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:25,791
<i>I need to take this
to the General Affairs team.</i>

464
00:30:25,815 --> 00:30:27,193
<i>Go on.</i>

465
00:30:27,217 --> 00:30:29,503
<i>Does the R&D Department use special paper?</i>

466
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,644
<i>Yes. Due to the nature the department…</i>

467
00:30:31,668 --> 00:30:34,010
<i>their document management is more stringent
than in other departments.</i>

468
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:36,439
<i>Only paper containing sensors
is allowed to be used.</i>

469
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:40,090
<i>If an internal document is taken out,
it will be detected at the checkpoint.</i>

470
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:41,780
<i>May I have a look?</i>

471
00:30:42,878 --> 00:30:44,439
<i>It looks like a normal paper.</i>

472
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,961
<i>Please excuse the mess.
I'm not really good at organizing.</i>

473
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,072
<i>But I have…</i>

474
00:30:57,085 --> 00:30:58,678
<i>- Can I use this?
- Wait a second.</i>

475
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:02,860
<i>That one is probably crumpled.
Here's a new one.</i>

476
00:31:04,837 --> 00:31:05,617
<i>Please wait.</i>

477
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:08,135
<i>I am here to interview
General Manager Lee Ji Hoon.</i>

478
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,400
<i>You may enter.</i>

479
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,830
<i>According to security regulations,
the R&D Department…</i>

480
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:17,377
<i>must use special paper
with a weight of 100 grams.</i>

481
00:31:17,401 --> 00:31:20,912
<i>But the paper I found
on General Manager Lee Ji Hoon's sofa…</i>

482
00:31:20,936 --> 00:31:24,965
<i>was lighter and thinner than the special paper.</i>

483
00:31:24,989 --> 00:31:28,693
<i>It was likely the common 80-gram regular paper.</i>

484
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:30,133
<i>Then…</i>

485
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:33,094
<i>if he printed something confidential
on that paper and took it out,</i>

486
00:31:33,118 --> 00:31:34,759
<i>it wouldn't have been detected
at the checkpoint.</i>

487
00:31:34,783 --> 00:31:38,042
<i>He is outwardly very sensitive
about the security of the R&D Department…</i>

488
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:40,621
<i>and has always advocated
for strengthening the system.</i>

489
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:45,747
<i>However, he himself was engaging in actions
that violate the regulations.</i>

490
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,052
<i>It doesn't add up.</i>

491
00:31:49,554 --> 00:31:50,676
<i>I agree…</i>

492
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:53,644
<i>but I'm still suspicious of Mr. Park.</i>

493
00:31:55,388 --> 00:32:00,394
<i>It makes sense if Mr. Lee was attempting
to leak information with Mr. Park's help.</i>

494
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:04,600
<i>The problem is finding evidence.</i>

495
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:08,045
<i>Mr. Goo, I want you to
secretly investigate about Mr. Park.</i>

496
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:10,798
<i>Okay. I will find the evidence.</i>

497
00:32:10,822 --> 00:32:12,115
<i>Don't push yourself too hard.</i>

498
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:13,758
<i>It is very important…</i>

499
00:32:13,782 --> 00:32:16,227
<i>that the fact that we are investigating
must not be revealed.</i>

500
00:32:19,382 --> 00:32:23,759
I'm sorry. I should've been more careful.

501
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:27,788
What did you find?

502
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:30,738
A sample of the J-BIMS demo version…

503
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:33,423
was posted on the dark web
to show to potential buyers.

504
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:35,169
However…

505
00:32:35,193 --> 00:32:37,985
it was deleted, perhaps because
they realized we were investigating.

506
00:32:38,009 --> 00:32:41,247
That would have been definitive evidence.

507
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:43,442
He wasn't surprised.

508
00:32:43,466 --> 00:32:44,481
What?

509
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:45,708
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

510
00:32:45,732 --> 00:32:48,067
<i>You must be scared to see this, right?
The evidence is all right here.</i>

511
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,137
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Leave it.</i>

512
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:51,476
<i>Mr. Lee?</i>

513
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:57,252
<i>I'm not sure what this is about but be quick.</i>

514
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:59,330
It seems certain that Mr. Lee is involved.

515
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,549
He must have realized
that I accessed the dark web…

516
00:33:01,573 --> 00:33:03,046
and deleted the demo version.

517
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:05,663
Mr. Park is an accomplice.

518
00:33:07,562 --> 00:33:10,218
J-BIMS couldn't be stolen yet, right?

519
00:33:10,242 --> 00:33:12,636
Some parts might have been
handed over to brokers.

520
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:16,977
However, since J-BIMS is not completed yet…

521
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:19,002
So the deal may not have been finalized yet.

522
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:20,610
That's right.

523
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:22,708
But we don't have much time left.

524
00:33:22,732 --> 00:33:24,661
What should we do?

525
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:28,076
We need to closely monitor General Manager Lee.

526
00:33:29,482 --> 00:33:32,062
I'll take care of that.

527
00:33:33,574 --> 00:33:35,654
They must have caught on
to our investigation by now.

528
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:38,309
Be careful.

529
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:40,581
Yes, sir.

530
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,794
Why did you search through
the R&D Department's computers?

531
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:49,869
What were you looking for?

532
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:51,413
Or were you trying to steal something?

533
00:33:53,017 --> 00:33:54,611
I hope you're not going
to make excuses…

534
00:33:54,635 --> 00:33:56,912
like "We're trying to find evidence
of workplace bullying."

535
00:33:56,936 --> 00:33:59,036
The issue is not related to workplace bullying.

536
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,421
Then what is it?

537
00:34:03,562 --> 00:34:05,748
There were signs of an attempt to leak…

538
00:34:05,772 --> 00:34:07,835
J-BIMS's core technology…

539
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:11,612
among the employees in the R&D Department.

540
00:34:11,636 --> 00:34:12,860
What did you say?

541
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,529
Leaking about J-BIMS?

542
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:19,209
Do you have evidence?

543
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:20,641
There is no physical evidence yet.

544
00:34:20,665 --> 00:34:23,568
We only have suspicions
about the attempt to leak the technology.

545
00:34:25,206 --> 00:34:29,591
Is the owner of the computer that
the audit team secretly searched a suspect?

546
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:31,428
There is a high probability
that he's an accomplice.

547
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:33,267
So there's another main suspect.

548
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:36,822
It's General Manager Lee Ji Hoon.

549
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:48,366
Honestly, I can't believe it.

550
00:34:49,344 --> 00:34:51,227
He oversees J-BIMS…

551
00:34:51,251 --> 00:34:54,445
and has previously reported
about two external brokers' attempts…

552
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,311
at leaking information.

553
00:34:56,335 --> 00:34:58,650
Still, an investigation is necessary.

554
00:34:58,674 --> 00:35:00,630
Variables can always arise.

555
00:35:01,645 --> 00:35:05,095
We need to determine if a leak attempt
actually occurred.

556
00:35:08,248 --> 00:35:09,928
Handle it discreetly.

557
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,074
Most importantly…

558
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,622
the preparation for the demonstration
must not be disrupted.

559
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:15,669
Yes, sir.

560
00:35:15,693 --> 00:35:16,716
Mr. Shin.

561
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:21,666
J-BIMS is crucial not only
for our company's future revenue…

562
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,244
but also for the management rights.

563
00:35:24,268 --> 00:35:25,979
If the suspicions turn out to be false,

564
00:35:26,003 --> 00:35:28,479
both you and the audit team…

565
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:31,200
will be held responsible for causing trouble.

566
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:42,034
I heard Han Soo is on vacation again.

567
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:43,192
People say…

568
00:35:44,998 --> 00:35:46,913
No. Never mind.

569
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:48,609
What is it? Spill it.

570
00:35:48,633 --> 00:35:50,866
Are you curious?

571
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,351
What is it? Tell us.

572
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:53,387
Well…

573
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:57,281
I heard someone caused trouble
at the R&D department.

574
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:59,128
I have a feeling that…

575
00:35:59,152 --> 00:36:00,231
Was it Han Soo?

576
00:36:00,255 --> 00:36:01,659
Yes.

577
00:36:01,683 --> 00:36:04,480
He was eager to find evidence.
I guess he caused trouble.

578
00:36:04,504 --> 00:36:05,494
It's just my gut feeling.

579
00:36:05,518 --> 00:36:08,979
He went against Mr. Shin once,
he must think he's the Team Leader now.

580
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:10,491
He's probably going through puberty.

581
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:25,422
Mr. Shin…

582
00:36:26,381 --> 00:36:28,430
I have something to tell you.

583
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:37,156
You haven't given up
on the R&D department case, right?

584
00:36:39,442 --> 00:36:42,594
If you're hesitant to move forward
due to lack of evidence, I can help.

585
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,641
I'm also concerned because he's my colleague.

586
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,458
What Han Soo said did make sense.

587
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:54,783
For now, I will go to the Information
Security Team to check…

588
00:36:54,807 --> 00:36:58,091
if there are any issues with our company's
network and technology security systems.

589
00:37:01,827 --> 00:37:03,255
Is that alright?

590
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,035
Go ahead.

591
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,179
Make sure to investigate thoroughly,

592
00:37:07,203 --> 00:37:11,453
but it should appear as a routine check
given the upcoming demonstration.

593
00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:13,844
Yes, sir.

594
00:37:15,662 --> 00:37:16,958
Come in.

595
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:24,759
- Mr. Park, come here. Take a look at this.
- Yes, sir.

596
00:37:26,406 --> 00:37:28,280
Why was the timeline
for the demonstration changed?

597
00:37:28,304 --> 00:37:32,082
While revising, it turned out that
changing it this way made the flow more natural

598
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:33,812
Restore it to its original state.

599
00:37:35,574 --> 00:37:39,549
Then we'll need to adjust the simulation
for the latter part and rerun the calculations.

600
00:37:39,573 --> 00:37:40,785
Yes, do that.

601
00:37:43,198 --> 00:37:46,540
I'm currently fixing an error
with the material inventory calculations…

602
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:50,611
so I don't have enough time
to make this adjustment as well.

603
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,455
Is there anyone just lounging around?

604
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,633
Everyone's short on time.

605
00:37:54,657 --> 00:37:57,912
Don't underestimate yourself.
You can definitely handle it all.

606
00:37:57,936 --> 00:37:58,975
Mr. Park…

607
00:37:59,703 --> 00:38:01,935
the demonstration is just around the corner.

608
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:04,810
We need to show them how much effort we put in.

609
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:06,178
Once we get through this
demonstration successfully…

610
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:07,779
you know
what will happen next, right?

611
00:38:07,803 --> 00:38:08,803
Mr. Park…

612
00:38:11,763 --> 00:38:13,211
No. General Manager Park.

613
00:38:17,692 --> 00:38:21,281
I want to do everything too,
but realistically, there's not enough time.

614
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:25,620
Please edit it as you wish.

615
00:38:25,644 --> 00:38:27,755
Just make sure to match
the presentation timeline.

616
00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:31,839
This exact scene must be shown
exactly 12 minutes…

617
00:38:31,863 --> 00:38:33,491
after I start the presentation.

618
00:38:33,515 --> 00:38:34,684
Okay?

619
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:35,720
Yes, sir.

620
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:43,624
The demonstration is coming up soon.

621
00:38:43,648 --> 00:38:45,773
I'm just asking as a precaution.

622
00:38:45,797 --> 00:38:49,077
Our R&D department's information
protection system is intact, right?

623
00:38:49,101 --> 00:38:52,289
Of course. The system is regularly upgraded.

624
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:59,552
It's rare for anyone in the R&D department
to violate security regulations, right?

625
00:38:59,576 --> 00:39:01,519
There might be minor mistakes occasionally…

626
00:39:01,543 --> 00:39:03,274
but with the demonstration so close…

627
00:39:03,298 --> 00:39:06,576
Yes. There used to be one person
who occasionally made mistakes…

628
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,476
but there haven't been any in recent days.

629
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,374
Speaking of which…

630
00:39:10,398 --> 00:39:13,749
I haven't received the statement of reason
about the security sticker removal.

631
00:39:13,773 --> 00:39:14,789
Is that so?

632
00:39:15,616 --> 00:39:16,831
Who is it?

633
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,397
That's…

634
00:39:55,498 --> 00:39:57,003
Yes, I understand.

635
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,353
Mr. Shin, it looks like the transaction
is happening tonight.

636
00:40:09,377 --> 00:40:11,450
He made an appointment with the broker.

637
00:40:11,474 --> 00:40:12,867
When and where?

638
00:41:57,554 --> 00:42:01,053
That's right. I have to follow the evidence.

639
00:42:42,115 --> 00:42:43,651
Where did he go?

640
00:42:55,478 --> 00:42:57,197
Who are you?

641
00:42:57,221 --> 00:42:59,385
Why are you following me?

642
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:02,190
- Well…
- Well what, you brat?

643
00:43:07,608 --> 00:43:08,819
Who are you?

644
00:43:09,794 --> 00:43:11,669
Hand over what you received from Lee Ji Hoon.

645
00:43:11,693 --> 00:43:13,874
What nonsense are you talking about?

646
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:20,736
- Hand it over.
- Hand over what?

647
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,314
I have nothing.

648
00:43:22,338 --> 00:43:25,407
Stop lying. I saw everything.

649
00:43:33,794 --> 00:43:35,446
Is this it?

650
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,801
Why are you doing this to me?

651
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:44,579
- Whose passport is this?
- My younger sister.

652
00:43:44,603 --> 00:43:46,607
She left it at home.

653
00:43:46,631 --> 00:43:48,328
I was bringing it to her.

654
00:43:48,352 --> 00:43:50,040
Why did you meet Lee Ji Hoon?

655
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:51,454
Who is that?

656
00:43:51,478 --> 00:43:53,744
The one you met under the bridge.

657
00:43:53,768 --> 00:43:56,070
Let me go. This is a crime.

658
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:58,571
Call the police.

659
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:00,426
What should I report?

660
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,286
Assault and battery.

661
00:44:04,292 --> 00:44:05,357
Yes, sir.

662
00:44:08,402 --> 00:44:10,621
Hello. I want to report an assault incident.

663
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:15,368
Did you already know
that he is a passport forger.

664
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,145
I didn't believe his story entirely.

665
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:19,434
How so?

666
00:44:21,006 --> 00:44:22,711
His sister didn't resemble him.

667
00:44:25,646 --> 00:44:27,106
Is that all?

668
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:30,808
Suspicious location, suspicious money,
and a suspicious passport.

669
00:44:30,832 --> 00:44:32,293
It was enough to raise doubts.

670
00:44:32,317 --> 00:44:35,981
General Manager Lee bought a fake passport.

671
00:44:36,005 --> 00:44:37,989
If the forger confesses, it's all over, right?

672
00:44:38,013 --> 00:44:41,526
We might not have time
to wait for a confession.

673
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,102
Why?

674
00:44:46,453 --> 00:44:47,511
This is Shin Cha Il.

675
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:52,607
I understand. I'm on my way.

676
00:44:53,456 --> 00:44:54,851
We're going back to the office.

677
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:56,818
Yes, sir.

678
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:24,638
You get off from work quite late.

679
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,642
I'm going down.

680
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:32,472
Let's have an interview at the audit room.

681
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:33,703
What are you doing?

682
00:45:33,727 --> 00:45:36,510
- Do you know what time it is now?
- It will be quick.

683
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,319
Please get off.

684
00:45:47,255 --> 00:45:49,199
Is this about Oh Yoon Woo?

685
00:45:49,223 --> 00:45:50,251
Let's talk tomorrow. Let me go home.

686
00:45:50,275 --> 00:45:53,661
Don't misunderstand.
This is not a request.

687
00:45:55,642 --> 00:45:56,735
Let's go.

688
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,040
Isn't Oh Yoon Woo's case over now?

689
00:46:28,064 --> 00:46:31,289
The investigation about workplace bullying
is still ongoing.

690
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:35,258
I didn't bully him.

691
00:46:35,282 --> 00:46:38,781
Mr. Park, have you ever been bullied?

692
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,076
What are you talking about?

693
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,256
Have you ever been bullied…

694
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,575
by General Manager Lee Ji Hoon?

695
00:46:49,566 --> 00:46:53,479
Compliments and motivation
disguised as gaslighting.

696
00:46:53,503 --> 00:46:55,581
That is his tactic.

697
00:46:58,422 --> 00:47:00,029
<i>[Lee Ji Hoon.]</i>

698
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:10,948
I worked with Lee Ji Hoon,
before he joined JU Construction

699
00:47:10,972 --> 00:47:13,339
It was a startup company.

700
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:16,581
He worked as a technical team leader
for about a year.

701
00:47:16,605 --> 00:47:17,855
It wasn't just me.

702
00:47:17,879 --> 00:47:19,501
There were a few others too.

703
00:47:20,202 --> 00:47:21,777
The people who were bullied by him.

704
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:26,276
Let's end the meeting here.

705
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,769
<i>Before joining JU Construction,</i>

706
00:47:28,793 --> 00:47:32,337
<i>Lee Ji Hoon worked as a technical team leader
at a startup for a year.</i>

707
00:47:37,861 --> 00:47:38,862
Jung Ho.

708
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,781
Is this how you want to work?

709
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:45,341
I wouldn't be like this
if you take responsibility for your mistakes.

710
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:49,985
<i>An employee who worked under him
resigned after only three months.</i>

711
00:47:50,009 --> 00:47:51,082
<i>The reason being…</i>

712
00:47:51,106 --> 00:47:54,153
You have a brain.
Shouldn't you be putting that to good use?

713
00:47:54,177 --> 00:47:54,917
Is it that hard?

714
00:47:54,941 --> 00:47:56,501
<i>Covert bullying.</i>

715
00:47:56,525 --> 00:47:58,238
<i>[JU Construction Shin Cha Il]</i>

716
00:48:03,504 --> 00:48:07,031
I'm not sure where to start.

717
00:48:11,274 --> 00:48:12,740
You fix this.

718
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,370
I can't handle it anymore.

719
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,067
Are you Mr. Shin Cha Il?

720
00:48:24,091 --> 00:48:25,403
Yes, I am.

721
00:48:25,427 --> 00:48:26,577
<i>That wasn't the end.</i>

722
00:48:26,601 --> 00:48:30,070
<i>Within less than six months, two more
employees resigned from the company.</i>

723
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,652
Are you sure
you won't regret this?

724
00:48:35,962 --> 00:48:38,256
<i>Their reasons for leaving were the same…</i>

725
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:41,381
<i>which was bullying by Mr. Lee.</i>

726
00:48:46,398 --> 00:48:48,340
<i>He used the same bullying style.</i>

727
00:48:48,364 --> 00:48:49,575
Hang in there just a little bit more.

728
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,520
We're almost finished with the project.
You can do it.

729
00:48:51,544 --> 00:48:52,931
<i>When it was just the two of them…</i>

730
00:48:52,955 --> 00:48:57,145
<i>the bullying was intense and discreet,
unnoticed by other team members.</i>

731
00:48:59,794 --> 00:49:00,636
Finish it by tomorrow.

732
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,162
- <i>To everyone else, he was Dr. Jekyll…</i>
- But this…

733
00:49:03,186 --> 00:49:06,207
<i>but to the victim, he was Mr. Hyde.</i>

734
00:49:08,008 --> 00:49:11,122
<i>Doesn't it sound familiar to you?</i>

735
00:49:14,782 --> 00:49:18,120
But from now on, this is not an interrogation
on the workplace bullying.

736
00:49:19,918 --> 00:49:21,714
Then, what is it?

737
00:49:21,738 --> 00:49:24,060
We'll being the investigation of Mr. Park,
the manager of R&D department…

738
00:49:24,084 --> 00:49:28,347
for involvement in attempting
to leak the core technology of J-BIMS.

739
00:49:28,371 --> 00:49:30,664
What…?

740
00:49:30,688 --> 00:49:32,145
What are you talking about?

741
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:34,506
Leaking J-BIMS?
What do you mean I'm the accomplice?

742
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:37,170
We discovered that Mr. Lee Ji Hoon,
the General Manager of R&D department,

743
00:49:37,194 --> 00:49:38,789
was involved in leaking
the core technology of J-BIMS…

744
00:49:38,813 --> 00:49:41,424
to a multinational broker organization.

745
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:45,588
He had also agreed to receive
approximately 50 billion won in exchange.

746
00:49:45,612 --> 00:49:47,213
Wait…

747
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:48,158
Is that true?

748
00:49:48,182 --> 00:49:52,572
During this process, we have captured evidence
indicating that you assisted him.

749
00:49:52,596 --> 00:49:56,020
No way. I've never done such thing.

750
00:49:58,399 --> 00:49:59,488
Here.

751
00:50:00,426 --> 00:50:02,988
According to the list of security
regulation violations in the R&D department…

752
00:50:03,012 --> 00:50:05,372
you brought in standard A4 paper,

753
00:50:05,396 --> 00:50:07,829
which is prohibited
within the development area.

754
00:50:07,853 --> 00:50:10,080
Additionally, you removed
the security stickers four times…

755
00:50:10,104 --> 00:50:11,979
and you submitted
statement of reason for these.

756
00:50:12,003 --> 00:50:12,965
Wait but that's…

757
00:50:12,989 --> 00:50:16,419
Above all, you replied
to an email from a broker…

758
00:50:16,443 --> 00:50:19,413
disguised as an advertisement spam.

759
00:50:19,437 --> 00:50:22,566
No. I've done all that
because Mr. Lee ordered me to.

760
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:25,480
You did all this
because your superior asked you to?

761
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:35,801
My position is low compared to my age.

762
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:38,434
I started working quite late
due to personal reasons…

763
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:41,403
so I didn't get promoted on time.

764
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:45,066
2 years ago…

765
00:50:45,848 --> 00:50:48,991
I was sure that I would be promoted
as the General Manager of the R&D Department.

766
00:50:49,015 --> 00:50:51,506
But then Mr. Lee, who's younger than me came.

767
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:54,436
But Mr. Lee said he would soon
become an executive.

768
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,280
So as long as I follow his orders…

769
00:50:56,304 --> 00:51:00,232
he would promote me as the head of the team.

770
00:51:00,256 --> 00:51:01,399
Then…

771
00:51:01,423 --> 00:51:05,216
why did you excluded Yoon Woo
from the J-BIMS project?

772
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,514
I didn't expect that either.

773
00:51:07,538 --> 00:51:10,314
Mr. Lee suddenly told me
not to ask questions…

774
00:51:10,338 --> 00:51:12,471
and just respond to a specific spam email.

775
00:51:12,495 --> 00:51:15,642
I did as I was told, but then Yoon Woo saw it.

776
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:17,112
After realizing this, he insisted
on sending Yoon Woo…

777
00:51:17,136 --> 00:51:19,399
to another department
by any means necessary.

778
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:24,453
So, I ended up bullying him.
But I just followed his orders.

779
00:51:24,477 --> 00:51:26,565
Do you think that makes sense?

780
00:51:27,974 --> 00:51:32,023
But, I really didn't know
that it was about a leaking information.

781
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:32,973
I swear.

782
00:51:32,997 --> 00:51:35,177
Mr. Lee promised you a promotion.

783
00:51:35,201 --> 00:51:37,230
He also used your computer IP address…

784
00:51:37,254 --> 00:51:41,737
to upload and promote the J-BIMS
demo version sample…

785
00:51:41,761 --> 00:51:43,927
on the dark web.

786
00:51:43,951 --> 00:51:47,379
He intended to pin
all the technology leakage on you.

787
00:51:47,403 --> 00:51:50,070
What?

788
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:52,544
Mr. Park.

789
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:55,340
Answer me properly.

790
00:51:56,308 --> 00:51:57,066
Depending in your answer…

791
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:59,333
we will either believe
your claim of innocence…

792
00:51:59,357 --> 00:52:02,272
or decide to report you to the police…

793
00:52:02,296 --> 00:52:04,172
immediately after this investigation.

794
00:52:08,697 --> 00:52:09,925
I understand.

795
00:52:38,882 --> 00:52:41,262
- There will be no problem at all.
- Welcome, sir.

796
00:52:42,204 --> 00:52:43,214
What is going on?

797
00:52:43,238 --> 00:52:46,920
I heard there was an error
in the cost estimation program.

798
00:52:46,944 --> 00:52:48,315
<i>Yes, thank you.</i>

799
00:52:50,398 --> 00:52:55,117
The CEO has allowed us to upload
the cost estimation program to the cloud…

800
00:52:55,141 --> 00:52:56,228
only during the demonstration.

801
00:52:56,252 --> 00:52:57,323
Then we can fix the error immediately…

802
00:52:57,347 --> 00:53:00,704
and make real-time updates
to the demonstration files.

803
00:53:00,728 --> 00:53:02,124
But won't there be a security risk?

804
00:53:02,148 --> 00:53:04,654
It's only a part of the whole program,
not the entire system anyway.

805
00:53:04,678 --> 00:53:06,742
Since it will only be for about
an hour during the demonstration.

806
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,109
It should be fine.

807
00:53:08,133 --> 00:53:10,169
I'm using a secure cloud service…

808
00:53:10,193 --> 00:53:12,017
and we can set a new password for access.

809
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:14,273
The password will only
be shared with Mr. Park…

810
00:53:14,297 --> 00:53:17,354
since only the two of us
can fix the error right now.

811
00:53:17,378 --> 00:53:18,433
The rest of you…

812
00:53:18,457 --> 00:53:19,730
can just re-check the errors…

813
00:53:19,754 --> 00:53:21,274
so that the demonstration
goes smoothly without any problem.

814
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:22,572
Yes, sir.

815
00:53:23,779 --> 00:53:25,983
I uploaded the copied file in the cloud.

816
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:27,588
Please set the password.

817
00:53:29,448 --> 00:53:31,609
I'm lazy to think. Let's just use this.

818
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,948
Then, I will modify the program from now on…

819
00:53:36,972 --> 00:53:39,163
so please accept it and mark it as an error.

820
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:40,646
Yes, sir. I got that.

821
00:53:54,903 --> 00:53:58,144
<i>Mr. Lee will hand over
the core technology of J-BIMS…</i>

822
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,983
<i>to the broker at the demonstration event.</i>

823
00:54:00,724 --> 00:54:02,271
From the start to the end
of the demonstration…

824
00:54:02,295 --> 00:54:05,672
please share with us all
notable activities of him.

825
00:54:05,696 --> 00:54:09,413
If he becomes aware of what we know,
and tries to sabotage the situation…

826
00:54:09,437 --> 00:54:11,163
we will assume that you leaked
the information to him…

827
00:54:11,187 --> 00:54:13,851
and will immediately report you
as a technology theft accomplice.

828
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,669
<i>While preparing for the demonstration…</i>

829
00:54:17,693 --> 00:54:19,537
<i>were there any special requests made by him…</i>

830
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:22,637
<i>aside from violating security protocols?</i>

831
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:54,707
People say AI will lead
to the extinction of humanity.

832
00:54:54,731 --> 00:54:57,342
Do you know that you're contributing to that?

833
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:09,341
This way, sir.

834
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:21,770
Mr. Shin. Do you remember what I said?

835
00:55:21,794 --> 00:55:24,091
Yes, I do.

836
00:55:36,395 --> 00:55:38,277
I heard there was an error.

837
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:39,531
How did it go?

838
00:55:39,555 --> 00:55:40,731
Rest assured.

839
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:42,965
The demonstration go on without a flaw.

840
00:56:03,658 --> 00:56:05,905
<i>The broker should be one of them.</i>

841
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:08,308
<i>How do you think he'll communicate
with the broker?</i>

842
00:56:08,332 --> 00:56:11,244
<i>Using his phone would be best.</i>

843
00:56:25,806 --> 00:56:29,828
He's taking photos and
writing articles all by himself.

844
00:56:29,852 --> 00:56:33,243
The working class are all suffering everywhere.

845
00:56:33,267 --> 00:56:35,327
You must have been having a hard time lately.

846
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:38,559
Why? Do you want to blame it on Mr. Shin again?

847
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:39,786
No I wasn't.

848
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:41,833
I'm just getting emotional watching that.

849
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,977
- Are you getting attached to us?
- That's disgusting!

850
00:56:44,689 --> 00:56:46,748
You're always thinking about nonsense.

851
00:56:56,033 --> 00:56:57,237
Hello.

852
00:56:57,261 --> 00:57:00,080
I am the CEO of JU Construction,
Hwang Se Woong.

853
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,428
Finally, the moment we've been
waiting for has arrived.

854
00:57:10,452 --> 00:57:12,291
I am proud to introduce…

855
00:57:12,315 --> 00:57:13,229
the innovative program…

856
00:57:13,253 --> 00:57:16,630
that will propel JU Construction
to become a leading…

857
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,706
global construction company.

858
00:57:20,817 --> 00:57:22,393
It is none other than J-BIMS.

859
00:57:38,476 --> 00:57:40,420
He left his phone behind.

860
00:57:48,266 --> 00:57:52,687
Hello. I am Lee Ji Hoon,
the lead developer of J-BIMS.

861
00:57:59,634 --> 00:58:02,896
J-BIMS automatically
calculates the amount of materials…

862
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,705
costs required and the duration needed
for a construction site.

863
00:58:05,729 --> 00:58:10,074
It has already achieved remarkable results
with its demo version.

864
00:58:10,098 --> 00:58:12,505
At the current progress rate of 60%,
we have successfully reduced…

865
00:58:12,529 --> 00:58:15,137
the total estimated construction cost
of 70 billion won by 2%.

866
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:18,043
Amounting to up to 1.4 billion won of savings.

867
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:23,577
At first glance, this figure
might seem insignificant.

868
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:28,414
But let's consider our annual average
order volume valued at 8 trillion won.

869
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,584
What does 2% of that makes?

870
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:33,079
It's 160 billion won.

871
00:58:44,112 --> 00:58:47,775
There are two elements that are necessary
on the path to reaching our goal.

872
00:58:47,799 --> 00:58:50,123
Passion and perseverance.

873
00:58:50,147 --> 00:58:53,987
While it's okay to take a break,
we must never stop moving forward.

874
00:58:54,011 --> 00:58:57,046
We proudly present the destination
of the journey we've embarked on.

875
00:58:57,070 --> 00:59:00,979
The fully completed J-BIMS.

876
00:59:01,003 --> 00:59:03,284
<i>[Five W's and one H]</i>

877
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:11,659
Who, when, where, what, how, and why.

878
00:59:11,683 --> 00:59:14,248
We refer to this as the 'Five Ws and One H.'

879
00:59:14,272 --> 00:59:19,616
Please remember this Five Ws and One H well.

880
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:24,716
It is the key keyword to experience
the fully completed J-BIMS.

881
00:59:25,891 --> 00:59:27,492
That I will introduce to you.

882
00:59:28,727 --> 00:59:30,500
Someone just accessed the cloud!

883
00:59:31,274 --> 00:59:33,165
<i>If you input the design blueprint like this…</i>

884
00:59:33,189 --> 00:59:37,230
<i>the system provides a 3D rendering
of the completed building.</i>

885
00:59:37,254 --> 00:59:40,646
Additionally, it calculates maintenance
information for the post-construction phase…

886
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,091
and supports VR functionality…

887
00:59:42,115 --> 00:59:43,863
offering a system that is…

888
00:59:54,443 --> 00:59:56,005
What are you doing!

889
01:00:11,764 --> 01:00:13,590
I have a question.

890
01:00:19,187 --> 01:00:20,601
<i>Here he goes again.</i>

891
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,402
What do you think…

892
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,340
are you doing?

893
01:01:05,677 --> 01:01:08,239
<i>[The Auditors]</i>

894
01:01:28,383 --> 01:01:32,657
<i>You are a broker who came to buy J-BIMS
that Lee Ji Hoon leaked.</i>

895
01:01:32,681 --> 01:01:35,195
<i>Is it okay for someone to do this
with no evidence?</i>

896
01:01:36,233 --> 01:01:39,483
<i>I am the CEO yet I am being
treated as a variable?</i>

897
01:01:39,507 --> 01:01:43,495
<i>J Construction.
It's obviously talking about our company.</i>

898
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:46,286
<i>This is weird. Why is it not here?</i>

899
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:47,990
<i>Of course I took the aptitude test.</i>

900
01:01:48,014 --> 01:01:49,388
<i>How would I pass if I didn't?</i>

901
01:01:49,412 --> 01:01:50,633
<i>But there was no record of it.</i>

902
01:01:50,657 --> 01:01:52,691
<i>Your asses will get fired soon.</i>

903
01:01:52,715 --> 01:01:54,279
<i>I will look forward to that.</i>

904
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,597
<i>If the media obtains evidence
of hiring corruptions first…</i>

905
01:01:56,621 --> 01:01:58,740
<i>the company will receive a bigger blow.</i>
