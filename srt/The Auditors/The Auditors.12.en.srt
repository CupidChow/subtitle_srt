00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:28,614
Hey!

3
00:01:30,204 --> 00:01:32,217
Pull yourself together.

4
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:33,497
Hey!

5
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:34,719
Hey!

6
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:44,359
Pull yourself together.

7
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:55,808
Head Choi! Hey!

8
00:02:01,274 --> 00:02:03,148
Hey! Pull yourself together.

9
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:10,122
Are you okay?

10
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:41,996
<i>[The Auditors]</i>

11
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:51,613
Hey.

12
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:53,037
Are you okay?

13
00:02:58,126 --> 00:03:00,005
What about you?

14
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:03,242
I'm not okay.

15
00:03:10,502 --> 00:03:12,951
Be patient. They're almost here.

16
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:17,023
What a brute.

17
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:23,295
He's breathed in too much smoke.

18
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,561
Oxygenate them right now and prepare albuterol.

19
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:26,731
Yes, sir.

20
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,338
You need to be treated.

21
00:03:37,362 --> 00:03:39,315
Excuse me, please check his condition.

22
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:40,679
This way, please.

23
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:06,905
Hey.

24
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:09,207
Is Mr. Shin okay?

25
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:11,878
He's being under treatment.

26
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:14,513
Are you okay?

27
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:16,406
I'm fine.

28
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,251
By the way, what happened?

29
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:24,895
Secret funds?

30
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,792
Mr. Shin is poking and prying to find it.

31
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:31,986
He even asked it to me.

32
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,637
You're not involved in it, right?

33
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:37,035
It's the money

34
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:39,938
Head Choi told me before.

35
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,908
That was when I realized
why Head Choi approached me.

36
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:49,013
It was a trap Hwang Se Woong set for me.

37
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:51,751
So I rushed recklessly to the funeral.

38
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:22,040
Damn it.

39
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:10,507
That is how it came to happen.

40
00:06:14,743 --> 00:06:17,459
Don't move. You need to relax.

41
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:19,282
How is the patient who came with me?

42
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:22,101
The prognosis is poor. He's still unconscious.

43
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,909
But your condition is also bad.

44
00:06:24,936 --> 00:06:26,083
Are you okay?

45
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:29,179
I'm fine.

46
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:30,918
No, you're not fine.

47
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:33,956
Please tell him.
It'll be serious if he moves like this.

48
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,598
Doctor. No one can wear him down.

49
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:37,823
Don't worry.

50
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:40,358
I won't hold the hospital responsible.

51
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:50,465
I should stop the cremation.

52
00:06:50,489 --> 00:06:52,571
If I fail
the proof to indicate murder will be gone.

53
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:53,999
Sir, there it is…

54
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,003
Stop them!

55
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:14,753
What are you doing?
Hurry up and move your car now.

56
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:22,194
<i>Hey… What's going on?</i>

57
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,500
We stop it.

58
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:32,944
<i>What?</i>

59
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:36,443
We're going to have cremation.
You're late.

60
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:38,077
We should conduct an autopsy.

61
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:41,247
The ex-president was murdered.

62
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:44,616
Mr. Shin. Why are you making a disturbance?

63
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:50,962
<i>Excuse me.</i>

64
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,486
What are you talking about?

65
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,827
Are you saying someone killed my husband?

66
00:08:57,189 --> 00:08:58,294
Are you out of your mind?

67
00:08:58,318 --> 00:09:00,432
No. Tell me.

68
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:03,102
Who killed my husband?

69
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:29,594
It's the vice president.

70
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:51,616
The ex-president passed away right after
the vice president visited the hospital.

71
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,191
What are you doing?

72
00:09:58,215 --> 00:10:02,394
To resolve suspicion
you should conduct an autopsy.

73
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:08,498
Conduct an autopsy.

74
00:10:08,522 --> 00:10:09,868
- Hey.
- Stop talking.

75
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:13,204
Conduct the autopsy right away.

76
00:10:23,514 --> 00:10:26,105
But how can we stop the cremation?

77
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:29,218
We should tell them
we're suspicious of the president.

78
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:30,589
They're not going to believe us

79
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:32,952
because we don't have strong evidence.

80
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:34,225
Then, what should we do?

81
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:41,699
I'll put you in a fix
saying you're a murder suspect.

82
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:45,011
What are you talking about?

83
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,351
It's just a bait.

84
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,659
That is too…

85
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:48,939
No.

86
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:51,009
You do that.

87
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:54,643
The sister-in-law will respond to your saying.

88
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:58,817
But promise me
that you will definitely capture Hwang Se Woong.

89
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:31,983
It's me who is under suspicion.

90
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:35,320
But your look looks much more serious.

91
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,603
Sir, are you okay?

92
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:55,941
Carry him to a hospital. Hurry up.

93
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:20,966
Lie down. The treatment hasn't ended.

94
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:24,665
Has the autopsy started?

95
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:26,099
It's started.

96
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:29,040
It's a high-profile case.
So they'll work on it quickly.

97
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:33,244
- How is Head Choi?
- He's still unconscious.

98
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:35,680
But the president…

99
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,784
He's moved Head Choi to Nasun General Hospital.

100
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,857
- Rest more.
- We don't have time.

101
00:12:46,676 --> 00:12:47,760
I need to meet with Head Choi.

102
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:49,056
No one except for his family
is allowed to visit.

103
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,175
You won't see his face
even though you go there.

104
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,980
I should meet his family.

105
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,264
Sir.

106
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,822
What's wrong with you?

107
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:59,070
Why do you risk your life on an audit?

108
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:01,372
It's a work

109
00:13:05,814 --> 00:13:08,147
that puts people's lives at stake.

110
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:12,818
Mr. Han Soo. Follow me.

111
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:16,655
Ms. Seo Jin. Investigate the scene of the fire.

112
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:37,476
It's burned to the ground.

113
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:40,277
There's nothing left we can use as evidence.

114
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:42,347
There's no CCTV around here.

115
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,716
Sir.

116
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,166
I'm also curious.

117
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,603
Why do you risk your life on an audit?

118
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,468
Excuse me.

119
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:36,835
I'm Goo Han Soo
a member of JU's Audit Team.

120
00:14:37,732 --> 00:14:39,557
Hello.

121
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:42,271
What brings you here?

122
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:44,424
How is your husband?

123
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,040
He breathed in a lot of smoke.

124
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:47,904
They said they needed to observe his condition

125
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,304
but he showed improvement.

126
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:52,848
That's a relief.

127
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:55,854
May I visit him?

128
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:04,996
You can't enter the room.

129
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:08,508
We're from JU's Audit Team.

130
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,767
We will just check Head Choi's condition.

131
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,005
Only his family can visit him.

132
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:25,517
I can't believe the ex-president was murdered.

133
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:30,650
I don't understand what's going on.

134
00:15:30,674 --> 00:15:32,894
I know you're innocent.

135
00:15:32,918 --> 00:15:34,185
Hey.

136
00:15:35,345 --> 00:15:36,378
Do you trust me?

137
00:15:38,744 --> 00:15:40,671
Well…

138
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:44,936
Definitely, I trust you.

139
00:15:53,196 --> 00:15:55,847
Leave us alone.

140
00:15:56,682 --> 00:15:57,715
Yes, sir.

141
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,429
You should

142
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:12,731
pull out of the Audit Team right now.

143
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:15,166
What?

144
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,601
Why are you saying it suddenly?

145
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,704
I'm so worried about you.

146
00:16:20,455 --> 00:16:23,444
Considering what happened
to Mr. Shin and Head Choi

147
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:25,676
there's a chance that you can be hurt.

148
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:28,163
I can't tolerate it.

149
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,515
Stay out of it
if you don't want to worry your mom.

150
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:33,435
Why don't I transfer you to another department?

151
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:37,489
I'll follow your words.

152
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:40,907
Thank you.

153
00:16:40,931 --> 00:16:43,194
But I'll transfer after finishing this work.

154
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:46,317
Hey…

155
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:51,883
Who are you guys?

156
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:55,400
I'll arrest you without a warrant on the charge
of murdering Mr. Hwang Geon Woong.

157
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:58,999
<i>You have the privilege against self-incrimination
and the right to a lawyer.</i>

158
00:16:59,023 --> 00:17:00,150
<i>Do you understand it?</i>

159
00:17:00,174 --> 00:17:02,280
- Take him.
- Yes, sir.

160
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:05,317
I understand

161
00:17:06,018 --> 00:17:07,385
so don't shackle me.

162
00:17:10,332 --> 00:17:11,456
Don't worry.

163
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:13,958
I'll be back soon.

164
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:26,471
Mr. Vice President was arrested.

165
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,371
As a result of the autopsy
they've found a circumstance of a murder.

166
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:31,115
They said they found a drug inside the body

167
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,345
and crucial evidence.

168
00:17:35,914 --> 00:17:37,349
What evidence?

169
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:40,352
I'll check it out.

170
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,487
Sir.

171
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:47,892
Please let me know.
What should I do now?

172
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:52,803
<i>Mr. Shin Cha Il.</i>

173
00:17:52,827 --> 00:17:56,325
The president has ordered you to transfer
to the Support Team right now.

174
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:58,336
What are you talking about?

175
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,305
<i>We'll carry your stuff.</i>

176
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:04,875
Mr. Han Soo.

177
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:11,282
Go to the purchasing department now
and secure the materials with Ms. Seo Jin.

178
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:13,417
Sir.

179
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:16,373
Let's go.

180
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,151
Let's go.

181
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,573
The president's office has already
retrieved everything.

182
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:44,566
<i>[Support Team]</i>

183
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:48,850
Sir.

184
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:52,090
We couldn't secure anything.

185
00:18:54,795 --> 00:18:56,027
What should we do now?

186
00:19:03,754 --> 00:19:04,935
Mr. Han Soo.

187
00:19:05,748 --> 00:19:06,871
Yes.

188
00:19:28,158 --> 00:19:30,862
This is your lighter, right?

189
00:19:31,696 --> 00:19:32,723
Yes.

190
00:19:32,747 --> 00:19:35,021
You said you didn't meet Hwang Geon Woong

191
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:37,646
but it was found in his hospital room.

192
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,043
Please explain it.

193
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:40,938
I don't know.

194
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:45,949
There was only your fingerprint on it.

195
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:47,865
Be straight with us.

196
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:52,414
<i>If you keep taking the Fifth
it'll be unfavorably applied to you.</i>

197
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:54,018
<i>Don't you still want to say anything?</i>

198
00:20:45,617 --> 00:20:46,502
<i>[Notice of general meeting of stockholders]</i>

199
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:48,511
<i>I heard the rumor
that he killed the ex-president.</i>

200
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:49,372
<i>Is it true?</i>

201
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:51,973
<i>I'm worried about
how the company is going to be.</i>

202
00:20:51,997 --> 00:20:53,711
The rumor that the vice president
was arrested could be true.

203
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:55,067
<i>Item about dismissing the vice president?</i>

204
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:57,887
I heard that he killed the ex-president.

205
00:20:57,911 --> 00:21:00,618
<i>It's too scary that I can't come to work.</i>

206
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:06,354
'He ruined the company's reputation severely'

207
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:09,226
'because he's under the suspicion of murder.'

208
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:16,863
Add that he played a part
in creating secret funds.

209
00:21:16,887 --> 00:21:17,767
What?

210
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,639
Everyone knows that
the vice president was close to Head Choi.

211
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:24,909
You're right.

212
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:27,908
- Deputy Director Yum.
- Yes, sir.

213
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:30,148
Inform the rest of the Audit Team.

214
00:21:31,371 --> 00:21:36,154
If they help Mr. Shin
the disadvantages will be considerable.

215
00:21:52,426 --> 00:21:56,174
You got it, right?
I told you.

216
00:22:00,845 --> 00:22:03,089
Don't risk your life on the company stuff.

217
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,297
It's good not to cause trouble.

218
00:22:06,321 --> 00:22:11,583
But if we accept disadvantages
it's okay to help Mr. Shin.

219
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:13,776
How could you interpret it like this?

220
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,756
I already think this is the last work
in this department.

221
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,162
Don't think it's your last work.

222
00:22:19,186 --> 00:22:21,981
I don't like to just wait and see.

223
00:22:22,005 --> 00:22:24,432
I'll support you as much as I can.

224
00:22:24,456 --> 00:22:26,835
You should stop them.

225
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:28,675
What about you?

226
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:30,908
- You won't help?
- I…

227
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,906
What am I supposed to do?

228
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,919
I don't know. Okay. Let's do it.

229
00:22:42,976 --> 00:22:47,057
I have something to report to Mr. Shin.
I'll be back.

230
00:22:51,992 --> 00:22:54,335
I passed your words to her.

231
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:57,404
But we haven't found the account book yet.

232
00:22:57,428 --> 00:23:00,138
Isn't it hard to arrest him without it?

233
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:04,509
It now depends on Head Choi.

234
00:23:06,982 --> 00:23:08,045
Sir.

235
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,616
Mr. Choi…

236
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,226
<i>I'll pronounce him dead.</i>

237
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:24,695
<i>Choi Joong Woo has passed away
on June 10th at 1:55 p.m.</i>

238
00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:39,777
They say Mr. Choi died.

239
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,313
I see.

240
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:52,882
Let's keep up the work.

241
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:54,065
Yes, sir.

242
00:24:21,365 --> 00:24:22,987
I've finished checking the data.

243
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:48,713
What do you want from me?

244
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:56,149
Make sure to investigate
the vice president fairly.

245
00:24:56,173 --> 00:24:57,655
Tell them right now.

246
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,702
What time is it now?
Why isn't Mr. Shin coming?

247
00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:15,746
If he's late, I should go inside…

248
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,679
He told you to do what the president ordered
until he would contact you.

249
00:25:19,703 --> 00:25:21,269
You should trust him.

250
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:24,813
Sir. Don't be nervous. You can do it.

251
00:25:24,837 --> 00:25:26,918
I really don't want to do this.

252
00:25:27,702 --> 00:25:29,693
Time's up. You should go.

253
00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:31,255
I know.

254
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:34,617
- Don't push me.
- I see.

255
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:37,161
- Don't push me.
- I didn't.

256
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:49,584
<i>[JU Construction
Extraordinary meeting of shareholders]</i>

257
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:52,143
- When on earth is he going to arrive?
- Are you okay?

258
00:25:57,158 --> 00:25:58,188
It's time to do this.

259
00:26:02,258 --> 00:26:03,421
Hello, everyone.

260
00:26:05,158 --> 00:26:08,411
Let's begin JU's extraordinary meeting
of shareholders.

261
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:13,898
President Hwang Se Woong
will explain today's item.

262
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:28,879
Hello. I'm Hwang Se Woong.

263
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,181
I'll explain the item right away.

264
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:36,184
Today's item is about to remove
the vice president from office.

265
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,380
Let's look at the screen.

266
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:42,841
<i>[The item about dismissing the vice president
Facing a charge of murdering the ex-president]</i>

267
00:26:44,294 --> 00:26:47,332
Vice President Hwang Dae Woong
was arrested without a warrant

268
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:50,067
on the charge of murdering his older brother.

269
00:26:50,091 --> 00:26:53,105
It ruined the company's reputation severely.

270
00:26:53,129 --> 00:26:56,036
It's an issue
that has yet to be brought to court.

271
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,539
Aren't you going too far?

272
00:26:57,563 --> 00:27:00,380
The fact that the news deals with it
and it's on everyone's lips severely

273
00:27:00,404 --> 00:27:02,283
hurts the company's image.

274
00:27:02,307 --> 00:27:06,650
And there's more trouble he caused.

275
00:27:10,618 --> 00:27:15,501
He tried to turn the directors
to his side with the secret funds

276
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:17,428
that Head Choi had created.

277
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:19,630
Director Yang, isn't it true?

278
00:27:22,731 --> 00:27:24,001
Well…

279
00:27:24,891 --> 00:27:30,935
He just called the directors to encourage them.

280
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:35,706
We just met to eat a meal.

281
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,469
And he didn't hand over money…

282
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:39,951
Everyone heard that, right?

283
00:27:40,735 --> 00:27:44,551
Like this, he embezzled the secret funds
and tried to use them as a bribe.

284
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:46,882
It's a serious malpractice.

285
00:27:46,906 --> 00:27:51,095
So, I propose his dismissal.

286
00:27:58,246 --> 00:27:59,754
Then, let's vote.

287
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,939
Please raise your hands
if you are in favor of it.

288
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:13,617
Announce the result.

289
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:16,772
All right.

290
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:20,491
According to the voting
I declare that

291
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:24,452
the item about the Vice President's resignation
has been passed.

292
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:29,395
We've finished the item.

293
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:30,901
Let's wrap it up.

294
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:41,011
Let me finish the extraordinary meeting
of shareholders.

295
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:45,816
Thank you for today.

296
00:28:48,616 --> 00:28:50,688
It's too early to finish it.

297
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,399
Do you expect me to be brought into custody?

298
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,015
What a shame.

299
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:20,482
The meeting has ended.

300
00:29:20,506 --> 00:29:21,683
And you're dismissed.

301
00:29:21,707 --> 00:29:25,247
I'm also a stockholder with 13% shares.

302
00:29:25,271 --> 00:29:28,392
We should deal with my item.

303
00:29:30,512 --> 00:29:33,314
Everyone, sit down quickly.

304
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,252
Don't close the door.

305
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:36,852
Someone will come in.

306
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:04,178
Mr. Shin isn't the Audit Team leader anymore.

307
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,661
He doesn't deserve to attend the meeting.
Don't you know it?

308
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:09,444
- He deserves to attend it.
- What?

309
00:30:09,468 --> 00:30:12,169
He's a witness
who will give an important testimony.

310
00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:15,306
Let's start.

311
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:24,233
The item is about dismissing someone
who embezzled money

312
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:27,894
took a bribe, and killed his brother

313
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:31,224
because he ruined the company's reputation.

314
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:35,025
This person is a total bastard.

315
00:30:36,055 --> 00:30:38,528
This kind of bastard should be dismissed.

316
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:41,332
- What do you think?
- Of course, you're right.

317
00:30:45,355 --> 00:30:48,172
I also propose

318
00:30:49,175 --> 00:30:51,524
dismissing the president
for the reasons mentioned above.

319
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:53,174
What are you talking about?

320
00:30:53,198 --> 00:30:57,407
I'm saying I'll dismiss you on the charge
of creating illegal secret funds

321
00:30:57,431 --> 00:31:01,183
malpractice, embezzlement

322
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:04,988
giving a bribe to a high-ranking official
and murder.

323
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:09,794
Can you prove it?

324
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,621
Do you believe that bullshit?

325
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:14,064
Of course, I can prove it.

326
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,534
That's why I've brought

327
00:31:17,716 --> 00:31:18,716
the witness here.

328
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,871
You can start.

329
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:24,040
Sit down.

330
00:31:31,342 --> 00:31:33,084
I'm Shin Cha Il, the Audit Team leader.

331
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:43,093
It's how Head Choi created
secret funds with the ex-president.

332
00:31:44,151 --> 00:31:48,363
And the Archcle has been operating
even after the ex-president fell.

333
00:31:48,387 --> 00:31:51,399
This means that secret funds
have been created since then.

334
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:54,456
- I guess Head Choi has created it.
- You're right.

335
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,474
But the real owner
who used it personally isn't him.

336
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,691
The funds of Archcle flowed to J-BIMS research
and the modular building development

337
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,668
of the Yulryeong factory.

338
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:11,655
These are the major businesses
Mr. President had pushed.

339
00:32:18,668 --> 00:32:22,465
Do you have proof that Archcle's funds
flowed to those two businesses?

340
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:26,803
The funds were laundered through various places.
So, it's hard to trace the funds.

341
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:30,821
So, you're saying
you don't have evidence, right?

342
00:32:42,034 --> 00:32:44,021
This is what Head Choi left.

343
00:32:46,947 --> 00:32:50,160
It contains the account book
and accounts showing the cash flow.

344
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:54,598
And this is the phone recording
with the president.

345
00:32:55,468 --> 00:32:58,965
We should re-create J-BIMS.
Send the money within this week.

346
00:32:58,989 --> 00:33:01,616
Send one billion won to the Yulryeong factory
under the name of research.

347
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,784
Give more work to the Archcle.

348
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:06,544
We need to make more funds. Hurry up.

349
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:10,647
Do you admit
that you've embezzled the secret funds?

350
00:33:11,714 --> 00:33:15,706
That's what the ex-president had created.

351
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,037
I just used them for the company.

352
00:33:18,061 --> 00:33:21,658
You're right.
The ex-president created the secret funds.

353
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:26,527
But you're the one who took care of them
after the ex-president fell.

354
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:28,265
I did.

355
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:31,257
You already said it.

356
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:35,649
Those funds were used for J-BIMS
and modular building development.

357
00:33:35,673 --> 00:33:38,370
I used them all only for the company.

358
00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:39,735
Isn't it a problem?

359
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,109
What a bullshit.
That's a malpractice.

360
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:43,368
Malpractice?

361
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:45,746
Have you found proof that I used them privately?

362
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,115
- That doesn't matter.
- What are you talking about?

363
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:52,990
A court ruled that creating secret funds
and using them for a company isn't malpractice.

364
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:56,393
Even the court judged that it wasn't a crime.
Why are you saying it's a crime?

365
00:33:58,392 --> 00:33:59,393
Is it true?

366
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:02,132
It's true. There is that kind of precedent.

367
00:34:03,816 --> 00:34:05,802
Do you dismiss me

368
00:34:07,443 --> 00:34:08,963
because I worked hard for the company?

369
00:34:13,586 --> 00:34:16,046
You didn't use the money only for the company.

370
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:18,554
What did you say?

371
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:22,846
President Hwang Se Woong
recently ordered his staff

372
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,940
to send me a gift.

373
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:30,091
I swear to my son.

374
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:35,796
I received it because I thought it was a gift
of less than 30,000 won.

375
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,967
But I checked it yesterday.
I found cash in the box

376
00:34:39,991 --> 00:34:43,344
so I voluntarily reported it to the Ministry
of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport.

377
00:34:43,368 --> 00:34:46,346
I'll accuse President Hwang Se Woong

378
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:50,628
of deceiving me and bribing me.

379
00:34:50,652 --> 00:34:55,881
As of today, I will cooperate
with all the investigations

380
00:34:55,905 --> 00:35:01,155
will not show any leniency

381
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:05,259
to those who do this kind of heinous crime.

382
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:07,895
How could you persuade Undersecretary Ahn?

383
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:12,203
Head Choi recorded
whenever he delivered a bribe.

384
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:14,802
It's three six-figure papers.
I look forward to your kind cooperation.

385
00:35:14,826 --> 00:35:16,039
Put it on the trunk.

386
00:35:19,145 --> 00:35:21,415
And there's more.

387
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:23,411
- There's more?
- Yes.

388
00:35:23,435 --> 00:35:24,715
You will wait and see.

389
00:35:26,653 --> 00:35:29,085
It was to remove
the regulations on the modular building.

390
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:31,306
Once again

391
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:34,112
it was all for the company.

392
00:35:34,136 --> 00:35:37,634
If I could remove the regulations
it would be good for the company.

393
00:35:37,658 --> 00:35:39,955
No, for the entire construction industry.

394
00:35:39,979 --> 00:35:42,466
Who can swear to me?

395
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:50,392
<i>He told me to investigate
the contract of Cheongon Sports Complex.</i>

396
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:53,410
<i>He must've wanted
to keep the vice president in check.</i>

397
00:35:56,261 --> 00:35:58,391
He didn't hesitate to damage the company

398
00:35:58,415 --> 00:36:00,975
in order to dismiss the vice president
and take over the company.

399
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:04,020
It's the malpractice.

400
00:36:06,462 --> 00:36:09,321
The company's future will be dark
if he becomes the president.

401
00:36:09,345 --> 00:36:12,162
So, it's natural to remove him
like a cockroach.

402
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:14,197
Don't you think so?

403
00:36:24,694 --> 00:36:25,809
All of you are idiots.

404
00:36:27,494 --> 00:36:29,913
You don't know what is right.

405
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,728
- Mr. Hwang Se Woong.
- What?

406
00:36:32,752 --> 00:36:35,416
Do you want me to wait here to be dismissed?

407
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,987
I don't care. So do whatever you want.

408
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:40,156
This isn't all you did.

409
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:44,593
- What?
- I told you.

410
00:36:44,617 --> 00:36:46,334
It's the same standard.

411
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:47,597
You…

412
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,001
You killed a person.

413
00:36:56,608 --> 00:37:00,944
Are you even trying to entrap me?

414
00:37:42,278 --> 00:37:44,512
What happened?

415
00:37:44,536 --> 00:37:46,604
Explain what this is.

416
00:37:46,628 --> 00:37:49,860
I'll explain it.

417
00:38:09,058 --> 00:38:13,447
He tried to kill Mr. Shin and me

418
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:16,586
when the Audit Team found out
about the secret funds.

419
00:38:17,737 --> 00:38:18,762
Hey.

420
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,806
<i>But Head Choi and I didn't die.</i>

421
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:30,051
He tried to kill Head Choi again
when he heard Head Choi was on the mend.

422
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:35,238
Mr. Shin warned me that you would kill me.

423
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:37,701
<i>You must be prepared.</i>

424
00:38:37,725 --> 00:38:40,443
<i>I'm sure he'll try to kill you.</i>

425
00:38:42,935 --> 00:38:44,219
<i>So I made a plan.</i>

426
00:38:44,243 --> 00:38:46,249
They said my husband was on the mend.

427
00:39:10,075 --> 00:39:13,289
I pretended I was dead by persuading the doctor

428
00:39:13,313 --> 00:39:17,577
and my wife and gave a USB to the Audit Team

429
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:19,749
with the hope that you'd be punished.

430
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:22,200
Confess everything now.

431
00:39:22,224 --> 00:39:25,653
Confess? What is he saying?

432
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:28,570
This wasn't his first time
trying to kill someone.

433
00:39:28,594 --> 00:39:32,262
He killed a person in the same way.

434
00:39:33,922 --> 00:39:35,465
The ex-president.

435
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:41,662
Are you crazy?

436
00:39:41,686 --> 00:39:46,643
On June 4th night, he was at the hospital
earlier than the vice president.

437
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:54,181
<i>After the vice president left
he secretly entered the room</i>

438
00:39:54,205 --> 00:39:56,953
<i>by avoiding CCTVs.</i>

439
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:30,987
<i>That was how he killed the ex-president
and escaped the room.</i>

440
00:40:33,691 --> 00:40:35,931
It's the syringe that we found
at the president's office.

441
00:40:36,885 --> 00:40:39,693
<i>Hello, sir. The president is absent now.</i>

442
00:40:39,717 --> 00:40:42,599
<i>I left something inside.
It won't take long to find it.</i>

443
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:22,305
The drug in the ex-president's body is the same
as that found in Head Choi's body.

444
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:28,878
You'll be accused of bribing
attempted murder, and murder.

445
00:41:33,209 --> 00:41:35,285
How could you kill your brother?

446
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:52,735
You're finished.

447
00:41:58,023 --> 00:42:00,610
You got slammed at the last stage.

448
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:02,879
Sir!

449
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,983
It's what he asked for.

450
00:42:08,463 --> 00:42:10,053
Brother asked for all this trouble.

451
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:40,216
I have a question.

452
00:42:42,013 --> 00:42:44,121
Why did you hire me?

453
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:52,967
<i>[JU Construction
President Hwang Se Woong]</i>

454
00:42:56,392 --> 00:43:00,156
I'll even audit you. Is it okay?

455
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,507
I don't care if it's necessary

456
00:43:04,878 --> 00:43:06,142
to develop JU.

457
00:43:07,565 --> 00:43:11,280
I wanted to make the company

458
00:43:12,872 --> 00:43:15,218
fair and righteous.

459
00:43:16,472 --> 00:43:19,489
But corruption was rampant.

460
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:22,692
I should be evil

461
00:43:24,198 --> 00:43:26,496
to fight against evil.

462
00:43:29,512 --> 00:43:31,602
Isn't it your faith?

463
00:43:35,568 --> 00:43:36,940
That's why I did all of it.

464
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:45,148
It's sophistry.

465
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,186
In any language, you're the most corrupt guy.

466
00:43:51,778 --> 00:43:55,225
You have no choice

467
00:43:56,798 --> 00:43:58,962
but to wait for the punishment.

468
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,205
Mr. Hwang Se Woong.

469
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:08,941
I'll arrest you on the charges of attempted murder
murder, and bribing a high-ranking official.

470
00:44:08,965 --> 00:44:12,209
<i>You can take the Fifth
and have the right to a lawyer.</i>

471
00:44:15,123 --> 00:44:16,123
Take him.

472
00:44:49,046 --> 00:44:50,847
<i>What? Look at that.</i>

473
00:44:51,706 --> 00:44:53,481
<i>That's the new JU's president.</i>

474
00:44:53,505 --> 00:44:55,166
<i>I hope there won't be any trouble.</i>

475
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,750
<i>[Hwang Dae Woong takes JU's office as president.
He's announced a new road map to overcome a crisis]</i>

476
00:44:57,774 --> 00:44:58,116
<i>[President Hwang Dae Woong]</i>

477
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:02,196
<i>I'm really happy today, sir.</i>

478
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,238
<i>I want to act frivolously.</i>

479
00:45:04,262 --> 00:45:06,329
President Hwang Dae Woong!

480
00:45:07,699 --> 00:45:09,606
President Hwang Dae Woong!

481
00:45:13,326 --> 00:45:15,556
Congratulations!

482
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,116
I'm happier than
when my son was accepted to my university.

483
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,109
Because that was my son's life

484
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:25,375
but your promotion is related to my life.

485
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:28,033
I'm so happy.

486
00:45:28,057 --> 00:45:32,131
By the way
the vice president position is vacant.

487
00:45:32,155 --> 00:45:33,973
Someone will…

488
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:38,995
I remember someone was suspicious
that I was a murderer.

489
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:41,731
It was you, right?

490
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:46,600
Me? No. That's a total nonsense.

491
00:45:46,624 --> 00:45:49,639
You hesitated to tell me that you trust me.

492
00:45:50,723 --> 00:45:55,363
Frankly, I was surrounded by dark fog.

493
00:45:55,387 --> 00:45:59,823
I had no slightest idea
of what would happen next.

494
00:45:59,847 --> 00:46:03,916
But I didn't release my grip
on the rope of hope

495
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,089
and endured the hardship
in order to be next to you.

496
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:09,459
Your loyalty is short of being a vice president.

497
00:46:10,306 --> 00:46:13,894
I've been loyal to you for over 30 years.

498
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:16,441
We've spent 30 years together.

499
00:46:16,465 --> 00:46:18,769
This much is enough.

500
00:46:24,021 --> 00:46:26,818
You must be tired. Have a drink.

501
00:46:26,842 --> 00:46:28,192
Thank you.

502
00:46:28,216 --> 00:46:29,432
Nice.

503
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:31,011
What? It isn't coffee.

504
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:32,764
We've drank too much coffee recently.

505
00:46:32,788 --> 00:46:34,271
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

506
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:36,072
It's a lemon tea.

507
00:46:36,096 --> 00:46:38,051
It's good.

508
00:46:38,075 --> 00:46:39,286
Did you make it yourself?

509
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:43,457
I don't have time to wash
and slice it with great care.

510
00:46:43,481 --> 00:46:44,767
So, I bought it.

511
00:46:46,153 --> 00:46:47,995
It's so refreshing.

512
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:51,301
Our life has been eventful.
I don't want to go through it again.

513
00:46:52,124 --> 00:46:53,184
Seo Jin.

514
00:46:54,177 --> 00:46:55,177
Take care of me.

515
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:57,671
It's not me who got promoted.

516
00:46:57,695 --> 00:47:00,301
Why are you buttering her up?
She's not the president.

517
00:47:00,325 --> 00:47:02,646
- Please take care of me.
- What?

518
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,684
Sir. This is for you.

519
00:47:12,717 --> 00:47:13,790
Let's have a meeting.

520
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:17,184
Right.

521
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:19,829
- Let's go.
- Yes.

522
00:47:19,853 --> 00:47:24,154
The expenditure
and the agreed contract sum matched.

523
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:26,712
There's no issue on the documents.

524
00:47:26,736 --> 00:47:29,157
Thank you. Let's wrap it up.

525
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:32,778
Sir. We've handled so much work.

526
00:47:32,802 --> 00:47:35,709
Why don't we have a staff dinner
to get rid of stress?

527
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:37,281
That's a good idea.

528
00:47:37,305 --> 00:47:40,414
We haven't yet thrown
a welcoming party for you.

529
00:47:40,438 --> 00:47:42,749
I'm up for it.

530
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:45,021
I'm definitely up for it.

531
00:47:49,254 --> 00:47:50,360
Okay.

532
00:48:04,527 --> 00:48:08,944
You came here to feel
a sense of superiority by looking at me.

533
00:48:16,284 --> 00:48:18,318
- Be straight with me.
- What?

534
00:48:18,342 --> 00:48:21,657
Brother fell a year ago.

535
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:24,727
Were you really not involved in it?

536
00:48:26,474 --> 00:48:28,931
- Why do you want to know that?
- Tell me.

537
00:48:39,832 --> 00:48:41,344
That was an accident.

538
00:48:47,738 --> 00:48:50,298
<i>[A year ago]</i>

539
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,026
What brings you here?

540
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,437
Why did you promote Dae Woong to an executive?

541
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:14,025
We agreed to dispatch him to a regional branch.

542
00:49:14,049 --> 00:49:15,228
You're right.

543
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:19,595
But I entrusted him with some work.
He picked up on things and learned quickly.

544
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:21,840
He'll work his ass off for me.

545
00:49:21,864 --> 00:49:24,954
It's because he's been reading
people's minds since he was young.

546
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:27,549
Don't you know he's lobbying secretly?

547
00:49:27,573 --> 00:49:28,927
He's corrupt.

548
00:49:28,951 --> 00:49:31,867
Lobbying is a practice to run a company.

549
00:49:31,891 --> 00:49:34,460
You just pretend to be incorrupt
and can't do anything.

550
00:49:34,484 --> 00:49:35,705
He's better than you.

551
00:49:35,729 --> 00:49:36,900
Is that why

552
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:39,636
you will use the secret funds?

553
00:49:40,767 --> 00:49:43,061
- What?
- Do you think I don't know it?

554
00:49:43,085 --> 00:49:44,811
The Archcle Design.

555
00:49:44,835 --> 00:49:48,193
It's a shell company
you created to make secret funds.

556
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:51,478
Do you plan to increase your shares
by using those funds?

557
00:49:51,502 --> 00:49:55,182
You might not know
but the president needs black money.

558
00:49:55,206 --> 00:49:59,322
You don't deserve that position.
You took it because you're older than me.

559
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,593
Come on.

560
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,265
You must've mistaken it.

561
00:50:12,404 --> 00:50:13,536
Hey.

562
00:50:15,051 --> 00:50:17,752
It's not because you're the second son.

563
00:50:17,776 --> 00:50:21,806
Dad told me that you're like a snake.

564
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:25,648
He said you were so wicked and unfathomable.

565
00:50:26,495 --> 00:50:28,384
He was afraid of having you near him.

566
00:50:30,689 --> 00:50:34,757
You were dumped by Dad, too.

567
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,677
What is it?

568
00:51:02,264 --> 00:51:04,488
Hey.

569
00:51:04,512 --> 00:51:06,355
<i>Come on.</i>

570
00:51:07,191 --> 00:51:08,525
<i>Why do I feel so dizzy?</i>

571
00:51:09,497 --> 00:51:11,160
Come on.

572
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:13,242
<i>Hey.</i>

573
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:20,102
<i>I feel so dizzy.</i>

574
00:51:24,056 --> 00:51:27,109
It's weird. I feel so dizzy.

575
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,827
It's hard, so do not resist.

576
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:47,510
I'll take care of everything.

577
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:51,400
I'll change everything, including the company.

578
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:54,136
So…

579
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,905
Do not resist.

580
00:52:25,086 --> 00:52:26,669
That was an accident.

581
00:52:29,506 --> 00:52:31,507
That was…

582
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:33,742
an inevitable accident.

583
00:53:10,376 --> 00:53:13,632
You look a bit more obedient.

584
00:53:13,656 --> 00:53:15,351
Is it because I've become the president?

585
00:53:18,249 --> 00:53:21,190
You don't know how to take a joke.

586
00:53:25,236 --> 00:53:26,829
I didn't know you were joking.

587
00:53:29,649 --> 00:53:32,501
The Audit Team is under my immediate control.

588
00:53:33,496 --> 00:53:35,571
That'll be a lot of work
and we should cooperate.

589
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,363
<i>[Letter of resignation]</i>

590
00:53:47,387 --> 00:53:48,637
What is it?

591
00:53:50,031 --> 00:53:52,187
Are you quitting your job
because I'm the president?

592
00:53:52,211 --> 00:53:53,211
No.

593
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:56,714
- My job here has ended.
- No.

594
00:53:56,738 --> 00:53:58,805
Your job hasn't ended yet.

595
00:53:58,829 --> 00:54:01,630
So, work for me at least one more year.

596
00:54:04,956 --> 00:54:07,329
I know how much you love the company.

597
00:54:07,353 --> 00:54:10,858
But your way is a bit dangerous and aggressive.

598
00:54:10,882 --> 00:54:12,405
Keep it in mind.

599
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:15,641
I want to see your arrogant attitude more.

600
00:54:15,665 --> 00:54:16,879
I'll go.

601
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:00,536
- Won't you drink?
- No.

602
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,025
I have always wondered

603
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:06,319
if it is your normal way of speaking.

604
00:55:06,343 --> 00:55:07,841
Right.

605
00:55:07,865 --> 00:55:10,487
You're always using the honorific.

606
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:13,549
It's challenging to be close to you
and I feel so distant.

607
00:55:13,573 --> 00:55:15,838
You are doing it on purpose, right?

608
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:19,642
It's my normal way of speaking.

609
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,086
I was joking.

610
00:55:36,247 --> 00:55:37,860
You're speaking like a robot.

611
00:55:38,953 --> 00:55:43,196
Sir. Let's have this kind of time often.
Isn't it good?

612
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,292
Right.

613
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:48,704
I have something to say to you.

614
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:55,678
I've submitted a letter of resignation
to the president today.

615
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:00,282
I'll resign from the Audit Team leader
as of today.

616
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:04,584
Today is the last day?

617
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:07,734
So, this is your farewell party.

618
00:56:07,758 --> 00:56:09,722
Will you work for another company?

619
00:56:09,746 --> 00:56:11,469
I have no plans yet.

620
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,744
Then, why don't you lead us more?

621
00:56:14,768 --> 00:56:17,032
I still have lots to learn from you.

622
00:56:20,144 --> 00:56:24,940
You've done your parts well.

623
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:30,088
Thank you for your hard work.

624
00:56:30,112 --> 00:56:31,447
Thank you.

625
00:56:37,534 --> 00:56:39,632
Don't be sad.

626
00:56:39,656 --> 00:56:41,192
Let's make a toast.
Shall we?

627
00:56:41,216 --> 00:56:43,189
Okay. Let's make a toast.

628
00:56:43,213 --> 00:56:45,106
What chant should we do?

629
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:46,763
I'll audit you.

630
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:48,764
What do you say?

631
00:56:48,788 --> 00:56:50,309
Okay. Let's go.

632
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:52,350
One, two, three.

633
00:56:52,374 --> 00:56:54,270
- I'll audit you.
- I'll audit you.

634
00:56:54,294 --> 00:56:55,705
Thank you for all you've done.

635
00:56:59,251 --> 00:57:00,764
You've gone through a lot of things.

636
00:57:01,471 --> 00:57:02,791
I'm sorry for not being obedient.

637
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:17,326
I'll walk you along until you get in a car.

638
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:24,967
Do you think

639
00:57:26,299 --> 00:57:27,870
I can pull it off?

640
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:35,277
Do you remember you asked me
why I risked my life on an audit?

641
00:57:39,384 --> 00:57:43,119
It was when I was a rookie on an Audit Team.

642
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:48,874
I found out that the purchasing amount
didn't match the payment.

643
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:49,881
Rebar?

644
00:57:49,905 --> 00:57:53,408
I checked the audit report
for purchasing building materials.

645
00:57:53,432 --> 00:57:56,421
The actual purchase cost is worth 300 tons.

646
00:57:56,445 --> 00:57:59,065
Why did we pay the money
worth of 420 tons of rebar?

647
00:57:59,089 --> 00:58:02,970
Do you think I turned a blind eye to siphoning
after taking a bribe?

648
00:58:02,994 --> 00:58:03,553
No, I mean…

649
00:58:03,577 --> 00:58:05,985
Do you worry that the building under construction
will collapse due to a shortage of rebar?

650
00:58:06,009 --> 00:58:07,609
That's not what I mean.

651
00:58:09,054 --> 00:58:10,179
Let's return to work.

652
00:58:10,203 --> 00:58:13,149
I just believed his suspicious explanation.

653
00:58:14,221 --> 00:58:15,221
No.

654
00:58:15,928 --> 00:58:18,821
I just didn't want to cause any trouble.

655
00:58:20,274 --> 00:58:23,292
He's the same Audit Team member.
I should trust him.

656
00:58:24,374 --> 00:58:26,795
A construction site collapsed?
Where is it?

657
00:58:28,154 --> 00:58:29,163
Dad…

658
00:58:37,465 --> 00:58:39,238

What's wrong with it?

661
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,516
Everyone will die.

662
00:59:15,684 --> 00:59:16,811

663
00:59:18,017 --> 00:59:19,692

665
00:59:23,071 --> 00:59:26,454

as much as other families did for their kids.

you got hired by a large company.</i>

669
00:59:44,048 --> 00:59:45,864
Please help me.

That was when

674
01:00:07,378 --> 01:00:12,701
I realized that people's lives
depend on the result of auditing.

675
01:00:33,034 --> 01:00:37,792
I also hope that a world
where we can trust people will come.

676
01:00:40,777 --> 01:00:42,031
Until that day comes

677
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:46,368
try to maintain a disinterested stance.

678
01:00:50,554 --> 01:00:52,608
- I'll go.
- Sir.

679
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:55,710

What's the matter suddenly?

683
01:01:59,017 --> 01:02:00,679
Do you want to have an interview here?

684
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,003
What?

685
01:02:20,017 --> 01:02:22,967
It's the details of the usage
of your company card.

686
01:02:22,991 --> 01:02:26,968
Do you admit that you used it privately?

687
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:36,133
Don't you think he's changed?

688
01:02:36,157 --> 01:02:38,411
Yes. Absolutely.

689
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:42,222
He must think he's Mr. Goo Cha Il.

690
01:02:42,246 --> 01:02:44,567
I feel the same way.

691
01:02:44,591 --> 01:02:48,813
It feels like Mr. Shin is still our leader.

01:02:48,837 --> 01:02:50,125
'Let's have a meeting.'

693
01:02:52,843 --> 01:02:54,615
When will the new leader come?

694
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:57,863
I'm sure of one thing.

695
01:02:57,887 --> 01:02:58,604
What is it?

696
01:02:58,628 --> 01:03:02,385
That position isn't yours.

697
01:03:02,409 --> 01:03:05,572
I'm okay. I'm not greedy.

698
01:03:05,596 --> 01:03:06,739
Really?

699
01:03:06,763 --> 01:03:08,076
Of course.

700
01:03:09,722 --> 01:03:13,439
Anyway, I'm wondering
if Seo Jin is doing well or not.

701
01:03:13,463 --> 01:03:18,084
You don't need to worry about her.
She's so smart that she will do her part.

01:03:55,048 --> 01:03:56,528
How's the work in the new department?

713
01:03:58,943 --> 01:04:00,028
It's fun.

714
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:05,268
It's worthwhile
to construct a building for people.

715
01:04:05,292 --> 01:04:08,503
I was so sad when you said
you would transfer to another department.

716
01:04:08,527 --> 01:04:11,039
I'm so glad that you like working there.

717
01:04:12,757 --> 01:04:14,907
I know that a new Audit Team leader is assigned.

718
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:17,404
Your team will clear the deck.

719
01:04:17,428 --> 01:04:18,804
You're right.

720
01:04:18,828 --> 01:04:20,081
I'll work hard.

721
01:04:21,323 --> 01:04:24,068
The recruit notice for the Flordia branch is up.

722
01:04:24,092 --> 01:04:25,386
Have you applied?

723
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,335
Here's the food.

724
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:40,199
It looks much tastier today.

725
01:04:40,223 --> 01:04:42,226
Isn't it a sumptuous feast?

726
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:45,376
After hearing he'd become president
I wanted to cook it for him.

727
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,140
Enjoy it.

728
01:04:46,164 --> 01:04:50,042
Amazing!
It's super delicious.

729
01:04:50,066 --> 01:04:53,680
You should open a restaurant near the company.

730
01:04:53,704 --> 01:04:54,782
I'll visit every day.

731
01:04:54,806 --> 01:04:57,049
If so, I can also be a president.

732
01:04:57,073 --> 01:04:58,269
You're right.

733
01:04:58,293 --> 01:04:59,657
What?

734
01:04:59,681 --> 01:05:03,356
If Mom also becomes a president
I feel left out.

735
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:08,860
The only thing you should do
is assist your two presidents.

736
01:05:08,884 --> 01:05:10,031
You got it?

737
01:05:10,055 --> 01:05:11,958
Yes, sir. I'll work hard.

738
01:05:11,982 --> 01:05:13,198
Nice.

739
01:05:13,222 --> 01:05:15,360
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.

740
01:05:15,384 --> 01:05:18,176
You're treating me differently
when I become the president.

741
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,241
There are various ingredients.

742
01:05:21,067 --> 01:05:22,408
It's to celebrate my promotion.

743
01:05:22,432 --> 01:05:24,218
Should I look for where I'll open a restaurant?

744
01:05:24,242 --> 01:05:26,097
- I'll look for a good place.
- Really?

745
01:05:34,954 --> 01:05:36,090
Hey.

746
01:05:36,854 --> 01:05:38,638
You're not allowed to embezzle money at home.

747
01:05:38,662 --> 01:05:39,760
What?

748
01:05:39,784 --> 01:05:42,194
Don't steal money.

749
01:05:42,218 --> 01:05:45,121
- Mom. Here you are.
- Thank you.

750
01:05:45,145 --> 01:05:46,568
You've changed.

751
01:05:46,592 --> 01:05:47,896
I haven't changed at all.

752
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,901
You're a betrayer.

753
01:05:48,925 --> 01:05:50,858
You're the one who needs to change.

754
01:05:50,882 --> 01:05:53,700
- I can't be cutter than now.
- What?

755
01:05:53,724 --> 01:05:55,410
You still don't get it?

756
01:05:56,694 --> 01:05:58,254
You still have no idea what's going on.

757
01:07:10,471 --> 01:07:11,786
Mr. Shin Cha Il.

758
01:07:15,444 --> 01:07:16,591
Who are you?

759
01:07:25,492 --> 01:07:27,669
I'm Kim Si Hyun, and I'm working there.

760
01:07:29,031 --> 01:07:31,472
You've captured a lot of corrupt people.

761
01:07:32,905 --> 01:07:35,143
Let's capture a big one with me.

762
01:07:39,459 --> 01:07:43,619
<i>[Director of the Board of Audit and Inspection
Kim Si Hyun]</i>

763
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:57,203
<i>[The Auditors]</i>
