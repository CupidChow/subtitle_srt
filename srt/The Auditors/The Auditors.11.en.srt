I guess the ex-president created it.

He already passed away.

44
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,745
It's no use to investigate
the deceased's weak point.

45
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:41,254
The more serious issue is that the shell company
has been operating since he fell

46
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:43,959
and has created secret funds.

47
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:48,261
Do you mean that someone took over it from him?

48
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:51,600
And the ex-president was on the mend
but suddenly passed away.

What are you suspicious of?

50

Someone hid secret funds
and has kept embezzled.

51
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:05,982
I'm saying the one could've killed
the ex-president to hide his sin.

Did the one really do that?

No. It's not a strong proof.

60
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:35,744
Then, I'll persuade them to conduct an autopsy.

00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:42,484

70
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:14,590
It'll be helpful to have the sentence commuted.
What do you think?

71
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:33,731
Is the Archcle you want to know?

72
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:37,240
Isn't it the secret funds source
of the ex-president?

73
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:39,975
Yes, it is.

74
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:43,561
Only a few know it

75
00:07:44,354 --> 00:07:46,234
because the ex-president
did thoroughly hide it.

76
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:51,737
The Archcle was operated even after he fell.

77
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:53,494
Isn't it obvious?

78
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:59,228
The one who took the company
and secret funds must've kept operating it.

79
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:02,985
Hwang Geon Woong must be upset
if he regains his consciousness.

80

It's a serious issue.

83
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:13,674
Please tell me.

84
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:15,478
Who's the new owner?

85
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:18,847
I don't know.

86
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:24,386
Being curious about what the owner is doing

87
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:27,956
makes it hard to maintain the position.

88
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,818
That's not a helpful answer.

89
00:08:31,842 --> 00:08:33,629
There might be a person who keeps a safe.

90
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:40,636
There was a rumor that the ex-president
hired someone to keep a safe.

91
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:43,205
Don't you know who it is?

92
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:45,107
I don't know, but…

93
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:47,998
The one must be his surrounding person.

94
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:55,084
- I see.
- You must've smelled a rat.

95
00:08:56,555 --> 00:09:00,189
Only two people can intercept the Archcle

96
00:09:01,655 --> 00:09:03,358
and secret funds in the company.

97
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:06,529

Let's have a meeting.

99
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:45,401
I want to say one thing
before starting the meeting.

100
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:50,172
Secrecy is necessary for this audit.

101
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:55,310
Can you agree to keep a secret rigidly?

102
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,196
Of course. I'll keep it.

103
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,187
Don't betray your colleague's trust
for the closeness with your acquaintance.

104
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:13,041
By the way, who's the target this time?

105
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:16,098
I'll catch a bad guy

106
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:19,268
who's been extorting JU Construction
for a long time.

107
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:29,987
These architectural firms
which have worked with us for the past six years

108
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:33,611
have started mapping out
elevations with Archcle.

109
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:36,887
Archcle is an architecture firm in Florida

110
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:40,278
and its CEO is Architect Benjamin Lee.

111
00:10:40,302 --> 00:10:43,221
I heard we've entrusted mapping out elevations

112
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:46,596
with a famous foreign architecture firm
to raise the construction's value.

113
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,581
Archcle's total sales during the past six years
is over four billion won.

114
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:55,853
All the sales were from contracts with us.

115
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:57,881
Is it possible?

116
00:10:57,905 --> 00:11:01,810
Yes. Archcle is a shell company.

117
00:11:03,715 --> 00:11:06,748
The ex-president established it
to create secret funds.

118
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:14,464
I can't believe it…

119
00:11:14,488 --> 00:11:19,662
Even since the ex-president fell
the relationship with Archcle hasn't stopped.

120
00:11:20,492 --> 00:11:25,175
Someone intercepted secret funds
and kept embezzling.

121
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:30,391
Are you saying that it has to do
with the death of the ex-president?

122
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,687
I think you're going too far.

123
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:37,043
We'll investigate this Archcle from now on.

124
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,986
But isn't it located in the United States?

125
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,226
Chief Ok.

126
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,671
I know an ex-Audit Team member
is in the Florida branch.

127
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:46,489
That's Chief Song.

128
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:50,160
I'll ask Chief Song for help.

129
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:53,793
I'll visit these architecture firms
with Mr. Han Soo and Ms. Seo Jin.

130
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:55,697
Try your best to get
as much information as possible.

131
00:11:55,721 --> 00:12:00,327
We should find a point of contact
between Archcle and JC Construction.

132
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:01,937
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,001
What should I do?

134
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:09,170
I have a special request for you.

135
00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:10,794
What?

136
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:13,142
We only have four days left.

137
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,869
Let's hurry up.

138
00:12:14,893 --> 00:12:16,351
Yes, sir.

139
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:27,798
How is it going with the board of directors?

140
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:32,965
They're focusing on
who's going to take the shares.

141
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:38,979
They seem to think Mr. President will
take the ex-president's shares.

142
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:41,725
Sister-in-law will never be on my side.

143
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:45,452
The winner of the battle depends
on Mr. Bang's decision.

144
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:50,836
If the board of directors supports you

145
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,176
it's not easy for Mr. Bang
to go against the trend.

146
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,458
Okay.

147
00:12:56,482 --> 00:12:58,622
The directors will come to the funeral, right?

148
00:12:58,646 --> 00:12:59,816
Of course.

149
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,431
- Tell them to meet in the evening.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:08,012
Come on.

His name is Chae Jong Woo.

152

Yes, I know him well.

154
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:25,235

word has spread that he's a talented worker.

156
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:35,995
Buckle down and work hard for him.

157
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:40,002
He'll be a president soon.

158
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:43,164

169
00:14:33,777 --> 00:14:35,688
The design plan wasn't bad.

170
00:14:35,712 --> 00:14:38,703
Even though the design didn't look
like the one by a veteran

171
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:40,035
it was refreshing.

172
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:42,662
I thought the design cost was quite high.

173
00:14:42,686 --> 00:14:47,775
But JC strongly demanded it, saying that
it was to raise the value of the building.

174
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,202
I couldn't refuse it.

175
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:51,372
Did they work hard to draw the design?

176
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:54,457
Of course.
One day, they even sent several designs.

177
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:58,980
But it was weird
that they didn't accept the feedback.

178
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:05,401
They told me to modify it if I wanted.

179
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:07,568
That wasn't a normal reply.

180
00:15:07,592 --> 00:15:12,332
They didn't even complain
when we didn't use their design.

181
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:15,970
I got the impression that they didn't care
for the project much.

182
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:19,634
They seemed to only care
about receiving the money.

183
00:15:20,737 --> 00:15:24,311
Please give the emails and files
you've received from Archcle.

184
00:15:24,335 --> 00:15:25,811
Please.

185
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:27,642
Please give me the files.

186
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:38,146
Thank you.

187
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:40,031
Thank you.

188
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:41,256
Thank you.

189
00:15:42,052 --> 00:15:45,772
The location is on the outskirts of Florida.
Please check it out.

190
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:48,650
I've never heard of it.
I see.

191
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:51,299
I'll check when I work outside of the office.

192
00:15:51,323 --> 00:15:54,527
Tell me
if you get the slightest of information.

193
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:59,019
And don't tell anyone about it.

194
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:00,439
Got it?

195
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:01,592
I see.

196
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:04,377
I can't ask you to treat me
because I'm in the US.

197
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:08,094
I'll treat you to nice food
when you return to the headquarters.

198
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:10,170
- Okay.
- Thank you.

199
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,298
What on earth is this?

200
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:14,977
What? The Archcle Design?

201
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:16,525
No.

202
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:20,391
Mr. Shin told me
he had a special request for me.

203
00:16:20,415 --> 00:16:21,570
I wonder what that is.

204
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:23,338
I don't know.

205
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:25,219
I'm so nervous.

206
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:28,968
- Isn't it that?
- What is it?

207
00:16:28,992 --> 00:16:32,539
He might think it'll be helpful
if you do nothing

208
00:16:32,563 --> 00:16:33,706
and keep quiet.

209
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,495
Are you kidding me?

210
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,445
I was a fool to ask you.

211
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:40,612
I got a call from him.

212
00:16:40,636 --> 00:16:42,388
- It's him.
- Answer it.

213
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:45,988
It's me.

214
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:50,051
What?

215
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:52,380
Yes.

216
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,398
What's wrong?
What did he ask you?

217
00:16:59,422 --> 00:17:00,523
I think

218
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:03,938
Mr. Shin has found out what my ability is.

219
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:06,169
What?

220
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,025
Yes, I met him a moment ago.

221
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:11,210
But I got a feeling that they did
the least work to avoid suspicion.

222
00:17:11,234 --> 00:17:14,874
That's why there wasn't any problem
from the previous audits.

223
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:17,969
It's over 40 billion won.

224
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:20,638
And if the one was involved
in the death of the ex-president

225
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:23,556
who could be this one?

226
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,782
Our job is to find out who it is.

227
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:30,596
Investigate the files you received
and let me know if you find anything else.

228
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes, sir.

229
00:17:50,214 --> 00:17:50,952
<i>It's me.</i>

230
00:17:50,976 --> 00:17:53,551
<i>Go to the funeral and read the vibe there.</i>

231
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:56,725
<i>I want you to observe Mr. President
and Mr. Vice President.</i>

232
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:04,245
I'm a spy now…
What should I do now?

233
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:05,493
Hey.

234
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,353
What brings you here?

235
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:09,967
Well…

236
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:12,740
I want to say goodbye to the ex-president.

237
00:18:12,764 --> 00:18:14,306
What a nonsense.

238
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,855
I know you're a spy.

239
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:18,410
You must be coming here to observe
Mr. Vice President. Am I right?

240
00:18:18,434 --> 00:18:21,494
Well… That's no true.

241
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:25,417
You must be wondering
who's going to take the reins.

242
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:27,697
You've come here to see if
Mr. Vice President has a chance, right?

243
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:32,711
I can't pull the wool over your eyes.

244
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:35,797
I know you like the back of my hand.

245
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:37,124
Don't worry.

246
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:39,177
Do you have any good news?

247
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:43,636
All the directors have accepted
Mr. Vice President's invitation.

248
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,955
Just wait.
Now come the days of Mr. Vice President.

249
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:50,320
You might not feel it, but I feel it now.

250
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:53,936
I'm seeing a good omen.

251
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:57,138
Nice.

252
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:08,326
<i>[Inseol Architecture]</i>

253
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,371
<i>[Sender, archcle design]</i>

254
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:14,217
<i>[Goongga Architecture]</i>

255
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:17,377
<i>[KGK Architecture]</i>

256
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,262
Excuse me.

257
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:28,280
I've traced Archcle's IP address.

258
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:30,940
Benjamin Lee wasn't in the United States.

259
00:19:30,964 --> 00:19:32,051
What?

260
00:19:32,075 --> 00:19:34,690
He's always been in Korea.

261
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:55,982
It's what Chief Song took in Florida.

262
00:19:56,006 --> 00:19:59,460
It seemed like they ran out of business
for a long time.

263
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:01,747
It must be a shell company.

264
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:05,951
They've held contests under the name of Archcle.

265
00:20:05,975 --> 00:20:07,411
Contests? Why?

266
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:10,783
I think those contests were
for securing designs to be sent to Korea.

267
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:13,993
The chances of recognizing
international student's work are low.

268
00:20:14,017 --> 00:20:17,274
I've talked with
an accountant substituting for Archcle

269
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,330
and asked about Benjamin Lee.

270
00:20:19,354 --> 00:20:21,669
Well…
You'd better check it out yourself.

271
00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:29,410
Benjamin Lee was 22 years old at that time.
He's 28 now.

272
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:32,701
Have you found his exact location?

273
00:20:32,725 --> 00:20:33,915
Well…

274
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:37,650
I've traced his IP address
but couldn't pinpoint the exact location.

275
00:20:37,674 --> 00:20:41,790
Please look at the locations.
The addresses were sporadic.

276
00:20:46,057 --> 00:20:48,666
Mr. Han Soo. Find the materials

277
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,953
about the college student contest's participants
for the past seven years.

278
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:53,203
Yes, sir.

279
00:20:53,227 --> 00:20:56,213
Chief Ok. Check the cash flow

280
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:58,003
of the departments that
cooperated with Archcle.

281
00:20:58,027 --> 00:20:59,066
Yes, sir.

282
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:03,912
By the way, what is Deputy Director Yum doing?

283
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:08,201
That is… It's a secret.
Curiosity kills the cat.

284
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,285
Let's wrap it up.

285
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:12,554
Ms. Seo Jin. Please stay for a minute.

286
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:37,743
Why are you so busy?
Are you auditing for someone else again?

287
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:41,249
I can't tell you audit information
for security reasons.

288
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:47,088
I thought we became close to each other.
Was it not?

289
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,390
I'm sad.

290
00:21:50,606 --> 00:21:54,593
This is JU's hunting dog.
Audit Team leader Shin Cha Il.

291
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:56,795
Remember his face.
You should be careful not to stimulate his feelings.

292
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:59,367
I'm Choi Joong Woo
the head of the purchasing department.

293
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,961
Why aren't you clearing the way?

294
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:30,660
Guests of VIP rooms are so picky
that we haven't installed CCTVs.

295
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:34,588
Can I check the CCTVs in the parking lots
and the list of vehicles entering and leaving?

296
00:22:34,612 --> 00:22:35,770
Please wait a minute.

297
00:22:41,745 --> 00:22:43,879
<i>[The list of vehicles entering and leaving]</i>

298
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,390
<i>[The list of vehicles entering and leaving]</i>

299
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:37,787
It's proof that Mr. Vice President
dropped by the hospital room

300
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:39,984
before the ex-president died.

301
00:23:42,064 --> 00:23:44,343
What is your point?

302
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:48,743
He's a bit rough but
isn't bad enough to hurt his brother.

303
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:53,145
Maybe…

304
00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:56,151
I'm just trying to find
suspicious circumstances.

305
00:23:57,107 --> 00:23:58,687
Give me proof.

306
00:23:58,711 --> 00:24:03,045
The proof that someone intercepted Archcle
and secret funds.

307
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:08,096
I can't persuade the bereaved
without tangible proof.

308
00:24:12,053 --> 00:24:13,501
I see.

309
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:51,439
The Vice President has met the head
of the purchasing department two days in a row.

310
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:53,605
I see.

311
00:24:53,629 --> 00:24:55,652
Sir, should I keep my eye on him?

312
00:24:55,676 --> 00:24:56,921
Keep up the good work.

313
00:24:56,945 --> 00:25:00,512
I have work to deal with at the office…

314
00:25:00,536 --> 00:25:03,551
I feel dizzy when I'm in a crowded place.

315
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,525
The guy next to Mr. President
is Undersecretary Ahn, right?

316
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:13,625
Right.

317
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:17,899
It's the funeral of the JU's president.
It's no wonder an undersecretary has come.

318
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:41,202
It's not proper to mention it
in mourning for the ex-president.

319
00:25:41,226 --> 00:25:46,224
The shareholder's meeting will be held soon
to elect a president.

320
00:25:46,248 --> 00:25:47,371
It won't take long.

321
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:49,094
I know but…

322
00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:52,356
It's uncomfortable
to talk about this subject now.

323
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,902
I'll leave.

324
00:26:00,222 --> 00:26:03,311
Why are you leaving without eating food?

325
00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:08,783
<i>I'll see you soon. Take care of yourself.</i>

326
00:26:15,175 --> 00:26:16,657
What's wrong with them?

327
00:26:17,888 --> 00:26:20,127
Their attitudes have changed.

328
00:26:21,368 --> 00:26:27,579
I think they didn't expect
the time of choice to come this early.

329
00:26:27,603 --> 00:26:30,469
Sir, it's just my opinion.

330
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:32,945
I guess

331
00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:35,762
they want something.

332
00:26:35,786 --> 00:26:37,769
Are you saying I should put money
into their pockets?

333
00:26:37,793 --> 00:26:39,080
Yes…

334
00:26:41,925 --> 00:26:44,938
Do they obviously look for
only their interests?

335
00:26:44,962 --> 00:26:48,889
I think we should prepare money for them.

336
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:55,899
Call Head Choi.

337
00:26:55,923 --> 00:26:58,066
Yes, sir.

338
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:09,374
Can the Vice President be the real owner
of Archcle and secret funds?

339
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:11,523
It could go either way.

340
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,664
Considering his working style

341
00:27:13,688 --> 00:27:17,465
he's the type who will tolerate
a bit of corruption to achieve his goal.

342
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:22,241
But he isn't such a person

343
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:25,223
to hurt someone.

344
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:26,825
There must be some misunderstanding.

345
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:27,962
Ms. Yoon Seo Jin.

346
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:34,964
What position is yours
about the Vice President?

347
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,471
Are you an Audit Team member or his niece?

348
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:39,606
Well…

349
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,943
Come to work
after making up your mind tomorrow.

350
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:53,521
Hey!

351
00:28:00,035 --> 00:28:02,165
Why are you so absent-minded?

352
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:03,595
You can hurt yourself.

353
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:06,262
Aren't you in the funeral?

354
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:07,766
Why are you here?

355
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,238
I'm sick of the food there. So I escaped.

356
00:28:10,949 --> 00:28:12,237
By the way, you're quite late.

357
00:28:12,261 --> 00:28:14,910
Is Mr. Shin making a plan or something?

358
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:16,243
If so, what is it?

359
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,580
Is he auditing someone?

360
00:28:19,593 --> 00:28:20,615
Mr. Vice President.

361
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,417
What?

362
00:28:23,441 --> 00:28:27,888
You're asking an Audit Team member
not your niece.

363
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,697
What's wrong?

364
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:32,576
I'll go through the usual procedure
if I need to report something.

365
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,896
I can't tell you now.

366
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,992
What's the matter?

367
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,133
What about you?

368
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,618
Don't you have anything you're hiding?

369
00:28:42,642 --> 00:28:44,705
What do you mean?

370
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:47,953
No.

371
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:51,145
Enjoy your dinner. I need to take a fresh air.

372
00:29:05,464 --> 00:29:07,257
Okay. Thank you.

373
00:29:09,564 --> 00:29:10,870
Sir

374
00:29:10,894 --> 00:29:14,246
I talked with Chief Song over the phone.

375
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,331
Archcle has suddenly reported
the closure of business.

376
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,774
- When was it?
- Today.

377
00:29:20,806 --> 00:29:21,773
I see.

378
00:29:21,797 --> 00:29:25,644
I've also traced the cash flow
of the departments cooperating with Archcle.

379
00:29:25,668 --> 00:29:30,072
The purchasing department has announced
that they'll recheck all the businesses.

380
00:29:30,096 --> 00:29:32,421
Among them, there's also Archcle.

381
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:36,793
So,
the budget allocated to Archcle is canceled.

382
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,413
The purchasing department?

383
00:29:38,437 --> 00:29:42,363
Yes. It was the first order
of the new head of the department.

384
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,066
Good morning.

385
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:12,106
Have you made up your mind?

386
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:16,189
Yes.

387
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,220
I won't let personal feelings come into play

388
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,550
because I'm an Audit Team member.

389
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,587
I see.

390
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:33,859
Sir! I've found it.

391
00:30:33,883 --> 00:30:34,720
What did you find?

392
00:30:34,744 --> 00:30:37,132
Benjamin Lee's Korean name
and personal information.

393
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:39,967
Here you go.

394
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:46,092
His name was among the participants
of the college student contests held by our company.

395
00:30:46,116 --> 00:30:48,850
His Korean name is Lee Beom Seok.
He went to a University in the US.

396
00:30:48,874 --> 00:30:52,753
But he doesn't use his previous phone number.
The address was also different.

397
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:56,859
The emergency contact was his uncle's.

398
00:30:56,883 --> 00:30:58,485
But his uncle didn't answer my call.

399
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,549
What? All of our efforts are pointless.

400
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:05,290
What city is
Benjamin Lee's university located in?

401
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:06,494
New York.

402
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:10,456
- Get me the resume of Head Choi.
- Yes, sir.

403
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,502
Here you are.

404
00:31:19,182 --> 00:31:22,042
<i>[Be dispatched to the Yulryeong factory]</i>

405
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:26,594
There might be a person who keeps a safe.

406
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:30,451
There was a rumor that the ex-president
hired someone to keep a safe.

407
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:32,830
Chief Ok.

408
00:31:32,854 --> 00:31:36,121
I want to see the business trip records
of the New York branch.

409
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,961
Yes, sir. I'll request it.

410
00:31:37,985 --> 00:31:41,129
Mr. Han Soo. Keep calling his uncle.

411
00:31:41,153 --> 00:31:42,597
Yes, sir.

412
00:31:54,337 --> 00:31:55,449
Okay, I'll go.

413
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,582
Ms. Seo Jin.

414
00:32:01,606 --> 00:32:04,864
Investigate the head
of the purchasing department.

415
00:32:04,888 --> 00:32:06,254
Yes, sir.

416
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:18,196
Lastly, please tell me
about JU Construction's vision.

417
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,377
Following my brother's wishes

418
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:23,847
I'll create an incorrupt, clean company

419
00:32:23,871 --> 00:32:27,172
and an advanced environment.

420
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:29,476
Yes. Thank you for the interview.

421
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,647
I'll take a few more pictures.
Please look over here.

422
00:32:36,173 --> 00:32:38,053
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

423
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,496
Isn't it improper to have an interview
in mourning for Brother?

424
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,827
It's a business.

425
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:52,564
You're the vice president.
Don't you care about the company's image?

426
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:55,957
It looks like you're waiting for his death.
Be careful.

427
00:32:55,981 --> 00:32:57,371
Look who's talking?

428
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,401
Why are you meeting up with directors
at a time like this?

429
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:04,846
You look like you've been waiting for this day.

430
00:33:07,093 --> 00:33:08,949
What are you doing?

431
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:14,709
Don't you care about other's glances?

432
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:16,422
You're brothers.
Shouldn't you really have to fight each other?

433
00:33:16,446 --> 00:33:18,302
- Brothers? Who?
- Who's my brother?

434
00:33:18,326 --> 00:33:20,169
Stop…

435
00:33:20,193 --> 00:33:22,730
I'm worried about the company's future.

436
00:33:27,343 --> 00:33:30,436
Mr. Bang. Think carefully

437
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,118
about who is more necessary for the company.

438
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:36,870
Do not only consider the direct line.

439
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,310
- What brings you here?
- I have a question for you.

440
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:28,062
- Come back later.
- It won't take long.

441
00:34:32,566 --> 00:34:33,433
What is it?

442
00:34:33,457 --> 00:34:36,576
Since when were you close to Head Choi?

443
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:39,304
Why are you asking that?

444
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:41,560
Was it before the ex-president fell?

445
00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:43,978
Get out if you keep talking nonsense.

446
00:34:47,971 --> 00:34:51,619
On June 4th at 11:30 p.m.

447
00:34:52,904 --> 00:34:55,422
why did you come to the hospital
to see the ex-president?

448
00:34:59,249 --> 00:35:02,118
Why are you asking it suddenly?
Get out.

449
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,853
Is there any reason you can't answer?

450
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:06,685
I'm not in the mood to answer.

451
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:12,139
You're the last visitor
before the ex-president died.

452
00:35:14,643 --> 00:35:17,293
Tell me why you visited there.

453
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:19,380
What's that supposed to mean?

454
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:21,409
Are you suspicious that

455
00:35:22,243 --> 00:35:24,785
I killed my brother?

456
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:30,891
Get out.

457
00:35:53,299 --> 00:35:54,401
Hello.

458
00:35:57,112 --> 00:35:58,185
The police?

I'm drinking too much coffee.

470
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,456
Hello. It's me who called you.

471
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,797
I'm from JU's Audit Team.
Is Benjamin Lee your nephew?

472
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,740
What?

473
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:59,358
Does Benjamin Lee live in the US now?

474
00:37:59,382 --> 00:38:03,911
He lives with his parents. He's never visited
Korea during the past five years.

475
00:38:03,935 --> 00:38:06,113
I've checked his immigration record.

476
00:38:06,947 --> 00:38:12,070
Then, who sent the design files
shipped from Korea under the name Archcle?

477
00:38:12,094 --> 00:38:14,405
Benjamin Lee must've lent his name.

478
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:18,068
The actual owner of Archcle has exchanged
emails with architecture firms

479
00:38:18,092 --> 00:38:20,194
and received money from JU.

480
00:38:25,394 --> 00:38:30,455
As you ordered, I've investigated Head Choi.

481
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:32,082
He worked at the Yulryeong factory

482
00:38:32,106 --> 00:38:34,194
before being assigned
to the head of the purchasing department.

483
00:38:34,218 --> 00:38:35,552
Here you are.

484
00:38:35,576 --> 00:38:38,216
This is what I've got
from the Department of Architecture.

485
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,031
The main business of the factory
is modular building.

486
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:44,951
It was designated as our company's future strategy
early this year and got huge investments.

487
00:38:45,663 --> 00:38:49,420
Mr. President and Vice President
all agreed to this investment.

488
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:52,103
There was one suspicious thing.

489
00:38:52,127 --> 00:38:56,005
The regulations on modular building
haven't been removed yet.

490
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:58,032
Turn over a page.

491
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:03,001
But the research funds for it
have increased recently.

492
00:39:03,025 --> 00:39:06,239
The regulations are still working
but did they increase the budget?

493
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:08,273
What if they fail to remove the regulations?

494
00:39:08,297 --> 00:39:10,480
That's what I'm suspicious of.

495
00:39:10,504 --> 00:39:13,381
It can be an investment
with pure hope for a better future.

496
00:39:14,724 --> 00:39:16,495
<i>[Undersecretary Ahn Dong Woo
will run for a parliamentary job?]</i>

497
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:18,871
<i>[He's demanding that old building regulations

498
00:39:21,211 --> 00:39:23,824
It can be a new route to create secret funds.

499
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:33,401
The general manager of this project
at the Yulryeon factory was Head Choi.

500
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:41,142
Many people think
he's on the vice president's side.

501
00:40:57,238 --> 00:40:58,585
Hi.

502
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:01,322
Hi.

503
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,184
We only have one day.

504
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:06,488
The coffin leaves the temple tomorrow.

505
00:41:06,512 --> 00:41:08,495
Can we succeed in finding out the truth?

506
00:41:15,122 --> 00:41:17,771
The Vice President doesn't look happy.

507
00:41:21,024 --> 00:41:23,711
Did you visit Hwang Geon Woong
on the day of his death?

508
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,599
Yes, I did.

509
00:41:29,623 --> 00:41:30,948
Why did you visit?

510
00:41:30,972 --> 00:41:32,986
I got a message from him.

511
00:41:33,878 --> 00:41:36,988
As far as I know,
you two weren't getting along.

512
00:41:37,012 --> 00:41:38,759
What are you talking about?

513
00:41:40,989 --> 00:41:43,120
I don't have any reason to tell a lie.

514
00:41:43,144 --> 00:41:45,347
What did you talk about with him?

515
00:41:45,371 --> 00:41:47,701
I couldn't enter his hospital room.

516
00:41:48,523 --> 00:41:50,703
A nurse told me that he was falling asleep
and stopped me from entering.

517
00:41:50,727 --> 00:41:54,208
It could be the sister-in-law
who ordered her to stop me.

518
00:41:54,963 --> 00:41:56,436
By the way

519
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,640
why are you asking this?

520
00:41:58,664 --> 00:42:01,648
It's just a general question.

521
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:13,296
The police investigated everyone

I heard from a high-ranking official

There's a rumor that the city hall will review
a contract with Cheongon Sports Complex.

542

Who's the owner of the funds?

562
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:05,399
It was the ex-president's money.
But we don't know who took it.

563

Mr. Shin thinks it has something to do

Yes. So what?

604
00:48:06,034 --> 00:48:10,067
The research funds increased suddenly
so the labor costs were considerable.

605

Even though it was for recruiting more researchers
wasn't it excessive spending?
