00:00:36,098 --> 00:00:37,108
(All characters, organizations, and events...)

2
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:38,138
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,167
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

4
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,578
Hey!

5
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,318
What is going on?

6
00:00:54,857 --> 00:00:55,987
He suddenly fell.

7
00:00:55,987 --> 00:00:57,228
Hurry!

8
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:02,196
Mr. Shin,

9
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:04,166
they gave me this at the reception.

10
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:05,551
They said it came via express courier.

11
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:11,766
(Manager Shin Cha Il)

12
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:21,575
(Audit those running the construction site dining halls,)

13
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:22,885
(or everyone who uses JU Construction's dining halls...)

14
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:24,285
(will be hurt, including the cafeteria at the head office!)

15
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:28,885
(The construction site for the shopping mall...)

16
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:30,255
(is the first target!)

17
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:40,565
This is the Audit Team.

18
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:56,016
How did they find out?

19
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,216
Only I knew about it.

20
00:01:58,246 --> 00:01:59,415
Ms. Yu has a lot...

21
00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:01,915
of time on her hands.

22
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:04,356
Maybe she got a different idea.

23
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:06,725
Like splitting the money with Mr. Shin.

24
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:09,525
She betrayed everyone until the end. What are you talking about?

25
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:10,996
I only said that...

26
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,626
because you said no one knew about it.

27
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,736
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:15,496
Please continue your meal.

29
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:18,936
That jerk keeps on popping up in my head. I can't eat.

30
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:22,535
Why would you think about him while you're eating?

31
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:23,906
Look, sir.

32
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:28,246
You have so many people who respect and follow you.

33
00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:31,785
- Hello. - Hey.

34
00:02:33,016 --> 00:02:34,785
- Hello. - Hey.

35
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:37,986
You're right.

36
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,696
Why did I waste my time on him?

37
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:44,296
Everyone, stop eating.

38
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,865
All of you!

39
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,706
Stop eating.

40
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:00,976
We're from the Audit Team.

41
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:02,245
Please stop eating.

42
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,316
I'm sorry, but please stop eating.

43
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:07,016
We're from the Audit Team.

44
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:22,335
(The Auditors)

45
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,706
(Episode 5)

46
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:29,435
(Audit those running the construction site dining halls.)

47
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:34,016
Will you be able to figure out who sent the mail?

48
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:36,386
I checked with the courier.

49
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:39,585
The mail was left on a bench in Hongseo Park.

50
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:42,816
I can report it to the police to investigate the area...

51
00:03:42,816 --> 00:03:44,055
Not the police.

52
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:50,226
Staff and laborers included,

53
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:52,095
twelve people were hospitalized.

54
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:56,606
Next month is the sneak preview of J-BIMS.

55
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,435
It's an important event that'll act as a turning point for the company.

56
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:01,576
We can't let any issues arise.

57
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:03,905
I'll speak to the head of the hospital.

58
00:04:03,905 --> 00:04:06,046
I'm sure we can cover it up saying it's food poisoning.

59
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,645
I want you to look into it,

60
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:10,946
in secret.

61
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,585
(The construction site for the shopping mall...)

62
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:17,886
(is the first target!)

63
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,696
(President's office)

64
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:22,796
What is it?

65
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,326
Why did you make a scene to stop people from eating?

66
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:26,766
You'll receive the notice.

67
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,636
What will the notice say?

68
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:29,905
You'll find out when you get it.

69
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:34,006
Do you get training to annoy people?

70
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:37,245
I don't have the time for it since my work keeps me busy.

71
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:41,375
How did you know Ms. Yu was there?

72
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,215
How did you know I met with her?

73
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:45,545
You little...

74
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:48,256
Are you testing my patience?

75
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,426
- Where do you think you're going? - Vice President Hwang.

76
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:57,196
We're at the office. What do you think you're doing?

77
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:10,545
Is he your lover?

78
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,516
Enough is enough.

79
00:05:24,186 --> 00:05:25,285
Gosh.

80
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:32,895
We're finally done.

81
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:36,335
By the way, what happened?

82
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:38,165
We'll be sending out the notice.

83
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,806
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:42,335
We'll take care of it soon.

85
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:52,045
Han Soo.

86
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:54,715
- Thanks for the hard work. - Good job.

87
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:55,915
Mr. Moon,

88
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:57,756
I'm so furious.

89
00:05:58,155 --> 00:05:59,186
Come on.

90
00:05:59,186 --> 00:06:01,926
How can they blackmail with food?

91
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,165
It doesn't make any sense. I feel so sorry for the cooks.

92
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,426
We're seeing unprecedented issues.

93
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:08,936
I can't pinpoint the name,

94
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,735
but it's because of a particular someone.

95
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:12,405
How can you joke right now?

96
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:14,206
So many people were hospitalized.

97
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:15,676
I'm not joking.

98
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,876
We'll have to do the math to get the exact number,

99
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:19,845
but the damage will likely be big.

100
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,915
It's going to cost extra to find a new cafeteria for the workers.

101
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:26,285
But the bigger issue is,

102
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:30,626
if lunchtime is extended by an hour at every site for a month,

103
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,386
the process will be delayed by several days.

104
00:06:33,196 --> 00:06:34,355
That means the damage will be...

105
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:36,355
- more than a million dollars. - Exactly.

106
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:38,126
We should also consider the extra costs attached...

107
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:41,165
to hiring more hands to meet the construction schedule.

108
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:43,335
This is what I mean.

109
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,535
Ever since Mr. Shin joined...

110
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:47,835
Let's have a meeting.

111
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:50,206
I mean, we should do our best in our meetings.

112
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:55,715
As for the situation during lunch,

113
00:06:55,845 --> 00:06:57,116
we'll tell everyone we stopped them from eating...

114
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,316
as a preventive measure...

115
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:00,456
as there was a possibility the food was spoiled.

116
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,426
This letter will remain secret.

117
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:06,186
"Secret?"

118
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:08,225
Do you mean you won't report it?

119
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:10,225
What about the person who blackmailed us?

120
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:11,595
We'll find them.

121
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,936
Inform all cafeterias on site.

122
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:17,835
Tell them not to serve anything until we tell them otherwise.

123
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,206
Have all the workers use restaurants outside of the sites.

124
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:21,376
Okay.

125
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:22,706
- Please help me. - Okay.

126
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,145
In my opinion,

127
00:07:24,145 --> 00:07:27,576
we'll get another letter soon demanding money.

128
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:30,085
If that happens, just give them the money.

129
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,386
It's the best solution for both sides.

130
00:07:31,386 --> 00:07:33,616
But the letter already states what they want.

131
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:35,285
I don't think money is what they want.

132
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:37,155
In the end, it's always money.

133
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:39,655
I'll check out the dining hall at the shopping mall site first.

134
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:41,926
You should go with Ms. Yoon.

135
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,426
Investigate the situation and report back to me.

136
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,735
You'll have to investigate to find out,

137
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:48,696
but even the employees of dining halls will suffer damages.

138
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:50,806
So it probably wasn't the doing of someone from the dining halls.

139
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:53,706
I'll track down the person who sent me the mail...

140
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:57,275
and investigate for corruption in operating the on-site restaurants.

141
00:07:58,605 --> 00:08:00,616
People reacted instantly while they were eating.

142
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:02,415
I think they added some kind of poison to the food.

143
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:05,215
If we can find that out, it'll become a clue for us.

144
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:06,915
This is an act of terrorism.

145
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:08,985
I'll find them and hold them accountable.

146
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:12,426
I think they used this method to tip off corruption.

147
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,225
When a dining hall secures a site,

148
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:15,725
it can earn a million dollars in just 4 to 5 years.

149
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,595
I wouldn't be surprised if there was corruption...

150
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:18,895
in the bidding process.

151
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,165
Hold on.

152
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:22,335
Maybe it's someone who suffered a loss...

153
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,436
due to the corruption in the bidding process.

154
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:26,605
Why didn't they just report it?

155
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,405
Sure, you could feel wronged,

156
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:30,446
but one shouldn't play around with food that way.

157
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:32,145
I'm sure they have their reasons.

158
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:34,616
No matter the reason, it's unforgivable.

159
00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:35,845
Let's go.

160
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:39,585
Where will the workers eat if you close it down?

161
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:41,355
Hang up.

162
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:45,886
I also helped the union members...

163
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:47,826
get their money back.

164
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:50,926
Why did you tell us not to find the money?

165
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:06,576
Thank you so much.

166
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:09,916
There is no order in this company anymore.

167
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:12,585
That Mr. Shin is really toxic for us.

168
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,316
His rudeness is infectious.

169
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:15,355
Are you talking about me?

170
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,326
That's not true.

171
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:20,495
I came with closed information just for you.

172
00:09:20,495 --> 00:09:22,696
It's nothing useful again, is it?

173
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:24,465
Think again. Remember the golf club?

174
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:26,936
- That was dead scary. I'm leaving. - Hold on.

175
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:32,066
Be prudent, okay?

176
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:34,706
I'm risking my life,

177
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:37,176
reporting every piece of information to Vice President Hwang.

178
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,375
Promise me you won't swing that golf club.

179
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:42,576
You don't know...

180
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:44,916
the reason behind the commotion during lunch, right?

181
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,156
You little... It was in the announcement.

182
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:49,585
Good grief. That's not everything.

183
00:09:49,585 --> 00:09:51,656
I told you I had closed information.

184
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,865
Listen. Mr. Shin received a threatening letter.

185
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:02,196
If he doesn't audit the on-site restaurant corruption,

186
00:10:02,196 --> 00:10:04,406
the restaurants will all be shut down.

187
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:06,806
As an example, they tried to kill all the workers by poisoning...

188
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,875
the food at the shopping mall on-site restaurant.

189
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,676
Shocking, isn't it?

190
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:12,806
This is a crazy piece of information.

191
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:14,146
Oh, gosh. Are you okay?

192
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:15,816
Is there an earthquake?

193
00:10:20,156 --> 00:10:22,916
- Goodness. - What is it?

196
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:39,365
Why were the shopping mall on-site restaurants shut down?

197
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:41,835
What? Were they shut down?

198
00:10:42,735 --> 00:10:45,806
I wonder why they shut down.

199
00:10:45,806 --> 00:10:47,115
I asked the question.

200
00:10:47,115 --> 00:10:48,245
Right.

201
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:50,015
What's with all the sweat?

202
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:52,085
You see, the lower-body baths I've been taking...

203
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,316
must've opened up my pores.

204
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:55,156
I'm old, as well.

205
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,426
- Where are we going? - To the site.

206
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:31,686
(Audit those running the construction site dining halls.)

207
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:32,926

(When someone is controlled by a person less than them)

212
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:03,526
This petty guy is acting like he owns the place.

213
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,926
I made it clear Yangyoon Industry...

214
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:08,495
gets priority in the iron subcontracting...

215
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,026
because they have advantages in steel structures.

216
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,066
But why did you arbitrarily decide on Songdan?

217
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:15,835
Yangyoon Industry did not meet...

218
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,906
the due date during the Fancheng construction...

219
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:20,306
Stop making me flip out, you little...

Director Pyeon.

221
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:36,186
Do you know how much we spent on outsourcing last year?

222
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:39,456
Two billion dollars.

223
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:42,225
But you came to the Subcontract Purchase Team...

224
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:44,595
simply because of the on-site restaurant selection?

225
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:48,296
Rumors circulate if the Audit Team Manager drops by.

226
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:50,066
People will think we embezzled money.

227
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,536
Think about it. This is just humiliating us.

228
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:55,576
I came to interview you...

229
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:58,146
with my authority as the Audit Team Manager.

230
00:12:58,505 --> 00:12:59,605
Answer my question.

231
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:03,885
- What was your name again? - It's Shin Cha Il.

232
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:04,985
Listen, Mr. Shin.

233
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,186
I heard you were running wild...

234
00:13:08,316 --> 00:13:10,985
to bump up your performance.

235
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:13,026
I understand, okay?

236
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:17,166
But don't mess around with the outsourcing purchase.

237
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:21,995
We select all subcontractors for JU Construction.

238
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:24,166
Nitpick at everything,

239
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,806
and we won't meet the construction starting date.

240
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,176
How did you select the on-site restaurant operation rights?

241
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:35,015
After posting a bidding notice, we received proposals,

242
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:39,015
evaluated them, offered a contract, and signed it.

243
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:41,985
- Happy now? - An evidential document is needed.

244
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:43,015
Hey!

245
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:45,456
Mr. Lim!

246
00:13:46,056 --> 00:13:47,826
Bring me the on-site restaurant selection documents.

247
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:53,696
Here's the document...

248
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:55,235

251
00:14:00,135 --> 00:14:01,436
What about documents before that?

252
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:04,105
Before that, the subcontractor took care of it.

253
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:06,446
We ended the contract with them.

254
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:08,745
I need to ask for documents.

255
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:10,416
Tell me the contact information of that subcontractor.

256
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,615
They went bankrupt and closed the business.

257
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,426
Even if you entrusted...

258
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:22,526
the operating rights' bidding to the subcontractor,

259
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:24,095
you would've managed them.

260
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,196
Saying there aren't any documents...

261
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:28,896
sounds like the Subcontract Purchase Headquarters...

262
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:30,605
didn't do their job properly.

263
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:33,706
I did say the subcontractor closed...

264
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:36,076
but didn't say there weren't any documents.

265
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,105
- Did I? - No, you didn't.

266
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:41,416
I thought you needed the most recent documents.

267
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,515
- What are you waiting for? - Sorry?

268
00:14:44,686 --> 00:14:46,115
Go and get them.

269
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:47,286
Understood.

270
00:14:59,296 --> 00:15:00,566
The lists of companies that participated...

271
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,365
in the subcontractor's bidding.

272
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:04,605
It's three years worth, so it's quite heavy.

273
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:09,676
Right.

274
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:13,676
Mr. Shin.

275
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:16,345
Shall I give you a tip-off?

276
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,715
Mr. Lim right here.

277
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,396
He pretends to be overworking but steals instant coffee.

278
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:29,696
He even keeps...

279
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,465
printing personal stuff with a lot of color in them.

280
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,595
Do you know S.I.E?

281
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:37,566
Small yet indisputable embezzlement.

282
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:40,906
Mr. Lim sure enjoys doing that.

283
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:45,505
I can't help but think you're dying to improve your performance.

284
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:48,875
So I'm giving you a tip-off.

285
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:56,656
Personal use of company items without prior consent...

286
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,985
is considered business embezzlement or theft.

287
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:01,255
It's regarded as trivial at first...

288
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:02,926
but could become worse.

289
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:04,026
In other words,

290
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:05,765
it can progress into company fund embezzlement.

291
00:16:06,326 --> 00:16:07,365
You should stop.

292
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:09,536
All right, I will.

293
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:14,436
And if there's any workplace violence using authority,

294
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:16,936
report it to the Audit Team.

(Business License)

296
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:42,536
I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years,

297
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:44,465
but this is a first.

298
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:45,936
Because it was a group meal,

299
00:16:45,936 --> 00:16:48,806
I was extra careful about hygiene.

300
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:51,046
To think this happened.

301
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,375
Don't worry too much.

302
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,776
You can reopen once the investigation is over.

303
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:55,845
I see.

304
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,245
Japchae is the problem, yes?

305
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:03,355
Only the workers who ate japchae got food poisoning.

306
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,686
Did an outsider enter the kitchen today?

307
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:09,326
The outsiders would've been the food ingredient deliverers.

308
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:11,326
But we do business with them.

309
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:13,396
Can I get their contact number?

310
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,036
Of course.

311
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:18,406
How did you win the restaurant operating rights bid?

312
00:17:18,406 --> 00:17:20,166
Well, that's...

313
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:25,646
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

314
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:31,345
Couldn't you manage this place properly?

315
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,386
My apologies, sir.

316
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:39,225
Hi.

317
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:44,265
I heard it was food poisoning.

318
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:47,336
Yes. There was a problem with the japchae.

319
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,336
Gosh, you should've been careful.

320
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:53,065
Prepare us a meal.

321
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:55,176
I'm hungry after a small lunch.

322
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:57,475
That specialty of yours. Soybean paste stew.

323
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:00,176
Get us four portions.

324
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:02,846
- Leave out japchae. - I will.

325
00:18:08,456 --> 00:18:09,485
Sit down.

326
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:21,696
I come here for food...

327
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:22,936
when I get hungry while making my site rounds.

328
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:24,936
This is the best on-site restaurant.

329
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:25,965
I see.

330
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:28,275
Don't make a scene over one mistake. Got it?

331
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:31,575
But we were given a task.

332
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:33,446
It needs further investigation.

333
00:18:33,606 --> 00:18:35,275
Didn't you hear Vice President Hwang?

334
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:37,285
He's telling you to stop.

335
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:38,785
What's wrong with your team?

336
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,485
We're not done with the interview.

337
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:41,656
It won't take long.

338
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:44,456
Listen, Audit Team. Have you really lost it?

339
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,456
Mr. Yang.

340
00:18:45,985 --> 00:18:47,696
Are you verbally abusing our workers?

341
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:50,456
- Sorry? - Apologize to them.

342
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,136
What... Why...

343
00:18:57,606 --> 00:19:00,065
Well, I'm sorry.

344
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,245
Are you not done with the interview?

345
00:19:04,446 --> 00:19:06,606
No. We asked how this place won...

346
00:19:06,606 --> 00:19:08,775
the restaurant operating rights bid.

347
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:09,815
What's this?

348
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:11,485
Why would you bring up...

349
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,315
the operating rights over some spoiled japchae?

350
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,315
Due to the food poisoning incident,

351
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:18,225
we're investigating how the cafeteria at the head office...

352
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,956
and the construction site dining halls are run.

353
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,426
I see.

354
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:24,896
Let's eat... But we can eat first, right?

355
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:26,225
Yes, sir.

356
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,735
I don't like this. Let's switch these.

357
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,706
- Don't you like pork? - Gosh, no.

358
00:19:37,606 --> 00:19:38,706
There, that's better.

359
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:41,245
All right. Thanks for the food.

360
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:42,446
Enjoy the meal.

361
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:48,586
Who's going to get us the soybean paste stew?

362
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:50,886

About the Subcontracts and Procurement Director.

368
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:08,505
Could you get me his employee profile?

369
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:09,535
Oh, sure.

370
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:12,975
So, you've met Director Pyeon In Ho?

371
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,116
He's kind of arrogant, isn't he?

372
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:17,446
Do you know him well?

373
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:18,715
I sure do.

374
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:20,886
When President Hwang Gun Woong was here,

375
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,616
Director Pyeon was his right-hand man.

376
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:25,356
But ever since President Hwang Gun Woong ended up like that,

377
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:27,126
he's lost his influence a bit.

378
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,926
He's not exactly the current president's cup of tea.

379
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:31,366
Not many people in the company know how he managed...

380
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:33,465
to become the former president's right-hand man in the first place.

381
00:20:34,436 --> 00:20:36,235
What do you say? Shall I tell you?

382
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:41,876
Well, it's the kind of story I can't really tell you for free,

383
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:45,676
but was it about three years ago?

384
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,876
Someone was occupying the construction site in Osung,

385
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:51,715
so the construction couldn't commence.

386
00:20:52,146 --> 00:20:53,745
They were offered five times the market price for the land...

387
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:54,785
but wouldn't budge.

388
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:57,015
We found out that the owner of the land...

389
00:20:57,086 --> 00:20:59,555
was holding out, hoping to make a fortune off it.

390
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,456
Come in.

391
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:04,495
Sir.

392
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,126
Hey, you're here.

393
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:09,166
So? How did it go?

394
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:10,535
I took care of it.

395
00:21:11,265 --> 00:21:12,265
- You did? - Yes.

396
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:13,305
Yes!

397
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:16,176
A few days later,

398
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,505
they were gone.

399
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:19,946
How do you think that happened?

400
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:22,416
Obviously, Director Pyeon In Ho took care of it.

401
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:25,015
That was when he totally lost his servile attitude...

402
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:26,785
and became rather haughty and arrogant.

403
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:29,515
Then he quickly landed the most influential position in the company,

404
00:21:29,515 --> 00:21:32,225
Subcontracts and Procurement Director.

405
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:33,626
Of course, he didn't stop there.

406
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,795
Business dinners, golf, business trips.

407
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:39,366
He made sure to go everywhere President Hwang Gun Woong went.

408
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,896
I know people call him a toothless tiger now,

409
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:44,965
but he still manages...

410
00:21:44,965 --> 00:21:46,836
over 100 subcontractors,

411
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:48,106
so we should never underestimate him.

We'll have to wait a bit to find out more,

415
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,485
but many things can cause an upset stomach.

416
00:22:06,485 --> 00:22:07,596
It's very common.

417
00:22:08,656 --> 00:22:11,696
But if someone deliberately spiked the food,

418
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:13,295
there's a chance a purgative was used.

Oh, right. Your brother's condition has improved significantly.

423

- Really? - Let's go inside.

424
00:22:31,715 --> 00:22:32,715
You're here.

425
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:34,456
Yes. I hear he's doing much better now.

426
00:22:34,785 --> 00:22:35,886
Try holding his hand.

427
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,725
His nerves are recovering.

428
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,396
It's too early to hope for a complete recovery,

429
00:22:48,436 --> 00:22:49,765
but this is a great sign.

430
00:22:49,896 --> 00:22:51,366
The universe is helping him.

431
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:53,265
Yes, for sure. I'll leave you to talk.

432
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:57,805
Thanks for everything you've done.

433
00:22:57,946 --> 00:23:00,805
I'll tell him everything when he wakes up.

434
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,416
I'll tell Dae Woong to leave the company.

435
00:23:05,245 --> 00:23:08,116
Everything at JU Construction will go back to the way it should be.

436
00:23:21,696 --> 00:23:24,505
See? I pigged out, and I'm fine.

437
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:25,636
And the food tasted great.

438
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,876
I think you've interviewed enough people,

439
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:30,636
so tell your manager that there's nothing to investigate here.

440
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:32,606
Yes, sir.

441
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:34,646
- You've eaten, so do some work. - Yes, sir.

442
00:23:35,045 --> 00:23:36,215

Don't you think he's acting strange today?

445
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:46,626
Why is he so nice to us all of a sudden?

446
00:23:46,956 --> 00:23:49,795
Earlier, I saw him trying to give you one of the side dishes,

447
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,225
so I looked at him, thinking, "What's he doing?"

448
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:55,035
Then he just ate it.

449
00:23:55,965 --> 00:23:56,965
Weird, right?

450
00:23:57,735 --> 00:23:58,965

454
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:08,275

Yes, Mr. Shin. We interviewed them.

They said people got sick because of japchae.

462

We also tracked down everyone who delivered the ingredients.

463
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:41,775
None of them went toward Hongseo Park.

464
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:45,515
As for the management rights, they said they followed the rules.

465
00:24:45,846 --> 00:24:47,586
And they received a high score in the evaluation.

466
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:50,616
They also said they didn't know anyone in the company.

467
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:53,225
To find out if the food was spiked with something,

468
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,795
we'd have to ask the doctors.

469
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,896

Do you think JU Construction needs him?

487
00:25:58,025 --> 00:26:00,456

That's right.

489
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:04,765

- Okay. - Hey.

493
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,106
Why would you keep it a secret?

494
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,176

- About what? - The on-site restaurant corruption.

- What? - It'll be quite noisy for a while.

If someone saw you now,

519
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:25,331
they'd think you were involved in the corruption.

I've reviewed all the documents...

523
00:27:43,142 --> 00:27:45,281
from the past year since we started putting out a bid notice...

524
00:27:45,452 --> 00:27:46,811
and found no issues.

525
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:48,581
I believe the problem occurred...

526
00:27:48,581 --> 00:27:50,581
during the three years when we had an agency take care of it.

527
00:27:50,751 --> 00:27:52,291
During that period, 52 businesses...

528
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:53,821
were selected to run on-site restaurants.

529
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:56,261
Then I'll try to find out if any of those business owners...

530
00:27:56,261 --> 00:27:57,491
had an acquaintance,

531
00:27:57,491 --> 00:28:00,162
a family member, or a relative...

532
00:28:00,162 --> 00:28:01,432
affiliated with the company.

533
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:05,202
To give them the right to operate those restaurants,

534
00:28:05,202 --> 00:28:07,432
it had to be someone with an executive-level position.

535
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:10,271
I'll investigate every employee, starting with the executives.

536
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:15,412
Then I'll investigate the businesses that lost the bid.

537
00:28:16,281 --> 00:28:19,281
What should we do if we identify an executive related to the case?

538
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:21,321
I'll interview them to see if they're connected...

539
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:23,351

540
00:28:24,591 --> 00:28:27,351

541
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:33,331

548
00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:02,291

No.

No, sir. I'm not the spy.

554

The truth is...

so I...

563
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:53,472

622
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:49,982
Please answer.

623
00:33:49,982 --> 00:33:51,181
I did not.

624
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:53,811
Were you asked for a favor?

saying the Audit Team can access their company phone and laptop.

Right now?

638
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:05,391
I will ask...

639
00:35:06,552 --> 00:35:09,862
a few questions and if you tell even a tiny lie,

640

He looks rough and tough,

644
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:23,101
but he's a timid guy.

645
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:25,041
I bet he's crying somewhere.

646
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:28,641
You knew, didn't you?

647
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:31,411
You knew.

648
00:35:31,951 --> 00:35:33,681
I don't believe this.

649
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:34,911
It's unbelievable.

650
00:35:35,081 --> 00:35:37,351
What do I know when my own life's so bleak?

651
00:35:37,422 --> 00:35:39,121
You knew already.

652
00:35:39,152 --> 00:35:40,391
I don't know.

653
00:35:45,692 --> 00:35:47,291
(The restaurant owner and director met yesterday.)

654
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:54,501
The restaurant owner and director met yesterday.

655
00:35:54,672 --> 00:35:56,871
How could they ignore each other when they're in-laws?

656
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,342
That's why we need to investigate.

657
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:05,911
Send these phones to forensics.

661
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:13,751
Yes, sir.

662
00:36:14,192 --> 00:36:16,291
- See you later. - Okay.

663
00:36:49,822 --> 00:36:51,661

664
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:54,431

but I couldn't find any records he contacted Director Pyeon.

670
00:37:19,521 --> 00:37:22,862
He didn't send any messages or emails either.

671
00:37:22,862 --> 00:37:24,192
What about his company credit card?

672
00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:26,692
Director Yang made a lot of small transactions.

673
00:37:28,032 --> 00:37:30,462
Director Pyeon didn't make any strange purchases either.

674
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:37,471

675
00:37:37,842 --> 00:37:39,012

Do you recognize this person?

677
00:37:43,612 --> 00:37:44,942
I don't.

678
00:37:44,942 --> 00:37:46,751
I don't think they work here.

679
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:47,911
Okay.

680
00:37:52,322 --> 00:37:53,992

681
00:37:57,322 --> 00:37:58,462
Go home.

682
00:38:00,891 --> 00:38:01,962
Okay.

683
00:38:02,302 --> 00:38:03,561
Let's go home.

684
00:38:04,902 --> 00:38:06,501
Competent people leave on time.

685
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:12,112
Why is there no trace if they lobbied?

686
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,172
This is going to be a headache.

687
00:38:14,471 --> 00:38:15,842
Maybe they only talked about it.

688
00:38:15,842 --> 00:38:17,282
That would make things difficult.

689
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:18,811
Stop working so hard.

690
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:20,282
Mr. Shin will figure it out on his own.

691
00:38:20,282 --> 00:38:21,612
Just act like you're working.

692
00:38:21,612 --> 00:38:23,652
Just pretend, okay? I'm off.

693
00:38:23,652 --> 00:38:25,121

- Bye. - Bye.

696
00:38:32,262 --> 00:38:34,592
When we seized the computers...

697
00:38:34,592 --> 00:38:36,402
and brought out the audit boxes earlier,

698
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:38,572
did you see their faces?

699
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:41,331
It was pretty bad, wasn't it?

700
00:38:43,172 --> 00:38:44,672
Why do you let that bother you?

701
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:48,882
You were born to be an auditor.

702
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:52,552
I was a bit nervous.

703
00:38:55,482 --> 00:38:58,081
Maybe Mr. Yang never asked for the favor...

704
00:38:58,081 --> 00:38:59,621
and that was why there was no evidence.

705
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:02,121
To be honest, the dining hall at the shopping mall site...

706
00:39:02,121 --> 00:39:03,322
looked good.

707
00:39:03,692 --> 00:39:04,822
Their prices were good too.

708
00:39:04,922 --> 00:39:07,032
They hid the fact that they were in-laws.

709
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:09,762
There was no reason to hide it if they won the bidding fairly.

710
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,532
All they had to do was write Mr. Yang's name on the letter.

711
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:15,942
Why did the blackmailer choose such a dangerous way?

712
00:39:15,942 --> 00:39:18,242
Because they also don't know who's behind the corruption.

713
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:21,411
They knew there was corruption behind the bidding,

714
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:23,882
but they didn't know who was responsible.

715
00:39:26,212 --> 00:39:28,212
There's someone who satisfies these two conditions.

716
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:31,882
The victim who unfairly lost during the bidding process.

717
00:39:35,992 --> 00:39:38,692
Can you give Mr. Moon a call?

718
00:39:38,692 --> 00:39:39,762
Sure.

719
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,601
I uploaded a list of the businesses that didn't make the cut...

720
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:50,771
on our shared folder.

722
00:39:59,282 --> 00:40:00,751
I think I found it.

723
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:06,521
This restaurant didn't make the cut for the shopping mall site,

724
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:07,951
and they went bankrupt afterward.

725
00:40:08,251 --> 00:40:10,362
They were located close to the shopping mall site too.

726
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:12,192
Good. By the way,

727
00:40:13,132 --> 00:40:14,362
where did Mr. Shin go?

728
00:40:14,492 --> 00:40:15,561
It doesn't look like he went home.

729
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:18,431
Let's head out for now and report to him on the way.

730
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:19,771
Okay.

731
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:29,212
Ms. Yoon, over here.

732
00:40:36,982 --> 00:40:38,021
Anyone home?

733
00:40:38,822 --> 00:40:39,891
Who is it?

734
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:43,791
I'm sorry for visiting you so late.

735
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,692
Would it be possible to speak with you?

736
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:46,992
Who are you?

737
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:49,331
We're from the Audit Team at JU Construction.

738
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:55,672
- Hello. - Hello.

739
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:02,282
JU Construction's Audit Team?

740
00:41:02,982 --> 00:41:04,012
What is this about?

741
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:05,382
I understand that you tried to run an on-site restaurant...

742
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:06,482
at our shopping mall site.

743
00:41:06,652 --> 00:41:08,451
But after that, your restaurant closed down.

744
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:09,521
I wonder...

745
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:12,121
if something happened.

746
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:14,851
Why are you asking about that now?

747
00:41:15,362 --> 00:41:17,192
When we talked back then,

748
00:41:17,192 --> 00:41:20,032
JU Construction said it had nothing to do with them.

749
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:23,101
What do you mean?

750
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:26,072
Would you mind explaining one more time?

751
00:41:26,632 --> 00:41:28,471
We're investigating internal corruption.

752
00:41:28,471 --> 00:41:30,802
If you tell us, we might be able to help you.

753
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:33,041
Didn't you say you were from the Audit Team?

754
00:41:33,172 --> 00:41:34,842
Why are you acting innocent?

755
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:37,282
Gosh.

756
00:41:37,882 --> 00:41:41,652
The subcontractor holds the right to the dining halls on site.

757
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:43,581
In order to win the bidding,

758
00:41:43,982 --> 00:41:45,851
you have to pay the subcontractor money under the table.

759
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:48,451
It was supposed to be my turn,

760
00:41:48,692 --> 00:41:50,721
but they suddenly claimed the system changed.

761
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:53,262
How much money did you give, and to whom?

762
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:54,431
I paid 50,000 dollars.

763
00:41:54,992 --> 00:41:57,661
I paid the subcontractor 50,000 dollars.

764
00:41:58,262 --> 00:41:59,771
You can say that I was on the luckier side.

765
00:41:59,771 --> 00:42:01,572
A lot of people paid way more than that.

766
00:42:01,572 --> 00:42:03,001
Why didn't you report it to the police?

767
00:42:03,742 --> 00:42:05,911
How could you give someone that much money so easily?

768
00:42:06,012 --> 00:42:07,041
I heard I wouldn't be able to retrieve it...

769
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:08,212
even through the police.

770
00:42:09,581 --> 00:42:11,242
So I went to JU Construction,

771
00:42:11,911 --> 00:42:14,152
and they told me it had nothing to do with you.

772
00:42:15,251 --> 00:42:17,451
I was told to speak directly with the subcontractor.

773
00:42:18,422 --> 00:42:21,192
Instead, you cornered me...

774
00:42:21,192 --> 00:42:23,362
and said bribing was nothing to be proud of.

775
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:26,962
Do you have proof that you gave them money?

776
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:29,362
Anything will do.

777
00:42:32,232 --> 00:42:33,271
Just a minute.

778
00:42:46,811 --> 00:42:48,751
I don't know why I did that either.

779
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,851
I was desperate then.

780
00:42:55,692 --> 00:42:57,322
A paper even covered a story on him.

781
00:42:57,322 --> 00:42:59,831
I had no reason to doubt.

782
00:43:01,962 --> 00:43:03,431
That money was everything to me.

783
00:43:11,641 --> 00:43:13,541
- We're back. - We're back.

("I’ll Choose an On-Site Restaurant Like My Mother’s")

786
00:43:23,221 --> 00:43:24,751
The man in the picture...

787
00:43:24,851 --> 00:43:27,791
is the manager of the subcontractor who took 50,000 dollars as a bribe.

788
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:30,092
But there wasn't much of a proof.

789
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:37,302
(Choi Kwang Hyun of Choi Kwang Food...)

790
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:44,771
Looking at how she told us everything,

791
00:43:44,771 --> 00:43:46,971
I don't think she's the blackmailer.

792
00:43:47,512 --> 00:43:49,212
But it wasn't a waste of time.

793
00:43:49,212 --> 00:43:52,141
We were able to find out there was corruption.

794
00:43:53,081 --> 00:43:54,081
However,

795
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:56,581
there's one thing I don't want to believe.

796
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,192
It looks like someone from our company decided...

797
00:44:00,692 --> 00:44:02,362
to overlook the subcontractor's corruption.

798
00:44:11,262 --> 00:44:13,802
How does the director know the manager of the subcontractor?

799
00:44:14,532 --> 00:44:17,471
It must be the director then.

800
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:20,212
He could give the subcontractor power over the management.

801
00:44:20,942 --> 00:44:22,012
Right?

802
00:44:22,012 --> 00:44:23,911
He's more likely than Mr. Yang.

803
00:44:24,982 --> 00:44:28,012
Now all the puzzles are going into their places.

804
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:31,251
Mr. Shin, let's interview the director.

805
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,721
We'll find a hole when we interview him.

806
00:44:32,822 --> 00:44:35,521
We'll be able to find the blackmailer fast.

807
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:38,121
You can go home now.

808
00:44:38,822 --> 00:44:40,362
Okay. See you tomorrow.

809
00:44:54,311 --> 00:44:56,112
Stop making me flip out, you little...

810
00:44:56,112 --> 00:44:57,842
Small yet indisputable embezzlement.

811
00:44:57,842 --> 00:45:00,552
Mr. Lim sure enjoys doing that.

812
00:45:00,552 --> 00:45:02,552
Ms. Ok, do you know who this is?

813
00:45:02,552 --> 00:45:05,382
The manager of the subcontractor who took 50,000 dollars as a bribe.

814
00:45:05,382 --> 00:45:07,552
Who do you take me for?

815
00:45:16,762 --> 00:45:18,862
- Welcome home. - I'm home.

816
00:45:18,862 --> 00:45:20,971
- You look happy today. - I am.

817
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:22,771
Did you find the one who toyed around with food?

818
00:45:23,141 --> 00:45:25,811
Not yet. But I think we're onto them.

819
00:45:25,871 --> 00:45:29,382
- Really? - Mr. Shin is being careful,

820
00:45:29,382 --> 00:45:30,641
but I have a good feeling.

821
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:31,681
Why is that?

822
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:33,782
Because I played a part in narrowing down the possibilities.

823
00:45:33,782 --> 00:45:35,951
That's really cool.

824
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:39,351
I'm sure you still have a lot to learn.

825
00:45:39,351 --> 00:45:41,791
I'm Gu Han Soo, you know. I'm a fast learner.

826
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:42,791
I'll go get changed.

827
00:45:43,391 --> 00:45:45,561
- Good luck, Gu Han Soo! - Thank you.

(JU Construction)

829
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:13,708
I'm going to see the Subcontract Purchase Team.

830
00:46:31,797 --> 00:46:32,898
I'd like to request for an interview.

831
00:46:33,328 --> 00:46:34,728
Do as you please.

832
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,578
You know him, don't you?

833
00:46:43,078 --> 00:46:44,108
What if I do?

834
00:46:44,378 --> 00:46:46,677
Did you know he swindled money...

835
00:46:46,947 --> 00:46:48,708
in exchange for promising people the on-site restaurant?

836
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:50,677
Why must I know about that?

837
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:52,378
Because you're the person in charge.

838
00:46:52,648 --> 00:46:54,748
Why was the subcontractor given the right to manage it?

839
00:46:56,518 --> 00:46:58,018
Back in the day,

840
00:46:58,018 --> 00:46:59,628
we had a lot of work to do.

841
00:46:59,628 --> 00:47:02,628
So we split up the load with our subcontractors.

842
00:47:03,728 --> 00:47:05,257
Those people...

843
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:07,768
are people who help us.

844
00:47:09,097 --> 00:47:11,137
Did you give them the management right?

845
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:14,608
If I did,

846
00:47:15,407 --> 00:47:16,978
are you going to hold me responsible?

847
00:47:18,007 --> 00:47:19,007
Look here.

848
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:25,177
We manage over 100 subcontractors, got it?

849
00:47:25,478 --> 00:47:26,887
That place is another subcontractor.

850
00:47:27,217 --> 00:47:30,117
Whether subcontractors take bribes or not...

851
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:33,058
can't be managed by the Purchase Team.

852
00:47:33,088 --> 00:47:34,828
We're already busy as is...

853
00:47:34,887 --> 00:47:38,328
pressing those subcontractors to meet the due date!

854
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:41,597
I see.

855
00:47:42,768 --> 00:47:44,938
This is about me golfing together, right?

856
00:47:45,637 --> 00:47:47,237
Our company executives...

857
00:47:47,467 --> 00:47:49,737
go golfing with the subcontractor workers.

858
00:47:52,538 --> 00:47:54,177
I've got a lot to settle today.

859
00:47:54,978 --> 00:47:56,018
Leave.

860
00:47:56,018 --> 00:47:58,617
You're being audited, Director Pyeon.

861
00:48:00,018 --> 00:48:02,088
Rejecting the interview is your right as the auditee,

862
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:03,157
so I'll back off.

863
00:48:03,788 --> 00:48:06,788
But this will be on the official record.

864
00:48:08,257 --> 00:48:09,828

Good grief.

873
00:48:57,808 --> 00:48:58,808

A relative of Director Yang Jae Seung...

876
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:13,188
was running an on-site restaurant.

877
00:49:14,257 --> 00:49:17,828
We're investigating if Director Pyeon In Ho was solicited.

878
00:49:18,197 --> 00:49:20,128
You'll get nothing out of it.

879
00:49:20,628 --> 00:49:23,067
Why? Because there was no solicitation.

880
00:49:28,268 --> 00:49:30,608
I'll be plain honest with you.

881
00:49:30,978 --> 00:49:33,308
Listen carefully. Believe it or not, it's the truth.

882
00:49:33,878 --> 00:49:35,447
The two had a meal together.

883
00:49:36,217 --> 00:49:38,117
Mr. Yang paid for it with his personal credit card.

884
00:49:38,617 --> 00:49:41,617
He simply recommended the wife during the meal.

885
00:49:41,617 --> 00:49:42,688
Recommended, okay?

886
00:49:43,117 --> 00:49:44,117
That was it.

887
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:46,328
The fact that a superior bought a meal and made a recommendation...

888
00:49:46,328 --> 00:49:48,328
means he used his authority to put pressure.

889
00:49:48,328 --> 00:49:50,527
In your eyes, everything is corrupted,

890
00:49:50,527 --> 00:49:52,197
and everyone fools the other. Right?

891
00:49:52,628 --> 00:49:55,398
Director Pyeon doesn't even own a house.

892
00:49:55,998 --> 00:49:57,768

Mr. Yang and Director Pyeon...

896
00:50:11,918 --> 00:50:13,987
handed them in, having lost the workers' faith...

897
00:50:13,987 --> 00:50:15,018
due to the unreasonable audit.

898
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:19,188
If the two leave the company like this,

899
00:50:19,188 --> 00:50:21,828
the construction contract we won will take a big hit.

900
00:50:23,527 --> 00:50:26,597
Bring me one solid piece of evidence!

901
00:50:34,668 --> 00:50:35,907
You owe an apology, don't you?

00:51:00,898 --> 00:51:02,427
and post it...

905
00:51:03,938 --> 00:51:05,038
on every intranet forum.

906
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:09,007
So you're human, too.

907
00:51:13,547 --> 00:51:14,608
An agency?

908
00:51:15,478 --> 00:51:17,918
Gosh, I was on the Audit Team for four years...

909
00:51:17,918 --> 00:51:20,317
but had no idea that was the case for our on-site restaurants.

910
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:22,887
It was none of our concern when Mr. Kwak was here.

911
00:51:23,058 --> 00:51:24,257
That was our prime.

912
00:51:24,257 --> 00:51:25,987
And everything is blowing up now.

913
00:51:26,927 --> 00:51:27,987
Right.

914
00:51:28,027 --> 00:51:30,128
Mr. Shin will fix things.

915
00:51:30,858 --> 00:51:32,797
What is he? A doctor to fix things?

916
00:51:32,867 --> 00:51:34,597
Look at you people.

917
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:44,808
I will upload an apology letter...

918
00:51:45,538 --> 00:51:46,978
on the intranet forum.

919
00:51:51,248 --> 00:51:53,447
We'll stop auditing the on-site restaurants.

920
00:51:53,817 --> 00:51:56,288
Mr. Shin. Why all of a sudden?

921
00:51:57,317 --> 00:51:58,518
There's no evidence.

922
00:51:59,317 --> 00:52:01,188
The tip-off was made through a threat,

923
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:02,458
so it's not credible.

924
00:52:02,527 --> 00:52:04,558
In conclusion, the audit was unreasonable.

925
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:07,498
What about the person who sent the threatening letter?

926
00:52:07,498 --> 00:52:09,427
We should find them, no?

927
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:10,998
It was a laxative.

928
00:52:11,237 --> 00:52:12,597
Stop fussing over a prank.

929
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:15,168
Mr. Gu and Ms. Yoon.

930
00:52:15,168 --> 00:52:17,407
Put up the apology letter on all bulletin boards.

931
00:52:18,078 --> 00:52:20,808
The on-site restaurants will run again as soon as...

932
00:52:20,808 --> 00:52:23,018
the hospital identifies the medicine composition.

933
00:52:23,547 --> 00:52:25,518
Gradually, starting tomorrow,

934
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:28,047
starting with our cafeteria, the restaurants will reopen.

935
00:52:28,248 --> 00:52:30,788
Mr. Shin, if we reopen the cafeteria,

936
00:52:30,788 --> 00:52:32,188
it could become a target again.

937
00:52:46,438 --> 00:52:48,737
(Letter of Apology)

938
00:52:49,507 --> 00:52:50,637
Greetings,

939
00:52:51,038 --> 00:52:52,538
executives and staff members of JU Construction.

940
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:54,878
This is Audit Team Manager Shin Cha Il.

941
00:52:54,878 --> 00:52:56,248
(Letter of Apology)

942
00:52:56,248 --> 00:52:58,677
Firstly, my apologies...

943
00:52:58,677 --> 00:53:00,588
for demoralizing everyone...

944
00:53:00,788 --> 00:53:04,058
with an unreasonable audit despite the lack of sufficient evidence.

945
00:53:04,657 --> 00:53:08,257
My deepest apologies for causing pain, anxiety,

946
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:10,228
and extreme concern.

947
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:12,728
It was my carelessness to launch an audit...

948
00:53:12,728 --> 00:53:15,027
with a report that had little or no credibility.

949
00:53:15,027 --> 00:53:16,027
(Letter of Apology)

950
00:53:16,597 --> 00:53:17,998
Another apologies...

951
00:53:18,268 --> 00:53:20,867
to Director Yang Jae Seung and Director Pyeon In Ho...

952
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:22,038
for causing damage.

953
00:53:22,768 --> 00:53:24,237
I am filled with regret.

954
00:53:24,608 --> 00:53:26,808
Please accept my sincere apology.

955
00:53:26,808 --> 00:53:27,847
(Subcontracts and Procurement Director Pyeon In Ho)

956
00:53:27,878 --> 00:53:28,907
As of this moment,

957
00:53:29,308 --> 00:53:31,317
the on-site restaurant operation rights audit...

958
00:53:31,317 --> 00:53:32,677
will be suspended.

959
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:35,317
From now on, I will exercise prudence.

960
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:39,217
I will endeavor to conduct a proper audit.

961
00:53:40,027 --> 00:53:42,728
My sincerest apologies once again.

962
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:46,527
I don't understand.

963
00:53:48,168 --> 00:53:49,367
Why did Mr. Shin...

964
00:53:50,038 --> 00:53:51,398
It must be President Hwang's order.

965
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:54,637
Do you really think he's obeying his order?

966
00:53:55,137 --> 00:53:56,237
We're talking about Mr. Shin.

967
00:53:56,907 --> 00:53:58,007
I doubt it.

968
00:53:58,007 --> 00:53:59,208
Remember?

969
00:53:59,878 --> 00:54:03,148
An audit team member gets paid to work for their private interest.

970
00:54:07,288 --> 00:54:08,788
(Uncle)

971
00:54:11,688 --> 00:54:12,987
Let me answer this call.

972
00:54:13,257 --> 00:54:14,628
Okay. I'll take that.

973
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:19,527
(Letter of Apology)

974
00:54:28,538 --> 00:54:29,567
This is Yoon Seo Jin.

975
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:30,777
Don't talk. Just listen.

976
00:54:31,378 --> 00:54:33,777
I don't think I gave you an answer back then.

977
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:36,878
Had the union members' money not been found,

978
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:40,387
the company would've suffered a huge blow to its reputation.

979
00:54:41,748 --> 00:54:43,858
I didn't stop them from finding it.

980
00:54:44,717 --> 00:54:47,328
I had a plan of my own.

981
00:54:49,288 --> 00:54:50,358
Shin Cha Il...

982
00:54:51,128 --> 00:54:54,527
prioritizes his cause more than the company's interest.

983
00:54:55,697 --> 00:54:57,197
I'm different from him.

984
00:54:58,197 --> 00:55:00,268
Rather than a useless cause,

985
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:02,268
I will do...

986
00:55:02,668 --> 00:55:05,777
what I must to protect our company...

987
00:55:06,808 --> 00:55:08,347
and workers.

988
00:55:10,918 --> 00:55:12,347
I feel like a stranger, right?

989
00:55:13,317 --> 00:55:14,447
But listen.

990
00:55:15,088 --> 00:55:16,657
The company...

991
00:55:17,487 --> 00:55:18,688
is like a battlefield to me.

992
00:55:20,088 --> 00:55:22,387
I must be a savage to protect my family.

993
00:55:23,197 --> 00:55:24,958
And you know who I consider my family, right?

994
00:55:25,998 --> 00:55:28,527
It's you and my older sister.

995
00:55:30,697 --> 00:55:32,438
I'll go to my sister's house today.

996
00:55:32,637 --> 00:55:34,108
Shall we grab dinner together?

997
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:36,237
All right, Uncle.

998
00:55:36,237 --> 00:55:37,277
Great.

999
00:55:47,418 --> 00:55:48,487
Come in.

1000
00:55:49,987 --> 00:55:52,188
Goodness, Mr. Yang.

1001
00:55:52,188 --> 00:55:53,757
You had it tough until now.

1002
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:55,688
I knew it.

1003
00:55:55,688 --> 00:55:58,058
I knew you were innocent.

1004
00:55:58,058 --> 00:55:59,097
You would never, right?

1005
00:55:59,097 --> 00:56:01,067
You would never do such a reckless thing.

1006
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:02,668
You're upright. What is it?

1007
00:56:08,007 --> 00:56:10,478
I may be leaving, but I'm always on your side.

1008
00:56:10,478 --> 00:56:12,907
I'll be more than happy as long as you remember that.

1009
00:56:19,248 --> 00:56:21,148
- Aren't you going home? - I will.

1010
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:23,858
But Mr. Shin is nowhere to be seen.

1011
00:56:23,918 --> 00:56:24,918
Gosh.

1012
00:56:25,717 --> 00:56:28,358
Since the audit is over, how about some fried chicken and beer?

1013
00:56:28,358 --> 00:56:30,527
I'm afraid I have plans tonight.

1014
00:56:30,558 --> 00:56:31,858
I'm in a rush, too.

1015
00:56:31,927 --> 00:56:34,597
Goodness gracious, you're all lousy.

1016
00:56:34,697 --> 00:56:35,867
I'm off.

1017
00:56:36,597 --> 00:56:37,797
We're leaving first, Han Soo.

1018
00:56:38,498 --> 00:56:40,308
- Okay. Bye. - Go home.

1019
00:56:57,387 --> 00:56:59,828
(Letter of Apology)

1020
00:57:06,128 --> 00:57:08,398
Oh, right. Your brother's condition has improved significantly.

1021
00:57:09,398 --> 00:57:12,168
I'll tell Dae Woong to leave the company.

1022
00:57:12,297 --> 00:57:15,338
Everything at JU Construction will go back to the way it should be.

1023
00:57:17,677 --> 00:57:18,907
It should go back...

1024
00:57:21,347 --> 00:57:22,547
to how it should be.

1025
00:57:43,597 --> 00:57:44,697
(Contents of the threatening note)

1026
00:57:44,697 --> 00:57:46,907
(Including the cafeteria at the head office!)

1027
00:57:49,668 --> 00:57:50,808
Hang on.

1028
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:54,907
Only the staff are allowed to eat at our cafeteria.

1029
00:57:55,748 --> 00:57:57,817
Does this really involve an insider?

1030
00:58:18,797 --> 00:58:20,438
(Manager Shin Cha Il)

1031
00:58:23,737 --> 00:58:28,547
Mr. Shin joined the team about 20 days ago.

1032
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:31,978
The blackmailer knew...

1033
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:35,788
our team had a new manager.

1034
00:58:38,418 --> 00:58:39,858
Someone in the company...

1035
00:58:44,728 --> 00:58:46,328
The blackmailer is an insider.

1036
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:49,567
Mr. Shin...

1037
00:58:50,268 --> 00:58:51,597
knew that already.

1038
00:58:51,898 --> 00:58:54,237
We'll stop auditing the on-site restaurants.

1039
00:58:54,237 --> 00:58:56,268
Gradually, starting tomorrow,

1040
00:58:56,268 --> 00:58:59,208
starting with our cafeteria, the restaurants will reopen.

1041
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:01,108
Mr. Shin, if we reopen the cafeteria,

1042
00:59:01,108 --> 00:59:02,507
it could become a target again.

1043
00:59:02,777 --> 00:59:04,148
He reduced the targets...

1044
00:59:04,148 --> 00:59:06,748
from all the restaurants to just our cafeteria...

1045
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:08,518
and announced the audit was over...

1046
00:59:10,117 --> 00:59:11,817
to goad the blackmailer to attack.

1047
00:59:56,027 --> 00:59:57,297
(Dark Soy Sauce)

1048
01:01:40,108 --> 01:01:41,268
Mr. Shin, over there!

1049
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:01,128
Tell me what floor it stops at.

1050
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:10,838
The rooftop.

1051
01:02:16,637 --> 01:02:17,878
(Stairwell)

1052
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:25,248
(Rooftop)

1053
01:03:01,288 --> 01:03:04,288
(The Auditors)

1054
01:03:04,317 --> 01:03:05,558
(Special thanks to Cho Han Cheul,)

1055
01:03:05,558 --> 01:03:06,757
(Woo Ji Hyun, Hong Soo Hyun, Kim Soo Jin.)

1056
01:03:24,777 --> 01:03:26,208
Did you send this?

1057
01:03:26,237 --> 01:03:28,507
The Audit Team caught the blackmailer.

1058
01:03:28,677 --> 01:03:30,447
How about we approach them first...

1059
01:03:30,447 --> 01:03:32,978
so they can report to us freely...

1060
01:03:32,978 --> 01:03:34,918
by putting up this notice?

1061
01:03:35,748 --> 01:03:36,887
What's he doing?

1062
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:39,058
I want to report workplace bullying.

1063
01:03:39,918 --> 01:03:41,288
- Yoon Woo. - Don't come closer!

1064
01:03:41,328 --> 01:03:42,387
What's this for?

1065
01:03:42,387 --> 01:03:44,458
I never bullied or verbally abused anyone.

1066
01:03:44,728 --> 01:03:46,797
I heard President Hwang told you to let it go.

1067
01:03:47,768 --> 01:03:49,097
J-BIMS is almost done,

1068
01:03:49,097 --> 01:03:51,338
and I get how anxious you are about it.

1069
01:03:52,467 --> 01:03:54,308
It's no fun to release it at once.

1070
01:03:54,467 --> 01:03:55,708
I'll make him wither away.

1071
01:03:56,668 --> 01:03:57,978
Slowly.
