183
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:58,567
What a waste that we don't get along.

184
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:02,908
Cancel Ms. Yu's transfer.

185
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:05,038
Keep the union rep's statement as it was.

186
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:07,977
Then your mistake can be undone.

187
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:10,408
- There won't be any audit, either. - Your threat is laughable.

188
00:11:10,408 --> 00:11:12,717
The company must take responsibility for its workers.

189
00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:15,118
That's easy for you to say since it's not your money.

190
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:18,388
I only do what will benefit me.

191
00:11:18,988 --> 00:11:21,258
Finding the money and returning it to the union members...

192
00:11:21,258 --> 00:11:22,988
will bring many benefits to you.

193
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:26,197
The company's reputation and the workers' devotion will rise.

194
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:27,227
And if the money is lost forever?

195
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:29,427
Will you take responsibility?

196
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,577
I will.

197
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:42,408
I will hand in...

198
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:44,378
my resignation letter.

199
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:48,648
Is your resignation letter worth 3.4 million dollars?

200
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:55,288
The conditions must fit the bill to make a deal, you punk.

201
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:57,288
I'll take your resignation letter...

202
00:11:57,358 --> 00:11:59,057
as collateral for the 3.4 million dollars.

203
00:11:59,697 --> 00:12:00,758
Get us back the money,

204
00:12:00,758 --> 00:12:01,998
or you'll have to cough it up somehow.

205
00:12:01,998 --> 00:12:02,998
How about it?

206
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:05,238
Fine.

207
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:08,608
Yu Mi Kyung's transfer has just been canceled.

208
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:10,837
You take care of the union rep's testimony.

209
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:12,108
Three days is all you have.

210
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,477
If you fail to settle it by then,

211
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,108
Ms. Yu will be sent to the US right away,

212
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:19,977
and you'll be blamed for the 3.4 million dollars.

Yes, this is Gu Han Soo.

215
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:45,408
The union rep testified that it was a lone act.

216
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:48,807
Ms. Yu won't fly out for the next three days.

217
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:51,918
I'll look into what Kang Myung Chul is thinking.

218
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:54,587
You are to pass on the situation to the others.

219
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:55,918
Understood.

220
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:14,837
We need the energy to work now.

221
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:17,608
The union rep stated it was a lone crime.

222
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:20,778
We're the ones who have to find the money now.

223
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:24,047
Was Vice President Hwang behind it?

224
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:26,418
Yes.

225
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:29,587
Make sure to have some.

226
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:48,337
The Audit Team exists to ensure ethical management.

227
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:51,138
Ethical management is...

228
00:13:51,408 --> 00:13:53,608
the most important company value these days.

229
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:05,087
Any intellectual is expected to obey...

230
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:07,957
the code of conduct I've explained so far.

231
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:09,288
Ladies and gentlemen,

232
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:11,158
I hope you can all work with passion.

233
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:13,797
That's it for the lecture. Thank you.

236
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:30,108
The man who sexually harassed my wife is...

237
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:31,148
visiting me at work?

238
00:14:31,677 --> 00:14:32,817
I should report you to the police.

239
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:34,788
Ms. Yu Mi Kyung's transfer has been canceled.

240
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:39,158
It's only a matter of time...

241
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:41,087
before we confirm that you were in it with her.

242
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:43,258
And now, you're threatening me?

243
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,957
This is serious.

244
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:47,597
If you quit now, you'll look suspicious.

245
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:49,498
If you spend the money, we'll track your funds.

246
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:51,437
You're in a difficult situation now.

247
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:54,038
Well...

248
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:58,337
Why are you worried about me?

249
00:14:59,138 --> 00:15:01,248
Snap out of it, Mr. Shin Cha Il.

250
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:04,278
The Audit Team's manager...

251
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,518
who holds lectures on professional ethics...

252
00:15:07,347 --> 00:15:08,748
committed embezzlement?

253
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:10,087
"Embezzlement?"

254
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,258
There's some dust here.

255
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:41,288
Stop putting on an act.

256
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:43,187
Why the long face? Don't fake it in front of me.

257
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:45,317
I know you're all excited inside.

258
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:48,258
Sit.

259
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:53,398
Your transfer has been canceled.

260
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:57,297
- Pardon me? - I gave Shin Cha Il three days,

261
00:15:58,197 --> 00:16:00,168
so just lie low for the next three days.

262
00:16:01,937 --> 00:16:03,008
Where's the money?

263
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:08,847
Hide it well in a safe place...

264
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:10,047
and guard it with your life.

265
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:13,118
You can go.

266
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:36,108
I was told the 50-dollar bills were all checked, bundled, and sealed...

267
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:38,608
and that they could all be traced with the serial numbers.

268
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:40,207
I'm not an idiot.

269
00:16:40,577 --> 00:16:41,947
Knowing that,

270
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:44,847
why would I think I could pocket such money all by myself?

271
00:16:50,988 --> 00:16:51,988
Mr. Shin.

272
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:53,457
Let's start the meeting.

273
00:16:56,687 --> 00:16:57,687
Okay.

274
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:01,158
Oh, boy.

275
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,668
Kang Myung Chul will try to launder the money.

276
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:07,837
The cash was taken out as sealed bundles,

277
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:09,937
and the serial numbers on the bills run in sequence,

278
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:11,638
so he has to launder it to be able to use it.

279
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:15,547
But the union rep said he did it alone.

280
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:16,748
Right?

281
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:19,477
So, why do we have to find the money?

282
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:22,018
Besides, Vice President Hwang told us not to, you know?

283
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:26,258
We should find out what methods he could use to launder the money.

284
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:28,628
- You brat. - There are a lot of ways.

285
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:31,597
He could use cryptocurrency or online gambling sites.

286
00:17:31,898 --> 00:17:32,998
He won't do that.

287
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,497
That leaves a trace.

288
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,598
Also, they take hefty commission fees.

289
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:37,937
Kang Myung Chul won't use...

290
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:40,068
such easy, dumb methods.

291
00:17:42,168 --> 00:17:44,237
What do you think, Ms. Yoon?

292
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:47,108
I'm...

293
00:17:47,677 --> 00:17:50,477
not sure if it's right to move ahead with the audit...

294
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:51,648
when the boss told us...

295
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:53,517
to drop it.

296
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,747
Exactly. You get what I'm saying.

297
00:17:57,687 --> 00:17:58,687
Hey.

298
00:18:03,128 --> 00:18:04,257
I'll take responsibility...

299
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:05,628
for everything as the team's manager.

300
00:18:06,598 --> 00:18:08,328
I'll investigate Kang Myung Chul.

301
00:18:08,427 --> 00:18:10,868
I want you guys to look into The Myeong Construction.

302
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:13,767
We must find evidence of his money laundering activities.

303
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:16,207
That's it for the meeting.

304
00:18:16,937 --> 00:18:17,977
Okay.

305
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:24,308
Seo Jin.

306
00:18:24,777 --> 00:18:28,717
We have to help that old man get his money back.

307
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:44,098
- Hello. - Hello.

308
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:54,308
(JU Construction)

309
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:57,677

310
00:19:00,947 --> 00:19:02,088
Hey.

311
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:04,618
The doors are closing.

312
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:10,158
About Shin Cha Il.

313
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,798
He'll voluntarily hand in his resignation in three days.

314
00:19:13,658 --> 00:19:15,527
And he'll have to repay us the 3.4 million dollars.

315
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:20,868
Do whatever you want.

316
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:24,568
What are you cooking up?

317
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:27,037
I thought it was fishy when you gave me full authority...

318
00:19:27,037 --> 00:19:28,148
to audit Ms. Yu.

319
00:19:29,947 --> 00:19:31,348
I was so preoccupied with Shin Cha Il...

320
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:32,348
that I let it slip away.

321
00:19:32,517 --> 00:19:34,118
If you manage to prevent losses...

322
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:36,517
and make Mr. Shin quit as you had wished,

323
00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:37,618
that's good enough.

324
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:39,187
What else could there be?

325
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,158
There's definitely something else.

326
00:19:49,868 --> 00:19:50,868
Aren't you getting out?

327
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:00,378
The doors are closing.

328
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:05,418
Gosh, seriously.

329
00:20:05,848 --> 00:20:08,687
How are we supposed to investigate a different company?

330
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:11,757
Are we seriously going to do this?

331
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:14,287
Yes, of course. We have to obey Mr. Shin's orders.

332
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:15,427
That's right.

333
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:17,358
In this office, he's the King.

334
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:19,427
King, my foot.

335
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:20,727
Go and make me a cup of coffee.

336
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:23,997
Darn it.

337
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:30,368
(A new message from Gu Han Soo)

338
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:32,537
Seo Jin.

339
00:20:32,537 --> 00:20:35,177
The Myeong Construction is building an apartment complex in Dongseo-gu.

340
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:36,578
Let's go there together.

341
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:41,148
You want to check their construction site?

342
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:42,148
You're going overboard.

343
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:48,588
(Yoon Seo Jin)

344
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,427
Did Vice President Hwang threaten you by any chance?

345
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,298
I've experienced it too, so I know what it's like.

346
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,507
Don't keep it bottled up inside. Let's solve the problem together.

347
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:03,737
Shall we visit the Ministry of Employment and Labor?

348
00:21:06,677 --> 00:21:08,578
Let's visit The Myeong's construction site.

349
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:24,588
About Kang Myung Chul.

350
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:26,957
How could he do that when he's an audit manager himself?

351
00:21:27,957 --> 00:21:30,398
Gosh, I'm starting to fear people.

352
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:32,638
Just don't trust anyone.

353
00:21:33,338 --> 00:21:35,108
Then you won't be hurt.

354
00:21:37,168 --> 00:21:39,838
I don't want to live like that.

355
00:21:41,078 --> 00:21:44,207
What will Mr. Shin do if he fails to find the money?

356
00:21:44,277 --> 00:21:45,517
Does he have another plan?

357
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:48,148
Why are you worried about that? Don't worry.

358
00:21:48,217 --> 00:21:51,048
I know we'll find the money.

359
00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:02,267
Hello, can I ask you a question?

360
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:08,368
Hello, can I ask you a question?

361
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,668
Did anything change at work recently?

362
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:12,177
What are you talking about? I'm busy now.

363
00:22:12,237 --> 00:22:14,177
- Anything you can think of... - I'm busy now.

364
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:19,717
Hello!

365
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:22,318
- Yes. - Has anything changed at work?

366
00:22:23,318 --> 00:22:24,447
Has anything changed?

367
00:22:24,447 --> 00:22:27,558
Oh, right. These days, they give us noodles as a snack.

368
00:22:27,757 --> 00:22:29,257
We used to get bread and milk.

369
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:31,628
We can take a longer break to go to the dining hall and come back.

370
00:22:32,257 --> 00:22:34,098
- It's nice. - Noodles?

371
00:22:34,497 --> 00:22:35,668
Anything else?

372
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:38,298
Can you think of anything else?

373
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:58,558
You know, the way things are done these days makes me a bit sad.

374
00:23:00,217 --> 00:23:01,217
Why?

375
00:23:01,217 --> 00:23:03,487
It's so cold.

376
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:06,158
I have to worry about so many things just to have dinner with someone.

377
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:09,227
If I treat you this time, you can treat me next time.

378
00:23:09,227 --> 00:23:10,568
You know?

379
00:23:10,697 --> 00:23:12,568
Yes. You're absolutely right.

380
00:23:12,638 --> 00:23:13,668
After all,

381
00:23:14,197 --> 00:23:16,868
we are working toward the same goal.

382
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:21,108
We have to understand each other to work well together.

383
00:23:21,277 --> 00:23:23,878
How will we understand each other when we can't even be friends?

384
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:26,618
I'm equally frustrated too, Mr. Hwang.

385
00:23:27,578 --> 00:23:29,787
We should vent to each other and let it all out today.

386
00:23:29,947 --> 00:23:31,957
Then shall we be friends?

387
00:23:32,217 --> 00:23:33,888
I knew you'd get it.

388
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:18,368
What's the matter?

389
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:22,168
What do you call this?

390
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:24,267
How about a skirmish?

391
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:25,977
Or leave.

392
00:24:32,578 --> 00:24:34,217
Where did you hide the money?

393
00:24:34,918 --> 00:24:37,918
- What? - Not home. That could be searched.

394
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:41,187
You deceived people so you wouldn't leave it with anyone.

395
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:44,828
You'd have hidden it in your vicinity.

396
00:24:47,227 --> 00:24:48,427
Sexual assault,

397
00:24:48,927 --> 00:24:50,168
blackmail,

398
00:24:50,368 --> 00:24:51,568
and defamation too?

399
00:24:53,098 --> 00:24:54,298
Sir.

400
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:56,937
Your phone's ringing.

401
00:24:59,677 --> 00:25:00,838
Mr. Shin.

402
00:25:01,308 --> 00:25:02,777
If I see you once more,

403
00:25:04,507 --> 00:25:06,277
I'll take action then.

404
00:25:06,818 --> 00:25:07,947
Okay?

405
00:25:18,858 --> 00:25:20,227
(Audit Team)

406
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,697
The Myeong Construction was restructured last year.

407
00:25:22,697 --> 00:25:26,298
Their audit team went from 7 members to 3.

408
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:27,668
They're so financially strapped...

409
00:25:27,668 --> 00:25:29,568
that there's a rumor they'll be delisted.

410
00:25:30,437 --> 00:25:32,608
Kang Myung Chul would've felt threatened.

411
00:25:34,477 --> 00:25:35,648
Okay, then.

412
00:25:35,777 --> 00:25:36,908
Good job, everyone.

413
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:39,418
I have some quality info.

414
00:25:39,717 --> 00:25:42,418
There was a rumor Kang Myung Chul lost everything in the stock market.

415
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:43,648
That's why his wife left him.

416
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:45,457
That means...

417
00:25:45,457 --> 00:25:47,918
his divorce wasn't a sham just for show,

418
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:49,328
so there's reasonable doubt...

419
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:50,588
we're barking up the wrong...

420
00:25:50,588 --> 00:25:51,898
That's motive for embezzlement.

421
00:25:57,068 --> 00:25:58,068
I went to...

422
00:25:58,068 --> 00:26:00,098
The Myeong Construction's site.

423
00:26:00,598 --> 00:26:04,537
The workers said they got noodles instead of bread and milk,

424
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:06,608
and they used to be paid daily in cash,

425
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:08,408
but now the money's wired to them.

426
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:12,017
That's all I found out. Sorry.

427
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:14,818
They paid the workers in cash?

428
00:26:14,878 --> 00:26:15,947
Yes.

429
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:17,217
That's odd.

430
00:26:17,217 --> 00:26:19,058
For insurance...

431
00:26:19,058 --> 00:26:20,918
and tax calculation purposes,

432
00:26:20,918 --> 00:26:22,527
laborers are never paid in cash.

433
00:26:22,687 --> 00:26:23,828
The pay is wired directly.

434
00:26:23,828 --> 00:26:25,398
When were they paid in cash?

435
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:28,098
This was in early January...

436
00:26:28,098 --> 00:26:29,328
and just for five days.

437
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:32,697
The Myeong's site was a popular place to work at.

438
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:35,237
- So many people flocked to work. - Naturally.

439
00:26:35,237 --> 00:26:38,007
- Cash pay means they pay no tax. - Right.

440
00:26:38,477 --> 00:26:40,108
The Myeong's finance team.

441
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:41,777
Look up their names and ages.

442
00:26:41,848 --> 00:26:42,947
Okay.

443
00:26:43,648 --> 00:26:45,618
Senior Manager Kim Chang Geol, age 51, male.

444
00:26:45,618 --> 00:26:47,918
Junior Manager Son Won Seok, age 39, male.

445
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,418
Junior Manager Lee Yeon Ji, aged 37, female.

446
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:51,918
Employee Lee Yoon Jae...

447
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:53,058
Your phone's ringing.

448
00:26:53,588 --> 00:26:55,257
(Lee Yeon Ji)

449
00:26:58,598 --> 00:26:59,757
Kang Myung Chul.

450
00:27:00,257 --> 00:27:02,997
He tested his money laundering by paying the workers in cash.

451
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:07,467
Isn't that a bit of a stretch?

452
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:10,237
Junior Manager Lee Yeon Ji called Kang Myung Chul.

453
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:11,338
Late at night.

454
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,437
Late at night?

455
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:14,108
They're on different teams.

456
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:17,677
Why would she call the manager of the audit team late at night?

457
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:19,477
If we suppose they're accomplices...

458
00:27:19,477 --> 00:27:20,818
A junior manager of finance...

459
00:27:20,947 --> 00:27:22,947
- could help launder money. - Right?

460
00:27:22,947 --> 00:27:25,457
- Yes. - You watched too many dramas.

461
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:27,888
Kang Myung Chul would've given the cash...

462
00:27:28,287 --> 00:27:30,558
meant to pay the workers with to Lee Yeon Ji.

463
00:27:31,088 --> 00:27:33,058
- It's not hard to do. - It's not.

464
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:34,398
(The Myeong, Finance Team, Lee Yeon Ji)

465
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:38,398
The safe is unlocked.

466
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:40,168
Lee would've swapped the bills...

467
00:27:40,168 --> 00:27:42,737
with those withdrawn from The Myeong's account.

468
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:46,477
The cash that Kang Myung Chul embezzled...

469
00:27:47,437 --> 00:27:49,777
was paid to the laborers at the site.

470
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:51,548
- A drink? - Here.

471
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:53,947
The bills were then scattered,

472
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:56,918
making them impossible to trace by serial number.

473
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:00,017
Then Lee Yeon Ji...

474
00:28:00,017 --> 00:28:01,588
hands over cash withdrawn from The Myeong's account...

475
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:03,787
to Kang Myung Chul, concluding the scheme.

476
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:09,927
The union rep withdrew 3.4 million on December 27 of last year,

477
00:28:10,197 --> 00:28:13,398
and Kang Myung Chul took the bag of cash that day.

478
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:16,368
Early January fits the timeline.

479
00:28:17,338 --> 00:28:19,237
When word got out and workers flocked,

480
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:21,308
he felt threatened and stopped the test.

481
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:22,977
That sounds plausible too.

482
00:28:24,308 --> 00:28:25,477
After that test,

483
00:28:25,548 --> 00:28:27,777
he'd have laundered more money in other ways.

484
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:29,348
It must be looked into.

485
00:28:29,987 --> 00:28:31,787
- Mr. Gu. - Yes?

486
00:28:32,187 --> 00:28:34,457
Look up Kang and Lee's social networking accounts.

487
00:28:35,187 --> 00:28:37,658
They must be close if they planned this together.

488
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,828
Yes, sir. I'll do that.

489
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:41,967
I'll get you their phone numbers.

490
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,128
Okay, thanks.

491
00:28:55,648 --> 00:28:56,677
Come in.

492
00:28:56,677 --> 00:28:57,747
(Vice President Hwang Dae Woong)

493
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,148
I have some quality info.

494
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:07,287
Quality info?

495
00:29:07,358 --> 00:29:08,457
Yes.

496
00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:09,757
If it's not that...

497
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:21,298
I think Shin Cha Il found out how the money was laundered.

498
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:23,207
No, he found out. I'm sure of it.

499
00:29:23,308 --> 00:29:26,078
Fortunately, he hasn't found the cash yet.

500
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:30,078
But as you know, life moves in mysterious ways,

501
00:29:30,108 --> 00:29:32,078
and it's complicated and ever-changing.

502
00:29:32,078 --> 00:29:33,277
- If... - Get Shin Cha Il.

503
00:29:33,348 --> 00:29:34,378
Yes, sir.

504
00:29:37,388 --> 00:29:38,588
Mr. Moon.

505
00:29:47,497 --> 00:29:49,168
"Jeju Island in August?"

506
00:29:50,598 --> 00:29:51,767
(Kang Myung Chul)

507
00:29:56,207 --> 00:29:57,668
(Kang Myung Chul)

508
00:29:58,037 --> 00:29:59,237
August?

509
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:01,037
This photo...

510
00:30:07,747 --> 00:30:08,747
(Copy)

511
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:39,717
Why haven't you reported yet?

512
00:30:39,747 --> 00:30:42,487
You get a comprehensive report when the case is concluded.

513
00:30:43,318 --> 00:30:45,048
You fight me at every turn.

514
00:30:45,658 --> 00:30:47,687
Do you know why I dislike you?

515
00:30:49,388 --> 00:30:51,088
I'll explain, so listen.

516
00:30:52,358 --> 00:30:55,997
I loved to play in the sand as a kid.

517
00:30:56,727 --> 00:30:59,398
But ants walked up in single file and got in the way.

518
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:01,767
"Darn you all."

519
00:31:01,767 --> 00:31:04,007
"Which of you shall I kill first?"

520
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:06,477
Just when I was wondering,

521
00:31:06,777 --> 00:31:08,848
I saw one ant break from the line...

522
00:31:09,747 --> 00:31:12,447
and walk off carrying a piece of food...

523
00:31:12,447 --> 00:31:15,118
that was massively bigger than its body.

524
00:31:21,257 --> 00:31:22,427
I killed that one.

525
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:25,287
Isolated and self-willed.

526
00:31:25,287 --> 00:31:26,658
He who stands alone.

527
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,527
What other expression is there?

528
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:31,368
Don Quixote.

529
00:31:31,497 --> 00:31:33,467
They're the types I hate the most.

530
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:35,237
Isn't it our rule...

531
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:38,168
to stay in line and go with the flow?

532
00:31:38,878 --> 00:31:40,207
Who do you think you are...

533
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:42,247
that you alone say no when everyone says yes...

534
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:43,477
This is Shin Cha Il.

535
00:31:44,308 --> 00:31:45,418
Very well.

536
00:31:47,318 --> 00:31:49,447
If that's all, I'll get going.

537
00:31:54,858 --> 00:31:56,927
I really will crush you under my foot.

538
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:04,427
If you look here,

539
00:32:04,427 --> 00:32:06,668
I think it was taken at a Jeju Island hotel.

540
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:10,668
A photo like this makes me think they're dating.

541
00:32:11,537 --> 00:32:12,808
What happens to Ms. Yu?

542
00:32:15,237 --> 00:32:16,977

548
00:32:49,078 --> 00:32:50,777
Do you know he has a girlfriend?

549
00:33:03,457 --> 00:33:05,287
He'll have told you what happens afterward.

550
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:07,457
That he knows someone in finance who will help him.

551
00:33:08,298 --> 00:33:10,227
It was possible because they were dating.

01:02:36,116 --> 01:02:39,047
Here, Min Seok. Eat as much as you want.

908
01:02:39,717 --> 01:02:41,987
Thank you for helping me get my money back.

909
01:02:41,987 --> 01:02:43,317
I just did my job. That's all.

910
01:02:43,317 --> 01:02:44,627
- My gosh. - I'm sorry you went through that.

911
01:02:44,757 --> 01:02:47,357
By the way, how come Seo Jin isn't here?

912
01:02:47,427 --> 01:02:50,697
Well, she had to take care of something.

913
01:02:50,697 --> 01:02:52,496
I miss her.

914
01:02:52,496 --> 01:02:53,697
You do?

915
01:02:53,697 --> 01:02:55,297
I promise you I'll bring her next time.

916
01:02:55,766 --> 01:02:57,197
But you have to eat a lot today, Min Hee.

917
01:02:57,967 --> 01:02:58,967
Here.

918
01:02:59,467 --> 01:03:01,677
- You too, sir. Have some. - Yes, all right.

919
01:03:05,246 --> 01:03:07,246
How is it, kids? Isn't it good?

920
01:03:07,547 --> 01:03:09,147
- Yes, it's yummy. - Right?

921
01:03:10,047 --> 01:03:13,016
Actually, the union rep called me earlier.

922
01:03:13,587 --> 01:03:15,357
I guess they let you make phone calls...

923
01:03:15,357 --> 01:03:16,717
in a holding cell these days?

924
01:03:16,717 --> 01:03:18,386
What did he say?

925
01:03:18,456 --> 01:03:20,587
He kept apologizing over and over.

926
01:03:21,056 --> 01:03:23,726
He said he wasn't thinking straight because he was so broke.

927
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,627
He was bawling.

928
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:27,496
So I told him...

929
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:29,936
never to make the same mistake again.

930
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:33,366
You forgave him?

931
01:03:33,366 --> 01:03:35,306
How are you going to live your life...

932
01:03:35,306 --> 01:03:37,476
if you hate people just because you've been scammed once?

933
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:39,277
Life is short.

934
01:03:43,047 --> 01:03:44,076
Eat as much as you like.

935
01:04:11,476 --> 01:04:12,677
- Get going. Bye. - Good night, sir.

936
01:04:17,246 --> 01:04:18,246
Hey, kiddo.

937
01:04:18,246 --> 01:04:19,286
What are you doing here at this hour?

938
01:04:19,786 --> 01:04:21,556
I have something to tell you.

939
01:04:21,556 --> 01:04:22,656
Okay, what is it?

940
01:04:23,817 --> 01:04:24,987
I also helped the union members...

941
01:04:26,627 --> 01:04:27,697
get their money back.

942
01:04:28,897 --> 01:04:30,897
They're all struggling financially,

943
01:04:31,096 --> 01:04:32,826
and they'd be homeless without that money,

944
01:04:33,397 --> 01:04:35,496
so I thought helping them was the right thing to do.

945
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:37,436
That's why I helped Mr. Shin.

946
01:04:39,866 --> 01:04:40,906
Good.

947
01:04:41,706 --> 01:04:43,476
Of course, you should help your manager.

948
01:04:43,476 --> 01:04:46,246
Why did you tell us not to find the money?

949
01:04:50,647 --> 01:04:51,717
Did you have dinner?

950
01:04:52,186 --> 01:04:54,487
How about I flaunt my cooking skills for you? It's been a while.

951
01:04:54,717 --> 01:04:55,817
Kimchi fried rice.

952
01:04:56,116 --> 01:04:57,587
You like kimchi fried rice.

953
01:04:58,927 --> 01:05:01,456
Sorry. Maybe another time.

954
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:15,136
Darn it.

955
01:05:19,877 --> 01:05:20,947
- Hello. - Let's eat!

956
01:05:21,976 --> 01:05:24,147
This is nice.

957
01:05:24,417 --> 01:05:25,516
I want more.

958
01:05:28,516 --> 01:05:31,487
Mr. Shin, they gave me this at the reception.

959
01:05:31,487 --> 01:05:32,656
They said it came via express courier.

960
01:05:38,096 --> 01:05:40,197
(Manager Shin Cha Il)

961
01:05:50,576 --> 01:05:52,107
(Audit those running the construction site dining halls,)

962
01:05:52,107 --> 01:05:53,877
(or everyone who uses JU Construction's dining halls...)

963
01:05:53,877 --> 01:05:55,647
(will be hurt, including the cafeteria at the head office!)

964
01:05:55,647 --> 01:05:56,677
(The construction site for the shopping mall...)

965
01:05:56,677 --> 01:05:57,686
(is the first target!)

966
01:06:12,127 --> 01:06:13,167
- What's wrong? - Hey!

967
01:06:13,697 --> 01:06:14,737
- Oh, no. - What should we do?

968
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:17,567
- What is going on? - Gosh, I feel sick.

969
01:06:32,587 --> 01:06:33,647
Everyone, stop eating.

970
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:42,996
All of you!

971
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:46,366
Stop eating.

972
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:51,066
(The Auditors)

973
01:06:51,066 --> 01:06:53,507
(Special thanks to Hong Soo Hyun and Lee Shin Ki)

974
01:07:11,286 --> 01:07:13,557
I want you to look into it, in secret.

975
01:07:13,656 --> 01:07:15,356
What about the person who sent the threatening letter?

976
01:07:15,356 --> 01:07:16,727
We will find out.

977
01:07:16,856 --> 01:07:18,167
If they snoop around and comb through stuff,

978
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:19,297
they'll find all sorts of things.

979
01:07:19,297 --> 01:07:20,866
Why Mr. Shin, of all people?

980
01:07:21,066 --> 01:07:23,337
You think everyone is corrupt...

981
01:07:23,337 --> 01:07:24,967
and is deceiving others, don't you?

982
01:07:24,967 --> 01:07:26,337
Has anyone asked you for a favor...

983
01:07:26,337 --> 01:07:27,837
regarding the management rights?

984
01:07:28,776 --> 01:07:29,937
Where do you think you're going?

985
01:07:29,937 --> 01:07:32,877
Bring me one solid piece of evidence!

986
01:07:33,076 --> 01:07:34,517
I'll write an official apology letter...

987
01:07:34,776 --> 01:07:37,847
and post it on every intranet forum.

988
01:07:38,246 --> 01:07:40,387
In conclusion, the audit was unreasonable.
