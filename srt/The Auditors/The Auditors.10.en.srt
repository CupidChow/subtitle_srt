00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:33,420
I see.

184
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:39,139
Sir.

185
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:42,621
Did something happen?

186
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:09,872
[Moon Sang Ho]

187
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,112
Are you out of your mind?

188
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,763
Do you want to cause harm to others
until the end?

189
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,953
I'm finished.

190
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,556
I'm really finished.

191
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,595
Then, I'm finished.

192
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,736
You're not finished.

193
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,271
You can start again.

194
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:46,211
Start from the beginning.

195
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:51,149
If you really expiate your wrong
you can start from the beginning.

196
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:56,688
I believe you can do it.

197
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:03,428
Sir.

198
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:07,265
I'm very sorry.

199
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:35,668
This is Shin Cha Il.

200
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:37,863
Sir, we have a problem.

201
00:15:49,874 --> 00:15:52,690
Did Ms. Jeong Hye Young try to kill herself?

202
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:53,564
Sir.

203
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:55,923
We also heard it from the personnel department.

204
00:15:55,947 --> 00:15:58,130
They found her fell on the floor
after taking pills.

205
00:15:58,154 --> 00:15:59,970
How is she?

206
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:01,653
She looked unconscious.

207
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:04,265
Where is she now?

208
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:06,358
They said they'd go to Nasun General Hospital.

209
00:16:09,991 --> 00:16:13,378
[Nasun General Hospital]

210
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:17,766
You're here.

211
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,371
Has he recovered his consciousness?

212
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:29,607
Hey.

213
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:30,982
It's me.

214
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:33,752
Can you recognize me?

215
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:38,934
Still, he hasn't recovered
his consciousness perfectly.

216
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,626
His condition will be stabilized soon.

217
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:43,771
What a relief.

218
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,998
When he regains his consciousness

219
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:48,934
we can kick that one out of the company.

220
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:51,436
Who do you want to kick out?

221
00:16:54,702 --> 00:16:56,086
What brings you here?

222
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,378
I should come. Aren't I a family member?

223
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:00,464
You've never visited before.

224
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:02,018
Why did you come today?

225
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:03,352
You wanted him to be dead.

226
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:06,398
Are you sad that
he's recovered his consciousness?

227
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:09,263
It's not a problem that a younger brother
comes to see his older brother.

228
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:11,031
You must've had happy days

229
00:17:11,055 --> 00:17:14,635
because you were like a king at the company.

230
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,262
Hey.

231
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,463
I'm happy that he's returned to himself.

232
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:20,642
You can see that I'm smiling.

233
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:26,004
Laugh as much as you want
because the days you can laugh are numbered.

234
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:29,841
When my husband returns to the company

235
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:33,045
you'll be damned.

236
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:38,516
I knew that I wouldn't be welcomed.

237
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,863
But you always treat me as a stranger.

238
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:43,321
I see that he's okay. So, I'll go off.

239
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:49,003
Take care of yourself.

240
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,361
I'll wait for you at the company.

241
00:17:58,502 --> 00:18:01,839
Isn't the Audit Team leader incompetent
enough not to kick him out?

242
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:05,449
When the knife becomes blunt
you should throw it.

243
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:07,912
There are plenty of knives you can use.

244
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:10,247
Wait a minute, please.

245
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:19,933
Hey.

246
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:25,138
I don't want to hear more nitpicking.

247
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:26,497
What's your purpose?

248
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,176
What do you mean?

249
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,768
If you were me, could you believe my word?

250
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:35,173
Right. We aren't close enough
to care for each other.

251
00:18:36,903 --> 00:18:40,978
But I sometimes mistake us for a family.

252
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,792
I won't mistake our relationship again.

253
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:46,117
You must be impatient.

254
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,520
You must've thought you were ahead of me.

255
00:18:50,982 --> 00:18:52,490
But Brother regained consciousness.

256
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:55,727
You're totally boggled

257
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,565
because you're alone.

258
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:05,378
Are you happy that you have your side again?

259
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:10,107
You must be happy with the thought
of stamping on me with your brother again.

260
00:19:12,645 --> 00:19:14,481
Suit yourself.

261
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,414
But you'd better brace yourself.

262
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,378
Who are you?

263
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,323
We're JU's Audit Team.

264
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:53,285
We want to see
Assistant Manager Jeong Hye Young.

265
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:55,887
The Audit Team?

266
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,883
Is it you?

267
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,037
Are you the one
who made our daughter like that?

268
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:04,863
I'm Shin Cha Il, the Audit Team leader.

269
00:20:07,714 --> 00:20:10,983
- Is she all right?
- All right?

270
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:13,997
She tried to kill herself at the company.

271
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:18,097
I heard you bullied
and forced her into making a false confession.

272
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:19,697
It's a good place.

273
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:23,357
I'll kill you and hold a funeral for you here.

274
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:25,757
What's wrong with you?
Please calm down.

275
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:28,857
It's your daughter who committed a crime.

276
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:30,731
A crime? What crime?

277
00:20:30,755 --> 00:20:32,833
You requested Director Seo
for unfair employment.

278
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,980
Then, our daughter deserved to die?

279
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:37,693
Tell me. Does she deserve to die?

280
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:39,146
No. I mean…

281
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,191
We also want to figure out
the truth of the case.

282
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:42,521
Please don't act recklessly.

283
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:44,668
Recklessly?

284
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:50,488
Isn't the audit
by this kind of murderer reckless?

285
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:54,421
I don't want to talk with them
so tell them to leave.

286
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:55,841
Did you hear her?

287
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:58,282
I don't want to talk with you. So get lost!

288
00:20:59,532 --> 00:21:01,281
I see.

289
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:03,154
I'll be back when she calms down.

290
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:16,034
Is everything okay?

291
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:19,904
Is there someone who dropped by?

292
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,630
There's no need to worry about it.

293
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:26,978
Something will happen soon.
So, please stand by.

294
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:29,280
I'll contact you again.

295
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:47,599
Tell Mr. Shin to come to me.

296
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,443
Assistant Manager Jeong's family
complained that

297
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:57,976
you had forcefully investigated her
while auditing.

298
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,221
I can't admit that.

299
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:03,857
I'll talk to them about it.

300
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:06,851
They don't want to meet you in person.

301
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,392
That's not important now.

302
00:22:15,743 --> 00:22:18,653
I barely persuaded them
not to report it to the press.

303
00:22:18,677 --> 00:22:19,677
So

304
00:22:20,537 --> 00:22:22,073
I'll start an audit.

305
00:22:22,097 --> 00:22:23,801
I'll start to investigate to
discover the truth.

306
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:27,905
No. It's an audit about you.

307
00:22:30,277 --> 00:22:33,811
They want me to discipline you.

308
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:36,947
You'll be excluded from
your duties for a while.

309
00:22:40,508 --> 00:22:43,177
Don't you forget the special provision
of the contract?

310
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:44,956
It's an audit as a mere formality.

311
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,777
Isn't it you who forget that

312
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,762
there's a condition for that provision?

313
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:57,468
Who's going to take charge of the audit?

314
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:01,773
You have already met her before.

315
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:11,129
I wanted to meet you again
but I didn't expect you to be an audit object.

316
00:23:11,153 --> 00:23:12,796
Let's start.

317
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,586
Yes. I'll start right away.

318
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:20,196
Why did you order thugs to steal
the recruitment-related documents?

319
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,857
I can bring the person
who appeared on the recording

320
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:24,076
and make you and him confront each other.

321
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,998
It must be your dad.
Please show me your phone.

322
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,385
You pushed her to answer the question
without proof.

323
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,478
Do you admit it?

324
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:33,235
The situation pointed out that
she was the suspect.

325
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:34,905
And it turned out to be true.

326
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,414
What did you do from 11 to 12
on the 21st of March?

327
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:44,467
Why did you post
Ms. Yoon Seon Jin's pictures?

328
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:47,147
So, you took pictures secretly
and uploaded them, right?

329
00:23:47,171 --> 00:23:50,165
You pushed her to confess what she didn't do.

330
00:23:50,189 --> 00:23:51,889
Do you admit it?

331
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,923
At that time…
The situation was like she was the suspect.

332
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:00,231
Well.

333
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,616
The investigation relying only on a situation

334
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,723
could be pushy and violent.

335
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:08,940
Don't you think so?

336
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:18,243
I knew he would be in trouble one day.

337
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:21,476
He was too pushy.

338
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,463
You're going too far.

339
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:25,465
Are you on Ms. Jeong's side?

340
00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:30,650
I mean. Mr. Shin must've lashed out at her
too much to make her try to kill herself.

341
00:24:30,674 --> 00:24:34,290
She didn't admit her guilt.

342
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:37,901
I don't think Mr. Shin was pushy enough
to get audited.

343
00:24:39,147 --> 00:24:43,707
There's no one who did well this time.
You got it?

344
00:24:52,372 --> 00:24:56,659
Submit all audit materials that
Mr. Shin was in charge of.

345
00:24:56,683 --> 00:24:58,514
What? All the materials?

346
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,941
Please be hurry.
I want to check them at least in the evening.

347
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:04,304
You'll be excluded from
your duties for a while.

348
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:05,931
I know.

349
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:07,031
See you tomorrow.

350
00:25:11,715 --> 00:25:13,804
Prepare the materials Ms. Seo requested.

351
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:16,725
And please prepare the quarterly audit well.

352
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:17,775
I'll go off first.

353
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Sir.

354
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,180
Sir.

355
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:36,204
Is it true?

356
00:25:36,228 --> 00:25:37,764
Yes.

357
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:40,364
My dad has already made
a secret investigation into him.

358
00:25:40,388 --> 00:25:42,584
Someone was dead due to him.

359
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:45,703
How could a person like him
be an audit team leader?

360
00:25:46,621 --> 00:25:48,539
I'm a victim, too.

361
00:25:58,404 --> 00:26:00,280
It's okay.

362
00:26:00,304 --> 00:26:01,560
I'm about to wrap it up.

363
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:03,660
Yes.

364
00:26:03,684 --> 00:26:06,200
Hello. I'm Gong Chae Yeon.

365
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:09,280
Ah, you found Ms. Jeong first when she fell.

366
00:26:09,304 --> 00:26:10,560
Have you come here to see Ms. Jeong?

367
00:26:10,584 --> 00:26:14,060
Yes. I want to see if she's okay.

368
00:26:14,084 --> 00:26:15,700
And to give her her items.

369
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,904
Are you done?

370
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:20,346
I want to take a rest a bit.

371
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,439
I'm done. Take care of yourself.

372
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:34,485
I'm happy that Mr. Shin is in trouble.

373
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:38,895
He's been acting snobbish.

374
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:40,322
Sir.

375
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:43,775
Who will be happy
if the ex-president regains consciousness?

376
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,181
Is Mr. President's presidency on the line?

377
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,822
Or is the Vice President's position
on the line?

378
00:26:47,846 --> 00:26:50,989
Both of them are doing all the best they can.

379
00:26:51,013 --> 00:26:57,273
But the Vice President was a pain
in their family's neck.

380
00:26:57,297 --> 00:26:59,000
Particularly

381
00:26:59,024 --> 00:27:04,386
the ex-president's wife is crazy
about kicking him out of the company.

382
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,394
What's the reason?

383
00:27:05,418 --> 00:27:08,659
She hates his family tree.

384
00:27:08,683 --> 00:27:10,872
Then, Mr. Vice President could be kicked out.

385
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,226
Shouldn't we stand on Mr. President's side?

386
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,235
Use your brain.

387
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,259
Listen carefully.

388
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:18,428
The ex-president can't come back
to the company soon

389
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:20,374
although he has regained consciousness.

390
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:22,263
The chance is low.

391
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:23,477
Then what should he do?

392
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:28,063
I think he will nominate someone
and support him for his own good.

393
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:29,623
Isn't it a bad situation
for Mr. Vice President?

394
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,686
Hey. Put yourself in the ex-president's shoes.

395
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,891
One failed a 50 billion won project
and to win a contract.

396
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:43,159
But the other one won a contract
of 400 billion for construction

397
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:45,464
and is about to win a redevelopment contract.

398
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:47,738
Who will you nominate?

399
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:50,294
Yeah, I understand now.

400
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,497
So

401
00:27:55,075 --> 00:28:00,388
In times like this, we should be far-sighted
and show which side we're on.

402
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,011
It's a tip.
As you know, I've gone through many hardships.

403
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:04,117
Keep it in mind.

404
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,531
Sir.

405
00:28:05,555 --> 00:28:08,231
You're so sure of yourself.

406
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:09,165
Do you have secret information?

407
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:14,318
I don't have it, but I'll check it out today.

408
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:19,022
I can see

409
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:21,759
who gets the leverage.

410
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:35,428
Mr. President.

411
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:39,374
Director Lee isn't available today
because he plans

412
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:40,798
to meet up with the Vice President.

413
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:56,536
Thank you for your hard work.

414
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,630
I'll reconstruct the JU Construction
that is in crisis.

415
00:29:00,654 --> 00:29:05,863
So, please have faith in me
and work hard for more time.

416
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:08,343
Cheers to JU!

417
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:10,541
Cheers!

418
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,212
Please give a round of applause.

419
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:20,343
I'll pour a drink for you.

420
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,330
- Thank you for your hard work.
- It's all thanks to you.

421
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:25,557
- You did a good job.
- Thank you.

422
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:27,491
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

423
00:29:29,338 --> 00:29:30,934
Sir.

424
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:34,540
If you win this redevelopment contract

425
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,140
the presidency is yours.

426
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:38,167
Right.

427
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:42,307
Let's burn the bull's horn this time.
And pull it completely.

428
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:46,477
We should get it done before the ex-president
comes back to the company.

429
00:29:47,908 --> 00:29:49,691
Why are you bringing that up?

430
00:29:49,715 --> 00:29:51,351
I'm sorry.

431
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,451
- Just drink.
- Yes, sir.

432
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:30,639
[Meeting room]

433
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:33,359
On March 5, 2024

434
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:36,719
you tried to forcefully take the laptop away
from Mr. Bae,

435
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:40,872
and he fell from the third floor. Right?

436
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:44,435
It happened because
he ran away with the laptop.

437
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:49,946
Did you go to a cocktail bar on March 14th
with Director Yoo, who was an audit object?

438
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:50,619
Yes, I did.

439
00:30:50,643 --> 00:30:53,581
Then, you went to her apartment
where she lived alone

440
00:30:53,605 --> 00:30:55,546
and faced a charge of harassment.

441
00:30:56,283 --> 00:30:58,892
That already turned out to be a false charge.

442
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:00,519
I know.

443
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:02,079
On April 10th

444
00:31:02,103 --> 00:31:05,386
you admitted that you had gone too far
and apologized

445
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,993
to Mr. Pyeon and Director Yang, right?

446
00:31:12,574 --> 00:31:13,031
Yes.

447
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:17,970
You investigated Chief Park
at 4 a.m. on May 9th.

448
00:31:17,994 --> 00:31:21,715
Was there an unavoidable reason
for that late investigation?

449
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:24,741
J-BIMS presentation was impending.

450
00:31:24,765 --> 00:31:27,645
The chance of information leakage was high
and I didn't have enough time.

451
00:31:27,892 --> 00:31:30,447
Why do you keep asking about past incidents?

452
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:35,953
Don't you get it?

453
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:39,250
You're pushing yourself.

454
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:44,829
You're urging yourself too hard
with a sense of duty to capture suspects.

455
00:31:45,678 --> 00:31:47,440
So, you didn't realize

456
00:31:47,464 --> 00:31:52,007
your oppressive investigation
harassed the audit objects.

457
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:53,346
Don't you think so?

458
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,241
Those who try to hide their crimes
are brazen and shrewd.

459
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,300
You also know that we need
to make a bold decision

460
00:32:02,324 --> 00:32:04,391
to fight with that kind of person, don't you?

461
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:05,553
Even so

462
00:32:05,577 --> 00:32:10,219
I think your way is too pushy
and drives people to a dead end.

463
00:32:10,243 --> 00:32:12,083
You and I have different investigation styles.

464
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,059
Well.

465
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,233
What about this one?

466
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,976
[Kim Man Soo, Baeon Construction]

467
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,549
Deputy Director Kim Man Soo
from Baeon Construction.

468
00:32:36,573 --> 00:32:37,681
Do you remember him?

469
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:48,692
[Two years ago]

470
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,880
Do you have a company?

471
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,165
Excuse me.

472
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:02,414
Who is he?

473
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,241
Who the hell is he?

474
00:33:08,144 --> 00:33:09,613
What the heck!

475
00:33:16,214 --> 00:33:17,955
Mr. Shin…

476
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:24,910
Do you admit you've used
the company credit card for pleasure?

477
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:26,673
No. It's just for…

478
00:33:26,697 --> 00:33:28,679
I'll tell you for you.

479
00:33:28,703 --> 00:33:33,737
Aren't the people you entertained the executives
from Moo San and Bong Sun companies?

480
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:38,106
I'm suspicious that they gave you
a higher subcontracted work amount

481
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,945
than the actual amount
to get back the difference.

482
00:33:41,714 --> 00:33:43,651
It's an act of illegal fundraising.

483
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:45,875
It can be qualified as embezzlement
and breach of trust.

484
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:50,530
You have two options.

485
00:33:50,554 --> 00:33:54,570
First. Admit that you set up a secret fund
and be fired and charged.

486
00:33:54,594 --> 00:33:58,695
Second. Disclose who ordered this
and receive leniency.

487
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:01,398
Which one are you going to choose?

488
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:10,194
I'm sorry the house is a mess.

489
00:34:10,218 --> 00:34:12,152
Why don't you come inside for a minute?

490
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,381
No, it's okay.

491
00:34:14,405 --> 00:34:16,313
Where is Deputy Director Kim Man Soo?

492
00:34:17,278 --> 00:34:18,283
What?

493
00:34:19,631 --> 00:34:22,285
He went to work in the morning.
Isn't he at the office?

494
00:34:29,018 --> 00:34:31,088
What do you think you're doing?

495
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,340
I know you're the Audit Team leader

496
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,961
but isn't it too much to drop by
my house without permission?

497
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:36,828
Do you know what my wife's condition is?

498
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:38,302
Let's talk in person.

499
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:50,681
Your wife didn't know you were excluded
from your duties and took time off.

500
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,334
I didn't tell her
because I didn't want to worry her.

501
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,727
Is it a problem?

502
00:34:54,751 --> 00:34:58,127
Why are you trying to take all the guilt?

503
00:34:58,151 --> 00:35:00,827
I know you're covering up for
Director Bae Hyung Kyu and the Vice President.

504
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:03,067
Please stop it.

505
00:35:03,091 --> 00:35:04,254
It is really not.

506
00:35:04,278 --> 00:35:06,107
Even though you keep silent
nothing will be solved.

507
00:35:06,131 --> 00:35:07,612
I will never give up.

508
00:35:07,636 --> 00:35:09,952
Everything will be discovered.

509
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:12,936
I said I did it alone.

510
00:35:18,302 --> 00:35:21,645
If you keep doing it, I'll be finished.

511
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:44,850
You pushed him, who had already confessed
what he did, to tell the truth.

512
00:35:44,874 --> 00:35:48,538
Was that why he committed suicide?

513
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:54,378
Is the case of Ms. Jeong the same
as that of Deputy Director Kim Man Soo?

514
00:35:58,544 --> 00:36:00,417
I'm so worried.

515
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,747
A similar incident can happen again

516
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:09,426
if you keep auditing like this.

517
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:19,169
Let's

518
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,239
call it a day.

519
00:36:48,032 --> 00:36:50,868
I think what Mr. Shin said is right.

520
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:52,108
What do you mean?

521
00:36:52,132 --> 00:36:54,038
He said we shouldn't trust anyone.

522
00:36:55,678 --> 00:36:58,808
Mr. Bae, Assistant Manager Moon

523
00:37:00,132 --> 00:37:01,712
and even Mr. Shin betrayed my trust.

524
00:37:02,705 --> 00:37:07,618
I can't believe
he audited someone until the one died.

525
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:10,921
Did he really do that?

526
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:14,959
You also heard the story
about Deputy Director Kim Man Soo.

527
00:37:17,497 --> 00:37:20,364
I didn't think he was that brutal.

528
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:30,107
When you told me you believed in me

529
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:33,944
I was glad.

530
00:37:35,443 --> 00:37:36,814
You were reliable.

531
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:43,653
I was encouraged a lot
when I had someone who trusted me.

532
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:47,382
So, I want to trust him.

533
00:37:50,076 --> 00:37:53,763
I'm sure there was a reason we don't know.

534
00:37:55,869 --> 00:38:01,711
If you'll keep working with the Audit Team
you'd better not trust someone easily.

535
00:38:01,735 --> 00:38:02,739
You're right.

536
00:38:05,275 --> 00:38:08,471
I feel like you've influenced me.

537
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:09,713
Right.

538
00:38:38,093 --> 00:38:40,109
Mr. Shin Cha Il.

539
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:42,129
Do you remember me?

540
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,114
I'm Deputy Director Kim Man Soo's wife.

541
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:46,136
I know.

542
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,584
Please tell me.

543
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,396
Why should my husband have to die?

544
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,459
No one told me the truth about it
including the company.

545
00:38:57,873 --> 00:39:00,630
You didn't tell me
what happened to him even at his funeral.

546
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,834
I need to know now.

547
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,073
I'm sorry.

548
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:18,549
I will never give up this time.

549
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:54,483
Isn't the audit
by this kind of murderer reckless?

550
00:39:54,507 --> 00:39:56,586
So you killed a person?

551
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,303
While auditing?

552
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:00,688
I'm so worried.

553
00:40:00,712 --> 00:40:03,736
A similar incident can happen again

554
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,398
if you keep auditing like this.

556
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:46,010
Isn't it a golden opportunity?

557
00:40:46,034 --> 00:40:50,016
We can fire him through this chance.

558
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,851
I'm sure it's your plan, right?

559
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:55,354
It's such an excellent strategy.

560
00:40:55,378 --> 00:40:57,190
It's the best.

561
00:40:57,214 --> 00:40:58,215
Are you excited?

562
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,117
Well…

563
00:41:02,214 --> 00:41:03,629
Aren't you excited?

564
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:05,703
I know you have an acquaintance
at Baeon Construction.

565
00:41:05,727 --> 00:41:06,796
Baeon Construction?

566
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,783
Ah, I can see your intention.

567
00:41:09,807 --> 00:41:12,509
You're going to plan to fire him, right?

568
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:17,066
Yeah, I have an acquaintance.
I'll contact him right now.

571
00:41:52,842 --> 00:41:54,891
Don't push yourself too hard.

572
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:58,341
If you want me to stop it
please tell the truth.

573
00:42:15,446 --> 00:42:19,242
Mr. Shin and I have agreed
to a special provision.

574
00:42:19,266 --> 00:42:22,129
That's a provision that I can't dismiss him
within two years.

575
00:42:22,153 --> 00:42:23,077
Two years?

576
00:42:23,101 --> 00:42:26,703
He demanded two years for a decent audit.

577
00:42:27,593 --> 00:42:30,809
But, there's a condition to that provision.

578
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:33,276
If he causes harm to the company

579
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:36,013
I can dismiss him.

580
00:42:39,386 --> 00:42:41,527
Is the picketing one such thing?

581
00:42:41,551 --> 00:42:45,355
If it becomes the focus of the public attention
you can call it into question.

582
00:42:46,084 --> 00:42:47,400
Is it what you want?

583
00:42:47,424 --> 00:42:48,859
I don't have any intention.

584
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,763
I just wanted to figure out what's going on.

585
00:42:55,637 --> 00:42:58,001
Thank you. You can go.

586
00:43:18,953 --> 00:43:21,090
This is a will Ms. Jeong wrote.

587
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,273
She wrote that it was such a violent
and oppressive audit that she felt shame

588
00:43:27,297 --> 00:43:29,466
and couldn't stand the pressure.

589
00:43:30,897 --> 00:43:33,814
The bereaved of Mr. Kim Man Soo
visited the company

590
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:35,210
and there was a gossip about you.

591
00:43:35,234 --> 00:43:37,873
The issue has become complicated.

592
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:39,576
Is there something you want to say?

593
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:45,882
'I couldn't say anything because I was daunted.

594
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:52,119
You'll know if you listen to the recording.
She wasn't daunted at all.

595
00:43:52,143 --> 00:43:54,813
Rather, she was confident and brazen.

596
00:43:54,837 --> 00:43:57,554
The will contains her impure intention.

597
00:43:57,578 --> 00:43:59,814
She tried to kill herself.

598
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:02,866
Are you saying she lied
at the risk of her life?

599
00:44:06,085 --> 00:44:07,671
Don't let anything cloud your judgment.

600
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:13,207
You should be careful the most
not to lose the insight.

601
00:44:13,231 --> 00:44:17,947
Figure out the situation with an open mind.

602
00:44:18,745 --> 00:44:21,885
And do not jump to conclusions.

603
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:26,740
I'll report the audit result tomorrow.

604
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,793
If you don't have anything to say
I'll wrap it up.

605
00:44:48,325 --> 00:44:49,855
What is this?

606
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:53,249
Go and figure out what happened to Mr. Shin.

00:44:59,675 --> 00:45:02,424
Why are you suddenly giving it to me?

609
00:45:02,448 --> 00:45:06,284
Do you want me to find something
that can harm Mr. Shin?

610
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:07,319
You want to die?

611
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:10,917
I mean, it's weird.

612
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,512
Why are you suddenly trying to help Mr. Shini?

613
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:18,419
I do whatever to get back at the enemy.

614
00:45:18,443 --> 00:45:20,332
It's the same
when it comes to returning the favor.

615
00:45:20,356 --> 00:45:23,626
You go and find out what happened exactly.

616
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,691
This is all I can help.

617
00:45:24,715 --> 00:45:26,472
- You got it?
- Yes.

618
00:45:26,496 --> 00:45:29,453
By the way, may I tell Mr. Shin

619
00:45:30,183 --> 00:45:33,346
- that you're helping?
- Yes.

620
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,125
Tell him if you want to die.

621
00:45:37,336 --> 00:45:38,461
Thank you.

622
00:45:43,769 --> 00:45:46,231
- Mr. Vice President?
- Yes.

623
00:45:46,255 --> 00:45:49,038
So, I'll go to see him.
Why don't we go together?

624
00:45:54,749 --> 00:45:56,989
- Did you hear that?
- What do you mean?

625
00:45:57,013 --> 00:45:59,358
The audit result of Mr. Shin
will come out tomorrow.

626
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:03,028
It seems like disciplinary action
will be taken against him.

627
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,959
There's a picketing in front of the company.

628
00:46:04,983 --> 00:46:07,299
The president definitely wants to show
he's paying attention to this case.

629
00:46:07,323 --> 00:46:10,126
In times like this, we'd better play it safe.

630
00:46:12,554 --> 00:46:13,796
Let's go to see him now.

631
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:16,208
We'll work outside of the office.

632
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:17,409
We'll be back.

633
00:46:17,433 --> 00:46:19,535
I told you to play it safe.
Where are you going?

634

Hello.

Hello.

636
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:31,414
Do you have a business with the Audit Team?

637
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:33,616
No.

638
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,000
Hey. Let's go.

639
00:46:41,024 --> 00:46:42,025
Okay.

640
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:50,333
I'm not sure

641
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:53,579
whether it's okay to say it to you.

642
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:58,379
We want to know
what happened to Mr Shin exactly.

643
00:46:58,403 --> 00:47:03,586
You also don't want him
to get an unfair punishment.

644
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,282
Please help us.

645
00:47:12,983 --> 00:47:14,924
It's me. Where are you?

646
00:47:16,123 --> 00:47:18,795
Don't worry. I will never tell.

647
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:21,141
But

648
00:47:21,979 --> 00:47:24,159
you should keep your word.

649
00:47:24,183 --> 00:47:26,476
You should save.

650
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:29,407
I see.

651
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,554
Did he say

652
00:47:45,273 --> 00:47:47,455
'You should save.'?

653
00:47:47,479 --> 00:47:48,493
Yes.

654
00:47:51,746 --> 00:47:54,835
Please stop it. It is really not.

655
00:47:54,859 --> 00:47:56,677
Even though you keep silent
nothing will be solved.

656
00:47:56,701 --> 00:47:58,210
I will never give up.

657
00:47:58,234 --> 00:48:00,510
Everything will be discovered.

658
00:48:00,534 --> 00:48:03,439
I said I did it alone.

659
00:48:06,912 --> 00:48:10,022
If you keep doing it, I'll be finished.

660
00:48:10,046 --> 00:48:12,682
Your wife has
triple-negative breast cancer, right?

661
00:48:12,706 --> 00:48:16,452
I heard you moved to a new house
because of the hospital fee.

662
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:18,330
Excuse me.

663
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,900
Is a huge amount of medical expense the reason

you're covering up for
Director Bae and the Vice President?

665

Please stop it.

666
00:48:25,098 --> 00:48:26,154
You're so mean.

667
00:48:26,178 --> 00:48:28,542
Did they guarantee you
the expense after the surgery?

668
00:48:28,566 --> 00:48:30,633
Is that why you keep silent like this?

669
00:48:31,804 --> 00:48:33,969
Do you really have to investigate like this?

670
00:48:41,143 --> 00:48:43,413
You're just aggravating the situation.

671
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,716

Is it true?

675
00:50:08,855 --> 00:50:11,608
Did my husband really commit a breach of trust

676
00:50:12,668 --> 00:50:13,936
and embezzlement?

677
00:50:15,995 --> 00:50:17,574
Is that why he died?

678
00:50:18,735 --> 00:50:21,110
We need to investigate more.

679
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,046
No.

680
00:50:23,935 --> 00:50:25,415
That's not true.

681
00:50:27,215 --> 00:50:29,252
He liked to go to work.

682
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,689
He was strongly devoted to the company.

683
00:50:33,688 --> 00:50:35,431
This is unfair.

684
00:50:35,455 --> 00:50:37,193
It must be a false charge.

685
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,377
We couldn't receive his statement

686
00:50:51,401 --> 00:50:55,322
and failed to leave a record
that it was due to a hospital fee.

687
00:50:55,346 --> 00:50:58,614
We also couldn't tell the truth to his wife.

688
00:51:00,826 --> 00:51:03,218
Mr. Shin couldn't tell her that

689
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:09,225
her husband committed a crime to save her life.

690
00:51:16,704 --> 00:51:19,936
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.

691
00:51:24,754 --> 00:51:29,010
We should let Ms. Seo know about it.
It wasn't an oppressive investigation.

692
00:51:29,034 --> 00:51:31,684
He did that for his wife's hospital fee.

Yes. Let's go.

00:51:33,178 --> 00:51:34,198

696
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:42,390
Isn't it coincidental?

697
00:51:42,414 --> 00:51:43,369
What do you mean?

698
00:51:43,393 --> 00:51:46,061
I don't understand
why his wife suddenly came up.

699
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:54,750
I think Ms. Jeong already knew
about the case with Deputy Director Kim.

700
00:51:54,774 --> 00:51:59,041
Isn't the audit
by this kind of murderer reckless?

and tell us who told you about it.

714
00:52:47,145 --> 00:52:49,325
He said his name is CEO Jeong.

715
00:52:50,311 --> 00:52:53,162
He told me
that his daughter was also Mr. Shin's victim.

716
00:52:56,421 --> 00:53:00,669
By any chance, is the phone number
you got this one?

717
00:53:02,354 --> 00:53:03,606
Yes.

718
00:53:07,407 --> 00:53:10,212
If she intentionally spread the story
of Deputy Director Kim

719
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:14,417
I doubt if she really tried to kill herself.

720
00:53:16,534 --> 00:53:19,297
Are you saying that she pretended to suicide?

721
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,458
Is she trustworthy?

722
00:53:26,644 --> 00:53:27,664
Wait a moment.

723
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:31,576
Look at this.

724
00:53:32,424 --> 00:53:35,115
This is a post she uploaded
in the morning she tried to kill herself.

725
00:53:35,139 --> 00:53:38,240
I want to quit work and go to Europe.

726
00:53:38,991 --> 00:53:41,591
A person who is determined to die
wouldn't write a post like this.

727
00:53:43,057 --> 00:53:44,747
I think there's a way to check this out.

728
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:55,077
[I don't want to open my eyes this morning
I want to quit work and go to Europe]

729
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:57,183
Please tell us the truth.

730
00:53:57,207 --> 00:54:02,844
You came to the Audit Team a bit ago
because you had something to say, right?

731
00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:06,124
Our team leader is in trouble due to this case.

732
00:54:06,148 --> 00:54:07,871
Please help us.

733
00:54:07,895 --> 00:54:09,591
Please

734
00:54:09,615 --> 00:54:11,207
tell us the truth.

735
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:16,346
Well…

736
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:21,443
I'll take a few of these pills.
So call 911 right away, right?

737
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:22,923
Do you really have to do this?

738
00:54:22,947 --> 00:54:25,943
You can't imagine
how shameful I was due to him.

739
00:54:25,967 --> 00:54:28,517
I'm not just going to take it lying down.

740
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:29,696
Get your head on straight.

741
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,863
If you do it well
I'll give you the money you asked for.

742
00:54:32,887 --> 00:54:34,096
I see.

743
00:54:39,857 --> 00:54:40,970
Let's start.

744
00:54:46,524 --> 00:54:50,079
Someone fell down. Please help me.

745
00:54:52,551 --> 00:54:55,861
Is what you said now true?

746
00:54:55,885 --> 00:54:57,494
Yes.

747
00:54:57,518 --> 00:55:00,356
She had no intention to kill herself.

748
00:55:01,078 --> 00:55:03,127
I needed money urgently.

749
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:05,127
So, I did what she asked on an impulse.

750
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:08,764
But I regretted what I did.

751
00:55:29,103 --> 00:55:30,729
Have you secured her testimony?

752
00:55:30,753 --> 00:55:33,649
I'll take care of the case.

753
00:55:33,673 --> 00:55:35,009
You did a good job.

754
00:55:35,033 --> 00:55:36,225
Thank you.

755
00:55:37,746 --> 00:55:39,228
I'm…

756
00:55:40,053 --> 00:55:41,163
jealous of Mr. Shin.

757
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:45,168
He has reliable team members who trust him.

758
00:55:56,795 --> 00:55:57,980
By the way

759
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:03,817
will you tell Deputy Director's wife the truth?

760
00:56:03,841 --> 00:56:07,689
She'll be shocked by the truth.
But I think she should know it.

761
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:12,327
If we don't tell her
her anguish will be bigger.

762
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:29,078
I'm surprised.
You should learn manners.

763
00:56:30,761 --> 00:56:34,704
Did you pretend to kill yourself
to set Mr. Shin up?

764
00:56:34,728 --> 00:56:36,552
What a bullshit is this?

765
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,925
What did you tell her?

766
00:56:44,726 --> 00:56:47,464
Tell me what you told her.

767
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:50,542
Hey. Ms. Jeong Hye Young.

768
00:56:50,566 --> 00:56:55,704
You'll be accused of
slandering and libeling Mr. Shin.

769
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:58,607
You'd better appoint a great lawyer.

770
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,175
Hey. Come here.

771
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:04,889
Hey! Tell me what you told her.

772
00:57:04,913 --> 00:57:06,282
No.

773
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:10,602
Damn it.

774
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:13,562
[Report of audit]

775
00:57:13,586 --> 00:57:17,526
[It turned out that Mr. Shin wasn't violent
and oppressive while auditing]

776
00:57:23,911 --> 00:57:25,800
I see.

777
00:57:25,824 --> 00:57:27,135
You can go.

778
00:57:55,156 --> 00:57:57,778
Isn't the president upset?

779
00:57:57,802 --> 00:57:59,568
He didn't say much.

780
00:58:08,773 --> 00:58:10,425
Wait.

781
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:13,858
I realize today that I'm a wolf.

782
00:58:13,882 --> 00:58:14,882
What?

783
00:58:16,595 --> 00:58:18,945
I'm curious about one thing.

784
00:58:18,969 --> 00:58:21,924
Are you a hunting dog or a wolf?

785
00:58:22,682 --> 00:58:23,724
Aha.

786
00:58:24,849 --> 00:58:27,258
I knew you were a wolf from the beginning.

787
00:58:27,282 --> 00:58:30,733
Be careful that talking down
can be within the audit scope.

788
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:07,302
I heard the truth.

789
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:10,406
He did that for me.

790
00:59:11,717 --> 00:59:14,276
I've blamed the wrong person.

791
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:16,478
I'm sorry.

792
00:59:17,377 --> 00:59:18,626
No.

793
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:20,249
It's me who feels sorry for you.

794
00:59:21,363 --> 00:59:24,186
Actually, I knew it.

795
00:59:25,483 --> 00:59:29,273
I knew that your husband
had come to a dead end.

796
00:59:29,297 --> 00:59:32,228
But, I pushed him more because I thought…

797
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:35,197
I could get more information.

798
00:59:36,277 --> 00:59:37,867
That was my fault.

799
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,433
I'm sorry.

800
00:59:40,457 --> 00:59:44,006
You just did what you should do.

801
00:59:49,413 --> 00:59:53,022
By the way, what happened to them?

802
00:59:53,046 --> 00:59:56,049
Those who took advantage of my husband.

803
00:59:56,073 --> 00:59:58,721
I found other evidence.
They were disciplined and dismissed.

804
00:59:59,946 --> 01:00:01,657
They're now in prison.

805
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:04,426
I see.

806
01:00:06,313 --> 01:00:08,055
That's good news.

807
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,431
I'm relieved.

808
01:00:11,299 --> 01:00:14,035
Thank you for coming.

809
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,123
I'm sorry.

810
01:00:58,503 --> 01:00:59,915
Good morning.

811
01:01:00,663 --> 01:01:03,019
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

812
01:01:08,419 --> 01:01:10,209
Do you have something to say?

813
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:11,782
No.

814
01:01:11,806 --> 01:01:13,429
I'm just happy to see you.

815
01:01:14,573 --> 01:01:17,733
I heard you helped me. Thank you.
You did a good job.

816
01:01:19,439 --> 01:01:21,203
What did you say just now?

817
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:24,082
I said I heard about you.

818
01:01:24,106 --> 01:01:25,794
I mean, the next sentence.

819
01:01:25,818 --> 01:01:26,842
You did a good job.

820
01:01:26,866 --> 01:01:28,811
No. The sentence before it.

821
01:01:29,673 --> 01:01:31,313
Thank…

822
01:01:33,786 --> 01:01:35,484
Be ready to work.

823
01:01:36,186 --> 01:01:38,146
Yes, sir.

824
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,169
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

825
01:01:44,193 --> 01:01:46,736
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

826
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,397
Good morning.

827
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,243
Good morning.

828
01:01:50,267 --> 01:01:53,135
Goo Han Soo.
Do you have any good news?

829
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:56,141
I think something good will happen today.

830
01:01:56,165 --> 01:01:57,672
You're so lame.

831
01:02:18,286 --> 01:02:19,461
Honey.

832
01:02:20,879 --> 01:02:24,834
It's me. Can you recognize me?

833
01:02:25,732 --> 01:02:27,002
What did you say?

834
01:02:28,532 --> 01:02:33,501
Se Woong? All right.
I'll call him to come.

835
01:02:33,525 --> 01:02:35,010
Excuse me!

836
01:02:44,931 --> 01:02:47,573
I'm sure. He wanted to see you.

837
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,437
He must've regained his consciousness.

838
01:02:50,504 --> 01:02:53,747
He's fallen asleep now.

839
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:55,373
Please come early tomorrow morning.

840
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:59,034
I'll go to my house tonight
and come early tomorrow morning.

841
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:03,738
Thank God.

842
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,046
Sir. Here you go.

843
01:03:12,113 --> 01:03:15,902
We've solved one thing
and now a bunch of work is waiting for us.

844
01:03:15,926 --> 01:03:20,009
It's too much. I see no end to it.

845
01:03:20,033 --> 01:03:22,941
The regular audit is a piece of work
compared to other incidents.

846
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:26,887
You're right.
May this peace continue.

847
01:03:29,981 --> 01:03:33,094
[Benjamin Lee]

848
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,228
I have a hunch right now.

849
01:03:50,252 --> 01:03:51,429
What kind of hunch?

850
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:55,266
I have a hunch that
something serious will happen.

851
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:56,980
Don't say that.

852
01:03:57,004 --> 01:03:58,227
Don't say a word that like.

853
01:04:00,697 --> 01:04:03,499
Let's work. We have a lot of stuff to do.

854
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:05,967
You're right.

855
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,973
Sir.

856
01:04:08,997 --> 01:04:10,139
Sir.

857
01:04:12,657 --> 01:04:18,026
Have you heard that the ex-president
regained his consciousness?

858
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:18,700
I heard.

859
01:04:18,724 --> 01:04:22,923
Yes. I didn't expect him

860
01:04:22,947 --> 01:04:25,746
to regain his consciousness this fast.

861
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:27,756
What should we do?

862
01:04:34,449 --> 01:04:38,610
I didn't expect to see you here.
I even hate seeing you in my dreams.

863
01:04:38,634 --> 01:04:39,869
What brings you here?

864
01:04:41,012 --> 01:04:45,595
Attempted manslaughter and dumping of a body
embezzlement, and breach of trust.

865
01:04:45,619 --> 01:04:48,181
And a special request for a job position.

866
01:04:48,205 --> 01:04:50,495
You'll be staying in prison for a long.

867
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:52,014
You bastard.

868
01:04:52,905 --> 01:04:54,826
Are you here to rub salt into my wound?

869
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:58,326
I came to see you because you would know
a lot of embarrassing matters of the company.

870
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:00,379
Are you planning
to stab somebody in the back again?

871
01:05:00,403 --> 01:05:02,172
It is not yet too late
to be a help to the company.

872
01:05:02,196 --> 01:05:04,279
Get lost, you bastard!

873
01:05:04,303 --> 01:05:06,561
Have you heard of Archcle-design?

874
01:05:17,954 --> 01:05:19,040
Well…

875
01:05:20,934 --> 01:05:24,079
Your look says you know about it.
Tell me as much as you know.

876
01:05:26,148 --> 01:05:28,184
Let's say I know about it.

877
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:30,185
But why should I tell it to you?

878
01:05:30,994 --> 01:05:32,921
Don't ever come to see me.

879
01:05:34,194 --> 01:05:37,192
Just seeing your face turns my stomach.

880
01:06:35,289 --> 01:06:37,942
[The Auditors]

881
01:06:58,225 --> 01:07:01,014
The ex-president was on the gain
but suddenly died.

882
01:07:01,038 --> 01:07:02,314
What are you suspicious of?

883
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:05,521
There's someone who keeps
siphoning secret funds and embezzling.

884
01:07:05,545 --> 01:07:07,694
I look forward to working with you.

885
01:07:07,718 --> 01:07:11,261
Since when have you been
on friendly terms with him?

886
01:07:11,285 --> 01:07:14,567
The guy next to Mr. President
is Undersecretary Ahn, right?

887
01:07:14,591 --> 01:07:19,759
Can the vice president be the real owner
of Archcle and secret funds?

888
01:07:19,783 --> 01:07:23,859
I won't let personal feelings come into play
because I'm an Audit Team member.

889
01:07:23,883 --> 01:07:27,599
Secrecy is necessary for this audit.

890
01:07:27,623 --> 01:07:32,974
I'll catch a bad guy who's been extorting
JU Construction for a long time.
