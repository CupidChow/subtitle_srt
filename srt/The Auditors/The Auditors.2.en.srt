1
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,032
(All characters, organizations, and events...)

2
00:00:37,032 --> 00:00:38,103
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:39,103
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

4
00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:42,466
You were the final decision maker on the tower crane purchase.

5
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:45,066
You used that power to purchase a tower crane...

6
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:46,807
without knowing when it was made at a normal price.

7
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:47,976
You took the difference in price...

8
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:50,106
through Myung Tower.

9
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:53,617
That feeble tower crane eventually fell and hurt people.

10
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:55,277
To cover up for your corruption,

11
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:57,787
you said the cause of the fall...

12
00:00:58,546 --> 00:00:59,586
was the wind?

13
00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:01,257
Gosh.

14
00:01:03,187 --> 00:01:05,226
You're a funny person.

15
00:01:06,187 --> 00:01:07,556
Can you prove it?

16
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:08,721
Give me the laptop.

17
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:12,796
How dare you talk about something you can't even prove in front of me?

18
00:01:12,997 --> 00:01:15,367
I'm going to fire you from the board for defamation.

19
00:01:15,437 --> 00:01:17,666
You will be remembered as the Audit Team manager...

20
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,007
who I fired after the shortest amount of time.

21
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:21,137
Someone is hiding...

22
00:01:21,476 --> 00:01:24,247
the injury of the tower crane operator.

23
00:01:25,276 --> 00:01:27,177
I think it's Mr. Bae.

24
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:29,147
What do you think?

25
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:41,826
Mr. Hwang is here.

26
00:01:42,257 --> 00:01:43,966
You're done for.

27
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:46,097
Be careful.

28
00:01:54,976 --> 00:01:57,446
Look who's here.

29
00:01:59,347 --> 00:02:00,776
Gosh.

30
00:02:01,446 --> 00:02:03,476
- Have you been well? - Yes, sir.

31
00:02:04,617 --> 00:02:05,686
- This is Mr. Yang. - Hi.

32
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:12,586
Mr. Shin. Aren't you going to greet him?

33
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:14,597
What are you doing? Say hello to Mr. Hwang.

34
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:16,496
Who is this?

35
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:18,966
He's the new Audit Team manager.

36
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,407
The Audit Team manager?

37
00:02:28,177 --> 00:02:29,336
Hurry up and say hello.

38
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:40,286
Why is he looking at me like that?

39
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:42,156
He's a lunatic.

40
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:53,697
Come on.

41
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:11,346
(The Auditors)

42
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:13,656
(Episode 2)

43
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:15,086
(Vice President Hwang Dae Woong)

44
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:16,387
That was my doing.

45
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:19,586
We should wrap up the construction as soon as possible.

46
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:21,397
It costs an astronomical amount of money.

47
00:03:22,697 --> 00:03:24,167
Isn't wind a good reason?

48
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:28,996
Covering up a small incident...

49
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:30,466
caused a big accident.

50
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:31,637
What accident?

51
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:33,506
- I'm currently auditing. - Who?

52
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,276
Mr. Seo Gil Pyo, Mr. Bae Young Sik,

53
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:36,506
the president of Myung Tower,

54
00:03:37,306 --> 00:03:38,406
and...

55
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:43,647
Me?

56
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:45,846
I'll audit all individuals related to the tower crane corruption.

57
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,316
Both executives and staff alike.

58
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:52,256
My goodness,

59
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:53,857
I'm impressed.

60
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:58,026
Where on earth did Se Woong find a gem like you?

61
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,827
Foreman Bae Young Sik has fled.

62
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:02,667
The laptop I need to audit also disappeared.

63
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:06,207
If you're done, I'll excuse myself.

64
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:08,707
Hey, punk!

65
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:23,017
That was what my old self would've said.

66
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:24,656
But now, I don't swear because people report...

67
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:25,786
to the Ministry of Employment and Labor nowadays.

68
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:29,357
I'll tell you nicely, so listen up.

69
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:31,427
If you don't find anything,

70
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:33,297
you'll be held responsible for causing a ruckus.

71
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:38,867
The Audit Team reports directly to the president.

72
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:41,077
Please go through the president...

73
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:43,477
to hold me responsible.

74
00:04:43,477 --> 00:04:44,607
It will be me.

75
00:04:48,177 --> 00:04:50,177
I'll make you pay for it.

76
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:17,076
I'm back.

77
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:18,977
What about Mr. Shin?

78
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:20,376
He left already.

79
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:21,547
Hey.

80
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:23,646
- Foreman Bae disappeared. - What?

81
00:05:23,677 --> 00:05:25,746
He disappeared without paying the hospital bill.

82
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:28,556
There really must be a scandal behind the tower crane.

83
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:31,857
How did it go with Mr. Shin at Myung Tower?

84
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:33,826
The laptop.

85
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,196
Hey.

86
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:39,967
Get ready for a meeting.

87
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:50,076
Mr. Bae Young Sik.

88
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:52,847
Why did you conceal the reason that caused the crane to topple over?

89
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:55,316
If the cause is a natural disaster,

90
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:58,117
I hear we could be more speedy to resume the construction.

91
00:05:58,117 --> 00:05:59,946
This was decided by the higher-ups.

92
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:01,857
I'd never decide on such a thing alone.

93
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:02,956
Foreman Bae disappeared.

94
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:04,626
He disappeared without paying the hospital bill.

95
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:06,857
There really must be a scandal behind the tower crane.

96
00:06:06,857 --> 00:06:09,696
Someone is hiding the injury of the tower crane operator.

97
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:11,927
I think it's Mr. Bae.

98
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:14,337
What do you think?

99
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:17,867
Those selected for the audit...

100
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:20,407
are either manipulating evidence or running off with evidence.

101
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,337
If we don't hurry,

102
00:06:22,977 --> 00:06:24,646
all evidence will become useless.

103
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,617
Fail to audit, and the company...

104
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:29,376
will suffer direct damage.

105
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:32,117
Focus, everyone.

106
00:06:36,157 --> 00:06:38,157
(President Hwang Se Woong)

107
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:47,597
So you scouted the Audit Team Manager.

108
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:50,936
There wasn't a need to import a hunting dog.

109
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:52,306
We have countless of them here.

110
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:54,737
Or are you trying to screw me up?

111
00:06:55,837 --> 00:06:57,306
You're going after Mr. Seo.

112
00:06:57,907 --> 00:07:00,146
Why is auditing Mr. Seo screwing you up?

113
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:01,917
It's okay for him to skim company funds.

114
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:04,146
Even Father turned a blind eye.

115
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:05,516
That won't happen from now on.

116
00:07:05,516 --> 00:07:07,386
- On whose order? - My order.

117
00:07:08,617 --> 00:07:09,686
I'm the President.

118
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:12,357
Right.

119
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:16,097
Being the President is the best, isn't it?

120
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:24,306
On the day of the accident,

121
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:28,607
But the tower crane operator...

122
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:31,206
only suffered one broken leg.

123
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:33,376
We're currently 12 stories high.

124
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:35,617
He should've suffered serious injuries.

125
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:38,816
Blood was found on the cabin chair headrest.

126
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:42,787
In short, Mr. Bae ran away in fear he would get busted...

127
00:07:42,787 --> 00:07:44,787
for lying about the operator's extent of injury.

128
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:48,326
He was worried he would get called to account as the site foreman.

129
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:50,797
Could this be the case?

130
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:52,696
No. Listen.

131
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:54,436
Had the operator suffered severe injuries,

132
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:55,867
why didn't the hospital get in touch?

133
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,667
Or are you suggesting Mr. Bae and the hospital worked together?

134
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:00,006
That's absurd.

135
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:02,277
The operator was lucky and got away with just a broken leg.

136
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:04,177
Did you question Mr. Choi Hyung Il?

137
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:06,407
Did you do it?

138
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:08,746
Without questioning him,

139
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:10,717
how can you believe in such a miracle?

140
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:15,617
Let's go question Mr. Choi right now.

141
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:17,857
We should check...

142
00:08:17,857 --> 00:08:20,487
why Mr. Bae ran away and if he had a reason to.

143
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:24,097
I'll look for Mr. Bae.

144
00:08:24,097 --> 00:08:27,196
There might be a way to find places he could've gone to.

145
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:29,136
Why don't we split into teams?

146
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:31,337
Ms. Ok and Mr. Moon will work together.

147
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:32,936
Ms. Yoon and I will work together.

148
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:36,576
It can't be helped. You are to work with Mr. Shin, Mr. Gu.

149
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:39,876
Mr. Gu Han Soo will be transferred...

150
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:40,977
to a different department.

151
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:44,016
It's a decision I made as the manager.

152
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:46,146
Wrap things up well.

153
00:08:49,756 --> 00:08:50,787
But...

154
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:02,867
Shin Cha Il asking for the laptop...

155
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:05,636
means he doesn't have it.

156
00:09:05,636 --> 00:09:06,707
Right?

157
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:09,707
Where on earth could the laptop be?

158
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:11,376
It couldn't be collected.

159
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,807
Maybe someone picked it up.

160
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:15,617
That could be for the better.

161
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:19,087
We shouldn't jump to conclusions.

162
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:21,416
It must be found one way or another.

163
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:24,557
In my opinion, you should report...

164
00:09:24,557 --> 00:09:27,926
to the Vice President yourself.

165
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:31,467
Darn it.

166
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:35,266
You can't drive a wrecked car.

167
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:36,697
I called for a tow truck.

168
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:38,737
Give me the car key.

169
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:41,876
You're not well, are you?

170
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:45,107
I already called our company car repair shop.

171
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:49,347
This will take some time.

172
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:51,187
We'll provide a company car for you.

173
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:53,687
- Wait just a minute. - Thank you.

174
00:09:56,687 --> 00:09:58,557
Did you really not see the laptop?

175
00:10:00,526 --> 00:10:03,256
I remember nothing after getting dragged away by the thugs.

176
00:10:03,496 --> 00:10:05,727
When I woke up, you were already unconscious.

177
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:10,496
There is information on the laptop that will conclude the audit.

178
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:12,506
Do you have it?

179
00:10:13,006 --> 00:10:14,636
I really have no idea.

180
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:20,847
- Goodness. - I'm in today, Mr. Choi.

181
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:21,847
- I'm in. - It must be a delivery, Hyun Hee.

182
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:22,847
Open the door.

183
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,717
What's this? Darn it.

184
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:27,217
- Good grief. - Seriously.

185
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:29,286
- Let's do this. - Oh, no.

186
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:30,827
Luck must be on your side.

187
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:32,987
- Hi, kid. - Hi.

188
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:35,396
- Who is he? - Hi. Who is Mr. Choi Hyung Il?

189
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:36,626
That's me.

190
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:38,996
We're from JU Construction.

191
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:40,166
Please answer our questions.

192
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,207
Back then, the materials were being pulled up from the surface.

193
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:48,207
But the tower crane collapsed with just the sudden gust of wind.

194
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,077
I thought I was going to die.

195
00:10:50,077 --> 00:10:51,577
Struggling to live was futile.

196
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:53,276
I passed out filled with regret.

197
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:55,347
When I woke up, I was at the hospital.

198
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:58,347
- You were really lucky. - I was.

199
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:01,256
How do you know Mr. Bae Young Sik?

200
00:11:01,256 --> 00:11:05,156
He's the foreman of the site, and I'm the operator.

201
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:07,026
So, no personal relationship?

202
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:08,097
No, none.

203
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:10,996
This is all I know. I can leave, right?

204
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:12,666
- Yes. Thank you for your time. - No worries.

205
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:17,967
Isn't everything clear now that the victim testified himself?

206
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:21,906
He lied that the cause of the accident was the wind.

207
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:24,947
He and Mr. Bae were junior and senior but didn't mention it.

208
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:26,977
Why didn't you argue back?

209
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:30,276
I let him be. There's a limit to auditing a subcontractor's worker.

210
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:33,516
Mr. Shin.

211
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:36,957
Tell me what you're thinking.

212
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:39,886
I really have no idea why you're stating...

213
00:11:40,957 --> 00:11:42,156
everyone is lying.

214
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:46,266
What do you think Mr. Bae's inevitable circumstance is?

215
00:11:48,296 --> 00:11:50,737
Something might be going on with his family.

216
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:53,166
With a sudden call, he could've been...

217
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,437
That's unlikely.

218
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:55,776
Go home.

219
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:04,847
Mr. Bae's house, the sauna he frequents,

220
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:07,217
the bar he's a regular at, and Mr. Kwak's house.

221
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:09,857
I tried all the places he could be, but he wasn't there.

222
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,457
What about his daughter's place?

223
00:12:12,587 --> 00:12:14,197
She's the only family he has.

224
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:16,057
That's going too far.

225
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:18,567
Things could get complicated.

226
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,097
But without finding him,

227
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,536
everything is a mystery.

228
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:25,166
Let me visit. I've met her before.

229
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:26,837
Send me the address.

230
00:12:28,176 --> 00:12:29,176
All right.

231
00:12:31,077 --> 00:12:32,077
Here, have some.

232
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:33,506
Thank you.

233
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:36,146
We met at my wedding, right?

234
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:39,746
I remember my dad introducing you as his favorite.

235
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:40,916
I see.

236
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:50,697
We're going to surprise my dad about it on his birthday.

237
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:52,227
Please keep it from him.

238
00:12:52,626 --> 00:12:53,666
I will.

239
00:12:55,737 --> 00:12:58,136
By any chance...

240
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,937
Did you contact Mr. Bae today?

241
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,646
No, I didn't. Why do you ask?

242
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:10,146
I should tell you as you're his family.

243
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:13,286
Mr. Bae suffered a minor injury...

244
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:15,317
and was admitted to the hospital.

245
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:16,317
"Hospital?"

246
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:18,987
It's nothing severe.

247
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:21,857
But he suddenly left. I want to know why.

248
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:27,597
- The call cannot be connected. - What? He's not picking up.

249
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:30,067
Is something going on at the company?

250
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,016
There is information...

251
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:51,286
on the laptop that will conclude the audit.

Do you have it?

253
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:53,487
With that,

254
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:55,057
- you'll get transferred to Florida. - To Florida.

255
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:56,857

268
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:57,416
he's right.

00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:02,925
He's the manager of our Audit Team.

365
00:23:02,986 --> 00:23:05,595
He's here to wish Gun Woong a happy birthday on behalf of everyone.

366
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:08,595
He's here even though he's not family,

367
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,595
while Dae Woong isn't even here.

368
00:23:10,796 --> 00:23:11,895
Watch what you say in front of the employees.

369
00:23:16,135 --> 00:23:18,976
Gun Woong, Mr. Shin is a very capable manager.

370
00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:22,206
We'll start afresh, so don't worry about the company.

371
00:23:22,845 --> 00:23:24,006
Just focus on your recovery.

372
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:31,085
The accident took place...

373
00:23:32,016 --> 00:23:33,486
two years after my brother was promoted to president...

374
00:23:33,486 --> 00:23:34,986
after my father's death.

375
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:38,556
That's why I was put in charge of JU Construction,

376
00:23:39,556 --> 00:23:40,925
and Dae Woong was promoted to vice president.

377
00:23:41,595 --> 00:23:43,466
- You've met Dae Woong, right? - Yes.

378
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:45,296
We have different mothers.

379
00:23:45,696 --> 00:23:47,196
So, he's rough around the edges.

380
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:49,065
He's very different from me and Gun Woong.

381
00:23:53,206 --> 00:23:55,375
I rarely talk about myself to my employees.

382
00:23:55,575 --> 00:23:57,006
But with you, I feel like I can tell you everything.

383
00:23:58,815 --> 00:24:00,615
You know I really trust you, right?

384
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:03,286
The first step is the most important.

385
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:05,815
Please do a good job with the audit.

386
00:24:14,796 --> 00:24:16,026
Darn it.

387
00:24:18,296 --> 00:24:20,865
President Hwang went to the hospital for your brother's birthday.

388
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,006
Don't you have to go too?

389
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:26,536
I suppose you have a lot to hide,

390
00:24:26,706 --> 00:24:28,575
seeing how you're trying to crack such a lame joke.

391
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,946
I burned that laptop,

392
00:24:34,615 --> 00:24:36,085
so just be your usual self.

393
00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:37,115
You burned it?

394
00:24:37,286 --> 00:24:39,855
Why would you even worry about that? We're busy building apartments.

395
00:24:40,085 --> 00:24:41,085
Let's play.

396
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:44,186
You've been under a lot of stress. Blow off some steam.

397
00:24:44,186 --> 00:24:45,296
What about Shin Cha Il though?

398
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:47,296
I'll fire that jerk no matter what.

399
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:48,766
Go on. Go ahead.

400
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:50,895
Oh, my.

401
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,065
What a nice shot.

402
00:25:02,905 --> 00:25:04,806
(Emergency Medical Center)

403
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:16,956
(Inpo tower crane accident)

404
00:25:16,956 --> 00:25:18,526
(10:27am accident, ER admission after 4pm)

405
00:25:21,256 --> 00:25:22,296
Here you go.

406
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:24,665
The files from Foreman Bae's office.

407
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:25,796
Thanks.

408
00:25:26,365 --> 00:25:28,236
Why do you look so solemn?

409
00:25:28,905 --> 00:25:30,905
I was looking into the day of the accident.

410
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,706
The timeline's a bit weird.

411
00:25:32,776 --> 00:25:33,776
Is it?

412
00:25:33,835 --> 00:25:36,645
- The accident was at 10:27am. - Yes.

413
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:40,175
The injured laborers were taken to hospital around noon.

414
00:25:40,175 --> 00:25:41,675
But crane operator Mr. Choi...

415
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:44,885
was admitted to the ER after 4pm.

416
00:25:46,355 --> 00:25:47,585
That's over five hours later.

417
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:48,756
Just a moment.

418
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,155
Isn't the hospital ten minutes from the site?

419
00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:52,996
Maybe he felt a sudden urge to poop.

420
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,925
Who poops for five hours?

421
00:25:55,925 --> 00:25:57,065
You're so naive.

422
00:25:57,165 --> 00:25:58,496
When a man is injured,

423
00:25:58,496 --> 00:26:00,766
his anal sphincter relaxes and stuff falls out.

424
00:26:00,766 --> 00:26:02,065
However often you wipe.

425
00:26:02,065 --> 00:26:03,236
It's torture.

426
00:26:03,536 --> 00:26:04,605
That's nonsense.

427
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:05,976
Why is it nonsense?

428
00:26:06,135 --> 00:26:08,206
The simple answer is the correct one.

429
00:26:13,476 --> 00:26:14,645
Hello, Audit Team.

430
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:16,686
Yes, sir.

431
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:18,686
Got it.

432
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:21,186
Was it Mr. Shin? What did he say?

433
00:26:21,186 --> 00:26:23,256
He wants the address of an Ahn Byung Jin.

434
00:26:23,256 --> 00:26:24,686
Who's Ahn Byung Jin?

435
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:27,395
Does he want to visit?

436
00:26:27,595 --> 00:26:28,696
I guess?

437
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,266
Ahn Byung Jin?

438
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:32,466
Hello, it's Yoon Seo Jin from the Audit Team.

439
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,065
I need the address of someone called Ahn Byung Jin.

440
00:26:37,165 --> 00:26:38,206
Okay.

441
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:39,736
Text me the address too.

442
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:43,345
- Why? Will you join Mr. Shin? - Yes.

443
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:45,046
Won't you get told off for acting without orders?

444
00:26:45,046 --> 00:26:46,546
Of course not.

445
00:26:46,546 --> 00:26:47,915
He should stick close to Mr. Shin.

446
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:49,315
You're doing great, Han Soo.

447
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:52,415
Seo Jin.

448
00:26:52,556 --> 00:26:54,186
I think the five hours is important.

449
00:26:54,186 --> 00:26:55,425
Send me the address.

450
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,466
(From: Woohee Police Station)

451
00:27:03,466 --> 00:27:05,936
(To Bae Young Sik, Inpo-gu Ganghu-ro 48-3)

452
00:27:05,936 --> 00:27:08,036
(Ahn Byung Jin's address is Dorae-gu Baegil-ro 342 Gutaek Villa B03)

453
00:27:08,036 --> 00:27:09,236
(Baegil-ro 342)

454
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:13,135
(Gutaek Villa)

455
00:27:20,446 --> 00:27:21,575
Mr. Shin.

456
00:27:32,355 --> 00:27:33,496
Mr. Shin.

457
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,226
Is anyone home?

458
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:40,395
What's this smell?

459
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:42,605
Mr. Shin.

460
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:09,296
Did you find the laptop?

461
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:14,095
This was Ahn Byung Jin's home, right?

462
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:15,405
Why were you here?

463
00:28:15,936 --> 00:28:18,466
Why would he leave food out to rot...

464
00:28:20,605 --> 00:28:21,776
This is Shin Cha Il.

465
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,175
It's Yoon Seo Jin.

466
00:28:23,675 --> 00:28:25,645
I looked up tickets issued to Foreman Bae's car...

467
00:28:25,645 --> 00:28:28,046
and found something odd on the day of the accident.

468
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:31,686
He was caught speeding three times on Route 77.

469
00:28:32,286 --> 00:28:34,256
The times were 11:10am,

470
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:35,925
11:30am,

471
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:38,425
and 11:55am, three times.

472
00:28:38,895 --> 00:28:41,796
I don't think these were taken en route...

473
00:28:41,796 --> 00:28:43,895
from the construction site to the hospital.

474
00:28:44,665 --> 00:28:46,565
On that day, Foreman Bae...

475
00:28:46,565 --> 00:28:49,065
drove Mr. Choi to the ER five hours later.

476
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:50,966
I think...

477
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:53,236
this is the reason.

478
00:28:55,036 --> 00:28:56,246
Good work.

479
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:59,746
Can I know what...

480
00:29:12,526 --> 00:29:13,655
Let's go.

481
00:29:20,835 --> 00:29:24,966
(Route 77)

482
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:48,756
(Darang Reservoir)

483
00:30:07,546 --> 00:30:08,815
Why are we here?

484
00:30:12,385 --> 00:30:13,615
Please tell me.

485
00:30:13,756 --> 00:30:15,456
You told me to wrap things up well.

486
00:30:26,436 --> 00:30:28,095
I took this photo from that home.

487
00:30:28,165 --> 00:30:30,865
The man who operated the tower crane that day.

488
00:30:31,006 --> 00:30:32,206
Ahn Byung Jin.

489
00:30:33,405 --> 00:30:34,476
But...

490
00:30:34,476 --> 00:30:36,946
the tower crane operator was Mr. Choi.

491
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:46,516
The person from the tower crane is not the man brought to the ER.

492
00:30:46,986 --> 00:30:48,855
Foreman Bae switched them.

493
00:30:51,756 --> 00:30:53,226
This is Byung Jin.

494
00:30:53,456 --> 00:30:57,026
There's a tower crane operator called Ahn Byung Jin.

495
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,696
We rarely hire him because he caused an accident.

496
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:03,835
I guess they were rushed enough that day to hire him.

497
00:31:04,605 --> 00:31:05,776
Then...

498
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:07,936
where is Ahn Byung Jin now?

499
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:10,446
This reservoir is a 90-minute drive from the site.

500
00:31:10,546 --> 00:31:12,546
Mr. Choi lives two hours from here.

501
00:31:12,615 --> 00:31:15,415
It takes 90 minutes to get from Mr. Choi's to the hospital.

502
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:18,216
He probably saved 5 to 10 minutes max by speeding.

503
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:21,615
It's not enough time to dig a hole.

504
00:31:22,585 --> 00:31:23,885
What do you mean "dig a hole?"

505
00:31:25,956 --> 00:31:27,425
The ER CCTV showed...

506
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:29,696
Foreman Bae left muddy footprints.

507
00:31:30,526 --> 00:31:32,065
He was here.

508
00:31:32,835 --> 00:31:35,296
Foreman Bae was here? To do what?

509
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:38,835
Ahn Byung Jin never returned home after the accident.

510
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:41,135
Mr. Bae dropped him in here?

511
00:31:42,036 --> 00:31:43,105
Come on.

512
00:31:43,246 --> 00:31:44,345
No way.

513
00:31:44,746 --> 00:31:45,875
No way.

514
00:31:46,016 --> 00:31:47,575
I may not know him completely,

515
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,486
but Foreman Bae would never do that.

516
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:53,286
You don't know Bae Young Sik at all.

517
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:55,186
It's not him.

518
00:31:55,315 --> 00:31:56,885
Who would do such a thing?

519
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:02,766
I got into the laptop.

520
00:32:05,395 --> 00:32:06,665
I saw the secret contract.

521
00:32:07,766 --> 00:32:09,865
Mr. Bae was the foreman,

522
00:32:10,006 --> 00:32:11,605
so he'd need the secret contract...

523
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:14,575
in case he had to get parts to fix the crane.

524
00:32:15,405 --> 00:32:17,046
He embezzled, yes, but...

525
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:19,746
Foreman Bae would never do something like that.

526
00:32:19,746 --> 00:32:22,046
That's why I say you can't be on our team.

527
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:24,446
Mr. Bae deserted...

528
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:26,585
a severely injured man to hide his embezzlement.

529
00:32:26,686 --> 00:32:29,686
That's deceiving and destroying the organization.

530
00:32:35,296 --> 00:32:36,696
I want to report a missing person.

531
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:37,996
- Darang Reservoir... - Over there.

532
00:32:38,796 --> 00:32:40,135
Let's look over there.

533
00:32:42,036 --> 00:32:43,936
It won't be too late to report then.

534
00:32:45,206 --> 00:32:46,736
If Mr. Bae's there,

535
00:32:47,105 --> 00:32:48,675
I'll make him turn himself in.

536
00:32:49,905 --> 00:32:51,306
Please give me a chance.

538
00:33:00,415 --> 00:33:03,026
(Dowoon Physicist)

539
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:04,325
- Excuse me. - Yes?

540
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:05,625
Do you have any inpatients?

541
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,696
No. Is this your first visit?

542
00:33:09,496 --> 00:33:11,065
You really don't have any inpatients?

543
00:33:11,996 --> 00:33:14,365
We don't. What's ailing you?

544
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:16,236
Can we look around the rooms?

545
00:33:16,966 --> 00:33:18,635
Hey, there's no one here.

546
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:20,875
- We won't take long. - You can't go inside!

547
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,075
Let us just check.

548
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,645
- No! - Just this once.

549
00:33:24,645 --> 00:33:26,145
- You can't! - Just a look around.

550
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:49,066
Mr. Bae!

551
00:33:51,606 --> 00:33:53,235
Leave us alone.

552
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,746
Darn you.

553
00:34:03,646 --> 00:34:05,545
You brought a badly injured man to a physicist?

554
00:34:05,615 --> 00:34:07,086
Will you go away?

555
00:34:10,356 --> 00:34:11,485
Darn you!

556
00:34:13,856 --> 00:34:15,025
Wait!

557
00:34:16,295 --> 00:34:17,795
Why are you doing this?

558
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:20,436
Han Soo. Byung Jin's alive.

559
00:34:20,496 --> 00:34:21,766
So just go away!

560
00:34:21,766 --> 00:34:23,306
Then nothing will happen!

561
00:34:23,306 --> 00:34:25,775
You neglected a severely injured man and tried to cover it up.

562
00:34:26,476 --> 00:34:28,005
If you don't stop,

563
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:29,675
we'll all die here!

564
00:34:34,045 --> 00:34:35,985
She's my daughter. A beauty, right?

565
00:34:35,985 --> 00:34:38,016
She's the prettiest when she smiles.

566
00:34:49,695 --> 00:34:50,896
Mr. Bae.

567
00:34:50,896 --> 00:34:52,266
Calm down and look at me.

568
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:54,595
Do you remember that time we talked in front of a bar?

569
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:57,306
You boasted that your daughter has a beautiful smile.

570
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:59,376
Your daughter is crying right now.

571
00:35:00,075 --> 00:35:01,306
Why is she crying?

572
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:03,575
We visited her place to look for you.

573
00:35:03,646 --> 00:35:05,106
I explained to her what happened,

574
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:07,445
and she cried.

575
00:35:12,516 --> 00:35:14,086
She says she's pregnant.

576
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:18,726
You should live to see your grandchild.

577
00:35:40,746 --> 00:35:42,746
What a piece of junk.

578
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:27,396
Hurry and get him out.

579
00:36:28,825 --> 00:36:29,896
Hey.

580
00:36:30,025 --> 00:36:31,865
Hey, get up.

581
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:07,795
What is it?

582
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:09,235
Mr. Seo,

583
00:37:09,235 --> 00:37:12,206
there was an accident.

584
00:37:12,206 --> 00:37:14,876
The tower crane toppled over.

585
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:16,405
The operator...

586
00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:18,646
I think the operator died.

587
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:50,106
Byung Jin? Byung Jin!

588
00:37:55,615 --> 00:37:57,985
(Dowoon Physicist)

589
00:37:59,586 --> 00:38:01,586
Are you crazy? Why would I get admitted to a hospital?

590
00:38:01,586 --> 00:38:03,255
You only work if you get paid under the table,

591
00:38:03,255 --> 00:38:05,255
so Byung Jin even switched turns...

592
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:08,726
- and operated it in your place! - Then you should've paid me!

593
00:38:08,726 --> 00:38:10,226
- Darn it. - What?

594
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:15,496
Do you need me to tell your wife that you're gambling again?

595
00:38:15,595 --> 00:38:17,706
Should I tell her you're throwing away half...

596
00:38:17,706 --> 00:38:18,766
of your wages gambling?

597
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:20,505
- Gosh. - Hyung Il, please.

598
00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:23,445
It's just for a week.

599
00:38:23,445 --> 00:38:26,575
You'll get paid compensation too.

600
00:38:26,675 --> 00:38:29,316
I can't believe the things I do for you.

601
00:38:29,316 --> 00:38:31,316
- Gosh. Where to? - Thank you.

602
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:33,086
Go.

603
00:38:43,295 --> 00:38:44,396
I'm sorry.

604
00:38:49,505 --> 00:38:50,936
Even if you were lucky,

605
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:53,836
you should have a broken leg at least.

606
00:38:54,675 --> 00:38:55,836
Mr. Seo told me...

607
00:38:57,075 --> 00:38:59,845
the construction would be halted if anyone died.

608
00:39:01,345 --> 00:39:02,916
He said I'd be arrested.

609
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:05,286
I was scared of that.

610
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,416
But how did you dare do something so serious?

611
00:39:09,485 --> 00:39:11,686
I wanted to put up a nice wedding for my daughter,

612
00:39:14,095 --> 00:39:15,996
so I received money from Mr. Seo.

613
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:19,536
Did you receive money from him?

614
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:23,905
I knew the tower crane was faulty.

615
00:39:24,235 --> 00:39:27,235
He also promised the workers full-time jobs.

616
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:31,345
Ever since I took that money,

617
00:39:31,905 --> 00:39:34,316
I became Mr. Seo's puppet.

618
00:39:39,016 --> 00:39:40,586
(Ward 2)

619
00:39:52,295 --> 00:39:53,695
Transfer him to the Naseon General Hospital.

620
00:40:04,075 --> 00:40:05,376
(Ambulance)

621
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:20,527
(JU Construction)

622
00:40:20,676 --> 00:40:22,676
Something disgraceful happened at our company.

623
00:40:23,376 --> 00:40:24,906
Luckily, there were no deaths,

624
00:40:24,906 --> 00:40:27,276
so it won't make too much noise.

625
00:40:27,816 --> 00:40:29,745
The problem is with the testimony from the foreman.

626
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:32,546
Apparently, he was ordered.

627
00:40:39,026 --> 00:40:42,225
When people are cornered, they're bound to make excuses.

628
00:40:42,865 --> 00:40:44,026
Is it irrelevant to you?

629
00:40:44,495 --> 00:40:47,665
What good would it do for me to order something like that?

630
00:40:47,796 --> 00:40:50,305
He hid someone nearing death to avoid trouble.

631
00:40:50,305 --> 00:40:51,606
Why would you listen to him?

632
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:54,776
Let's treat some reporters to a meal and wrap it up.

633
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:57,705
I heard the wall construction went well.

634
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,115
We should go treat the workers to glasses of makgeolli.

635
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:01,645
Let's do that.

636
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:05,285
I request to perform a special audit on Mr. Seo Gil Pyo.

637
00:41:13,495 --> 00:41:15,156
I accuse him of these suspicions.

638
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:16,765
"Suspicions?"

639
00:41:17,066 --> 00:41:18,696
How dare you?

640
00:41:19,495 --> 00:41:20,935
Our special audits include...

641
00:41:21,196 --> 00:41:25,265
Old Man Hwang and the major shareholders.

642
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:26,336
(Proposal for Disciplinary Action)

643
00:41:26,336 --> 00:41:28,606
One slip and you could get humiliated,

644
00:41:29,176 --> 00:41:30,205
President Hwang.

645
00:41:36,046 --> 00:41:37,115
Please prepare it.

646
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:46,856
That jerk...

647
00:41:58,865 --> 00:42:01,705
It's my fault. I was sloppy.

648
00:42:03,305 --> 00:42:04,376
Don't worry.

649
00:42:05,406 --> 00:42:08,415
You always cleaned up after me whenever I made a mess.

650
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:10,645
You'd take Father's beating in my place too.

651
00:42:12,856 --> 00:42:15,816
This time, I'll repay you.

652
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:27,566
Gosh, why didn't the foreman take the operator to the hospital?

653
00:42:27,736 --> 00:42:29,466
The punishment wouldn't have been much.

654
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:32,606
Sometimes people make the wrong judgments.

655
00:42:32,606 --> 00:42:36,305
This is no time to sit back and relax.

656
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:37,946
We're also guilty of taking bribes.

657
00:42:38,276 --> 00:42:39,845
What bribes?

658
00:42:40,946 --> 00:42:42,046
You're right.

659
00:42:42,046 --> 00:42:43,245
We did.

660
00:42:43,245 --> 00:42:44,745
Drinks, taxi fare, and gifts.

661
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:47,055
It'd be a headache if all of these are taken into account.

662
00:42:47,455 --> 00:42:49,386
Gosh. Hey, Han Soo.

663
00:42:49,555 --> 00:42:50,886
Did Mr. Shin say anything about us?

664
00:42:50,886 --> 00:42:53,026
(Name: Hwang Dae Woong)

665
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,926
I have to find the laptop.

666
00:42:54,926 --> 00:42:57,066
What are you saying? So did he or not?

667
00:42:59,865 --> 00:43:00,995
Hello.

668
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,906
- Hello. - Hello.

669
00:43:03,106 --> 00:43:05,435
We'll perform a special audit on Mr. Seo Gil Pyo.

670
00:43:05,665 --> 00:43:08,035
It'll happen at 2pm on March 13 in the meeting room.

671
00:43:08,506 --> 00:43:11,546
The president, executives, staff, and major shareholders will attend.

672
00:43:12,406 --> 00:43:13,645
Please prepare for it thoroughly.

673
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:15,075
- Okay. - Okay.

674
00:43:20,156 --> 00:43:21,486
Strange. How strange.

675
00:43:21,486 --> 00:43:23,356
He's performing a special audit on the senior managing director?

676
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:26,325
He's wasting his time. He's digging his own grave.

677
00:43:26,325 --> 00:43:29,455
This will get Shin Cha Il fired for sure.

678
00:43:29,455 --> 00:43:31,665
Please, Mr. Yang.

679
00:43:32,466 --> 00:43:35,636
Luckily the laptop is gone. It would cause so much trouble.

680
00:43:35,895 --> 00:43:37,435
I'm amazed by the Vice President.

681
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:38,665
I can't believe he burned it.

682
00:43:38,665 --> 00:43:40,636
Keep it down.

683
00:43:42,106 --> 00:43:43,406
Was the laptop burned?

684
00:43:44,075 --> 00:43:46,316
Did he really burn it?

685
00:43:47,316 --> 00:43:49,245
Have a good day, Mr. Yang.

686
00:43:49,845 --> 00:43:51,946
Mr. Gu, follow me. Come on.

687
00:43:52,645 --> 00:43:55,915
Han Soo. That's none of your business, isn't it?

688
00:43:55,915 --> 00:43:57,886
Your business is with Mr. Shin.

689
00:43:57,886 --> 00:44:01,026
Report his every move to us, Han Soo. Got it?

690
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:05,995
I really regret listening to you.

691
00:44:07,595 --> 00:44:09,765
Good gracious. Hey.

(Yeonseon Police Station)

693
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:22,915
Allow me to visit him for a bit.

694
00:44:24,386 --> 00:44:25,415
Mr. Bae.

695
00:44:26,785 --> 00:44:28,386
What? Han Soo.

696
00:44:29,185 --> 00:44:30,225
What about Byung Jin?

697
00:44:31,926 --> 00:44:34,825
Mr. Ahn is a lot better now. And he'll get better.

698
00:44:36,526 --> 00:44:38,526
I shouldn't have followed the order.

699
00:44:39,196 --> 00:44:40,665
The moment I saw my daughter,

700
00:44:41,165 --> 00:44:42,865
I realized I committed a crime.

701
00:44:43,106 --> 00:44:46,066
Yes. It's a grave crime.

702
00:44:47,205 --> 00:44:50,305
You should get punished for your wrongdoings,

703
00:44:50,305 --> 00:44:51,946
but we should find out what you didn't do.

704
00:44:52,506 --> 00:44:55,316
On the day you talked with Mr. Seo over the phone.

705
00:44:56,075 --> 00:44:57,345
Did you record it?

706
00:44:57,645 --> 00:44:59,615
Of course not. I was all over the place.

00:45:18,236 --> 00:45:19,535
Yes, Gu Han Soo speaking.

- took the lives of workers... - Proper production standards...

711

don't exist for tower cranes.

712
00:45:34,256 --> 00:45:35,986
Similar to traffic fatalities,

713
00:45:35,986 --> 00:45:38,126
- without circumlocution... - The tower crane accident...

714
00:45:38,126 --> 00:45:40,225
- was caused by old... - The tower crane that passed fit...

715
00:45:40,225 --> 00:45:41,955
- Had the accident... - The one...

716
00:45:41,955 --> 00:45:43,095
- not happened... - responsible...

Myung Tower's President wants to continue our deal.

719
00:46:05,245 --> 00:46:07,316
He will testify during the special audit.

720
00:46:08,386 --> 00:46:11,486
Saying he can't hide the truth, he will disclose...

721
00:46:12,285 --> 00:46:14,356
the transfer details between him and Mr. Seo.

722

00:47:00,676 --> 00:47:02,106
It's been a while.

726
00:47:03,075 --> 00:47:04,075
Hi.

727
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,716
Numerous special audits were held when your father was here.

728
00:47:09,716 --> 00:47:12,415
He loved it when people gathered.

729
00:47:12,546 --> 00:47:15,955
Shouldn't you mind your manners? He's the President now.

730
00:47:16,356 --> 00:47:19,426
Nonsense. I practically raised Se Woong.

731
00:47:26,466 --> 00:47:28,336
Don't cause any trouble.

732
00:47:28,736 --> 00:47:30,165
Keep this up, all right?

733
00:47:46,145 --> 00:47:47,415
You must be nervous.

734
00:47:50,656 --> 00:47:53,455
It's only natural. They'll give you the ax.

735
00:47:54,656 --> 00:47:58,196
And I really will chop your head off.

736
00:48:03,136 --> 00:48:05,066
No, stop it.

737
00:48:05,205 --> 00:48:07,975
Verbal abuse in companies is a big problem, right?

738
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:11,676
Report me to the Ministry of Employment and Labor.

739
00:48:11,676 --> 00:48:12,805
I'll acknowledge what I did.

740
00:48:19,345 --> 00:48:23,386
(JU Construction)

741
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:33,636
Where's Gu Han Soo?

742
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:34,935
I'll give him a call.

743
00:48:36,236 --> 00:48:39,535
Thank you very much for making a tough decision, Mr. Park.

744
00:48:39,535 --> 00:48:41,776
Well, anyone would do the same.

745
00:48:43,475 --> 00:48:44,645
Here comes Mr. Shin.

746
00:49:08,796 --> 00:49:11,406
(JU Construction)

747
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,475
I'm the Audit Team Manager Shin Cha Il.

748
00:49:20,145 --> 00:49:21,546
Let's start the special audit.

749
00:49:22,745 --> 00:49:25,446
Around 10am on January 16, 2024,

750
00:49:25,446 --> 00:49:27,386
a tower crane collapsed...

751
00:49:27,586 --> 00:49:30,185
at the construction site of Inpo Apartment.

752
00:49:30,856 --> 00:49:33,555
The missing certificate of manufacture...

753
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:35,856
and the defect of the unapproved tower crane...

754
00:49:35,856 --> 00:49:37,196
were the cause of the accident.

755
00:49:37,696 --> 00:49:40,796
The Audit Team made an amateur mistake.

756
00:49:41,595 --> 00:49:43,836
Honorable President and executives.

757
00:49:44,165 --> 00:49:47,606
It is regrettable to hold such a meeting, regardless of all reasons.

758
00:49:48,406 --> 00:49:51,276
Our newly appointed Audit Team Manager...

759
00:49:51,606 --> 00:49:53,046
is too passionate.

760
00:49:55,645 --> 00:49:57,586
Historically speaking,

761
00:49:57,586 --> 00:49:59,515
as construction companies...

762
00:49:59,685 --> 00:50:02,156
could no longer possess tower cranes due to the IMF,

763
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:05,256
they weren't obligated to submit certificates of manufacture.

764
00:50:05,526 --> 00:50:08,495
Hence, tower cranes weren't approved and wore out.

765
00:50:08,796 --> 00:50:10,796
That's why finding a decent tower crane...

766
00:50:11,165 --> 00:50:13,296
has become harder than finding a decent assemblyman.

767
00:50:13,895 --> 00:50:14,966
You are wrong.

768
00:50:15,136 --> 00:50:17,506
Certificate of manufacture has become mandatory years ago.

769
00:50:18,136 --> 00:50:20,136
We should've received a functional tower crane...

770
00:50:20,136 --> 00:50:22,305
with proper sorting and screening procedures.

771
00:50:22,305 --> 00:50:24,245
The construction cost us over 700 million dollars.

772
00:50:24,446 --> 00:50:27,075
Even a day of delay causes a big loss.

773
00:50:27,276 --> 00:50:29,376
We can't waste time on a tower crane.

774
00:50:29,376 --> 00:50:31,185
People's lives depend on it.

775
00:50:33,586 --> 00:50:36,185
You're determined to make me the bad guy, aren't you?

776
00:50:36,486 --> 00:50:39,656
Every year, 2,000 people die in car accidents.

777
00:50:39,825 --> 00:50:41,196
Even if sturdy cars...

778
00:50:41,196 --> 00:50:43,426
and safe roads are built,

779
00:50:43,626 --> 00:50:45,265
people die if luck is not on their side.

780
00:50:45,926 --> 00:50:48,535
The recent accident was purely out of bad luck.

781
00:50:48,535 --> 00:50:50,336
It is not such a wide-ranging issue.

782
00:50:50,336 --> 00:50:53,606
Less than ten tower cranes are used in an apartment construction site.

783
00:50:53,606 --> 00:50:55,606
Follow the rules strictly,

784
00:50:55,606 --> 00:50:57,176
and accidents can be prevented.

785
00:50:58,406 --> 00:51:00,115
You can't treat it with luck.

786
00:51:00,645 --> 00:51:02,716
I may look irresponsible,

787
00:51:02,816 --> 00:51:04,685
treating it with luck.

788
00:51:04,986 --> 00:51:06,756
But the result will be the same...

789
00:51:06,756 --> 00:51:08,515
regardless of who selects the tower cranes.

790
00:51:09,386 --> 00:51:12,426
Why did you pay for it as a functional tower crane?

791
00:51:12,886 --> 00:51:15,325
And why did you keep the difference...

792
00:51:15,555 --> 00:51:17,095
and not transfer it to the company?

793
00:51:18,696 --> 00:51:20,435
I kept the difference?

794
00:51:21,395 --> 00:51:22,736
Who said so?

795
00:51:22,736 --> 00:51:24,865
The President of Myung Tower, who supplies tower cranes...

796
00:51:24,865 --> 00:51:26,566
to JU Construction, will testify.

797
00:51:26,975 --> 00:51:28,035
What was that?

798
00:51:31,276 --> 00:51:34,345
Don't get nervous. Please only state the truth.

799
00:51:39,046 --> 00:51:40,356
How dare you slander me?

800
00:51:42,615 --> 00:51:45,725
Why would I slander you, Mr. Seo?

801
00:51:46,086 --> 00:51:47,156
I...

802
00:51:47,725 --> 00:51:50,926
came to thank Mr. Seo for doing business...

803
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,966
with Myung Tower.

804
00:51:56,495 --> 00:51:59,506
Mr. Park. You said you had the bank transactions.

805
00:51:59,506 --> 00:52:00,506
I did?

806
00:52:01,136 --> 00:52:02,975
I never said such a thing.

807
00:52:29,665 --> 00:52:31,836
The President of Myung Tower will not testify.

808
00:52:34,236 --> 00:52:35,876
He made a promise to me.

809
00:52:35,876 --> 00:52:37,745
Mr. Seo and him are relatives.

810
00:52:37,745 --> 00:52:39,745
He must know the laptop is missing.

811
00:52:39,876 --> 00:52:41,345
That promise to testify is a trap.

812
00:52:41,446 --> 00:52:42,546
(Glass Bottles)

813
00:52:42,546 --> 00:52:43,685
Search...

814
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:45,986
for something else.

815
00:52:54,356 --> 00:52:57,165
Who prepares a special audit like this?

816
00:52:57,165 --> 00:52:58,426
It's a total mess.

817
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,736
The President shouldn't have the authority...

818
00:53:00,736 --> 00:53:02,595
over the Audit Team Manager.

819
00:53:27,696 --> 00:53:30,696
There is another worker responsible for this recent accident.

820
00:53:31,066 --> 00:53:33,066
- It's Foreman Bae. - Play this.

821
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:35,265
Responsible for the site,

822
00:53:35,265 --> 00:53:37,506
Mr. Bae Young Sik knew the tower crane was defective.

823
00:53:38,136 --> 00:53:40,305
In order to stop him from talking,

824
00:53:40,506 --> 00:53:42,205
someone bribed him.

825
00:53:44,475 --> 00:53:45,705
And it was Mr. Seo Gil Pyo.

826
00:53:45,845 --> 00:53:47,475
That's absurd!

827
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:49,446
What's wrong with you, Mr. Shin?

828
00:53:50,615 --> 00:53:51,645
What is it?

829
00:53:52,216 --> 00:53:54,086
Mr. Seo,

830
00:53:54,386 --> 00:53:57,086
there was an accident.

831
00:53:57,825 --> 00:53:59,455
The tower crane toppled over.

832
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:01,325
The operator...

833
00:54:01,796 --> 00:54:03,296
I think the operator died.

834
00:54:04,566 --> 00:54:06,296
What? Are you sure?

835
00:54:06,395 --> 00:54:08,495
Yes. I think so.

836
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,205
I'm driving with him in my car.

837
00:54:12,406 --> 00:54:13,676
He's not breathing.

838
00:54:14,035 --> 00:54:15,176
Did anyone see?

839
00:54:15,636 --> 00:54:17,006
Did anyone see him die?

840
00:54:17,006 --> 00:54:19,245
No, no one saw him die.

841
00:54:20,975 --> 00:54:22,245
Bury him somewhere quiet...

842
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,946
- or throw him in the water. - What?

843
00:54:25,015 --> 00:54:26,446
Deal with him in secret!

844
00:54:26,816 --> 00:54:28,415
You want me to do what?

845
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,716
Keep your wits about you.

846
00:54:29,986 --> 00:54:32,725
If someone dies, the police will get involved.

847
00:54:32,825 --> 00:54:36,595
They'll find out you and I accepted bribes from Myung Tower,

848
00:54:36,865 --> 00:54:39,365
and that we were using a defective tower crane!

849
00:54:39,865 --> 00:54:43,265
If that happens, you and I will never see daylight again.

850
00:54:43,566 --> 00:54:44,665
Do you get that?

851
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,035
This was recorded...

852
00:54:46,305 --> 00:54:48,106
on a dashcam on the day of the accident.

853
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,176
Mr. Bae was going to dump the operator in a reservoir,

854
00:54:51,305 --> 00:54:52,645
but he changed his mind.

855
00:54:53,816 --> 00:54:55,216
Senior Managing Director Seo Gil Pyo...

856
00:54:55,515 --> 00:54:57,915
avoided the duty his title comes with and threatened...

857
00:54:57,915 --> 00:54:59,816
the lives of many workers by saying...

858
00:54:59,816 --> 00:55:02,785
machinery operates on luck and old practices.

859
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:05,886
And he secretly shared bribes with the foreman...

860
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,256
and embezzled habitually.

861
00:55:08,356 --> 00:55:09,626
JU Construction is of the opinion...

862
00:55:09,626 --> 00:55:12,566
that we can no longer work with Senior Managing Director Seo.

863
00:55:13,865 --> 00:55:15,796
I request the Special Audit Committee...

864
00:55:16,095 --> 00:55:17,566
give Senior Managing Director Seo...

865
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:21,435
the maximum penalty...

866
00:55:22,035 --> 00:55:23,376
of dismissal.

867
00:55:27,415 --> 00:55:30,645
Criminal charges will be pressed by the police waiting outside.

868
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,955
Myung Tower sells defective cranes and is a corrupt subcontractor.

869
00:55:34,955 --> 00:55:36,356
We must cut ties with them...

870
00:55:36,356 --> 00:55:37,955
and sue for damages.

871
00:55:41,325 --> 00:55:44,196
Yes. That is the right thing to do.

872
00:55:46,696 --> 00:55:49,265
I also demand Vice President Hwang be penalized.

873
00:55:51,435 --> 00:55:52,566
Vice President Hwang...

874
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:55,836
damaged a laptop that held evidence in this investigation.

875
00:55:56,535 --> 00:55:57,946
You have two options.

876
00:55:57,946 --> 00:55:59,776
One, deny you didn't do so.

877
00:55:59,776 --> 00:56:01,876
Two, admit doing so and apologize.

878
00:56:02,716 --> 00:56:04,145
If you choose option one,

879
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:07,156
I'll play CCTV footage of you burning the laptop.

880
00:56:08,685 --> 00:56:10,325
There were many cameras at the scene.

881
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:12,586
The choice is yours.

882
00:56:37,415 --> 00:56:38,745
I apologize.

883
00:56:43,515 --> 00:56:46,656
JU Construction is working properly at last.

884
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,446
Mr. Shin told me...

885
00:57:13,685 --> 00:57:15,015
to find the dashcam.

886
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,955
He said Mr. Bae would know, so I visited him to ask.

887
00:57:18,256 --> 00:57:20,156
He said he'd smashed the dashcam...

888
00:57:20,156 --> 00:57:22,455
and dumped it in Mr. Choi's villa garbage site.

889
00:57:22,495 --> 00:57:23,595
So what?

890
00:57:23,966 --> 00:57:25,426
That was over a month ago.

891
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,595
I searched all the garbage...

892
00:57:27,595 --> 00:57:29,365
wondering if it would be there.

893
00:57:29,435 --> 00:57:31,265
Dashcam memory cards are tiny.

894
00:57:31,265 --> 00:57:33,535
It was stuck in a corner of a garbage can...

895
00:57:33,535 --> 00:57:34,776
and I found it.

896
00:57:35,736 --> 00:57:37,205
Good for you, Gu Han Soo.

897
00:57:37,305 --> 00:57:38,876
- I'm impressed. - Thanks.

898
00:57:39,745 --> 00:57:40,745
Well done.

899
00:57:40,876 --> 00:57:42,276
What was Mr. Shin...

900
00:57:42,276 --> 00:57:45,415
going to do if you couldn't find the recording?

901
00:57:46,415 --> 00:57:47,656
- What do you think? - Goodness.

902
00:57:47,915 --> 00:57:48,955
Sorry.

903
00:57:48,955 --> 00:57:50,015
Why did you jump?

904
00:57:51,055 --> 00:57:53,026
I bet he'd have packed and run.

905
00:57:54,256 --> 00:57:55,555
Get back to work.

906
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:58,495
Why make a fuss when you found just one thing?

907
00:57:58,495 --> 00:58:00,895
Goodness. You think you're amazing.

909

You barely had the time to settle in.

910
00:58:09,106 --> 00:58:10,745
Good job, Mr. Shin.

911
00:58:10,906 --> 00:58:12,946
I only did my job.

912
00:58:14,015 --> 00:58:15,176
It's so reassuring.

913
00:58:15,345 --> 00:58:16,745

00:58:16,745 --> 00:58:18,946

915
00:58:38,305 --> 00:58:39,636
What's so funny?

00:58:40,506 --> 00:58:41,606
Mi Jin.

00:58:41,906 --> 00:58:44,245
The Audit Team has a new manager.

918
00:58:44,745 --> 00:58:47,006
He docked my pay for three months.

919
00:58:47,006 --> 00:58:48,216
What the heck?

920
00:58:48,216 --> 00:58:49,546
What the heck, right?

921
00:58:51,316 --> 00:58:52,486
Your kid isn't home yet?

922
00:58:52,486 --> 00:58:55,015
She texted to say she got the bus. She'll be here soon.

923
00:58:55,785 --> 00:58:57,086
You didn't see her today?

924
00:58:57,526 --> 00:58:59,386
We don't say hi at work.

925
00:59:02,156 --> 00:59:03,225
That's her.

926
00:59:04,365 --> 00:59:05,765
I'm home.

927
00:59:07,026 --> 00:59:08,535
Hello, kiddo.

928
00:59:11,205 --> 00:59:13,265
- Hi. - Come and eat.

929
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:16,736
Your new manager's good at his job.

930
00:59:17,075 --> 00:59:18,906
Our son is good at his.

931
00:59:18,906 --> 00:59:20,276
He found the crane operator.

932
00:59:20,475 --> 00:59:23,345
If not, he could've died in that clinic.

933
00:59:23,716 --> 00:59:27,115
Our son knew the foreman wouldn't cross the line.

934
00:59:27,115 --> 00:59:28,955
He takes after me.

935
00:59:30,156 --> 00:59:31,185
How so?

936
00:59:31,185 --> 00:59:32,285
The smile.

937
00:59:32,955 --> 00:59:35,256
We could've found the operator sooner.

938
00:59:36,856 --> 00:59:37,926
I was...

939
00:59:39,595 --> 00:59:40,765
clueless.

940
00:59:53,845 --> 00:59:54,915
Mr. Shin.

941
00:59:56,015 --> 00:59:57,185
What about...

942
00:59:57,446 --> 00:59:59,185
my transfer?

943
01:00:09,156 --> 01:00:10,256
That's on hold.

- Yes. - Then you must know.

No.

The tower crane accident...

964
01:02:25,196 --> 01:02:27,395
was a man-made disaster due to poor auditing.

970
01:02:39,946 --> 01:02:43,015

I am Shin Cha Il, the manager of the Audit Team.

997
01:04:12,236 --> 01:04:13,365
I'd like an interview.

01:04:13,566 --> 01:04:14,676
Cha Il.

999
01:04:14,676 --> 01:04:16,836
You said you two dated. You were in a relationship.

1000
01:04:16,836 --> 01:04:19,245
I'll leave once I see Mr. Shin leave.

If you want to keep your position even just a little longer,

1002

I suggest you fire that scumbag first.

1004
01:04:26,615 --> 01:04:29,955
I need your explanation to understand...

1005
01:04:30,316 --> 01:04:32,555
- the nature of your relationship. - Darn it!

1006
01:04:32,555 --> 01:04:36,296
I can't get my job done because that jerk keeps getting on my nerves.
