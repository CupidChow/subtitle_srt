(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

4
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:08,123
Did you see the person who just came up to the rooftop?

5
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,422
No.

6
00:01:12,362 --> 00:01:13,962
I was chasing the blackmailer.

7
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:17,303
It looks like you failed to catch them.

8
00:01:17,403 --> 00:01:20,703
I was sure you'd resolve such a case in a flash.

9
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:21,903
I'll find them.

10
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:24,002
As fast as you can.

00:01:34,612 --> 00:01:36,483
(Team Manager Shin Cha Il)

12
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,453
- Yes, Mr. Shin. - I lost the blackmailer.

13
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:40,892
Meet me in the security control room.

14
00:01:42,123 --> 00:01:43,192
Okay.

15
00:01:58,403 --> 00:01:59,873
They entered through the wellness floor...

16
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:01,472
which doesn't require an employee card.

17
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:06,112
But only employees know of this space.

18
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:07,853
Looking at the route they take to escape,

19
00:02:07,853 --> 00:02:10,112
they're someone who knows the layout of our office well.

20
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:13,282
Then is it really...

21
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:29,032
(The Auditors)

22
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:31,403
Mr. Hwang, I'm so impressed.

23
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:35,343
This makes me feel so good. You sure taught him a lesson.

24
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:38,882
It's like striking his head with your knee.

25
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,412
I bet...

26
00:02:41,183 --> 00:02:42,912
Mr. Shin is dispirited now.

27
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:44,523
Is that enough?

28
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:45,952
No, of course not.

29
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:48,523
He gave you such a hard time and even humiliated...

30
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:53,792
I mean, it's not enough for putting you in so much trouble.

31
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,243
Does he look dispirited to you?

32
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:15,083
Let's go.

33
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:18,683
Did the blackmailer really show up? Amazing.

34
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:20,923
What's so amazing? They didn't get to catch him.

35
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:24,292
What if he doesn't give up and returns to poison more food?

36
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:25,623
What about today's lunch?

37
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:27,893
Gosh. I skipped breakfast too.

38
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,292
They failed to poison food.

39
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:31,463
You can rest assured.

40
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,403
I told the cafeteria to heighten the security...

41
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:36,532
and to reexamine all the ingredients.

42
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:40,343
How did you know the blackmailer showed up?

43
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:45,482
We'll have a meeting to discuss this case after lunch.

44
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:46,813
I'll explain in detail then.

45
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:49,083
Okay.

46
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,683
By the way, where's Han Soo?

47
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,262
These individuals are employees of companies we work with.

48
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:04,732
Did you see anyone...

49
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,202
in black work clothes with a hat...

50
00:04:07,202 --> 00:04:08,673
and a mask?

51
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:10,202
He's about this tall.

52
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:13,202
People sometimes wear masks,

53
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:14,613
but I didn't see anyone in one today.

54
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:16,143
No hats either.

55
00:04:16,743 --> 00:04:17,843
Is that so?

56
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:22,083
Only female reporters came this morning...

57
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,722
to interview the Ethics Management Team.

58
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:26,653
Is that so?

59
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:29,692
- Thank you. Have a good day. - Thank you.

60
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:36,333
- Please, let me. - Gosh.

61
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:42,773
- I'll do it. - Thank you.

62
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:44,373
Hello, Mr. Lim.

63
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:47,342
I'm Gu Han Soo, and I work in the Audit Team.

64
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:48,413
I see. Hello.

65
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,012
Hello. I'll help too.

66
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:51,382
Gosh, thank you so much.

67
00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:57,152
How are the employees at JU Construction so kind?

68
00:04:57,483 --> 00:05:00,183
Mr. Lim treats me like his own mother.

69
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:03,022
He always gives me instant coffee and snacks.

70
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:05,962
- Are you going to the supply room? - Yes.

71
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:08,733
- We'll help. - Thank you.

72
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:13,632
I bet you felt uncomfortable last time.

73
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:16,673
What?

74
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:19,272
When we had to clear out Director Pyeon's office,

75
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:21,373
I felt uncomfortable too.

76
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:23,873
That's the job of the Audit Team.

77
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:26,642
Thank you for your understanding.

78
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:29,152
I can take it from here. Thank you.

79
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:30,752
Okay.

80
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,723
- Thank you. - Take care.

81
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:34,092
- I will. - Bye.

82
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:37,252
I saw the letter of apology.

83
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:39,262
I guess it was just a happening.

84
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:43,392
I can't really comment on that.

85
00:05:44,663 --> 00:05:46,762
But we're working for the employees.

86
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:49,572
If you see any issues, please feel free to report them.

87
00:05:50,673 --> 00:05:51,902
If I report something,

88
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:53,743
will anything change?

89
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:58,613
Of course it will. It will change.

90
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,243

103
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:56,502

115

No, it's not that.

116
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,173
I really feel sick.

117
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:34,373
I feel nauseous and have the chills.

118
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:35,572

120

121
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:42,252
- Okay. - All right.

122
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:45,423
Despite setting up a trap to lure the blackmailer,

123
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,853
we failed to chase after them.

124
00:07:47,952 --> 00:07:50,692
Additional CCTVs will be installed and access to the kitchen will be...

125
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:53,262
strictly controlled to prevent another incident in the cafeteria.

126
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:57,363
I checked the list of visitors the company had in the morning.

127
00:07:57,832 --> 00:07:59,533
There wasn't anyone suspicious.

128
00:07:59,863 --> 00:08:01,873
Since our inducement failed, we must go back to square one...

129
00:08:01,873 --> 00:08:04,902
and identify the blackmailer through the data and circumstances.

130
00:08:06,642 --> 00:08:09,873
Wouldn't that be looking for a needle in a haystack?

131
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:11,683
We have no lead.

132
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:12,882
Judging by their telling us to investigate...

133
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:14,882
the on-site restaurant operations corruption,

134
00:08:14,882 --> 00:08:15,913
the blackmailer...

135
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,123
most likely participated in the operation rights bid...

136
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:20,053
but lost.

137
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:22,353
They clearly knew...

138
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:24,493
the newly appointed Audit Team Manager's name...

139
00:08:24,793 --> 00:08:26,863
and knew the cafeteria reopened, which only those...

140
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:28,892
who read the company announcement would've known.

141
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:31,063
And they could freely come in...

142
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:32,663
and out of the company and cafeteria.

143
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:35,132
Yes. They were even aware of the company's internal structure.

144
00:08:35,502 --> 00:08:37,873
Does that mean they're a headquarters worker?

145
00:08:38,043 --> 00:08:39,702
If they lost the operation rights bid,

146
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:41,413
they would be running a restaurant.

147
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:44,382
But can a worker even run an on-site restaurant?

148
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:47,983
Mr. Moon. It would be their family, not themselves, running it.

149
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:50,983
There are no internal regulations that a worker's family can't run...

150
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:52,283
an on-site restaurant.

151
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,192
You can say that I was on the luckier side.

152
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:57,493
A lot of people paid way more than that.

153
00:08:58,022 --> 00:09:00,063
Couldn't the blackmailer's family...

154
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:01,892
also have paid money to the subcontractor?

155
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:03,692
From the subcontractor's behaviors,

156
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:05,033
it's highly possible.

157
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:06,263
But would they have poisoned...

158
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:08,403
the cafeteria's food simply because they lost the money?

159
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:09,972
Had there been a casualty,

160
00:09:09,972 --> 00:09:11,643
they would've received a severe punishment.

161
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:15,442
They probably lost something more important.

162
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:20,952
If they had lost a family member,

163
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:22,883
they wouldn't be in their right mind.

164
00:09:24,352 --> 00:09:26,822
My dad passed away from overworking.

165
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:29,192
He lost consciousness...

166
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:31,322
while working at the factory for days to secure the supply.

167
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:35,163
It was hard getting his death to be accepted as an industrial accident.

168
00:09:35,793 --> 00:09:37,903
And? Was it accepted?

169
00:09:39,102 --> 00:09:41,133
It was after we fought for years.

170
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:43,633
Had it not been accepted,

171
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,872
I would've gone mad and done something.

172
00:09:46,342 --> 00:09:47,503
It was extremely unjust.

173
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,942
Going to jail was no big deal.

174
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:52,842
That was what I thought back then.

175
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,013
His death was accepted as an industrial accident,

176
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:56,612
and you're leading a good life.

177
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:58,283
I'm sure your father is at peace.

178
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:02,293
JU Construction entrusted...

179
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:03,622
the on-site restaurant operations to an agency...

180
00:10:03,622 --> 00:10:05,992
only for three years when President Hwang Gun Woong took office.

181
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:07,992
So, the last four years...

182
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:11,263

00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:58,424
(Attention: Audit Team)

364
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,323
(Attention: Audit Team)

365
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:05,394
What is this?

366
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,264
I tried sending a tip-off to the Audit Team...

367
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:10,234
but received no response.

368
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,843
How did such a scam begin?

369
00:21:17,704 --> 00:21:19,644
I even tried transferring to Subcontracts and Procurement...

370
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:20,773
to find out what exactly happened.

371
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:23,583
But the only thing I could find out...

372
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:25,583
was that the contract with the agency...

373
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,684
had ended and that the company held no responsibility.

374
00:21:28,984 --> 00:21:30,454
What do you think about all this, Mr. Shin?

375
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,793
Any documents from before that time?

376
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,363
Before that, an agency was in charge of managing it.

377
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:38,063
But we no longer work with them.

378
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,363
I get that the agency is to blame,

379
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:44,504
but they scammed people using...

380
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:45,904
JU Construction's on-site restaurants.

381
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:49,474
Even so, the company said they held no responsibility...

382
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,343
and didn't even look into it.

383
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:55,313
Does it make sense to you?

384
00:21:57,184 --> 00:21:59,553
You see, we manage...

385
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:00,853
over 100 subcontractors.

386
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,254
That agency was one of our subcontractors.

387
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,323
How is my team supposed to monitor...

388
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,754
whether or not the subcontractors are taking bribes?

389
00:22:14,164 --> 00:22:17,264
No matter the situation, the method you chose was wrong.

390
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:19,974
Junior Manager of Subcontracts and Procurement, Lim Jung Yoon.

391
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:21,704
You sent a threatening letter to the company,

392
00:22:21,704 --> 00:22:23,144
which made your colleagues anxious.

393
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:24,444
You spiked the employees' food with a drug...

394
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,744
and significantly jeopardized the safety of the workers on site.

395
00:22:29,543 --> 00:22:30,843
I will suggest...

396
00:22:31,214 --> 00:22:32,613
that your employment be terminated.

397
00:22:40,623 --> 00:22:43,823
Oh, Ms. Ok. I think this is wrong. How is this...

398
00:22:44,623 --> 00:22:46,164
- File this away. - Yes, sir.

399
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:48,533
Good. You're doing a great job.

400
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,573
Gosh, my stomach is upset.

401
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:56,873
Do your work. My stomach hurts.

402
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:07,014
As for Mr. Lim, let's say he quit due to health reasons.

403
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,654
We'll wrap it up without pressing charges against him.

404
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:10,853
Like I said the other day,

405
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:13,254
we're planning to make the announcement about J-BIMS soon,

406
00:23:13,254 --> 00:23:14,424
so let's just wrap it up.

407
00:23:17,793 --> 00:23:19,063
Do you need to tell me anything else?

408
00:23:20,694 --> 00:23:22,863
Legally, JU Construction holds no liability...

409
00:23:22,863 --> 00:23:25,033
for how the agency used the on-site restaurants...

410
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:27,373
to extort money from the bidders.

411
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:30,373
But ethically, I believe JU Construction...

412
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:31,944
should take care of the victims' legal expenses...

413
00:23:32,373 --> 00:23:35,613
should they decide to sue the agency.

414
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,383
It'll enhance our public image as a company...

415
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,254
that did not neglect its moral responsibility. Sure.

416
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:41,984
Also, it's true that...

417
00:23:41,984 --> 00:23:44,523
Subcontracts and Procurement poorly managed the subcontractors...

418
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,394
and turned a blind eye to their wrongdoings.

419
00:23:46,654 --> 00:23:49,264
Director Pyeon should be held responsible for it...

420
00:23:49,924 --> 00:23:51,363
and get a three-month pay cut...

421
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,093
Why don't we transfer him to the factory in Sanpo?

422
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:09,883
Yes.

423
00:24:13,514 --> 00:24:14,853
Sir, the thing is...

424
00:24:15,783 --> 00:24:18,083
The Audit Team caught the blackmailer.

425
00:24:18,553 --> 00:24:19,954
Apparently, he's a JU employee.

426
00:24:20,123 --> 00:24:21,623
They're saying...

427
00:24:21,623 --> 00:24:23,863
they'll just fire him and bury the details...

428
00:24:24,623 --> 00:24:26,833
because it's a critical time for the company.

429
00:24:27,664 --> 00:24:30,033
You remember how Mr. Shin posted an apology letter...

430
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:32,734
and said he wouldn't audit the case, right?

431
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:35,204
They say it was a trap.

432
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:38,813
He did that to lure the blackmailer to the cafeteria and catch him.

433
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:39,843
Gosh.

434
00:24:40,073 --> 00:24:41,514
I'll write an official apology letter...

435
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,383
and post it...

436
00:24:45,254 --> 00:24:46,353
on every intranet forum.

437
00:24:47,184 --> 00:24:48,523
Oh, also...

438
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,783
To hold someone accountable...

439
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:52,894
for the poor management of the subcontractors,

440
00:24:53,353 --> 00:24:54,954
President Hwang...

441
00:24:57,224 --> 00:24:59,734
has decided to transfer Director Pyeon to the countryside.

442
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:02,164
Gosh. I hope...

443
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,063
they won't make me pay for it too, will they?

444
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:09,843
That jerk must think I'm a total pushover.

445
00:25:24,383 --> 00:25:26,123
Guys, who did this?

446
00:25:26,254 --> 00:25:27,353
This is...

447
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,194
(President Hwang Se Woong)

448
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:31,464
Yes, sir.

449
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:35,264
Pardon me?

450
00:25:36,103 --> 00:25:38,504
Sanpo? Did you say Sanpo?

451
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:44,904
No, sir. Could you at least tell me what I did wrong?

452
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,043
No, please tell me...

453
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:55,553
Darn it.

454
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:58,424
I see. This was why...

455
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,293
This was why he hired a new manager for the Audit Team.

456
00:26:02,464 --> 00:26:03,464
Gosh.

457
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:07,363
He thinks he can get rid of me like this? Seriously?

458
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:12,974
Darn it.

459
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:15,843
Hey.

460
00:26:16,644 --> 00:26:18,144
- Yes, sir. - Happy now?

461
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:20,773
Are you happy?

462
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,484
You guys just wait and see.

463
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:27,214
When President Hwang Gun Woong is back,

464
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,023
I will chew you to pieces.

465
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:31,353
All of you!

466
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,833
The company won't press criminal charges.

467
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:21,603
I get that you felt wronged and angry,

468
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:23,474
but still,

469
00:27:23,904 --> 00:27:26,543
many others suffered because of what you did.

470
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,514
Please remember that.

471
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:31,744
How are the workers doing?

472
00:27:32,254 --> 00:27:35,383
Some are still in hospital, but they'll recover soon.

473
00:27:41,353 --> 00:27:42,424
Mr. Lim.

474
00:27:43,323 --> 00:27:45,023
If you don't mind me asking,

475
00:27:47,764 --> 00:27:51,603
can you tell me how your mother passed?

476
00:28:04,543 --> 00:28:05,754
I wanted to...

477
00:28:07,514 --> 00:28:10,654
do whatever I could to tell people my mother had been wronged.

478
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:17,494
The stress and anguish...

479
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,264
made her very ill.

480
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:24,033
She'd lost what I'd saved up for marriage,

481
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:26,133
and she didn't want to rack up medical bills too.

482
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:29,744
She drowned in a river on a winter day.

483
00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:40,583
Han Soo.

484
00:28:44,254 --> 00:28:45,394
Yes?

485
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:47,123
What should I have done?

486
00:28:48,764 --> 00:28:50,494
There were many victims...

487
00:28:50,494 --> 00:28:52,533
and no one was held responsible.

488
00:28:54,694 --> 00:28:56,764
Should I have kept the anger bottled up...

489
00:28:57,964 --> 00:28:59,904
and kept on trying to report them?

490
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,773
When no one even cared?

491
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,514
Not even the Audit Team?

492
00:29:48,313 --> 00:29:50,283
I sent Mr. Lim away with his things.

493
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,823
This was also...

494
00:29:57,823 --> 00:29:59,793
the result of idle auditing.

495
00:30:00,563 --> 00:30:03,664
It could've been prevented if anyone had heeded the report two years ago.

496
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:06,803
But you all ignored it.

497
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:10,744
You didn't care because it happened outside the company.

498
00:30:11,773 --> 00:30:15,984
Eventually, it led to the suffering of innocent company workers.

499
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:19,553
So that this never happens again,

500
00:30:19,553 --> 00:30:22,254
please audit carefully and thoroughly.

501
00:30:39,073 --> 00:30:40,803
- Are you going home? - Yes.

502
00:30:44,004 --> 00:30:45,644
- See you. - Bye.

503
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:47,273
- Good job. - Goodbye.

504
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:48,674
Take care.

505
00:30:50,843 --> 00:30:53,283
Terrible things can happen...

506
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:56,023
if the Audit Team doesn't do their job.

507
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:59,894
People will think we only move...

508
00:30:59,894 --> 00:31:02,224
when we receive threatening letters.

509
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,434
Here. Enjoy your meal.

510
00:31:14,434 --> 00:31:15,543
- Thanks. - Sure.

511
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,603
Han Soo's home.

512
00:31:19,414 --> 00:31:20,674
Why is he going straight upstairs?

513
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:23,014
Leave him alone. Something must be up.

514
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:34,154
What should I have done?

515
00:31:34,553 --> 00:31:36,424
When no one even cared?

516
00:31:37,323 --> 00:31:38,593
Not even the Audit Team?

517
00:31:55,944 --> 00:31:57,144
Hello.

518
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:03,353
(Letter of Apology)

519
00:32:10,023 --> 00:32:12,894
(Letter of Apology)

520
00:32:30,984 --> 00:32:33,184
(The Audit Team will accept reports from staff.)

521
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,583
(We'll become a trusted Audit Team.)

522
00:32:35,113 --> 00:32:38,283
I think what our team needs is to earn trust.

523
00:32:41,254 --> 00:32:42,924
How about we approach them first...

524
00:32:42,924 --> 00:32:45,323
so they can report to us freely...

525
00:32:45,394 --> 00:32:47,333
and believe we're on their side...

526
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:50,303
by putting up this notice?

527
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,103
I think it's a good idea.

528
00:32:59,073 --> 00:33:00,414
I agree too.

529
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:04,343
It's a bit embarrassing,

530
00:33:05,714 --> 00:33:06,914
but I vote yes too.

531
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,853
Okay, then. I gather...

532
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:15,494
and support your opinions...

533
00:33:16,863 --> 00:33:18,164
and offer half a vote.

534
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,164
Please, sir.

535
00:33:36,113 --> 00:33:37,214
What's this?

536
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,883
The Audit Team is doing all sorts to try to gain influence.

537
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:43,283
- I want a report. - On what?

538
00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:47,224
On the construction market for the second half of the year?

539
00:33:47,224 --> 00:33:48,954
On everything about Shin Cha Il.

540
00:33:49,323 --> 00:33:50,463
Oh, that?

541
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:53,533
I came in early a few days ago...

542
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:56,363
and read through his resume again.

543
00:33:56,363 --> 00:33:58,064
So I know a lot.

544
00:33:58,604 --> 00:33:59,633
He graduated from Sunghan University...

545
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:01,874
I want to know everything that isn't on his resume.

546
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:03,744
If there's not enough,

547
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:06,474
a new notice of transfer will go up right next to this.

548
00:34:07,374 --> 00:34:08,443
I understand.

549
00:34:13,014 --> 00:34:16,153
It's nice to have you join us for lunch, sir.

550
00:34:17,524 --> 00:34:19,423
I hope they serve something nice today.

551
00:34:19,823 --> 00:34:21,024
What's for lunch?

552
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:25,564
Spicy stir-fried squid, pork cutlet, and the last one is...

553
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,264
It's from the Audit Team.

554
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:30,033
Are they doing to do some real work?

555
00:34:30,104 --> 00:34:32,104
- It must be the new manager. - Yes.

556
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:33,403
(The Audit Team will accept reports from staff.)

557
00:34:33,934 --> 00:34:36,204
Oh, dear. Work will start flooding in.

558
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:38,503
Hey. I only gave half a vote.

559
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:41,274
You gathered our opinions too.

560
00:34:41,343 --> 00:34:42,783
It comes with the territory.

561
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:45,954
Let's decide who will manage the online report forum.

562
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:50,883
You do it, Mr. Gu.

563
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:56,394
Okay. I'll do my best.

564
00:34:57,593 --> 00:34:58,664
Good luck.

565
00:34:58,664 --> 00:34:59,834
- Squid. - Thanks.

566
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,483
What brought you here?

567
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:21,414
I'm here because I heard Gun Woong was getting better.

568
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:23,724
I called him.

569
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:25,084
I'm glad you did.

570
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:26,193
How is he doing?

571
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:27,954
He's much better.

572
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:31,363
The doctor thinks he'll wake up soon.

573
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:43,544
I'm sorry to say this after visiting a patient,

574
00:35:44,044 --> 00:35:45,843
but we're under-performing terribly.

575
00:35:46,573 --> 00:35:48,814
Stock prices fall more each day.

576
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:52,014
The economic sensory index is at an all-time low...

577
00:35:52,014 --> 00:35:53,684
and the construction market's future is uncertain.

578
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:56,724
We have to reduce the lots to parcel out.

579
00:35:57,383 --> 00:35:59,894
That's why it's hard to run a company.

580
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:03,124
You must know how to get through the dark times.

581
00:36:03,923 --> 00:36:07,164
We'll gain an advantage in winning contracts once J-BIMS is completed.

582
00:36:07,463 --> 00:36:09,604
Okay. I look forward to seeing that.

583
00:36:10,704 --> 00:36:13,604
How are things with Dae Woong? Do you get along?

584
00:36:16,003 --> 00:36:17,774
The worst spectacle ever...

585
00:36:17,774 --> 00:36:20,173
is brothers fighting over a company.

586
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:25,283
It would've been nice if your father had divided things before he died.

589
00:36:53,443 --> 00:36:54,474
How nice.

590
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:57,014
Nice gibberish.

(J-BIMS Sneak Preview)

592
00:37:18,133 --> 00:37:19,274
Welcome.

593
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:25,673
- I'll take a gukbap. - Okay.

594
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:28,874
Mr. Shin! Hello.

595
00:37:29,613 --> 00:37:32,753
I don't want to eat alone. May I join you?

596
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:50,934
Are you eating out for dinner?

597
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:52,363
Is no one home today?

598
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:53,803
There's no one else at home.

599
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:55,204
You must live alone.

600
00:37:56,573 --> 00:37:57,573
Thank you.

601
00:37:57,573 --> 00:37:58,874
- Enjoy. - I will.

602
00:38:03,644 --> 00:38:04,644
Mr. Shin.

603
00:38:06,454 --> 00:38:09,383
Ever since you came, our team started to change.

604
00:38:10,783 --> 00:38:13,593
We're becoming a real audit team.

605
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:17,193
As a member of the Audit Team,

606
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:19,224
I feel responsible and proud.

607
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:21,363
Also,

608
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:25,533
my new goal is to become someone like you.

609
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:28,274
You say I should be suspicious of everyone.

610
00:38:28,503 --> 00:38:30,474
It's still hard for me to grasp those words.

611
00:38:30,774 --> 00:38:33,943
Although you say that, I know you trust your team.

612
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:34,974
Isn't that right?

613
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,044
Please enjoy your meal.

614
00:38:43,724 --> 00:38:45,153
This looks great.

615
00:39:23,323 --> 00:39:24,923
As a member of the Audit Team,

616
00:39:24,923 --> 00:39:27,064
I feel responsible and proud.

617
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:29,863
My new goal is to become someone like you.

618
00:39:41,544 --> 00:39:42,613
Yes, Cha Il. What is it?

619
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:46,184
It’s the construction supply purchase audit report you worked on.

620
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:49,253
Gosh, did you study something that was already settled?

621
00:39:50,184 --> 00:39:52,454
That's our future ace. You're so reliable.

622
00:39:55,153 --> 00:39:57,363
What is it? Is there a problem?

623
00:39:58,294 --> 00:40:01,693
I found something strange while studying the purchase list.

624
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:04,434
Gosh. I should've explained it to you in advance.

625
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:07,303
You're new to the job, so you must be shocked.

626
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:11,003
Of course, the actual amount of rebar bought was 300 tons.

627
00:40:11,604 --> 00:40:12,644
Then...

628
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:16,014
Why did we pay the company for 420 tons worth of rebar?

629
00:40:16,084 --> 00:40:19,184
Because other supplies we bought from them were included in it.

630
00:40:19,854 --> 00:40:21,684
It'd be awkward to list them one by one.

631
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,454
Rebar is a major supply, so whenever we purchase them,

632
00:40:25,454 --> 00:40:26,553
we add others on top of it.

633
00:40:26,553 --> 00:40:27,693
But still...

634
00:40:28,753 --> 00:40:30,724
Shouldn't it be recorded accurately?

635
00:40:31,593 --> 00:40:33,463
Yes, you're right.

636
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,164
But when you're constructing a building,

637
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:37,233
you need a lot of extra supplies.

638
00:40:37,403 --> 00:40:40,974
But they're too petty to make a separate payment form.

639
00:40:44,144 --> 00:40:46,244
What is it? Does it look like I'm turning a blind eye...

640
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,943
to people sneaking out rebars and taking bribes?

641
00:40:47,943 --> 00:40:49,544
- No, I... - Are you afraid...

642
00:40:49,544 --> 00:40:51,084
the lack of rebars will lead the building to fall?

643
00:40:51,084 --> 00:40:53,053
- I don't mean that at all. - Cha Il.

644
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:55,253
Don't look at the small things. Look at the big picture.

645
00:40:55,713 --> 00:40:58,624
The Audit Team is about looking at the overall flow.

646
00:41:00,454 --> 00:41:01,494
Let's go back.

647
00:41:20,874 --> 00:41:22,544
- Hello. - Hello.

648
00:41:22,544 --> 00:41:23,883
- Hello. - Hello.

649
00:41:23,883 --> 00:41:24,943
Hello!

650
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:31,423
Hello!

651
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:33,994
- Hello. - Hello.

652
00:41:38,064 --> 00:41:40,693
- Gosh! - What are you doing?

653
00:41:40,693 --> 00:41:42,863
- My goodness. - What is he doing?

654
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:46,774
Don't come near me!

655
00:41:46,774 --> 00:41:48,033
What's the matter?

656
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:49,073
I said, don't come near me!

657
00:41:49,544 --> 00:41:51,144
Don't come...

658
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:54,974
I want to report workplace bullying.

659
00:41:54,974 --> 00:41:57,383
- Be careful! - Fire.

660
00:41:57,644 --> 00:41:59,514
- Yoon Woo. - Don't come closer!

661
00:41:59,883 --> 00:42:00,914
All right.

662
00:42:01,053 --> 00:42:04,124
I won't go close. Let's turn that off and talk.

663
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:07,624
Don't come near me!

664
00:42:13,863 --> 00:42:16,604
Are you insane? How dare you try to start a fire?

665
00:42:19,233 --> 00:42:20,303
Do you think this is a show?

666
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:22,173
Get to work!

667
00:42:24,704 --> 00:42:25,774
Take care of this.

668
00:42:25,774 --> 00:42:27,974
Yoon Woo, are you okay?

669
00:42:32,744 --> 00:42:33,783
Yoon Woo...

670
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:38,761
The informant is mentally unstable,

671
00:42:38,761 --> 00:42:41,170
so we should give him some time to calm down.

672
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,000
Ms. Yoon, I heard you started work with Mr. Oh Yoon Woo too.

673
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,011
Yes.

674
00:42:47,971 --> 00:42:49,710
During our new employee training,

675
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,281
Mr. Oh was voted the most popular. He had a good personality.

676
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:55,551
I wonder what drove him to almost set himself on fire.

677
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:58,721
He must have suffered under his superior.

678
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,120
Gosh.

679
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,861
They must have tortured him.

680
00:43:04,891 --> 00:43:07,091
But is there such a person on the Technology Development Team?

681
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:08,730
I haven't heard of anyone.

682
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:12,031
But isn't that team extremely busy...

683
00:43:12,031 --> 00:43:13,330
with preparing for the upcoming J-BIMS demonstration?

684
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,330
They are.

Okay.

We'll do the interview after I meet with President Hwang.

689
00:43:31,051 --> 00:43:32,850
I heard someone caused a disturbance in the lobby...

690
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:35,150
- and that the Audit Team took him. - Yes.

691
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:38,120
We'll investigate as soon as the informant finds his calm.

692
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,830

696
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,020
I had it thoroughly researched...

697

using all of my networks.

698
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,020
You can trust it.

Gosh, that Shin Cha Il is some piece of work.

700
00:44:15,161 --> 00:44:17,830
I honestly didn't think...

701
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,971
it would be this bad.

702
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:25,000
Mr. Hwang, you should go to the Audit Team and expose him.

703
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,971
He'd be humiliated in front of his subordinates.

704
00:44:27,971 --> 00:44:30,011
He might even decide to leave voluntarily.

705
00:44:30,841 --> 00:44:31,841
Yes.

706
00:44:32,411 --> 00:44:34,281
It's no fun to release it at once.

707
00:44:36,111 --> 00:44:37,480
I'll make him wither away.

710
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,861
Just tell me everything that happened...

711

as much as you can remember.

712
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,600
You look gaunt.

713
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,770
It breaks my heart.

714
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:02,540
You were so happy to be assigned to the Technology Development Team.

715
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,341

718

Don't worry and tell us everything.

719
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:28,000
Do you mean you were constantly bullied...

720
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,801
by Technology Development Team's Junior Manager Park Jae Wan?

721
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:34,540
Do you remember when the bullying began?

722
00:45:40,911 --> 00:45:42,710
I don't know exactly,

723
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,150
but I think it has been three to four months.

00:45:47,721 --> 00:45:49,420
Why did you put up with it...

725
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,991
for that long only to speak up now?

726
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,431
I'd wanted to join the Technology Development Team since I started.

727
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,900
Although I was sent to another team at first,

728
00:45:59,201 --> 00:46:01,201
I worked and tried hard to transfer.

729
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,701
More than anything,

730
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:05,971
I was proud to be part of...

731
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:09,210
the J-BIMS project that held the company's future.

732
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,451
So I put up with it though it was hard.

733
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,551
- Goodness. - Hello.

734
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,020
- Hello. - Hello.

735
00:46:18,551 --> 00:46:19,551
Hello.

736
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:28,460
(Employee Number, Password)

737
00:46:30,261 --> 00:46:31,460
(Access denied)

738
00:46:35,571 --> 00:46:36,571
(Access denied)

739
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:39,571
Mr. Park, there's an error in the access system.

740
00:46:39,571 --> 00:46:41,210
It's not an error.

741
00:46:41,511 --> 00:46:43,641
- What? - You no longer...

742
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,040
have access to the J-BIMS development folder.

743
00:46:46,141 --> 00:46:47,650
Your access was revoked.

744
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:49,511
I got approval already.

745
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,960
Does that mean I can no longer help develop J-BIMS?

746
00:46:57,161 --> 00:47:00,491
That's right. You're off the project now.

747
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:02,761
There are other things to do.

748
00:47:03,161 --> 00:47:05,761
Oh, right. Security needed something.

749
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:08,471
Do stuff like this.

750
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,841
The others are busy with the J-BIMS preview.

751
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:13,710
Are you done?

752
00:47:14,111 --> 00:47:15,511
- Almost. - Okay.

753
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:25,620
(Access denied)

754
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,850
I could take anything else...

755
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,750
but not being excluded from the J-BIMS project.

756
00:47:30,321 --> 00:47:31,361
That...

757
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,190
practically means they want me gone.

758
00:47:37,201 --> 00:47:38,730
It must've been rough, Yoon Woo.

759
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,310
I must grasp the situation.

760
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:53,580
You can carry out the next interview.

761
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,920
- Me? - The more you do it,

762
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,120
the more you learn.

763
00:47:58,781 --> 00:48:01,790
Draw them into the conversation and get as many details as you can.

764
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,391
With a steely gaze.

765
00:48:13,531 --> 00:48:15,071
(Do not film, Do not take off)

766
00:48:15,531 --> 00:48:16,940
- You can enter now. - Okay.

767
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,770
(Use of phones prohibited, security cameras are recording)

768
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:29,781
(JU Construction)

769
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:35,020
(Manager's Office)

770
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:36,190
Come in.

771
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,801
Sorry.

772
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,801
I'm terrible at cleaning up.

773
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,670
Please sit.

774
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,940
You got here really fast.

775
00:48:59,181 --> 00:49:01,381
I only just got the call that you'd be coming.

776
00:49:01,451 --> 00:49:03,850
It's a simple interview. I thought we should get it over with.

777
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,420
I see.

778
00:49:06,281 --> 00:49:09,520
I can't spare you much time.

779
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,161
I hope you understand.

780
00:49:13,221 --> 00:49:15,261
- May I use this? - Just a moment.

781
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,330
That's crumpled up. Here's a new sheet.

782
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:29,511
I'll begin, then.

783
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:32,710
Employee Oh Yoon Woo reported Junior Manager Park Jae Wan...

784
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,350
for workplace bullying.

785
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,520
It's my fault.

786
00:49:39,181 --> 00:49:40,290
Trying to set himself on fire?

787
00:49:41,451 --> 00:49:44,361
I had no idea Yoon Woo was suffering,

788
00:49:45,261 --> 00:49:46,361
and I feel guilty.

789
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,161
I heard they were working on the same thing.

790
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,560
Yes. They were developing a cost-optimizing engine.

791
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:53,431
Mr. Park headed the project,

792
00:49:53,431 --> 00:49:55,201
and Yoon Woo was assisting.

793
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:58,040
Mr. Oh said he was verbally abused.

794
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,310
What do you say about that?

795
00:50:08,451 --> 00:50:11,051
Mr. Park is quite sensitive.

796
00:50:11,381 --> 00:50:13,591
He has an important role which means a lot of work.

797
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,620
Yoon Woo was assisting him,

798
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,391
but he made lots of small mistakes and didn't know much about math.

799
00:50:19,861 --> 00:50:22,531
Mr. Park did nag a lot and got annoyed often,

800
00:50:22,531 --> 00:50:23,600
but...

801
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,431
calling that verbal abuse...

802
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,301
Why did you exclude Mr. Oh from the J-BIMS project?

803
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,971
It was Mr. Park's suggestion.

804
00:50:32,641 --> 00:50:34,710
He said Yoon Woo was more of a hindrance than help.

805
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:38,040
I do feel sorry for Yoon Woo,

806
00:50:38,781 --> 00:50:40,250
but work is more important.

807
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:57,060
I'm Audit Team Manager Shin Cha Il.

808
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,730
I would like to conduct an interview.

809
00:51:19,681 --> 00:51:21,491
- Hello. - Hello.

810
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,221
I'm Yoon Seo Jin from the Audit Team.

811
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,761
I'd like to interview you.

812
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,881
- That's Mr. Park, right? - Yes.

813
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,511
Why does he look so haggard?

814
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,710
You'd think he was being bullied.

815
00:51:49,951 --> 00:51:51,350
He's as thin as a stick.

816
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:52,850
He is.

817
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,920
(Yes! Chicken)

818
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,020
Yoon Woo, it's been so long.

819
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,161
You should've come over more often.

820
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:00,161
Yes.

821
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:01,931
Dad! When will the chicken be ready?

822
00:52:01,931 --> 00:52:03,491
Right now.

823
00:52:03,491 --> 00:52:04,830
Here it comes.

824
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,830
There.

825
00:52:08,701 --> 00:52:11,641
Yoon Woo, you said we served the best chicken.

826
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:12,900
Why haven't you been by?

827
00:52:13,341 --> 00:52:14,641
Did you find another place?

828
00:52:14,641 --> 00:52:15,710
Yes.

829
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,540
Something came up.

830
00:52:19,841 --> 00:52:20,911
Like what?

831
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:22,781
You punk.

832
00:52:22,781 --> 00:52:25,020
If something had come up, you should've come to me.

833
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,850
We could've talked over a beer.

834
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,221
- Enjoy the food. - Yes, eat.

835
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,730
Yoon Woo, eat this first.

836
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:36,631
What do you eat when you feel down?

837
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,031
Fried chicken.

838
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:40,301
Our drumsticks are amazing.

839
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:41,370
Come on, eat.

840
00:52:45,571 --> 00:52:47,141
Isn't it good?

841
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:48,571
The stress melts away, right?

842
00:52:48,841 --> 00:52:50,611
Hey, how about a beer?

843
00:52:53,411 --> 00:52:56,480
Yoon Woo. Mr. Shin gave you time off, so rest.

844
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,150
Let's not think about work...

845
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:00,120
and dig into some chicken.

846
00:53:03,591 --> 00:53:05,861
Okay. I'll... My gosh.

847
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,960
I'll give you the other drumstick too.

848
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:10,661
Do you know what this means? I'm letting you eat both.

849
00:53:12,131 --> 00:53:14,931
You must eat to be strong, right?

850
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,000
You look so nice when you smile.

851
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,801
Dad! Where's the beer?

852
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,810
Mr. Oh and Mr. Park gave conflicting statements.

853
00:53:23,341 --> 00:53:26,440
Why do you think Mr. Park bullied you?

854
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,710
Does he treat his other teammates the same way?

855
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:30,551
I do lack some skills,

856
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,850
but he speaks to me in an extra nasty manner.

857
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,391
You still haven't solved the error?

858
00:53:35,891 --> 00:53:37,761
This will delay the other parts too.

859
00:53:37,761 --> 00:53:40,631
I'm sorry, sir. I'll finish that within the week.

860
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:42,460
Please do that.

861
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:43,801
Let's end the meeting.

862
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:45,730
- Thanks. - Thank you.

863
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,670
Mr. Oh. Can I have a word?

864
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:53,770
How many times must I tell you?

865
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:55,370
What's this for?

866
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:58,841
Why do you need a head when you don't use it to think?

867
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,120
You pointed out his shortcomings,

868
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,721
but you weren't verbally abusive?

869
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:08,420
Yes, that's right.

870
00:54:11,721 --> 00:54:15,131
We're fixing just one thing, and you're making me repeat myself.

871
00:54:15,761 --> 00:54:16,991
How many times must I tell you?

872
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,531
I apologize.

873
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,830
Others are suffering because we're slow.

874
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,071
I need you to think a bit more when you work.

875
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:30,011
Is there a witness or evidence of the verbal abuse?

876
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:31,540
Of course there isn't.

877
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,850
I never bullied or verbally abused anyone.

878
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,980
(Mr. Park, here's the revised file.)

879
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,451
(File error: File is damaged or not compatible.)

880
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:41,350
I apologize.

881
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,190
I can't run the simulation right now.

882
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,690
I'll get a new file...

883
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,631
and show it to you.

884
00:54:47,631 --> 00:54:50,361
Is this how you prepare for a meeting?

885
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:52,230
I'm really sorry.

886
00:54:55,071 --> 00:54:56,100
Mr. Oh.

887
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:58,500
How could you mess up the attached file?

888
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,801
I was humiliated.

889
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,940
Are you doing this on purpose because you have a grudge?

890
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,241
I'd rather you speak up honestly.

891
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,681
It's really stressing me out.

892
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:12,020
It's usually when we're alone or on the phone.

893
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,850
We all have a security app on our phones,

894
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,190
so we can't record calls.

895
00:55:19,161 --> 00:55:21,230
- Hello, Mr. Park... - Have you lost your mind?

896
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:26,801
What kind of idiot can't even send an email right?

897
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:28,531
Are you doing this on purpose?

898
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,230
To mess with me, right?

899
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:31,440
No, it's not...

900
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,170
You're a dimwit during work,

901
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:35,911
but you get all smart when screwing me over.

902
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:37,741
You wicked son of a gun.

903
00:55:37,911 --> 00:55:40,310
You're nothing but a useless piece of trash.

904
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:41,911
Darn it!

905
00:55:55,661 --> 00:55:57,931
Even if I had shortcomings,

906
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:01,471
getting excluded from J-BIMS was unfair.

907
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:03,330
With the demonstration just around the corner,

908
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:04,540
we have tons to do within a short time.

909
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,741
He's not being helpful.

910
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:10,270
Honestly,

911
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:13,040
I want Mr. Oh Yoon Woo to leave our team.

912
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:15,111
It's for everyone's sake.

913
00:56:18,281 --> 00:56:19,381
I'm back.

914
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:23,051
What did the other Technology Development Team members say?

915
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:26,060
Well... You see...

916
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:30,960
He gets scolded a lot.

917
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:33,701
He can't really handle his work.

918
00:56:34,301 --> 00:56:37,370
But Mr. Lee is too kind to say anything bad to him.

919
00:56:38,471 --> 00:56:39,841
If he had a temper, gosh...

920
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,241
Mr. Park gets irritated easily.

921
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,480
It's getting worse. He wasn't like that before.

922
00:56:45,881 --> 00:56:48,281
Mr. Oh Yoon Woo frequently makes mistakes.

923
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:50,920
But I heard he did well under Junior Manager Shim.

924
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,721
Mr. Park has Mr. Oh on a short leash.

925
00:56:53,721 --> 00:56:57,290
But he blames Mr. Oh for any delays or problems.

926
00:56:57,891 --> 00:56:59,460
We don't question about it.

927
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:00,861
By any chance,

928
00:57:00,861 --> 00:57:03,391
did Mr. Park make an insulting remark...

929
00:57:03,391 --> 00:57:05,801
or mention Mr. Oh's family background?

930
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,400
What? About Mr. Oh being an orphan?

931
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,701
Gosh. That would be crossing the line.

932
00:57:11,701 --> 00:57:14,341
Mr. Park can be extremely on edge.

933
00:57:15,411 --> 00:57:16,810
But he's not that bad of a person.

934
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:19,781
Everyone may be too busy to be concerned about others.

935
00:57:20,281 --> 00:57:22,281
But if Mr. Park had done any of those,

936
00:57:22,281 --> 00:57:23,710
we would've stepped in.

937
00:57:25,681 --> 00:57:27,991
Then Yoon Woo is making up stories.

938
00:57:29,051 --> 00:57:30,190
Nothing is clear.

939
00:57:30,661 --> 00:57:31,821
There isn't any evidence, either.

942
00:57:49,071 --> 00:57:50,210
Yes, Mr. Lee?

943
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:52,611
Come inside.

944
00:57:52,841 --> 00:57:54,080
You haven't visited in a while, right, Yoon Woo?

945
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,111
Hold on.

946
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:56,281
It's okay.

947
00:57:56,281 --> 00:57:57,620
I can sleep at my house.

948
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,451
Come on. Aren't we coworkers?

949
00:58:00,051 --> 00:58:01,790
Rest well at my place until tomorrow.

950
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,650
I'll wrap things up at work quickly.

951
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:04,821
Let's grab some delicious dinner.

952
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,261
By the way,

953
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:13,431
do your team members not know that...

954
00:58:13,661 --> 00:58:15,230
Mr. Park is harassing you?

955
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,230
All they know is that I often get scolded.

956
00:58:18,141 --> 00:58:20,940
Mr. Park verbally abuses me only when we're alone.

957
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:23,170
What about Mr. Lee?

958
00:58:23,471 --> 00:58:24,940
Does he get angry at you too?

959
00:58:25,241 --> 00:58:26,381
No.

960
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,281
Mr. Lee is a great person.

963

Mr. Oh. How are you feeling?

964
00:58:37,861 --> 00:58:39,591
I'm all right.

(Technology Development Team Manager Lee Ji Hoon)

966
00:58:41,931 --> 00:58:45,131
I'll give you a ten-day special vacation. Get some good rest.

967
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:47,000
Let's talk again after that.

968
00:58:47,431 --> 00:58:48,571
Mr. Lee.

969
00:58:49,031 --> 00:58:51,341
If it's ten days later, the demonstration will have ended.

970
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:55,411
Does that mean I'm excluded from J-BIMS' completion?

971
00:58:55,641 --> 00:58:58,641
With the current situation, you can't get involved in J-BIMS.

972
00:58:59,281 --> 00:59:01,210
There isn't much time to settle...

973
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,011
our emotions right now.

974
00:59:03,111 --> 00:59:06,350
No. I'll go to the office right now.

975
00:59:09,721 --> 00:59:10,920
What?

976
00:59:12,861 --> 00:59:13,991
Yes.

977
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,400
Understood.

978
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:22,071
Can you not return to working on J-BIMS?

979
00:59:22,131 --> 00:59:23,370
Mr. Lee said it was a vacation.

980
00:59:25,571 --> 00:59:27,170
But he meant I should leave the project.

981
00:59:27,841 --> 00:59:30,511
Listen, Yoon Woo. I'll go and let the Audit Team know.

982
00:59:45,391 --> 00:59:46,591
Mr. Shin.

983
00:59:46,591 --> 00:59:48,861
Giving Yoon Woo a vacation,

984
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:50,861
Mr. Lee told him to sit out of J-BIMS.

985
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,431
It's been decided that Mr. Oh's report...

986
00:59:53,431 --> 00:59:56,270
will be processed after the J-BIMS demonstration.

987
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:58,940
Then nothing will change for Yoon Woo.

988
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:00,670
We must investigate further.

989
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:05,810
There is no evidence proving his allegations of verbal abuse.

990
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,210
He couldn't record anything...

991
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:09,611
due to the nature of the Technology Development Team.

992
01:00:09,611 --> 01:00:11,381
The Technology Development Team members...

993
01:00:11,381 --> 01:00:15,120
testified they had never witnessed Mr. Park verbally abuse Mr. Oh.

994
01:00:15,891 --> 01:00:17,221
Mr. Oh's report...

995
01:00:17,221 --> 01:00:19,060
is a one-sided argument at the moment.

996
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:21,591
Considering the realistic situation,

997
01:00:21,591 --> 01:00:25,861
we will separate Mr. Park and Mr. Oh until the demonstration.

998
01:00:26,201 --> 01:00:27,870
Mr. Oh will either be put back on the team...

999
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:30,201
or transferred to another team after the demonstration.

1000
01:00:31,241 --> 01:00:32,741
I'll go and let the Audit Team know.

1001
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,911
President Hwang ordered Mr. Shin...

1002
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:37,940
not to make a big deal out of it.

1003
01:00:39,111 --> 01:00:40,241
Is it...

1004
01:00:41,051 --> 01:00:42,281
because of President Hwang?

1005
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,051
I heard he told you to close this case.

1006
01:00:51,221 --> 01:00:53,020
Is this the Audit Team...

1007
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:55,861
suspecting everything you mentioned?

1008
01:00:57,261 --> 01:00:58,801
Yoon Woo must've felt so wronged...

1009
01:00:58,801 --> 01:01:01,201
and distressed to have wanted to burn himself to death.

1010
01:01:02,531 --> 01:01:05,741
I know that the demonstration is an important big event. I do.

1011
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:09,370
But I don't think it's important enough to disregard one's pain.

1012
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:10,980
We're not disregarding it.

1013
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,580
The conclusion of the investigation...

1014
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,350
has been postponed until ten days later.

1015
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,580
Why must the victim sit out?

1016
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:20,781
Yoon Woo did his best for the past year on J-BIMS.

1017
01:01:23,091 --> 01:01:24,460
If it benefits the company,

1018
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,531
do we overlook the matter regardless of how bad it is?

1019
01:01:27,531 --> 01:01:29,931
Your personal feelings toward the informant...

1020
01:01:29,931 --> 01:01:32,631
have made you lose judgment and become biased.

1021
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:35,370
Is that so?

1022
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:38,000
Then what about this, Mr. Shin?

1023
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,870
What if someone is going to leak the company's important technology?

1024
01:01:47,011 --> 01:01:48,181
What are you saying?

1025
01:01:48,181 --> 01:01:50,781
You may cover up the pain of a bullied individual.

1026
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:52,951
But you will investigate...

1027
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:55,850
a major case like this, right?

Answer wisely.

1039
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,141
If not, reporting to the police will be decided...

1040
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,241
as soon as this investigation is over.

1041
