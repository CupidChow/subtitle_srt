00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,345
NEW TEMPORARY TEACHER

2
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,018
HEAD OF COLLEGE ADVISORY

3
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,731
COLLEGE ADVISORY DEPARTMENT

VICE-PRINCIPAL, PRINCIPAL,

HEADS OF EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES,
IT, AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS

8
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:55,847
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

9
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,068
Yes, I lied.

10
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,444
Why?

11
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,031
If you keep confronting everybody,
you'll make the issue bigger.

12
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,032
I mean,

13
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:18,870
who are you to tell that team
to revise their own questions?

14
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,706
These questions are
from all four of us so obviously--

15
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,666
That's not the reality.

16
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,002
You shouldn't be worrying
about their questions.

17
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,837
Mr. Ji and Mr. Ha should--

18
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,131
If I don't say anything,
it's not only the kids,

19
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,342
but Mr. Ji will also be in trouble.

20
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,595
But I should still do nothing?

21
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,971
Yes.

22
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,057
Mr. Do.

23
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,020
Just stay out of it this time

24
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,689
if you don't want to be cursed out again.

25
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,069
Are all schools like this?

26
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,447
Did you think it'd be the same place
you remember as a student?

27
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,222
It's going to be embarrassing
in front of the kids.

28
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,683
At the very least,
the exam questions should be fair.

29
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:25,436
As I've told you before,
this is an issue for Mr. Ji to deal with.

30
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,813
If I don't say anything,

31
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,816
Mr. Ji will take the fall for everything.
Then--

32
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,526
What will I take the fall for?

33
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,449
What is it?
What am I going to take the fall for?

34
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,088
What is it? What am I going
to take the fall for?

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,721
I have to speak to you
about Mr. Ha's exam questions.

36
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,806
Why would you need to speak
to me about that?

37
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,148
Because we teach the same subject…

38
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,031
But we're not partners.

39
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,330
Yes?

40
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,206
-Yes.
-Mr. Ji.

41
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,835
Just a moment.

42
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,757
You should know your place,

43
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,217
Ms. Go.

44
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,888
Yes.

45
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,057
I'm on my way.

46
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,110
<i>Well, he worked hard
even when he was a student here.</i>

47
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,528
The speed is…

48
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,406
<i>Maybe it's because
he's been here for a while,</i>

49
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,534
<i>he's very quick-witted,
and his love for this school is deep too.</i>

50
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,578
<i>Mr. Moon, take a close look</i>

51
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,830
<i>for the permanent teacher exam.</i>

52
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,124
If I don't say anything,
it's not only the kids,

53
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,210
but Mr. Ji will also be in trouble.

54
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,421
<i>But I should still do nothing?</i>

55
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,149
MR. JI, THIS IS GO HA-NEUL

56
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:51,249
MR. JI, THIS IS GO HA-NEUL. ABOUT BEFORE…

57
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,670
MOM

58
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,965
Yes, Mom. I'm on my way home.

59
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,011
What?

60
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,305
Okay. Hold on.

61
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,936
Come on.

62
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,651
Well, you know…

63
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,323
-There she is.
-There she is.

64
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,890
-Have a drink.
-Thanks.

65
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,360
So…

66
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,988
Is she doing okay at school?

67
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,616
She doesn't tell us anything.

68
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,078
Yes. She lucked out
with her department head as well.

69
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,704
She's a good person.

70
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,791
Really? Her supervisor likes her as well?

71
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,792
Yes.

72
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,545
Well, she was in school for a long time,

73
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,049
so she might not be very familiar
with office culture,

74
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,302
but besides that, she has a kind heart
because she takes after me.

75
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,430
I'll go buy some beer.

76
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,765
Okay.

77
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,402
I heard that there's an opening
for a Korean teacher this year.

78
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,447
Do you think she has a chance?

79
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,157
I'm not sure.

80
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,619
We have a temporary teacher
that's been with us for six years.

81
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,412
What? Six?

82
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,123
Six years?

83
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,458
Yes.

84
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,629
Oh, my.

85
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,012
-Thank you.
-Take care.

86
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,245
What do you think?

87
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,747
Do you think you have a chance?

88
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,336
To be a permanent teacher
at a private school…

89
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,008
Education, work experience, age…
They're all important.

90
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,010
But…

91
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,846
There's something else besides a résumé

92
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,599
that a private school highly values.

93
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,600
Did your talk with Ms. Go go well?

94
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,936
Yes.

95
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:47,485
There's something
I've always wanted to ask you.

96
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,073
You have a good reputation
and a lot of experience,

97
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,992
but why are you always so impatient

98
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,329
and only see your colleagues
as the competition.

99
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,340
I'm aware

100
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,259
of how pathetic I am.

101
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,850
But were you that much different than me?

102
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,688
That winter, four years ago.

103

CSAT ANALYSIS AND DEVELOPMENT
KOREAN, JI HAE-WON

104
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,201
He's so handsome.

105
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,661
He could be a celebrity.

106
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,236
<i>There's something else besides a résumé</i>

107
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,905
that a private school highly values.

108
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,158
What is it?

109
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,787
Whether or not you're a person that
will adapt and fit in with the school.

110
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:27,084
That why private schools prefer to hire
among current temp teachers.

111
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,089
One wrong permanent hire could ruin
the atmosphere of the whole school.

112
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,175
In the office,

113
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,679
when someone sees a new hire running
around without thinking twice,

114
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,559
they think to themselves,
"Gosh, how annoying."

115
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,311
About that…

116
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,731
"They're not going to stop."

117
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,650
I had my reasons.

118
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,612
You should have found a different way.

119
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,616
Are you going to risk your position
over something like this?

120
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,956
There's this person that keeps spreading
those strange rumors online.

121
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,126
That's because of a lack of patience.

122
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,422
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

123
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,759
Do you know who it is?

124
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,191
<i>He's been there for six years.
I think that he got a bit greedy</i>

125
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,445
<i>after hearing a rumor like that.</i>

126
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,095
But we're not partners.

127
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,057
You should know your place.

128
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,311
<i>There's something called
the 2 to 6 to 2 law.</i>

129
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,150
<i>When ten people gather, two will like me,</i>

130
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,403
<i>six will have no interest in me,</i>

131
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,699
<i>and the other two are bound to hate me.</i>

132
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,325
<i>It's law of nature.</i>

133
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,591
<i>But despite me knowing this law,</i>

134
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,510
<i>my heart doesn't have the capacity</i>

135
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,680
<i>to help out the guy
who has hated me behind my back </i>

136
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,432
<i>this whole time</i>

137
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,726
<i>and be at peace afterward.</i>

Aren't you leaving? It's Saturday.

146
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,261
-Hey!
-What?

147
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,931
-I'm just going to finish this.
-Okay.

148
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,519
Hey, do you want to take
this class with me?

149
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,645
What is it?

150
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,564

153
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,946
Let's take it together.

154
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,323
My student record is lacking.

155
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,033
I should at least get my grades up.

156
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,536
Look for someone else.
I'm going to head out.

157
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,539
That brat.

158
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,543
I heard you volunteered as an interpreter
at a hospital over the break.

159
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,545
You can volunteer to do that?

160
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,548
Your student record must look insane.

161
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,174
Let's go.

MR. JI HAE-WON'S NOTES

169
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,644
I guess academies are helpful.

QUESTIONS STRESSED BY TEACHERS

172
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,892
<i>This is the Exam Division.
It's time to finalize midterm questions.</i>

173
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,145
It's all set to go.
Please bring this over to CAD.

174
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,354
Okay.

175
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,274
This is going to the EAD.

176
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,906
STUDENTS NOT ALLOWED DURING EXAM PERIOD

177
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,159
STUDENTS NOT ALLOWED

178
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,702
STUDENTS NOT ALLOWED. IF YOU ENTER,
QUESTIONS WILL GET HARDER.

179
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,912
STUDENTS ARE FORBIDDEN
FROM ENTERING THE TEACHERS' OFFICES

180
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,167
<i>Please make sure that students
are forbidden from entering your office</i>

181
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,586
<i>and ensure that
exam questions are protected.</i>

182
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,337
PASSWORD SETTING

183
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,717
Yes, it's a total of 25 questions.

184
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,261
Don't give more points for easy questions…

185
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,804
<i>And please complete filling out</i>

186
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,224
<i>the exam question table
on the administration information system</i>

187
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,893
<i>by this Wednesday.</i>

188
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,895
<i>By next Wednesday,</i>

189
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,898
<i>please prepare a draft of the questions,
answer explanations,</i>

190
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,068
<i>and exam question table
for each teacher to stamp their seal</i>

191
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,195
<i>and be submitted to the Exam Division.</i>

192
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,780
Here's math.

193
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,864
Let's take a look.

194
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,700
Let's see now.

195
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,459
<i>Also, cross-check exam questions
with teachers in your subject</i>

196
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,044
<i>to avoid any errors.</i>

197
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,130
Do you think this will be better?
Or make it easier to solve?

198
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,174
<i>Please follow the format
outlined in the guidelines</i>

199
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,676
<i>provided at the training
for the finalization of exam questions.</i>

200
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,722
<i>Performance assessments by subject
are due by the end of this week.</i>

201
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:24,144
<i>New teachers must attend the midterm exam
training session after school.</i>

202
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,608
It feels like we're walking on thin ice,
doesn't it?

203
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,868
It's been hectic trying to get through
all the materials.

204
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,869
Right?

205
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,496
I'm dying over here, too.

206
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,584
I can't tell if this is an exam
or an art book.

207
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,045
Why are you whining so much today?

208
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,173
What's wrong?

209
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,093
Look. This is a question
on the biology portion.

210
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,636
Half the questions are pictures.

211
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,680
At this rate, I'm about to leave my mark,

212
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:03,475
a brushstroke on the world of Korean Art.

213
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,938
But at least Biology has
only a few pages of questions.

214
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,525
Korean has at least ten pages
worth of questions.

215
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,322
But why do I have to be the one
that draws all these pictures?

216
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,117
Everyone claims
they're technologically challenged

217
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,244
or that they're old
and can't see very well.

218
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,080
Come on. Are they the three blind mice?

219
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,625
Please, lower your voice, farmer's wife.

220
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,423
Why I…

221
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,844
This is Park Seong-soon,
the Head of College Advisory.

222
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,556
Yes, I'll be right there. Okay.

223
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,290
Ms. Park.

224
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,417
Hello.

225
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,920
Oh. Hi, Mr. Ji.

226
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,882
Are you here for something?

227
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,842
Oh, yes.

228
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,802
I'm here to see Mr. Ha.

229
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,555
It's about the Year 3
Korean exam questions.

230
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,724
Exam questions?

231
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,017
Is there an issue?

232
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,899
To the Head of
the School Affairs Department?

233
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,652
Teachers should watch each other's backs!

234
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,488
Excuse me. What's going on?

235
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,909
Apparently, a temporary teacher
at our school is badmouthing

236
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,912
the Head of the School Affairs Department
of our school online.

237
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,082
They're saying that another temp teacher
has connections and whatnot.

238
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,834
-This is great. Just great.
-And that managed to reach

239
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,213
the Office of Education
through a complaint.

240
00:20:56,296 --> 00:21:00,217
And our vice principal had
a headache to deal with.

241
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,013
How could someone go around
saying such things…

242
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,645
Darn it. There's another bomb here.

243
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,359
He even acts like that
when I'm being nice?

244
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,529
Anyway, it seems like Mr. Moon
knew about it all along,

245
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,614
but just kept it to himself.

246
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,785
Jeez, that person might have acted
all nice and friendly in front of him

247
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:30,247
while they were talking
smack about him behind his back.

248
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,543
-Ms. Park, let's go to the meeting room.
-Sure.

249
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,712
Mr. Ji Hae-won.

250
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,380
Mr. Ji Hae-won?

251
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,090
Mr. Ji!

252
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,970
-We need to discuss the exam questions.
-Oh, yes.

253
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,992
<i>Hello. Is this Ms. Go Ha-neul?</i>

254
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,494
<i>I'm the father of Gu Jae-hyun
in Year 3, Class 5.</i>

255
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,122
<i>I look forward to the year ahead with you.</i>

256
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,083
Ms. Go.

257
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,419
-About that…
-Ms. Go!

258
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,921
-Hi, Mr. Do!
-Hello.

259
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,131
Let's go.

260
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,343
I told Mr. Ji and Mr. Ha
that we'd meet them in the meeting room.

261
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,552
Oh, okay.

262
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,432
You didn't say anything
about that, did you?

263
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,394
Regarding Mr. Ha Soo-hyun's
exam questions.

264
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,234
No.

265
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,903
I haven't had a chance to.

266
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,530
And…

267
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,284
I don't plan to.

268
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,411
Good job.

269
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,623
If you do nothing,
you can at least make it half the way.

270
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,665
Take care, Mr. Do.

271
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,917
-Let's go.
-Okay.

272
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:12,307
Ms. Park, why are you here?

273
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,226
I'll explain. Please, take a seat first.

274
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,404
YEAR 3, 1ST SEMESTER

275
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,075
But why is Ms. Park here?

276
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,785
Oh, yes.

277
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,871
I mostly teach first-year students.

278
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,457
But since I teach
two classes of third year,

279
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,418
I just wanted to help out
and come up with a few questions

280
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,713
You all know how magnanimous I could be.

281
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,721
So how should we do this?
She did come up with some questions.

282
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,809
But the majority of her class
are first-year students.

283
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,686
Wouldn't it be too much for you

284
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,147
to handle the 3rd year exam as well?

285
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,149
Well…

286
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,156
I agree, I don't think you need to either.

287
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,533
Okay then.

288
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,119
You four can finalize the questions

289
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,247
and I'll be here to help you
review them at the end.

290
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,748
<i>Review them together?</i>

291
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,083
That sounds good.

292
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,504
Let's solve each other's questions

293
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,717
and let each other know
if we find any errors.

294
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,928
Who is going to edit them this time?

295
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,223
Let's just do it the way
we normally do it. By seniority.

296
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,018
Okay. Ms. Go-Sky, you're up.

297
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,063
But… I've never edited an exam before.

298
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,190
Will it be okay?

299
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,568
You can use the basic format
in the training manual as a reference.

300
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,278
And ask if you have any questions.

301
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,238
Okay.

302
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:55,035
But I already gave you
a copy of my questions.

303
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,747
You didn't find any issues
with them, did you?

304
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,346
-Hello.
-Hi.

305
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,809
Ms. Kim.

306
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,894
What is it?

307
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:25,690
Is there an issue with the exam questions?

308
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,567
What? No.

309
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,821
I smell something fishy.
You know I have a dog's nose.

310
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,490
There's nothing fishy.

311
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,202
Maybe they're serving curry
for lunch today.

312
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,716
QUESTIONS FINALIZED BY HA SOO-HYUN

313
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,678
Mr. Ji.

314
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,596
Yes?

315
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,475
Can you check my questions?
Please check for any mistakes.

316
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,310
Okay.

317
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:09,234
I have to speak to you
about Mr. Ha's exam questions.

318
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,453
Mr. Ha.

319
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,832
-About your exam questions…
-Hold on. I'm sorry.

320
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,627
You finished entering
in your performance assessment grades?

321
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,338
-Yes.
-Can you take care of mine as well?

322
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,133
I have to teach a supplemental class
for the advanced class.

323
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,969
-Sure, but about…
-Mr. Ha.

324
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,721
-Let's have a chat.
-Yes, sir.

325
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,681
Excuse me.

326
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,961
About the exam questions…

327
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,715
-What? The midterms?
-Yes.

328
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,178
I'm in charge of Year 1.

329
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:22,766
But if I were to get involved
with the third year questions…

330
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,270
-That would be going overboard?
-Did they ask you for help?

331
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,398
-No.
-Then it's overboard.

332
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,026
Very much overboard. Obviously overboard.

333
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,196
There's no need to repeat it three times.

334
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,950
People would

335
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,453
really curse me out, right?

336
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,163
-Yup.
-Yes.

337
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,561
Excuse me.

338
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,938
What is it?

339
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,651
Could I possibly use
a personal day tomorrow?

340
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,653
Why?

341
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,323
I don't feel too well.
I think I need to go see a doctor.

342
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,537
Who uses their personal days at a school?

343
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,334
I'll speak to the principal myself.

344
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,171
Mr. Ji.
We're finalizing the exam this week.

345
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,507
If you take the day off,
who will sub for you?

346
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,218
And imagine if people found out.

347
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,762
Everyone is going to want
to take personal days.

348
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,516
It will be a big headache for us.
Come on. You know all this.

349
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,270
If it gets to be too much,

350
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,355
can I at least leave early?

351
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,859
Fine. Try to stick it out
and if you can't, leave early.

352
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,406
If you leave before noon,
the other teachers might not like it.

353
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,533
Try your best to leave in the afternoon.

354
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,298
What do you think?

355
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:22,802
If we all work this hard and study
to get into a good college,

356
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,637
we could live a good life, right?

357
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,055
Or become a YouTuber.

358
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,435
She has improved a lot.

359
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,062
She has. Even the writing
on her chalkboard looks better.

360
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,189
Yes, it does.

361
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,776
She seems to be teaching well.

362
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,783
Sure. We don't live in a time

363
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,910
where a good college
guarantees a good life.

364
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,206
but when you all grow up
and become my age,

365
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,418
there might come a day
where our society justly rewards people

366
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,755
based on the amount of effort
they put into something.

367
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:03,426
He based his midterm questions
from a textbook that's only taught

368
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,846
at an after-school program
for the Icaros kids.

369
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,266
That's my hope anyway.

370
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,313
<i>Especially, Yoo-ra,</i>

371
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,941
whose family is going
through a tough time.

372
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,609
Hypocrite.

373
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,448
Oh, my…

374
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,909
If anyone has any questions
on the midterm, come up.

375
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,336
We went over this last class.
Just one class before.

376
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,880
Why don't you remember?
Did you sleep through it?

377
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,430
-You slept.
-Why do I sleep all the time?

378
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,558
Hey. I thought you had a question.

379
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,814
Mr. Do.

380
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,734
Hey, Yoo-ra!

381
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,403
How's studying going?

382
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,154
Yes, it's going okay.

383
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,324
I had a question I wanted to ask.

384
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,617
Let's go to the office.

385
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,205
The way you solve it is important.

386
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,125
What are the possible methods?
First, you can state it clearly.

387
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,210
What is it?

388
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,463
I have a favor to ask.

389
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,966
Yes, my dear alumna,
do whatever it is you want to do.

390
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,134
Pardon?

391
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,011
I didn't say anything.

392
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:31,222
Your kids have a question. Come on in.
There's already someone here.

393
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,557
Thank you.

394
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,059
Come in.

395
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,701
Hey, Yoo-ra.

396
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,869
Yes?

397
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,413
Aren't you in Ms. Go Ha-neul's class?

398
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,916
Oh, yes.

399
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,961
But why are you asking
your question to Mr. Do

400
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,421
instead of Ms. Go?

401
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,298
Is there a special reason?

402
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,679
Mr. Do is a Korean teacher too.

403
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,017
Come on now. That's not right.

404
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,228
Don't you think asking
the teacher who teaches you the materials

405
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,439
is the polite thing to do?

406
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,359
Yes.

407
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:36,204
Ms. Go, we'll come back later.

408
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,413
Okay.

409
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,128
There's always one in every bunch.
Don't worry about her.

410
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,549
Did you do something
to get on her bad side?

411
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,718
Why are you saying that?

412
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,637
Why? It's clear that
she's unhappy with her.

413
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,182
If someone like her gets under your skin,
it's going to be hard to teach a class.

414
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,351
Make sure you have control over your kids.

415
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,937
Be sure to pull and loosen
the reins when necessary.

416
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,650
A student asked me to give you this.

417
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,277
Thank you.

418
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,369
Okay.

419
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,122
Well, let's wrap up.

420
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,416
And go get some lunch.

421
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,793
Let's go.

422
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,796
-Okay.
-Let's go.

423
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,214
Thank you.

424
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,804
I didn't prepare much
but I hope you enjoy it.

425
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,265
Eat up, my dear alumna.

426
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,143
-Okay.
-What? Alumna?

427
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,020
Did you two go to the same university?

428
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,022
The same elementary school.

429
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,314
Wow.

430
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,446
The more I think about it,
the more insulted I am.

431
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,405
What now?

432
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,199
Look at this.

433
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,494
They want me to write
this verbatim in the student record.

434
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,999
Oh, that was from before…

435
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,543
-A self-student record.
-What is that?

436
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,754
An academy comes up with the words

437
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,757
and then they tell us to copy
everything into the student record.

438
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,259
What do they take schools for?

439
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,346
They think we're crap.
Ms. Go, don't ever do that.

440
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,142
Who is it? Who's the rude one?

441
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,896
A boy named Gu Jae-hyun in my class.

442
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,689
Wait.

443
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:31,110
Wasn't his father the one
behind the grade adjustment issue

444
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,612
in the Physics Department?

445
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:36,783
Yes. He sent over a copy
of the exam to the Physical Society

446
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,451
and got the school good.

447
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,705
Gosh. With mean Jin Yoo-ra
and Papa-boy, Gu Jae-hyun,

448
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,083
it must be tough on my dear alumna.

449
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,092
The grammar in Year 3

450
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,637
expands what you have already
learned in your first and second year.

451
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,180
So it's going to be quite tough.

452
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,892
If you approach it with just the concept,
you won't be able to solve the problem.

453
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:03,976
-Right?
-Yes.

454
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,063
So I wrote down three examples for you.

455
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,234
Now, this is related to <i>rieul</i>.

456
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,860
It's somewhat oddly similar,

457
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,737
but different at the same time.

458
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,280
Which part is different?

459
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,715
2019 MIDTERM FINALIZING QUESTIONS
AND TEST SUPERVISION NOTES

460
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,676
ASSESSMENT SUMMARY

461
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,598
This is the most important part
of this training.

462
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:47,311
If by any chance,
you witness a student cheating,

463
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:51,691
you cannot yell at them that
they're getting a zero on the spot.

464
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,818
You take their exam paper away…

465
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,945
<i>Make sure you have control over your kids.</i>

466
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,614
<i>Be sure to pull and loosen
the reins when necessary.</i>

467
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,666
What did you want to speak to me about?

468
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,087
It's about the midterm exam questions.

469
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,382
The questions you came up with this time.

470
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,676
What is it? Is there an error?

471
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,554
No. It's not exactly an error.

472
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,059
I was maybe wondering
if there was another issue.

473
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,233
What does that mean?

474
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,702
I know that you saw me.

475
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,718
Mr. Do.

476
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,595
Enjoy.

477
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,477
Do you want a bite?

478
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,449
But why are you treating me?

479
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,577
You said you like stuff like this.

480
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,912
An easy-going palate.

481
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,711
I'm sorry.

482
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,090
I didn't think that far.

483
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,801
About the fact that Yoo-ra
was in your class.

484
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,804
Of course, it's insulting to a teacher.

485
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,598
A kid that I teach

486
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,685
asks another teacher about my class?

487
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,272
"I can't trust you."

488
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,649
That's the implication.

489
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,742
And regarding the exam question issue,

490
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,163
I wasn't trying to belittle you.

491
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,334
But considering
the current atmosphere of the school…

492
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,878
Ma'am, can we get another order of <i>sundae</i>?

493
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,879
Okay.

494
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,507
-Is that okay?
-Sure.

495
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,267
I don't know exactly what's going on.

496
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,311
But even if Mr. Ji knows,

497
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,981
it will be difficult for him
to go up to Mr. Ha to ask him

498
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,691
to change the questions.

499
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,828
So basically,

500
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,998
you're telling me
to change my exam questions.

501
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,333
Is that it?

502
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,462
No, I wasn't exactly asking you
to change the questions themselves.

503
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,172
How is that any different?

504
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:04,717
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>

505
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:09,180
a teacher criticizing or asking
another teacher

506
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,765
to edit their exam questions

507
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,351
could result in a power struggle.

508
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,686
Why is that so?

509
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,358
There are teachers whose pride gets hurt

510
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,985
when you criticize their exam questions.

511
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,781
And Mr. Ha is one of those teachers.

512
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:32,203
Strictly speaking, exam questions are
intellectual properties.

513
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:35,331
So it's not surprising
to find a teacher be sensitive

514
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,208
when it comes to their exam questions.

515
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,172
Did you order <i>tteokbokki</i> too?

516
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,924
Yes.

517
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,058
But for someone like Mr. Ji,

518
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,602
it must be much more difficult

519
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,938
to tell Mr. Ha about it.

520
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:04,652
<i>He is a senior teacher
that works in the same office</i>

521
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,823
<i>and at a completely different seniority
level and standing at the school.</i>

522
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,535
If there is an error
with the exam questions,

523
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,955
provide clear evidence and a valid reason.

524
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,874
That's how
you should approach me with this.

525
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,876
Not rudely like this.

526
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,391
I'm leaving. Okay?

527
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:42,857
Mr. Ji.

528
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,113
Organize all of these over there
before you leave for the day.

529
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,207
LAUNDRY

2020 1ST SEMESTER EXAM, WRITING PORTION

531

KOREAN: YEAR 3, 1ST SEMESTER
1ST SECTION: WRITING PORTION EXAM DRAFT

532
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,343
QUESTIONS FINALIZED BY HA SOO-HYUN

533
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,097
<i>But for someone like Mr. Ji,</i>

534
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,350
<i>it must be that much more difficult
to tell Mr. Ha about it.</i>

535

<i>and at a completely different seniority

537
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,986
Darn it…

538
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,582
Oh, come on.

539
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,632
KOREAN: PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT

540
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,592
KOREAN 3-5

541
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:13,489
If you look at question 9 here,

542
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,867
the template is different here.

543
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,787
KOREAN

544
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,770
Yes, I reviewed all the exam questions.

545
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:30,107
I didn't find any more errors
besides the ones from yesterday.

546
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,027
Were there any errors on mine?

547
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,070
Wow.

548
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,531
How many times did she solve those?

549
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,909
Okay, I'll be there in a bit.

550
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:42,828
Thank you.

551
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,834
That's odd.

552
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,836
What is?

553
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,880
My exam questions.

554
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,841
She didn't say anything about them.

555
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,718
Oh, Ms. Kim Yi-boon?

556
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,682
I'm sure you came up with good questions.

557
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,185
Oh, that's too kind.

558
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,062
But that's unlikely.

559
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,442
Ms. Kim doesn't really proofread
other teachers' exam questions very well.

560
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,402
That's what she's famous for.

561
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,655
She might have calmed down recently,

562
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:21,158
but it's in her nature to act like a nut.

563
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,160
She can't fight against nature.

564
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:27,206
To be fair, it's quite a nuisance
to solve someone else's exam questions.

565
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,169
What happens to me

566
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,964
if they find an error
in one of my questions?

567
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:40,052
First, you'll probably be dragged
to the principal's office.

568
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:43,263
You saw what happened
to the Physics Department last time.

569
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:59,863
He's kidding. Don't worry.

570
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,909
Our Ms. Park would never let that happen…

571
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,329
Ms. Go, see me for a moment.

572
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,831
Oh, okay.

573
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,007
Look here.

574
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,554
The choices should go
from short to long from one to five,

575
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:26,140
so change the order.

576
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,685
Since there are no criteria,

577
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:33,063
answer number one and five
can both be the answer.

578
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,609
So I should provide a condition
in the context beforehand

579
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,528
-or give an example.
-That's right.

580
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,405
See?

581
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:45,492
It's clear she's trying
to make her into the next Ms. Park.

582
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,328
She even solved
all of Ms. Go-Sky's questions for her.

583
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,622
Hey, Biology, keep it down.

584
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,629
Excuse me.

585
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:58,714
Yes?

586
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:05,053
3rd Year Department said
they took the wrong printouts.

587
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,723
-Which ones are they?
-Well… I'm not sure.

588
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,142
They said they put it in a cabinet?

589
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,977
Oh, really? Just a moment.

590
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,273
Come this way.

591
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,832
Which one is it?

592
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,918
They said there was
a red paper on top of it.

593
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,002
It must be that one.

594
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,754
-Oh, this one?
-Yes.

595
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,589
Oh, it's this one.

596
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,383
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

597
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,889
-Hello, how are you?
-Hello.

598
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,891
-Are you on your way to the printing room?
-Yes.

599
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,143
-Have a good day.
-You too.

600
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,937
What are you doing, Ms. Go?

601
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,314
-Come on.
-Oh, yes.

602
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,567
Hello.

603
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,544
I think the edits look good.

604
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,922
I think we just need to make sure that
four isn't the most common answer.

605
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,175
Let's submit the rest of it as is.

606
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,469
Okay. Oh, right.

607
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:32,349
We need to do some more revisions
on our questions,

608
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,561
-so we'll submit ours later.
-Okay.

609
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,230
-Send them over when you're done.
-Okay.

610
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,361
Thank you.

611
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,445
Have a good day.

612
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:54,329
This clearly sounds strange.

613
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,374
It's a double negative.

614
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,167
This too.

615
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,421
This question is worth so many points.

616
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,047
How could you ask
such a simple memory question?

617
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:11,763
He's just nitpicking for no reason.

618
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:15,684
-Pardon?
-Knowledge, understanding and application.

619
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,312
You only need to outline
that in the exam question table.

620
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,896
Why is that important now?

621
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,607
He just needs to make sure that

622
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,151
there are no errors and typos
in the questions.

623
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,280
There's something going on
between those two.

624
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,452
And stop coughing already!

625
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,662
It's so damn noisy!

626
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:56,892
Send me those questions as soon
as you're done revising them.

627
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:58,810
Yes, sir.

628
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,536
Ms. Ha.

629
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,581
A student wants to find out
her performance assessment score.

630
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,667
Let her in.

631
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,968
Sir, can you check my score for me?

632
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,096
I'm in Year 3 Class 5, number 25.

633
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,472
Class 5, number 25.

634
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,390
Mr. Ji.

635
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,684
Where did you put
the performance assessments?

636
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,187
I put it in the cabinet yesterday.

637
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,982
-Hold on.
-Okay.

638
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,451
Oh, come on.

639
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,996
Class 5 is the only one that's missing.
Where did you put it?

640
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,207
Wait.

641
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,377
I put them in there yesterday.

642
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,712
Just a moment.

643
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:18,849
Where did it go?

644
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,360
Are you sure you put it in there?

645
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,486
What the…

646
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,157
Ms. Park.

647
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,451
The 3rd Year Department is
in chaos right now.

648
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,618
Over what?

649
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,787
The 3rd-Year Korean Department
Performance Assessments

650
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,623
-of one whole class file is missing.
-What?

651
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,682
Where did you put the damn thing?
I'm about to lose it.

652
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,269
They lost the Korean Department
Performance Assessments?

653
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,812
Are they nuts?

654
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,939
Did Mr. Ji lose them?

655
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,692
Look for them!

656
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,617
What happens if they can't find them?

657
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,703
They issue a formal apology
and everyone has to retake it.

658
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,538
They're lucky if it ends there.

659
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,707
With parents' complaints
and grade adjustments…

660
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,584
That's going to be too much to handle.

661
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,881
Mr. Ji.

662
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:35,759
Mr. Ji?

663
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,513
First, calm down and think it over.

664
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:42,265
Did you ever take out
Class 5's file separately?

665
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:53,860
Is he okay?

666
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,988
-Mr. Ji!
-Mr. Ji!

667
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,791
Oh, class.

668
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,210
Does Mr. Ji have a class this period?

669
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:15,173
He does.
Ask Scheduling Department for a sub.

670
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,800
-I'll go.
-Okay.

671
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,220
JI HAE-WON SCHEDULE

672

673
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,222
EARLY LEAVE APPROVED

674
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,516
Mr. Ji Hae-won's early leave
has been approved.

675
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,978
He has a class next period.

676
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,814
Year 3, Class 7.

677
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,985
-We need to send a sub.
-I can go in.

678
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,486
I'm free next period.

679
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,905
Really? That's great.

680
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,785
Can you put that on
Mr. Ji Hae-won's desk for me?

681
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,745
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

682
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,963
He just left us with this serious issue.
Where did he put it?

683
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:57,883
He's clearly sick. What can you do?

684
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,634
<i>-Hello, how are you?
-Hello.</i>

685
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,344
-Are you on your way to the printing room?
-Yes.

686
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,763
-Have a good day.
-You too.

687
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,056
KOREAN 3-5

688
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,310
Excuse me.

689
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,129
This is Mr. Ji Hae-won's class, correct?

690
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,255
-Yes.
-Yes.

691
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,508
Something came up and I came in his place.

692
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,386
We'll be having a self-study period.

693
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:48,892
SELF-STUDY

YEAR 3 CLASS 7 HOMEROOM TEACHER:
JI HAE-WON

701
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,983
THESE TIMES AND MOMENTS
THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL YET SO PAINFUL…

702
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,568
MR. JI, CAN WE CHANGE OUR SEATS?

703
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:27,282
That's our homeroom teacher's file.

704
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,079
Oh, right.

705
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:39,002
But does he normally keep a daily record?

706
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,003
Yes.

707
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,672
But where is Mr. Ji?

708
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:13,161
MS. YOON YEO-HWA

709
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,499
Yes, Ms. Yoon?

710
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:18,958
<i>Hello, Mr. Ji.</i>

711
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,503
<i>They found the performance assessments.</i>

712
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:23,755
<i>Everything worked out, so don't worry.</i>

713
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:25,799
Okay.

714
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,593
Thank you very much.

715
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:31,387
<i>Oh, you shouldn't thank me.
You should thank Ms. Go.</i>

716
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:35,433
<i>She subbed for you and found
the performance assessments.</i>

717
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,936
Oh…

718
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,231
I see. Thank you anyway.

719
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,901
<i>Don't worry about anything
and get some rest.</i>

720
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,362
<i>-Okay?</i>
-Thank you.

721
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,415
<i>You just have a severe cold.</i>

722
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,750
<i>Don't overexert yourself.</i>

723
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,878
<i>You can be discharged
after the IV is finished.</i>

724
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,026
Hello, Aunt.

725
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,447
I'll take my usual.

726
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,824
Oh, my, look who it is.

727
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,826
It's been a while, right?

728
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,621
What's wrong with your face?

729
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,250
What's wrong with my face?

730
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,296
Here's the kimchi.

731
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:08,818
What a small world.

732
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,614
He's one of my regulars.

733
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,116
Is that so?

734
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,912
So are you two close?

735
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,044
I guess not.

736
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,837
She has quite a temper, doesn't she?

737
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,342
Shut up!

738
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:34,928
You bark all damn day!

739
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:38,181
And I'm the one with the bad temper?

740
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,979
Anyway, she might have a nasty temper

741
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:48,775
and she's not flexible at all.

742
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,363
But she is resilient! Yes.

743
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:56,783
She thought that she wouldn't get
into that school when she first applied.

744
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,993
Someone posted on the internet

745
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:02,247
that she got in through
her connections or something.

746
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:06,876
But…

747
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:11,589
I've known this girl for ten years.

748
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:14,592
She's not the type
to sneak around and cheat.

749
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,011
She's too dumb for that.

750
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,059
So you can be friends with her.

751
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,811
I can vouch for her.

752
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:29,732
What?

753
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,984
Become friends.

754
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:58,803
People even

755
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,474
stand in a line for the bus.

756
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:10,356
When it comes to life and opportunities,

757
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,526
I believe it should be first come,
first served.

758
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,320
And I still believe that to this day.

759
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,282
If someone were to cut in front of me,

760
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,164
I won't just stand by and let it happen.

761
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:34,130
That's true when it comes to buses.

762
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,260
But when it comes to seizing
an opportunity in life,

763
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:42,764
shouldn't we look at a person's capability

764
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,975
and not who came first?

765
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,853
Followed by whoever gets lucky first.

766
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:51,606
Am I wrong?

767
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,493
Even so…

768
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,579
Thank you for today.

769
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,378
I need to tell you something.

770
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,968
It's regarding the exam questions.

771
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,854
There were no errors
in the questions themselves,

772
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,898
so I missed it as well.

773
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,067
Mr. Ha Soo-hyun made questions

774
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,153
based on the materials
he teaches in Icaros.

775
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,571
It could raise

776
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,616
some issues about fairness.

777
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,743
The questions have no errors.

778
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,539
But if people get their hands
on the Icaros workbook,

779
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:53,501
there could be complaints about
how this exam favored the Icaros students.

780
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,301
I understand.

781
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,392
<i>So it was decided that
the Year 3 Korean exam</i>

782
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,561
<i>had to be revised just two days</i>

783
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,105
<i>before it was to be printed.</i>

784
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,149
<i>It was quite a rare occurrence.</i>

785
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,775
Are you just telling us
to figure it out and fix it?

786
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:18,985
Do you work alone?

787
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:22,864
Thanks to that, we heard
every curse word in the book.

788
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,289
<i>We had to stay up all night
to come up with new questions.</i>

789
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:34,584
<i>And then finally,
the exam paper was finalized.</i>

790
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:38,379
FROM: KIM YI-BOON

791
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:41,299
<i>The exam was finally printed.
Come to the printing room.</i>

792
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,267
The exam papers are out!

793
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,477
Oh, really?

794
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,103
Congratulations.

795
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,618
Take this too.

796
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,796
<i>But of course,
the painful tasks continued.</i>

797
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:22,882
Do we normally do this

798
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,718
-by hand?
-Yes.

799
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:30,973
Perhaps you shouldn't just
sit around and help us, Ms. Go?

800
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:32,725
Yes.

801
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,230
What about Mr. Ha

802
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,483
He left early because he's sick.

803
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,527
That bastard…

804
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,822
He's the reason we're in this mess,
but he weaseled his way out…

805
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,907
Damn it. I lost count.

806
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,253
EXAM PAPER ENVELOPE

807
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,384

JI HAE-WON, GO HA-NEUL

811
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:26,153
Does anyone have any questions?

812
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,377
I checked in
on all the classes back there.

813
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,379
Nobody had any questions, right?

814
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:45,590
No.

815
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:47,466
Nobody.

816
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:10,865
<i>The Year 3 Korean exam went smoothly,</i>

817
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:14,619
<i>and my first time proctoring an exam
also went off without a hitch.</i>

818
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:16,954
Good work today.

DAY TO CHECK SHORT ANSWER GRADE
AND TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT EXAM

822
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,601
Number one to five can come up first.

823
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:40,728
Let's check your scores and answer sheets.

824
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:41,979
-Okay.
-Okay.

825
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:43,731
-Check your score.
-Okay.

826
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,360
Ms. Go, doesn't this mean the same thing?

827
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:48,986
No.

828
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:53,699
<i>And it seemed like the midterms
were coming to a quiet close.</i>

829
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:57,453
You already finished
correcting the midterms?

830
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,080
Yes.

831
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:02,625
Wait.

832
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:04,919
Today is Teachers' Day.

833
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:07,338
Is the school taking a day off or not?

834
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:09,674
With the law nowadays,
you can even get in trouble

835
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,842
for accepting a single
flower the wrong way.

836
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,930
How dreary…

837
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:18,557
In my day,
we used to throw parties and stuff

838
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:22,645
with our homeroom teacher
on Teachers' Day.

839
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:25,356
Move your legs, will you?

840
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,651
Come on…

841
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,865
It's so nice…

842
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,451
to have a break.

843
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:39,412
I'm on advanced class monitor duty.

844
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:41,247
The midterms are over.

845
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:46,460
What does the end of midterms have
anything to do with seniors?

846
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:54,010
They're actually done
after they take the CSATs.

847
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:55,720
Yes.

848
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:59,890
So? Did you ask?

849
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,922
<i>CSAT PREP ADVANCED QUESTION SOLUTIONS</i>

850
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:37,011
Was it you?

851
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:42,600
No wonder my books were
always in a new spot.

852
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,063
Thief.

853
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:53,069
-Yes.
-Who are you to call me that?

854
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:55,029
-Hold on.
-Who do you think you are?

855
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:58,657
Who are you to call me that? Apologize!

856
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,869
Why didn't you just ask to borrow it?

857
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:04,622
It's all because of
that stupid pride of yours.

858
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:08,375
-You're a thief.
-Why you crazy…

859
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:10,419
What did you say? Let go of me!

860
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,296
What did you say to me?

861
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:14,215
What did you call me?

862
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:15,841
What are you two doing?

863
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,014
What do you think you're doing?

864
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,394
So they are the ones?

865
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:30,689
Icaros is a complete mess right now.

866
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:31,982
Did you know that?

867
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:38,864
Why these mindless…

868
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:43,452
Do you not want to go to college?

869
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,331
Should I write
all this in your student records?

870
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:56,882
What has Ms. Go Ha-neul
been doing up until now?

871
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,300
How could she let it get this bad?

872
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:06,142
-Ha-neul.
-Yes?

873
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:08,519
Your phone keeps ringing.

874
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:09,645
What?

875
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,486
10 MISSED CALLS
MS. KIM YI-BOON

876
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,368
MS. KIM YI-BOON

877
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:27,788
<i>We received a complaint
about a question on our Korean exam.</i>

878
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:29,415
<i>It's a bit serious.</i>

879
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:33,878
<i>I've actually never seen
a complaint like this before.</i>

880
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:44,597
<i>A truly big problem</i>

881
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:48,142
<i>lurks around nearby like a snake</i>

882
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:50,352
<i>and when I have my guard down,</i>

883
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,271
<i>it slips in through the cracks.</i>

884
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,815
This is the answer key
for the short answers.

885
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:58,694
But they're saying
that the answer can also be

886
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:02,239
"Seong-soon bought two watermelons
with Park Banana and Kim Banana."

887
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:03,741
Does this make any sense?

888
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,329
You're here.

889
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:10,372
What's the complaint?

890
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,708
Is it serious?

891
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:16,212
The thing is… It's unbelievable.

892
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,131
Who would make a complaint about this?

893
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:21,592
Are they kidding?

894
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,886
The thing is…

895
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,181
The Icaros kids are
the ones who initiated it.

896
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:31,894
The smart ones are worse nowadays.

897
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,562
I'm so sick of them.

898
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:36,899
This was a schoolwide Year 3 exam,
so it's a serious matter.

899
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:40,402
They asked for everyone
in the Korean Department to meet

900
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:43,447
and discuss this matter.

901
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:57,771
<i>And this was how the infamous
Korean Department Banana incident</i>

902
01:11:58,355 --> 01:12:02,568
<i>that would be talked about
for years to come began.</i>

903
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:30,596
What is the complaint about?

904
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:32,598
The problem is about the banana.

905
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:35,392
<i>Ms. Go-Sky.
Did you finish resolving the banana?</i>

906
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:37,686
<i>They're saying it's an irrational answer.</i>

907
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,314
If we accept something like this,
it's a violation of our authority!

908
01:12:40,397 --> 01:12:42,941
<i>It's not a wrong answer
just because a few kids wrote it down.</i>

909
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:45,110
<i>I guess the kids could be right.</i>

910
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,280
<i>It's going to be difficult
to grade them again, right?</i>

911
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,241
You have to be prepared
to write a formal apology.

912
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:54,495
<i>For the kids,
their college acceptance is in jeopardy.</i>

913
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:57,164
<i>Could we call another meeting
of the Korean Department?</i>

914
01:12:57,247 --> 01:13:02,252
