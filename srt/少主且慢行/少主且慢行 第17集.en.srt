[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,100
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,979
Episode 17

4
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,870
How is she, doctor?

5
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,740
Can she wake up?

6
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,760
It shouldn't be life-threatening.

7
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,440
But her back injury

8
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,510
takes time to recover.

9
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,000
Thank you, doctor.

10
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:10,630
Li Jia.

11
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,190
Sanqi.

12
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,190
Wake up quickly.

13
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,550
I still have a lot of words to say to you.

14
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,180
Sanqi.

15
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,190
No more accident is allowed at this time.

16
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,320
We can take care of her.

17
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,960
Rest assured.

18
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,360
I, I, I...

19
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
Shh.

20
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,270
Be good.

21
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,750
Hey.

22
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,270
You.

23
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,060
You guys.

24
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,220
Are you guys insane?

25
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,110
Sorry, sorry.

26
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,000
You didn't see it?

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,829
That playboy

28
00:02:58,829 --> 00:02:59,800
holds my wife's hand.

29
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,080
What are you doing?

30
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,600
Oh, shut up.

31
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,630
Lower your voice.

32
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,940
My little ancestor.

33
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,600
Your head was not cut off

34
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,880
because our ancestors blessed you.

35
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,800
Cut my head?

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,030
How can he do this?

37
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,360
Shut up.

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,800
Do you know who he is?

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,470
Who is he?

40
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,829
Tell me his name.

41
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,440
He Zhen.

42
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,910
Young Lord of Taoyuan City, my Brother.

43
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,240
Young Lord, Young Lord.

44
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,100
Young Lord?

45
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,079
OK, since he is your brother.

46
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,000
Who are you?

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,270
My title is Jinyan.

48
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,470
Logically,

49
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,829
you all should salute me.

50
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,670
Ma-ma-ma-master!

51
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,190
Get up. No need.

52
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,750
OK, that's your brother, right?

53
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,750
Go in and control him.

54
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,270
Even if he is Young Lord of Taoyuan City,

55
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,880
he can't just hold my wife's hand.

56
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,829
What did you say?

57
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,520
Obviously you robbed my brother's wife.

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,520
Have you made a mistake?

59
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,470
They have nothing to do with each other.

60
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,110
You don't know yet

61
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,630
the real identity of Sanqi?

62
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,190
Who is she?

63
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,470
She is Young Lady my dad personally chose

64
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,960
for my brother.

65
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,750
Have you made a mistake, He Ruoyao?

66
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,750
She's nothing more than an impostor

67
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,270
of He Jinxin's identity.

68
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:06,830
When did she

69
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,550
become the young lady?

70
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,720
Sanqi is the only daughter of the Tian family

71
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,470
of Yizhuang in Shifang Village.

72
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,830
My dad set this engagement for my brother

73
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,880
and Tian Sanqi exactly.

74
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,480
At that time, the letters of employment was sent to her home

75
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,640
and she even got into the sedan.

76
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,440
Unexpectedly, Sanqi finally fled.

77
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,670
That's why she faked He Jinxin later

78
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,040
and married into your house.

79
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,920
So by rights,

80
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,200
you robbed my brother's wife.

81
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,200
Sanqi escaped marriage?

82
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,390
Escaped the marriage with Young Lord?

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,670
How come I heard nothing

84
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,200
of such a big deal?

85
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,270
Do you know it?

86
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,720
Do you know it?

87
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,550
Right, your brother is the young lord.

88
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,040
If she ran away from marriage,

89
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,880
he must turn Taoyuan City over

90
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,760
to find her out.

91
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,480
My brother didn't intend to marry her.

92
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,920
Escaping marriage fit his purpose.

93
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,830
That's great.

94
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,000
Now take your brother away.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,880
I'll go to see my wife.

96
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,390
No.

97
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,060
But look at him now.

98
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,000
He wants her now.

99
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,320
No way!

100
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,390
He can't take her at will!

101
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,670
That's unreasonable!

102
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,670
Shh. Lower your voice.

103
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,550
You turtle.

104
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,160
He is Young Lord of Taoyuan City.

105
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,830
He is the reason.

106
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,510
You,

107
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,230
control your grief.

108
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,600
Alas, don't be so sad.

109
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,780
Hum.

110
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,300
What happened to you?

111
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,880
You can ask me if you want.

112
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,740
I just think

113
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,350
not everything in this world

114
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,510
can be solved with love.

115
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,110
Thinking of this, I feel sad.

116
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,670
Bullshit.

117
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,830
I think love

118
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,480
is the most powerful in this world.

119
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,600
Oops, Bai Yifei.

120
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,070
Just say what you want.

121
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,830
Don't beat about the bush here.

122
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,160
I...

123
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,390
Okay, let me say.

124
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,510
I'm Lady Jinyan of Taoyuan City.

125
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,550
And you are just the son

126
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,270
of Taifu Magistrate within my jurisdiction area.

127
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,880
You are afraid that due to the status disparity between us,

128
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,160
we will have a difficult future, right?

129
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,980
Yes.

130
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,440
So many people in this world

131
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,160
can't be together

132
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,230
due to different family backgrounds.

133
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,070
Bai Yifei.

134
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,230
Do you like me?

135
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,550
Of course.

136
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,440
My sincerity for you is here.

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,830
If you want to see it, I can take it out for you.

138
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,350
We just solve the case of digging hearts out.

139
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,000
And you want to take your heart out here.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,950
Change another one.

141
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,300
I was wrong.

142
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,380
Okay.

143
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,270
Since we love each other sincerely,

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,160
nothing else matters.

145
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,200
If you worry that we have status disparity,

146
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,880
I can beg my father to

147
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,230
take back my title of Lady Jinyan.

148
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,660
After that,

149
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,640
we can live together in folk

150
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,140
as a couple.

151
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,180
Really?

152
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,200
I,

153
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,390
I'm so happy.

154
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,720
Then you'll grind ink and I'll paint.

155
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,600
We can live as a normal couple, okay?

156
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,390
But you are the only daughter of the lord.

157
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,920
Will he be sad?

158
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
He sees you as a treasure.

159
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,830
As the saying goes, gentlemen don't take love from others.

160
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,070
You nerd.

161
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,920
You have never met my father.

162
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,000
How do you know he doesn't agree?

163
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,720
Let me take you to see him.

164
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,110
If he doesn't agree,

165
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,070
I'll cry. If it doesn't work, I will...

166
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,550
I won't make you cry.

167
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,920
Since your childhood, your father and brother

168
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,900
have taken you as a treasure.

169
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,580
And I will

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,040
definitely cherish you more.

171
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,640
From now on,

172
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,380
you are my priceless treasure.

173
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,980
Then you won't dump me?

174
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,640
Of course.

175
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,200
Why are you worried about this?

176
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,100
I'm still worried you don't want me.

177
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,460
Oh, are you a fool?

178
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,150
If I don't want you,

179
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,520
what if you get bullied by others?

180
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,110
So I still want you.

181
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,960
I want you.

182
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,790
God blesses.

183
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,060
Young Madam woke up.

184
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,960
Young Master, after Young Madam wakes up,

185
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,400
I rushed here to inform you

186
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,550
as soon as possible.

187
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,340
Good job.

188
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,540
Shoes.

189
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Your Highness.

190
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,590
It may be too abrupt for you

191
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,280
to go there now.

192
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,470
You'd better visit her tomorrow.

193
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,350
Your Highness, slow down.

194
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,470
Young Master, don't worry.

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,710
This time we are absolutely the first.

196
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,200
Come.

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,110
Boy, smart.

198
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,590
You can avoid being kicked for one time.

199
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,260
Rest assured.

200
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,470
Who can rush ahead of us?

201
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,960
Right?

202
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,000
Huh!

203
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,860
What are you doing?

204
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,280
I go to the toilet.

205
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,150
The toilet is over there.

206
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,020
How about you?

207
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,550
Oh, I'm a little hungry. I'll go to the kitchen.

208
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,590
The kitchen is over there.

209
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,140
Go away.

210
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,550
Dear.

211
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,000
Honey.

212
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,520
You wake up.

213
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,180
Are you a parrot repeating my words?

214
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,030
I came to see my wife. Nothing of your business.

215
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,000
What wife?

216
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,080
Obviously she is my wife.

217
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,030
First come, first served.

218
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,980
She too my wedding letter first, OK?

219
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,640
Listen up.

220
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,910
We two have been married.

221
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,550
Do you know de facto marriage?

222
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,400
What did you say?

223
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,150
I don't care.

224
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,540
Listen.

225
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,280
Don't quarrel.

226
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,910
Where did you come from?

227
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,880
What do you mean?

228
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,030
This is Zhao's mansion.

229
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,640
You lose memory?

230
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,840
Oh, it's okay.

231
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,280
Honey, you just need to remember.

232
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,590
I'm your beloved husband.

233
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,670
All right, dear.

234
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,110
It doesn't matter who he is.

235
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,980
You just need to remember me.

236
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,350
I am your husband.

237
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,150
He Zhen, Young Lord of Taoyuan City.

238
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,760
He is not important.

239
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,550
You don't need to remember him.

240
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,470
You just need to remember me.

241
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,150
It's okay.

242
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,000
You just need to remember me.

243
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,200
I don't lose my memory.

244
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,670
Can you two be quiet?

245
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,320
What sound?

246
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,760
Honey, you must be hungry.

247
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,960
I'm to blame for not taking care of you well.

248
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,400
Let's eat pig brain.

249
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,840
Nourish your brain, okay?

250
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,470
What pig brain?

251
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,520
We still eat the best tonic.

252
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,200
Shark fin, bird's nest

253
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,280
or fish glue and cornu cervi?

254
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,320
Yeah. How about a drumstick?

255
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,670
Wet Nurse Ling just brought it from Shifang Village.

256
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,520
Authentic mountain forest chicken, delicious meat.

257
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,470
Hometown taste.

258
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,200
This drumstick

259
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,350
is too greasy.

260
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,150
Let's drink some full tonic congee.

261
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,910
Wait a while.

262
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,030
I'll cook it for you personally.

263
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,440
Wait, I'll make soup for you.

264
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,080
Hey, you guys.

265
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,150
Ah, don't bother me.

266
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,640
Can you leave me alone for a while?

267
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,030
It's me.

268
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,400
Both of them are not here today?

269
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,030
It is said

270
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,230
the dessert shop launches new products today.

271
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,280
They both went to buy it in person.

272
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,150
I feel strange.

273
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,470
Zhao Cuo may act like this.

274
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,790
Why does Young Lord...

275
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,880
Actually I also wonder.

276
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,280
My brother used to be an iceberg.

277
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,960
But you melt him.

278
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,760
He said he didn't want to get married.

279
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,350
But now he is attentive.

280
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,740
Huh, what should I do?

281
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,320
No, I've married Zhao Cuo.

282
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,150
I cannot regret.

283
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,080
Sanqi.

284
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,080
You know what?

285
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,000
No woman can't get rid of my brother

286
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,080
as long as he wants.

287
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,840
So if he really wants you,

288
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,640
you can't help but agree.

289
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,280
No, I'm married to Zhao Cuo.

290
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,470
I can only be his wife.

291
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,200
What kind of couple are you and Zhao Cuo?

292
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,300
You two haven't

293
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,640
slept together, right?

294
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,230
We...

295
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
Why are you holding me?

296
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,980
What did you do to me?

297
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,080
Dear, of course I did

298
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,640
what should be done between husband and wife.

299
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:54,320
Anyway, probably,

300
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,420
we did it.

301
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,790
But it seems not real.

302
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,760
Are you a fool?

303
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,590
You are not clear

304
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,710
of such a thing?

305
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,320
Let me ask you.

306
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,110
What did you mean?

307
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,710
I heard someone said before.

308
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,380
That is,

309
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,840
that is...

310
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,840
Did he take your clothes off,

311
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,550
then scratch your armpit

312
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,640
to make you tickle?

313
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,140
No.

314
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,150
That's great. That's great.

315
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,080
I heard people say children

316
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,880
were born from the armpit.

317
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,640
So you are still innocent.

318
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,790
Rest assured.

319
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,550
That damn Zhao Cuo lied to me again.

320
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:47,980
Hey.

321
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,840
Did Mr. Bai do that to you?

322
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,790
Of course not!

323
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,440
I'm very conservative.

324
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,150
Okay.

325
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,470
Then we must protect

326
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,320
our armpits well.

327
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,640
Hold the last line of defense.

328
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,840
Hold it.

329
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,230
How dare you attack me, Tian Sanqi!

330
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,819
Oh, to be serious.

331
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,430
I almost forgot

332
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,760
a very important thing.

333
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,470
My brother asked to meet you in the pavilion.

334
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,880
He said he has something very important to tell you.

335
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,280
Okay.

336
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,190
I should make it clear early to avoid misunderstanding.

337
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,350
Young Lord, what's up?

338
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,140
Hum.

339
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,190
I want to tell you a story.

340
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,950
Eight years ago,

341
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,800
under the old locust tree in Shifang Village,

342
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,680
a little girl could only

343
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,350
make friends with the old locust tree

344
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,230
because she was bullied by other children in the village.

345
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,260
One day,

346
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,710
she begged the immortal to give her a friend.

347
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,820
Unexpectedly,

348
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,900
the immortal really gave her

349
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,760
a little boy.

350
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,280
How,

351
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,140
how did you know this story?

352
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,760
Later,

353
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,760
the little boy and the little girl

354
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,070
promised to be friends under the big tree.

355
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,070
They played

356
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,710
and had fun together.

357
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,470
They picked fruits

358
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,760
and sang nursery rhymes together.

359
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,880
They also took fireflies as fireworks.

360
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,700
The little boy swore that

361
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,920
he would never let the little girl

362
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,680
be bullied again.

363
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,310
Who are you?

364
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,000
After that,

365
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,520
the little boy was leaving

366
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,590
to return to where he belonged.

367
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,800
The little girl cried before he left.

368
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,590
That little boy gave her

369
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,040
a bamboo name ring

370
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,520
that was engraved with his totem.

371
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,500
Your name ring.

372
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:26,940
I return it to you.

373
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,100
And there is one.

374
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,160
It has been eight years.

375
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,310
I wonder if you still recognize it.

376
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,400
This name ring. Why do you have

377
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,470
the name ring of friend

378
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,110
Do you remember

379
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,580
what I said

380
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,900
when I gave you my name ring?

381
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,950
I remember.

382
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,220
I made my name ring with bamboo chips.

383
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,430
I give it to you now.

384
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,040
We are destined to be together.

385
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,230
When you are eighteen,

386
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,040
I will definitely come back for you.

387
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,380
Wait for me.

388
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,460
Okay, I wait for you.

389
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,680
Old locust tree as evidence.

390
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,280
Old locust tree as evidence.

391
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,160
Sorry.

392
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,900
I left without saying goodbye

393
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,710
but leaving only that grimace

394
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,710
to tell you I'm alive.

395
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,430
I have kept you waiting for eight years.

396
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,350
All these years,

397
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,260
I can't find you.

398
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,220
I could only talk to you

399
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,710
under that old locust tree over and over again

400
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,680
in my dream.

401
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,430
Sanqi.

402
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,760
Sorry.

403
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Sorry to have kept you waiting long.

404
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,710
Dear.

405
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,680
Li Jia.

406
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:52,700
Young Master.

407
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,350
What happened?

408
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,070
Where is Young Madam?

409
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,350
Uh, well.

410
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,740
I saw her in the garden pavilion.

411
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,430
Don't you know she is ill now?

412
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,310
The doctor asked her to rest more

413
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,000
and move less.

414
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,470
Young Master, let's not go first.

415
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,580
She is not alone.

416
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,760
Li Jia, you are bold now.

417
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,310
How could you say that?

418
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,590
I don't mean this.

419
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,230
He Zhen?

420
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,040
Correct.

421
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,560
Young Master, we can't go.

422
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,430
They are there...

423
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,710
You stop me now.

424
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,830
Why didn't you stop him?

425
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,430
Turn over.

426
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,590
Young Master.

427
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,160
He's Young Lord.

428
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,520
How can I stop him? Ouch.

429
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,430
Why don't you talk?

430
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,640
Just stare at me like this?

431
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,280
Do you still doubt about what I say?

432
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:57,980
I.

433
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,070
Well.

434
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,230
I have one last thing.

435
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,110
If you promise me,

436
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,190
I can recognize you.

437
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,350
Go ahead.

438
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,260
Can you

439
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,160
let me see your waist?

440
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,070
You want to see my birthmark?

441
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,280
Exactly.

442
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,520
Come with me.

443
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,950
Wait, wait, wait.

444
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,710
Didn't you want me to show you clearly?

445
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,760
I.

446
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,190
No, no, no.

447
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,640
I haven't been so familiar with you.

448
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,000
Put on your clothes first.

449
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,430
Sanqi, you and I are married.

450
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,310
No need to stick to this detail.

451
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,400
After you see it clearly,

452
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,560
don't doubt about what I said anymore.

453
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,950
In this case,

454
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,590
I should check it clearly.

455
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,280
It has the final say.

456
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,400
OK, come on.

457
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,760
Are you alright?

458
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,380
All right.

459
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,640
Sanqi, is this you want to see?

460
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,520
Exactly.

461
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,310
This is my brother's birthmark.

462
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,180
Sanqi.

463
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,950
You finally recognize me.

464
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,260
Brother.

465
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,800
Where have you been all these years?

466
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,350
Why didn't you appear earlier

467
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,950
but at the time?

468
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,500
Sanqi.

469
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,070
I promise.

470
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,160
I will never let you get wronged again.

471
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,420
After you recover,

472
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,100
I'll immediately take you back to get married.

473
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:27,680
I know.

474
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,520
we haven't seen each other for so long

475
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,040
You will find it hard to accept me

476
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,880
as I suddenly asked you to come back with me.

477
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,590
It's okay.

478
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,230
Let's take it slowly. Okay?

479
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,560
We can have

480
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,280
the best taste of this tea

481
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,920
when the water is the hottest.

482
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,470
Tasty?

483
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:06,800
Hum.

484
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,350
This is also the latest pastry of Nanxin Desert Shop.

485
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:12,950
Have a taste.

486
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:28,980
Come on.

487
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,680
Can you two stop showing off love?

488
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,110
Can you care about

489
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,950
my feeling as I am to

490
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,640
be single, okay?

491
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,110
Zhao Cuo, we don't show off.

492
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,230
This is a man's instinct reaction

493
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,280
to his beloved.

494
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,160
Have tangerine.

495
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:50,880
Okay.

496
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,760
I'll peel you n tangerine.

497
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:53,830
Okay.

498
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,950
He Ruoyao.

499
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,640
Tell me quickly.

500
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,640
Does your brother

501
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,560
hide Sanqi, huh?

502
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,520
Zhao Cuo.

503
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:04,430
It's useless for you

504
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,110
to be anxious

505
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,430
because I don't know either

506
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,190
where he hides Sanqi.

507
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,760
He Ruoyao.

508
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,830
He yells at me.

509
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,300
Leave him alone.

510
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,950
As long as you tell me,

511
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,280
I will bring all beautiful men

512
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,880
of the entire southern city here

513
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,560
for you.

514
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,110
How is it?

515
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,590
Really?

516
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:34,950
Hum.

517
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,110
Am I that type of liking handsome men?

518
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,430
No.

519
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,760
Oh, Zhao Cuo.

520
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,520
I really can't help.

521
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,590
At the very beginning

522
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,680
when I knew Sanqi 's identity,

523
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,710
I also wanted to help her.

524
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,310
Right.

525
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,110
I didn't want her to marry into my family either.

526
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,220
But unexpectedly,

527
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:05,560
my brother changes his attitude fast.

528
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,920
In addition,

529
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,880
at first I thought.

530
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,800
my brother was not interested in Sanqi.

531
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,590
But he actually came

532
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,560
to southern city himself.

533
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,590
Hey, I can't

534
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,230
manage him.

535
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,110
You can't manage him.

536
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,950
Hey, Zhao Cuo.

537
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,520
Long pain is worse than short pain.

538
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,190
You should give up as soon as possible.

539
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,000
Damn.

540
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,580
Young Master.

541
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,560
Young Master.

542
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,950
You must calm down after I tell you something.

543
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,470
Go ahead.

544
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,310
I heard the maid said that

545
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,640
Young Madam is in the room of Young Lord

546
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,430
and hasn't come out till now.

547
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,740
Li Jia.

548
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,340
Yes.

549
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,760
Go get my knife.

550
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,280
What?

551
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,620
I'll hack him.

552
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:02,920
I'll kill him.

553
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,040
Young Master, Young Master, sit down.

554
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,950
That's a capital crime.

555
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,700
You can't do it.

556
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,560
Capital crime?

557
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,110
So what, huh?

558
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,310
He robs my wife in broad daylight.

559
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,300
I tell you.

560
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,590
If something wrong happens to Sanqi,

561
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,520
my life will be meaningless.

562
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,520
God, Young Master.

563
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,230
It turns out you are worried about this.

564
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,950
Rest assured.

565
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,590
I sent a maid to listen over there.

566
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,800
They are just chatting.

567
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,860
They can't chat.

568
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,430
I'll hack him now.

569
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,950
Young Master, Young Master.

570
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,110
Young Master, can't you break in.

571
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,940
There are all masters.

572
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,580
Masters?

573
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
Then tell me what to do.

574
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,710
Sit and wait?

575
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,310
Listen to me.

576
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,470
At this moment,

577
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,350
what we need more is calmness.

578
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,560
Do not act on impulse.

579
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,000
We need to calm down. Use our wisdom.

580
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,560
Calm down.

581
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,980
Calm down. Outsmart him.

582
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,000
I outsmart him.

583
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,400
Li Jia.

584
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,110
Am I handsome?

585
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,820
Yeah.

586
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,680
Am I the most handsome guy in southern city,

587
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,880
Mr. Right for many girls

588
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,640
and the popular

589
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,100
Whirly of Southern City?

590
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,180
Yes.

591
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,160
Well, how am I compared to that black potato?

592
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,780
Uh, I dare not say.

593
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,520
Hey, right.

594
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,830
You are afraid to offend Young Lord.

595
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,660
Because I'm more handsome than him.

596
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,310
Well, no.

597
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,830
I didn't say it. I don't admit this.

598
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,520
Actually thinking in this way,

599
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,430
you are slightly better

600
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,000
than that young lord.

601
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,950
You are a bit

602
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
more handsome

603
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,400
than him in appearance.

604
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:15,980
[Big Battle for Wife]

605
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,470
But Young Master,

606
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,680
robbing a wife from Young Lord

607
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,020
is a capital crime.

608
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,470
Wow. When did you wear it?

609
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,110
Hum, you, Just Face and He Ruoyao

610
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,800
are all unreliable.

611
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,880
Since I can't take her forcibly, I will outwit him.

612
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,800
Good luck, Young Master.

613
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,400
I'll leave first.

614
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,880
Calm down.

615
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,640
As my most loyal attendant,

616
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,190
I have a glorious task for you.

617
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,310
Wow, where did you get this?

618
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,000
Hum, from now on,

619
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,540
never let black potato

620
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,950
stays alone with Sanqi.

621
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,830
Every half hour,

622
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,400
give him half a plate of fruit.

623
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,760
Can I refuse?

624
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,660
No.

625
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,020
Oh.

626
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,830
You damn potato.

627
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,560
Grab a woman with me? You're still young.

628
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,190
Do you remember

629
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,590
we picked fruits from trees?

630
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,680
Yes.

631
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,380
Young Lord.

632
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,520
Young, Young Lady.

633
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,710
I've prepared some fruit.

634
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,760
Enjoy it please.

635
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,230
Put it here.

636
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,400
I have never

637
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
seen that fruit again.

638
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Was it called green jujube?

639
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,000
Green jujube

640
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,280
tastes crunchy.

641
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
Do you have anything else?

642
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,760
Sorry.

643
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,400
So good.

644
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,710
Young Lord.

645
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,800
This is today's menu.

646
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,020
Please go through it.

647
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,590
We follow the owner.

648
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,070
Sorry.

649
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,740
Young Lord,

650
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,400
which one between Wet Nurse Ling and Hu

651
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,190
looks better?

652
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,520
Thank you.

653
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,070
Oh, sorry.

654
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,660
Do you remember when we were young,

655
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,110
in Shifang Village...

656
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,900
Shifang Village?

657
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:52,280
The uncle of the head of Shifang Village

658
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:52,820
used to work with me as...

659
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,020
Li Jia.

660
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,560
I don't want to see you again

661
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,640
within four hours.

662
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
Oh, sorry.

663
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,880
Come back.

664
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,520
What?

665
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,340
Six hours.

666
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,300
Oh, sorry.

667
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,160
What did you say?

668
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,590
They two recalled

669
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,920
their childhood memory in the room?

670
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,560
They act intimately and looked happy?

671
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,400
Yeah.

672
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
No way.

673
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,590
They should not have common

674
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,560
childhood memories.

675
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,760
Li Jia, explore it again.

676
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,520
I can't.

677
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,160
Young Lord said he didn't want

678
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,350
to see me again in six hours.

679
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,520
Don't you go?

680
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,740
I'll go on my own.

681
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,700
You are not allowed to go anywhere.

682
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:36,820
I announce,

683
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,000
wife struggling campaign plan must end.

684
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,800
Li Jia, you traitor.

685
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,460
You even tell him this case.

686
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,350
Why are you kicking Li Jia?

687
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,540
He is well-intended.

688
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,820
Hey, dad.

689
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,220
It was you who asked me to marry Sanqi.

690
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,680
That's your daughter-in-law.

691
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,950
Now you give her up to him?

692
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,280
I didn't know the identity of Sanqi.

693
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,880
But I know it now.

694
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,920
If you grab a wife from Young Lord,

695
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,920
you will be beheaded.

696
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:09,520
Son.

697
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,870
I finally find

698
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,670
my second love after half of my life.

699
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,120
I want to live

700
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,949
a happy retirement life with my Ling.

701
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,000
Are you going to ruin your dad's

702
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,429
retirement life?

703
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,080
Are you going to ruin

704
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,670
my happy youth?

705
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,520
Young Master, Young Master.

706
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,360
There are thousands of beauties in this world.

707
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,560
Why do you fall in love with her only?

708
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,080
Ah, you asked me to marry her before.

709
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,520
But now you tell me to give up.

710
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,909
Are you guys bewitched?

711
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:40,739
No.

712
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,389
True love may be more than once.

713
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:44,840
Right? You may meet the second one.

714
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,190
In southern city,

715
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,429
there are tens of thousands of beauties.

716
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,909
What if you are going to

717
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,949
fall in love with another lovely girl?

718
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,230
I don't believe you!

719
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,150
I just want her.

720
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,000
I'll go now.

721
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,630
Don't say anything.

722
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,560
Stay here honestly.

723
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,280
You are not allowed to go anywhere.

724
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,360
Especially you can't disturb Young Lord and Sanqi.

725
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,800
Huh? Li Jia.

726
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,500
Stay here.

727
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,230
Yeah.

728
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,630
I don't care. Ouch.

729
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,760
Listen up.

730
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,760
Guard him tightly.

731
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,910
If he conflicts with Young Lord

732
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,150
because of Sanqi,

733
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,040
we will be over.

734
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,390
That's Young Lord.

735
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,190
Offending him

736
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,230
will make our whole family beheaded.

737
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:37,860
Understand?

738
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,260
But Master,

739
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,190
do you think I can hold Young Master?

740
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,900
This is really a bit difficult.

741
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,320
But you can try.

742
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,840
We believe in you.

743
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,870
You can make it.

744
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,230
Don't believe me anymore.

745
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,080
Come on.

746
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,840
But now Young Master is thinking about

747
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,870
how to recapture Young Madam.

748
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,800
How about

749
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,040
we pack away secretly?

750
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,360
Bullshit!

751
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,120
Can you escape from Taoyuan City?

752
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,080
Oh.

753
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,560
Well, let me ask you.

754
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,840
Since Cuo married....

755
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,660
Path.

756
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,630
Since he met Sanqi,

757
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,120
does he rarely go to whorehouse and taverns?

758
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,600
It seems so.

759
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,360
Oops, since you can't hold him,

760
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,840
we'd better let him play.

761
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,950
Lead him to have fun

762
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,760
in the gambling house and whorehouse.

763
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,560
If he meets again

764
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,630
his wine-and-meat friends,

765
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,840
he may forget Sanqi..

766
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,660
Master, you are wise.

767
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,670
But, it takes...

768
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,760
Here you are.

769
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,870
Wait. Wait. Enough.

770
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,000
Okay.

771
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,430
Hurry up. Hurry up.

772
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,560
You can do it.

773
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,390
Perfect.

774
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,000
Hey, what does this mean?

775
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,520
He gave me event funding?

776
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,280
Yeah, event funding.

777
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,520
He said not to let me go.

778
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:46,320
But he just supports me with money.

779
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,040
Yes, let's go.

780
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,800
Master said that

781
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,870
it has been a long time

782
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,520
since you went to the whorehouse and gambling house last time.

783
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,360
They are depressed.

784
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,390
For our economic development in southern city,

785
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,390
he asked me to lead you

786
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,390
to tour there

787
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,560
for arousing the enthusiasm of the masses

788
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,150
and stimulating consumption.

789
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,390
I think you want to go.

790
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,620
Take the money and go yourself.

791
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
Young Master, let's go.

792
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,870
Don't worry. It's definitely not

793
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,520
his entrapment this time.

794
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,320
No one will stop you.

795
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,670
Master, let's go.

796
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,980
I said no.

797
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,300
Get off.

798
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,800
Get off.

799
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:25,630
Okay.

800
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,670
You guys are not kind at all.

801
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,390
With funds and plans,

802
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,950
I finally don't need to drink medicine again.

803
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,280
Being injured these days,

804
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,600
I cannot run or jump.

805
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,840
It really killed me.

806
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
But you have to pay attention to it.

807
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,150
Although the doctor said that you are already fine,

808
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,430
you still need to take care of yourself.

809
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,000
Oh, don't worry.

810
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,950
I'm not those

811
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,470
frail young ladies.

812
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,670
I'm not so fragile.

813
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,360
How about it?

814
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,560
Now you're recovered.

815
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,280
Have you decided it?

816
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,360
When you will return to capital with me?

817
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,470
Huh?

818
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:12,710
Father is seriously ill.

819
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,560
I can't stay in southern city for too long.

820
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,870
If you haven't decided it yet,

821
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,840
I can go home first.

822
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,800
However,

823
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,670
as long as you will go back.

824
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,100
I have been waiting to meet you again

825
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,560
for a long time.

826
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,800
I don't want to wait any more.

827
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,420
So, so

828
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,430
what exactly happened eight years ago?

829
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,950
Why did you leave suddenly?

830
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,870
Since childhood,

831
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,430
I was sent out to escape war.

832
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,320
I followed the general who escorted me

833
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,080
and lived with no fixed abodes

834
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,710
to hide my identity

835
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,600
from others.

836
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,040
Before I was ten,

837
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,190
I didn't even know who I was.

838
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,560
It turns out you had been hiding from the assassination.

839
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,150
Yes.

840
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,360
General told me

841
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,870
everyone in the world wanted to kill me.

842
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,560
My task

843
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,000
was to protect myself from being assassinated.

844
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,360
In fact,

845
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,000
I was not afraid of death.

846
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,430
I was more afraid of being alive.

847
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,760
Why?

848
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,280
Do you know

849
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,150
the feeling

850
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,150
of living alone in this world?

851
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,040
I hid everywhere since young.

852
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,280
I couldn't contact with anyone.

853
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,280
I had no friends.

854
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,520
I couldn't cry or laugh.

855
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,230
Brother.

856
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,800
I didn't know

857
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,120
you still had these pasts.

858
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,060
Everyone thinks

859
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,230
Young Lord

860
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,560
is extremely distinguished and powerful

861
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,470
as he is second only to the lord.

862
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,560
But they don't know

863
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,950
I have no idea what stability is in my life.

864
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,040
Sanqi, that period of staying with you

865
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,710
is the happiest time in my life.

866
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,040
I don't want to be separated from you.

867
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:21,230
Follow me. Okay?

868
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,910
Someday,

869
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:33,520
I will go back to where I should be.

870
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:34,520
Never mind.

871
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,190
You have me.

872
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,780
I will stay with you.

873
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,320
Don't be seen by others.

874
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,800
Since we exchange name rings,

875
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,040
we will be together forever.

876
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:57,980
You are willing to go back with me?

877
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,120
Yeah.
