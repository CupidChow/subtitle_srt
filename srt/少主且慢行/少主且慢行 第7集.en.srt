00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:33,020
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,780
Episode 7

4
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:00,040
Wow! Welcome home!

5
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,320
Let's go home.

6
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,550
Let's go.

7
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:31,750
I saw you dodging that day.

8
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,030
Actually you've long known

9
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,470
the letter was written by Leimo, right?

10
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:46,720
You guys go first.

11
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,320
I'll go later.

12
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,440
Leimo.

13
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,110
Yes.

14
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,880
Although he tried to imitate Liang Xiangsong's handwriting,

15
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,670
he didn't know

16
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,910
Liang Xiangsong is a left-hander.

17
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,830
You are together from morning to night.

18
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
Actually you've long known

19
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,600
Leimo is a man, right?

20
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,030
Ah?

21
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,320
What?

22
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,079
Don't lie to me.

23
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,320
I really don't know.

24
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,600
Don't lie to me.

25
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,470
I read less.

26
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,079
Young Master.

27
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,470
Now that you've known

28
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,110
I'm not a girl,

29
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,750
why do you still spend every day with me here?

30
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
It's good that you are a man.

31
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,960
In your place,

32
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,630
I can avoid meeting those ordinary girls.

33
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,520
But you don't need to worry.

34
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,670
When I make friends,

35
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,720
I attach most importance to brotherhood.

36
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,110
So I'll definitely protect you.

37
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,110
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

38
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,600
I thought

39
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,750
my friends are all over the southern city.

40
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,880
Unexpectedly,

41
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,550
they all used me.

42
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,880
That's not true.

43
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,550
When Leimo was dying, he asked me

44
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,600
to say sorry to you for him.

45
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,480
He said,

46
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,510
actually he has always regarded you as a good friend.

47
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,110
Yes, friend.

48
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,920
From now on,

49
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,040
you are my friend.

50
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,950
I will never

51
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,040
let anyone bully you.

52
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,070
I see.

53
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,390
Believe it or not. I can write a letter

54
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,070
to divorce you right now.

55
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,760
You can do it.

56
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,950
As long as I'm your wife,

57
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,230
I must save you.

58
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,110
As your wife,

59
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,480
the most important thing is being loyal to you.

60
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,270
Trust me.

61
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,720
Thank you.

62
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,320
What?

63
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,230
I say...

64
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,390
What do you unruly people want to do?

65
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,230
Step aside.

66
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,390
Hey, miss,

67
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,040
Without your help,

68
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,070
I really thought there's a ghost.

69
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,480
I didn't dare to come out to do business.

70
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,670
This is a small gift for you.

71
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,350
Thank you.

72
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,720
Hey. Just say it.

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,230
Don't touch her.

74
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:20,950
OK.

75
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,440
Miss,

76
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,000
you are so amazing.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,830
We all know.

78
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,830
This is a gift for you.

79
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,760
Please accept it.

80
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,320
Thank you.

81
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,480
Everybody, let's give our applause to this heroine.

82
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,550
OK.

83
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,270
Girl,

84
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:40,830
when you grow up,

85
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,320
be as amazing as this lady.

86
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,950
Hey. Listen.

87
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,830
You were amazing this time.

88
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,600
Cool!

89
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,270
Thank you.

90
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,720
What are you laughing about?

91
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,600
You, Zhao Cuo, who have declared yourself to be a bully young master,

92
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,070
can actually say thank you.

93
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,670
What are you laughing about?

94
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,510
Are you ready?

95
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,550
What do you mean?

96
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,110
Come in.

97
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,320
There's something wrong with you.

98
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,160
I didn't go into the wrong room.

99
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,270
You did that.

100
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,790
Didn't you say that

101
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,830
anyone who wants to be your friend,

102
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,040
should indulge in eating, drinking, gambling and frequenting brothels?

103
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,270
Do you think I'm OK?

104
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,640
You, a woman, came here to gamble?

105
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,320
Go, go, go!

106
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,920
Leave here! Leave here!

107
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,000
Go, go, go!

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,670
Look!

109
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,760
If I can't lose all the money today,

110
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,670
I won't leave.

111
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,230
OK.

112
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,670
Bet!

113
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,920
If anyone who teaches me well,

114
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,230
I'll give this gold bar to him.

115
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,640
OK.

116
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,159
Let me.

117
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:53,920
Let me teach you.

118
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,670
Let me. Let me.

119
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,790
You are a girl.

120
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,830
You don't need to understand men's entertainments.

121
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,280
Oh, you are right.

122
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,440
Hey, man.

123
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,110
My name is Sanqi. I'm passing through this place.

124
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,710
I want to make a friend with you.

125
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,520
OK?

126
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,670
I heard you are the No.1 gambler in the southern city.

127
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,230
Unfortunately,

128
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,320
I'm the No.1 god of gambling in the southern city.

129
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,030
Let's play to see who is better, OK?

130
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,080
So ugly.

131
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,400
Ho!

132
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,640
So you

133
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,080
just pretend to be the No.1 gambler to fool people

134
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,280
and dare not accept the challenge?

135
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,760
Naive.

136
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,440
You are afraid?

137
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,440
Man,

138
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,320
you talk arrogantly.

139
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,670
I, the No.1 gambler in the southern city,

140
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,550
will see how amazing you are.

141
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,910
Excuse me.

142
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,230
What did you say?

143
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,880
Hey...

144
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,470
What?

145
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,590
I miss you.

146
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,080
Ahhh!

147
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,710
Nothing happened between us.

148
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,200
Don't misunderstand me.

149
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,110
That's good.

150
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,400
What do you mean by that?

151
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,880
Hey.

152
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,110
Why did you go to my bed after getting drunk?

153
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,550
Ah?

154
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,440
Didn't you sleep on the floor where I sleep?

155
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,760
Oh.

156
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,080
Thank you.

157
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,760
Huh?

158
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,840
I mean

159
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,710
thank you for saving my life.

160
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,520
You can ask me to do something,

161
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,110
as long as I can do it.

162
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,080
So I won't owe you.

163
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,760
But don't get me wrong.

164
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,640
I just don't hate you that much.

165
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,520
If you do get me wrong,

166
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,110
I can do nothing about it.

167
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,230
Oh, you're welcome.

168
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,150
Huh? What did you say just now?

169
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,080
I said

170
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
thank you for saving my life.

171
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,910
You can ask me to do something.

172
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,960
So I won't owe you.

173
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,670
But don't get me wrong.

174
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,590
I just don't hate you that much.

175
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,520
If you do get me wrong,

176
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,000
I can do nothing about it.

177
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,760
I can ask you to do something?

178
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,080
Yes.

179
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,280
Anything is OK?

180
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,520
OK.

181
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,280
Give me the tally with your Eight Characters.

182
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,790
I can't.

183
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,230
Then,

184
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,960
go on a date with me.

185
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Date?

186
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,760
Yes.

187
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,280
Didn't you say anything is OK?

188
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,520
OK.

189
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,640
Then it's settled.

190
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,400
See you tonight.

191
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,760
OK.

192
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,230
Young Master, Young Lady,

193
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,760
it's time to get up and have breakfast.

194
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,320
Coming.

195
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,840
Young Lady, look.

196
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,590
Thread the needle from here

197
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,520
and then tie a knot.

198
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,640
Oh, I see.

199
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,110
Young Lady,

200
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,030
things like sewing clothes for Young Master

201
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,150
can be done by the servants.

202
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,030
I want to sew for him myself.

203
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,520
Young Master,

204
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,910
what are you doing here?

205
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,880
Why are you scratching the tree?

206
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm enjoying the flowers.

207
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,230
Enjoying the flowers

208
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,230
Where are the flowers?

209
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,320
Eh. But it's strange.

210
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,960
Why hasn't this tree bloomed this year?

211
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,790
Weird.

212
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,640
No!

213
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,670
No!

214
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,880
No!

215
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,110
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

216
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,350
I'm by your side.

217
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,080
I'm leaving.

218
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,880
Will you come back?

219
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:09,670
Look.

220
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,880
When it's the eighth time the cherry blossom tree comes into flower

221
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,150
and the petals fly all over the sky,

222
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,960
I'll be back.

223
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,550
Young Master,

224
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,960
you've been walking back and forth here

225
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,670
for two hours.

226
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,520
Go away!

227
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,080
Don't bother me.

228
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,520
How about you take a break?

229
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,840
I'll ask someone to bring some light refreshments for you.

230
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,310
Walk after eating, OK?

231
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,069
I don't want to eat.

232
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,800
Go!

233
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh.

234
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,040
Well.

235
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,800
I'll go and talk to her.

236
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,069
The cherry blossom tree came into flower.

237
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,640
It actually came into flower.

238
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,400
Wow! How beautiful they are!

239
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,040
Why are you wearing a veil?

240
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh. I caught a cold

241
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,680
and I can't be exposed to wind.

242
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,190
Why

243
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,710
are you here alone?

244
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,680
You are unhappy today?

245
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,710
I want to go to the fair to see the fireworks at the Peach Blossom Festival.

246
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,920
But my dad doesn't allow me to go.

247
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,830
You like fireworks?

248
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,310
Yes.

249
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,590
Come with me.

250
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,950
I'll take the "fireworks" off for you.

251
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,310
Hey,

252
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,040
where are you taking me?

253
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,040
We'll arrive soon.

254
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,190
Look. These are the "fireworks" for you.

255
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,950
When you see the fireflies all over the sky,

256
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,950
can you think of

257
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,310
the promise we made before?

258
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,230
When it's the eighth time the cherry blossom tree comes into flower

259
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,070
and the petals fly all over the sky,

260
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,160
I'll be back.

261
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,560
Hey, Young Master.

262
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,160
Wet Nurse Ling.

263
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,430
What are you going to do so early in the morning?

264
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,040
Wet Nurse Ling.

265
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,710
Have you seen He Jinxin?

266
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,230
No.

267
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,400
Oh, no.

268
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,190
Something is going to happen.

269
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,230
Wet Nurse Ling, I've something to do.

270
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,760
I'm leaving.

271
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,950
Give the food to Ahu.

272
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,400
No. Alas.

273
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,040
Without having my breakfast, I specially bought it for you.

274
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,920
Naughty child.

275
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,190
She is not a fool.

276
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,880
How could she wait here all night?

277
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,280
Zhao Cuo!

278
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,760
Yes.

279
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,350
Ah. It's a little far.

280
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,640
Where did you go?

281
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,640
I...

282
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,920
You waited here all night?

283
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,430
Yes.

284
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,040
Are you a fool?

285
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,520
You waited all night by the river.

286
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,000
Do you know how dangerous it is?

287
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,760
Why didn't you go home?

288
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,880
Didn't we agree to meet here?

289
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,950
And this is our first date.

290
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,070
It's very important to me.

291
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,160
But I knew you definitely would come.

292
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,760
So...

293
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,800
Here you are.

294
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,710
This is your favorite pancake.

295
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,920
I bought it early in the morning.

296
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,400
It took me a long time to find it.

297
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,350
With it covered, I came all the way here.

298
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,110
It is not cold.

299
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,830
Eat it when it is still warm.

300
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,280
What's wrong with you?

301
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,950
I'm cold.

302
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,800
Keep me warm.

303
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,920
Zhao, Zhao Cuo.

304
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,760
Yes.

305
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,520
You can get warm after eating the pancake.

306
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,880
What time is it now?

307
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,590
Go home.

308
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,680
Hey.

309
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,000
Why did you want to see me at the riverside yesterday?

310
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,880
Hey.

311
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
He Jinxin.

312
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,680
If you give me the tally with your Eight Characters,

313
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,800
I'll tell you.

314
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,520
What do you want to do this time?

315
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,880
We've been like this.

316
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
So it's the time.

317
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
What?

318
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,830
Do I need to say this?

319
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,640
According to the rule of our village,

320
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,880
after we do this, if we don't exchange the tallies with Eight Characters,

321
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,430
we'll be caught, put into the basket for pigs, and soaked in water.

322
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,680
Really?

323
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,190
Yes.

324
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,470
In this case,

325
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,590
I have to give you the tally with my Eight Characters.

326
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,280
Really?

327
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,400
Yes.

328
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,230
The thing you want is inside.

329
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,110
But you can't open it now.

330
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,950
A silk bag again.

331
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,680
Why do people in the city

332
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,280
like giving silk bags so much?

333
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,470
When can I open it?

334
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,680
A month later again?

335
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,280
No need.

336
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,230
Just wait until I leave.

337
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,710
OK.

338
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,160
Zhao Cuo,

339
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,920
I'll know the answer soon.

340
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,070
If it's not you,

341
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,560
I won't play with you, Zhao Cuo.

342
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,310
Stupid Zhao Cuo!

343
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,350
You played a trick on me again!

344
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,800
Be obedient.

345
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,880
Don't scream.

346
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,560
Come on.

347
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,280
My dad owes you the money, not I.

348
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,230
Why do you come to me?

349
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,880
I don't have money.

350
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,560
Cut the crap!

351
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,430
Or I'll slap you.

352
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
Go ahead.

353
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,520
Ah!

354
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,800
Help!

355
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,950
Somebody!

356
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,350
Hey!

357
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,160
Help!

358
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,230
You guys, stop.

359
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,520
You are burly.

360
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,880
Why are you bullying a weak woman?

361
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,310
She is weak?

362
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,560
Man,

363
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,470
do you have poor eyesight?

364
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,400
Hey!

365
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,760
Didn't you see we fell in love at first sight?

366
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,590
Why did you cut in?

367
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,280
You stupid extra.

368
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,800
Is an extra not a human?

369
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Take this woman away!

370
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,110
Ah!

371
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,710
Stop!

372
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,590
You want to fight, right?

373
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,800
Head.

374
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,400
Do you want to continue?

375
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:45,950
You are not leaving?

376
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,430
Sir.

377
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,040
Thank you for saving me.

378
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,070
I'll keep your kindness in mind.

379
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,430
It's a small thing. Don't mention it.

380
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,760
Wait. May I

381
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,000
know your name?

382
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,760
How many people are there in your family?

383
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,590
How large is your field?

384
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,430
How many cattle do you have?

385
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,950
Here is the most important question: Have you been married?

386
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,470
No.

387
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,280
Ah. Great!

388
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,350
I haven't been married either.

389
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,710
Bye.

390
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,000
Stop there!

391
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,830
Stop there!

392
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,350
Hey.

393
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:29,920
It hurts. It hurts.

394
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,950
It's you.

395
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,640
Ah!

396
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,070
What a coincidence!

397
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,040
Do you know him?

398
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,470
Yes, yes.

399
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,350
Really?

400
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,430
What's your relationship?

401
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,950
He, he, he is my uncle.

402
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,640
Great.

403
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,590
I feel he likes me.

404
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,680
Tell him.

405
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
I can be your aunt.

406
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,830
Really?

407
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,590
I'm going to bring him here for you.

408
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,280
Wait for me.

409
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,680
Wait. Wait.

410
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,760
I haven't finished yet.

411
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,280
Hey!

412
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,560
Wait for me.

413
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,800
Do you know that psycho?

414
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,070
Yes.

415
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:09,880
Right.

416
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,560
Don't fool me.

417
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,190
Give me the tally with your Eight Characters.

418
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,560
Do you want to be my wife so much?

419
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,640
Being my wife

420
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,070
is not something simple.

421
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,160
Wow!

422
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,190
These are the "fireworks"

423
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,470
I wanted to catch with you last night.

424
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,230
Hey!

425
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,710
Fireworks?

426
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,110
Catch fireflies.

427
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,190
Where are fireworks?

428
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,190
Come over and catch them.

429
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,160
Over there! Over there!

430
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:36,800
What is fun

431
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,190
about catching a small insect?

432
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,280
A small insect?

433
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,880
Didn't catch fireflies for me when we were kids?

434
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,110
What are you talking about?

435
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,560
Eh?

436
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,280
When we were kids?

437
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,950
Forget it.

438
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,310
It seems he has lost memory.

439
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,520
Don't move.

440
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,280
There is a firefly here.

441
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,160
Well.

442
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,950
Huh?

443
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,230
Nothing.

444
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,110
Oh.

445
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,520
Well.

446
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,190
Huh?

447
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,070
Actually, I...

448
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,710
Sanqi.

449
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,350
Mr. Bai.

450
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,160
Sanqi,

451
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,950
you are finally back.

452
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,830
Hey, Just Face,

453
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,830
why are you in my home in the middle of the night?

454
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,520
The decoration of our home is better than that of yours.

455
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,590
What have you been doing these days?

456
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:05,830
What has she been doing?

457
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,350
Does it have anything to do with you?

458
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,430
Have you been busy

459
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,920
doing anything these days?

460
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,920
Yes, she has.

461
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,680
But it has nothing to do with you.

462
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,640
I'm here to see you

463
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,680
because there are suspicious cases

464
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,800
I want to discuss with you.

465
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,560
Hypocritical.

466
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,110
Disgusting.

467
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,040
Nasty.

468
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,230
Zhao Cuo.

469
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,710
Yes?

470
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,160
I'm talking to Sanqi.

471
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,400
It has nothing to do with you.

472
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,760
I'm telling you.

473
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,800
It has something to do with me.

474
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,430
Address me.

475
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,590
Young Master.

476
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,560
Not this.

477
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,760
Call me darling.

478
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,230
Listen. I'm telling you.

479
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,000
She's not my servant girl.

480
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,430
Her name is He Jinxin.

481
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,430
She is my wife

482
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,830
I married in an open, correct manner.

483
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,470
Before, we joked around.

484
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,920
Now you have known, right?

485
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,880
So whether in the middle of the night

486
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,680
or not,

487
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,800
don't come to my home,

488
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,710
let alone see her.

489
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:09,320
The gate is over there.

490
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,870
I won't walk you there.

491
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,909
Hey, Mr. Bai.

492
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,280
Let's talk about the case...

493
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,870
Ah! Let's talk about it later.

494
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,040
He Jinxin?

495
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,520
Go!

496
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,800
Let go of me!

497
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,389
Let go of me!

498
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,150
Ouch.

499
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,320
Li Jia!

500
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,320
Coming, Young Master.

501
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,870
Pour the tea.

502
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,670
Honey, drink it.

503
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,280
Li Jia,

504
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,630
bring a basin of hot water for her to wash feet.

505
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,630
Young Lady?

506
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,910
Did I mishear?

507
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,190
Raise your hips up.

508
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,560
Oh.

509
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,120
Higher.

510
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,760
Higher.

511
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,390
Go!

512
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,120
I'll go. I'll go.

513
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,840
What are you doing?

514
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'm making a bed on the floor.

515
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,040
From today on, you sleep on the bed.

516
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,390
What about you?

517
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,870
I'll sleep on the floor.

518
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:53,870
Why?

519
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,520
From now on,

520
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,630
don't pretend to be my servant girl anymore.

521
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,280
Ask the servants to do the things

522
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,430
they should do.

523
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:02,910
You

524
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,430
just need to be my wife.

525
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,950
Are you sure you are Zhao Cuo?

526
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,800
Yes, I am.

527
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,630
Are you sure you are not sick?

528
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,560
I'm healthy.

529
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,870
Did he think of anything?

530
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,230
Besides,

531
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,040
I failed to keep an appointment last time.

532
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,870
Except for the tally with my Eight Characters,

533
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,630
I promise to give you whatever you want.

534
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,950
OK.

535
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,560
Since you don't give me that,

536
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,320
let me see your birthmark.

537
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,520
I want to take a bath with you.

538
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,670
Isn't this too fast?

539
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,080
Boss,

540
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:07,000
is there any flower

541
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,710
which smells really good after soaking in water?

542
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,080
Huh?

543
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,670
Is there any flower

544
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,950
which smells really good after soaking in water?

545
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,870
Chrysanthemum has good effects of clearing heat and detoxicating.

546
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,800
It tastes good.

547
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,230
I mean the flower

548
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,910
which can create romantic atmosphere

549
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,710
when two people have a bath together.

550
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,360
Oh. You are going to have a bath with someone?

551
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,080
If so,

552
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,870
I suggest you use rose and puncture vine.

553
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,870
You can put some candles nearby.

554
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,630
They not only help create good atmosphere, but also can strengthen your yang qi.

555
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,280
Young man, are you suffering kidney deficiency?

556
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,230
Ah, yes.

557
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,320
Pack it up.

558
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,840
My young master is not very well.

559
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,040
Hurry.

560
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,120
If you are suffering kidney deficiency,

561
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,670
this will definitely help.

562
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,950
My young master is not very well,

563
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:02,470
not me.

564
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,230
Don't worry.

565
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,280
You definitely will be fine.

566
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:05,760
I...

567
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,280
My...

568
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,430
Right. My young master definitely will be fine.

569
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,040
You'll be fine.

570
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,630
Yes.

571
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,390
Isn't that Mr. Bai's house?

572
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,280
How come they have kites with grimace totem?

573
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,120
Yes.

574
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,870
No.

575
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,320
Yes.

576
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,600
Young Master,

577
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,320
why do you keep saying yes and no?

578
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,950
If you are really bothered

579
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,150
by taking a bath with Young Lady,

580
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,390
you can just talk to her.

581
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,120
Tell me.

582
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,800
Is He Jinxin attracted by

583
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,710
my handsome appearance

584
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,390
or by

585
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,040
my unconventional and unrestrained characters?

586
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:00,870
Be honest.

587
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,870
Don't be afraid to hurt me.

588
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,840
Well.

589
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:06,950
Women

590
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,150
are all too superficial.

591
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,950
I have both.

592
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,760
I can do nothing about it.

593
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,560
It bothers me.

594
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,910
OK. Young Master,

595
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,710
you can go on.

596
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,950
I'm leaving.

597
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,470
Come back.

598
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,000
He Jinxin is so shameless.

599
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,430
She covets my beauty and is justified.

600
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,230
She even wants to have a bath with me.

601
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,190
It really bothers me.

602
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,190
Young Master,

603
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,390
with all due respect,

604
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,040
you are not bothered.

605
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,230
You like her.

606
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,280
That's not true.

607
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:55,630
Because,

608
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,670
because, I want to thank her

609
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,950
for saving my life.

610
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,080
Right.

611
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,150
So you'll give your body to her.

612
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,040
Yes.

613
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,630
Young Master, it is almost ready.

614
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,040
Wow! This is...

615
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,950
A big scene, Young Master.

616
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,470
Go for it tonight.

617
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,630
What have you done?

618
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,150
Huh!

619
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,870
Spread them evenly.

620
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,800
Spread them evenly.

621
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,910
You didn't do it right.

622
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,710
You should do it like this.

623
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:35,190
There.

624
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,280
Well. He is so stubborn.

625
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,950
He keeps up appearance to cover up his predicament.

626
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,230
Young Master, you don't need all these drawings?

627
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,080
Let them fly to the sky with the kites.

628
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,910
Cut them off

629
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,710
and let them go with the wind.

630
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,120
Yes, Young Master.

631
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,320
Someone is iridescent.

632
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,320
Only when you meet her can you know.

633
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,190
You were like a draught coming unintentionally,

634
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,320
but triggered torrential flood.

635
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,470
Just let the past go with the wind.

636
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,230
All go with the wind.

637
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,760
What's wrong with Young Master?

638
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,320
You can't tell?

639
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,840
Young Master is crossed in love.

640
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,520
Isn't Young Master

641
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,120
the bright moonlight in the heart of the girls in the northern city?

642
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,710
How could he be crossed in love?

643
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,520
Well, you don't understand.

644
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,360
Young Master is very special.

645
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,950
Either he doesn't fall in love,

646
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,470
or he takes a fancy to somebody's wife.

647
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,040
Oh.

648
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,470
Hey, are we speaking ill of Young Master

649
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,600
behind him?

650
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,600
Yes.

651
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,000
Never mind that

652
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,760
you are talking bad things behind me.

653
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,950
You are actually talking so loud.

654
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,670
I'm already very painful.

655
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,190
I'm...

656
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,950
I'm sorry.

657
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,560
It really hurts.

658
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,430
Don't...

659
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,230
Which part hurts?

660
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:36,950
Have you taken medicine?

661
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,520
Aren't you medicine?

662
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:41,760
Huh?

663
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,630
Jinxin,

664
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,870
why are you here?

665
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,430
Oh.

666
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,000
Is Zhao Cuo here?

667
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,520
Where is he?

668
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,000
Zhao Cuo and I are incompatible as fire and water.

669
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,150
Why do you think he's here?

670
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,080
I saw his kites in the sky,

671
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,150
so I came here.

672
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,470
I didn't expect they are kept here.

673
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,520
His kites?

674
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,040
Everything here belongs to me.

675
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,150
How come there are his kites?

676
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,230
What?

677
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,870
These kites are yours?

678
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,390
Yes.

679
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,390
So you drew

680
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:19,870
the pictures on them?

681
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,190
Yes, I drew them myself.
