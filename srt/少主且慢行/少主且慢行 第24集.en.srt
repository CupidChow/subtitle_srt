[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,900
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,060
Episode 24

4
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,120
Lord,

5
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,080
this is a list based on the letters.

6
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,039
I didn't expect that

7
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,830
so many people

8
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,870
colluded secretly with my brother.

9
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,950
What are you going to do?

10
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,550
After all, it hasn't happened yet.

11
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,510
If we deal with him,

12
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,830
Taoyuan City will be in chaos.

13
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,470
It's urgent.

14
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,800
Ruoyao, Yifei, Commander Zhang,

15
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,030
go out of the city overnight

16
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,079
with my tiger-shaped tally and this list

17
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,750
to meet General Li.

18
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,520
Make sure to give him this list.

19
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,440
Control those people

20
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,320
on this list

21
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
early tomorrow morning

22
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,470
to avoid sanguinary conflict.

23
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,550
Yes.

24
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,220
Go.

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Be careful.

26
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,190
Lord.

27
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,160
Stand up first.

28
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,800
What's the matter,

29
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,470
Lord?

30
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:18,520
Well,

31
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,390
Considering my health,

32
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,880
I'm afraid that I'll die soon.

33
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,600
I asked you here to

34
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,600
make arrangement for the future.

35
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,270
Lord.

36
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,470
You don't have to say anything.

37
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,630
You're my elder brother

38
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,320
and Zhen's uncle.

39
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,000
Zhen is still young.

40
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:47,900
After I die,

41
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,470
I hope you can help him

42
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,300
as Deputy Lord.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,520
Yes.

44
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,320
I'll try my best to the end of my days

45
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,800
to assist him in managing Taoyuan City.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,100
I'm rest assured to hear that.

47
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,060
But I heard that

48
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,350
you've done many things

49
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,459
without telling me.

50
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,660
I never hide anything from you.

51
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,980
In this case,

52
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,580
just tell me the truth.

53
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,100
I wonder

54
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,180
what you mean.

55
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,100
What do you want me to confess?

56
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,720
You told me

57
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,060
a lie, right?

58
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,020
Obviously, you've recovered,

59
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,620
but you lied to me that you are going to die.

60
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,860
Don't you know my health?

61
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:01,860
Huh?

62
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,180
As long as you're captured without fighting back,

63
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,420
I'll let you go

64
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,260
for the sake of brotherhood.

65
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,820
It'll be alright

66
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,100
as long as you promise to change.

67
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,180
No more words.

68
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,320
Just catch him.

69
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,900
Humph.

70
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,020
Why are you laughing?

71
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,820
I laugh at you as you think you've made it.

72
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,420
However, it isn't what you think.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,720
Everything is

74
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,180
in my master's hands.

75
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,300
Skin mask.

76
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,660
You're his guardian.

77
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,020
You sound quite like him.

78
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,140
It seems that he has attracted many talented people.

79
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,540
Tell me.

80
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,340
Where is that villain?

81
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,260
To tell the truth,

82
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,160
Lord,

83
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,720
Deputy Lord has recognized

84
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,220
your trick long ago,

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,790
but he did nothing

86
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,670
to see

87
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,320
what you will do.

88
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,940
Humph. He is

89
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,230
really disappointed

90
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,260
at your trick.

91
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
Moreover,

92
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,200
think about it, Lord.

93
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,040
Do you think that

94
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,230
those who he has supported for over a decade

95
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,390
will betray him because of your words?

96
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,020
Huh?

97
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,659
How naïve!

98
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,220
Listen.

99
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,620
We have captured

100
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,580
your soldiers.

101
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,380
Don't make a false show of strength here.

102
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,620
If he was aware of anything,

103
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,060
he would have launched a mutiny

104
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,340
instead of sending you here.

105
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,880
But He Zhen

106
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,500
told him

107
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,820
the information.

108
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,500
He lets us down.

109
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,620
Indeed.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,920
I've sent someone

111
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,780
to capture you contact.

112
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,620
It's impossible

113
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,740
to rise in rebellion.

114
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,260
Whether you

115
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,940
believe it or not,

116
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,500
this is all I can tell you.

117
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,760
Take him away

118
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,950
and guard him sternly.

119
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,580
Yes.

120
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,380
I…

121
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,820
Dad,

122
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,420
please allow me

123
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,070
to lead soldiers to

124
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,460
confiscate his mansion.

125
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,460
Please close the city's gates.

126
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,420
Even if they ran away,

127
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,040
they won't be far away

128
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,900
in such a short time.

129
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,180
Stand up.

130
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,950
I thought

131
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,820
if he came here personally,

132
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,420
we could have a talk.

133
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,140
However, he was stubborn

134
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,140
and chose to

135
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,539
fight against me.

136
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,740
Son, go ahead.

137
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,540
Be careful.

138
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,740
Yes.

139
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,660
Let's go.

140
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,940
Go.

141
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,400
Lord,

142
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,740
will Zhao Cuo be alright?

143
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,900
Don't worry.

144
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,700
He'll be alright.

145
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,110
Search carefully.

146
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,500
Don't overlook even a corner.

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,820
If anyone resists,

148
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,910
capture him.

149
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,760
Yes.

150
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,460
Go.

151
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,470
Young Master,

152
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,030
neither Deputy Lord

153
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,280
nor anyone else

154
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,060
is in this mansion.

155
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,670
No grain, weapon

156
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,400
or men in black?

157
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,460
Yes. None.

158
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,940
Is there a secret room or path?

159
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,640
Well, yes or no?

160
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,380
No for the time being.

161
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,400
Search it carefully.

162
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,230
Yes. Follow me.

163
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,020
Follow me.

164
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,500
Young Master.

165
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,340
How is it going?

166
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,660
Nothing.

167
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,940
How come?

168
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,460
Well, Young Master,

169
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,710
there might be

170
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,980
no secret room at all.

171
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,060
And he really ran away.

172
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,060
Impossible.

173
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,380
He has planned for many years.

174
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,440
Without a secret room or path,

175
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,300
he wouldn't dare to run away in the daytime.

176
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,780
You're right.

177
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,880
It should be hollow down here.

178
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,940
There must be a secret room and path.

179
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,180
Get torches.

180
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,060
You're Zhao Cuo.

181
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,740
Yes, it's me.

182
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,380
As expected, you're here.

183
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,440
Don't talk nonsense.

184
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,080
Just be captured.

185
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
You're my uncle.

186
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,260
I don't want to hurt you.

187
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,980
What?

188
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,590
This is my place.

189
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,620
How dare you say that!

190
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,150
Just play your tricks

191
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,140
if you have any.

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,260
I'll deal with them.

193
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,380
You're young

194
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,300
and impulsive.

195
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,710
Such a person like you

196
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,700
shouldn't manage Taoyuan City.

197
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,400
No nonsense.

198
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,300
Fight, OK?

199
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,470
I said that

200
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,620
you were too impulsive.

201
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,280
It has been two hours,

202
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,790
but Zhao Cuo hasn't come back.

203
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,780
Don't worry.

204
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,300
Calm down.

205
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,020
Bad news!

206
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,340
What is it?

207
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,960
What's wrong?

208
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,350
Why hasn't Zhao Cuo come back?

209
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,320
We,

210
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,220
we were ambushed

211
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,780
at Wujianding.

212
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:05,820
Young Master,

213
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,840
Young Master was captured by them.

214
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,540
What?

215
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,020
This is a letter

216
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,740
they asked me to bring back.

217
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,400
See you

218
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,880
at Wujianding in one hour.

219
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,710
Otherwise,

220
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,150
you'll never see your son.

221
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,060
One hour.

222
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,380
It seems that

223
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,460
we have to move before Ruoyao and others come back.

224
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,880
My brother

225
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,670
knows well of our action.

226
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,540
We were careless.

227
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,080
Lord,

228
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,900
how about waiting for a while?

229
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,150
If we go to Wujianding now,

230
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,790
I'm afraid…

231
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,470
No. There isn't enough time.

232
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,470
Sanqi,

233
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,700
wait for Ruoyao here.

234
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,940
I'll save Zhao Cuo at Wujianding.

235
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,260
At most, save him at the cost of my life.

236
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,380
Where is your master?

237
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,020
He is waiting for you over there.

238
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,100
Zhao Cuo.

239
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,200
Don't worry about me.

240
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,320
Just send troops

241
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,540
to kill them here.

242
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,820
Humph.

243
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,580
Brother,

244
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,700
why have you plotted

245
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,060
just to be the lord?

246
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,820
We are brothers.

247
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,110
Do you

248
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,420
really want to

249
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,760
fight against me?

250
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,340
You even know that I'm your brother?

251
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,860
I should have been the lord

252
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,100
as the eldest son.

253
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,540
Why?

254
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,700
I didn't want to be the lord.

255
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,550
You know clearly why

256
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,100
dad abdicated in favor of me.

257
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,910
I don't want to know

258
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,300
what the dead old man thought.

259
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,790
Today I'm going to take back

260
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,660
what belongs to me.

261
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,700
So,

262
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,620
my brother,

263
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,140
it will make no difference

264
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,110
even if you know the truth

265
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,980
and find your own son.

266
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,230
Now you both are

267
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,140
at my mercy, right?

268
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,980
OK.

269
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,470
You can do whatever you want to me,

270
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,440
but

271
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,760
let go of my son.

272
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,910
I'll do whatever

273
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,180
you want me to do.

274
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,820
This is an imperial edict of abdication.

275
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,660
I've prepared it for you.

276
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,100
As long as you

277
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,380
abdicate the position of lord to He Zhen,

278
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,230
I may consider releasing Zhao Cuo.

279
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,030
Old man.

280
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,670
How dare you!

281
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,550
Dad,

282
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,380
don't trust him.

283
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,640
Son.

284
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,300
Son.

285
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,700
You don't have a say here.

286
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,020
Have you decided it?

287
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,230
Which one do you want,

288
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,640
your son's life or the position of lord.

289
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,579
Let him go.

290
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,180
I'll listen to you.

291
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,780
I've done as you told me.

292
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,300
Can I take my son away?

293
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,780
I'll rest assured

294
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,950
after killing you.

295
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,540
You.

296
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,500
Stop.

297
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,420
Sanqi.

298
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,700
You're Tian Sanqi?

299
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,310
You saw through He Zhen

300
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,700
and my plan?

301
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,220
So what?

302
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,300
You're really clever.

303
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,660
What a pity!

304
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,540
He Zhen.

305
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,300
She caused it. Kill her

306
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,620
to show your loyalty.

307
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,740
He Zhen.

308
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,300
He Zhen,

309
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,220
I told you that our great plan

310
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,180
should come first, right?

311
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,470
Don't destroy our plan

312
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,500
because of love.

313
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,580
However,

314
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,310
because of her,

315
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,310
you lost judgment

316
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,350
and became softhearted,

317
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,800
which made our plan

318
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,620
like this today.

319
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,020
So

320
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,220
kill her.

321
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,540
But you said

322
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,700
you would let her go

323
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,620
as long as I helped you.

324
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,700
Let her go?

325
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,020
He Zhen,

326
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,540
I give you a chance

327
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,190
to kill her personally

328
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,640
to cut your last thought.

329
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,350
Thus,

330
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,220
you won't be hesitant in the future.

331
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,180
Kill her.

332
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,980
What?

333
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,420
Don't you want to kill her?

334
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
He Zhen,

335
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,880
do you still want to

336
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,920
be a puppet controlled by him

337
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,820
all your life?

338
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,740
Is the life I give you not good enough?

339
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,110
You'll be the young lord

340
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,830
and the lord of Taoyuan City in the future.

341
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,920
So many people

342
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,430
want such a life.

343
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,220
What else do you want?

344
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,260
Kill her.

345
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,780
He Zhen.

346
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,020
He Zhen.

347
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,860
He Zhen.

348
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,760
Are you crazy, He Zhen?

349
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,500
He Zhen.

350
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,420
He Zhen.

351
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,190
Brother,

352
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,060
lead me to see the real firework

353
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,100
in the city in the future, OK?

354
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,520
OK.

355
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,180
I will show you fireworks spreading in the sky.

356
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,700
OK. Deal.

357
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,260
He Zhen,

358
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,880
do you really want to betray me

359
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,420
for this woman?

360
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,780
I do it for myself.

361
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,980
Since the day you selected me,

362
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,580
I have had no will

363
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,900
or freedom.

364
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,660
I'm just a part of your plan.

365
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,660
It is the same to

366
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,580
both Wumeng and me.

367
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,830
I don't care if

368
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,500
I can be the young lord.

369
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,760
I just want to be

370
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,180
a really free man.

371
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,620
How ungrateful!

372
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,100
You betrayed me for her, right?

373
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,900
Just watch me killing her.

374
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:29,980
He Zhen,

375
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,620
why do you…

376
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,700
At least,

377
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,300
at least,

378
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,140
I was your brother for a day.

379
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,500
As your brother,

380
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,380
I should keep my promise

381
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,460
to protect you.

382
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,620
Hurry up. I'll bind up for you.

383
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,900
No need, Sanqi.

384
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,260
Sanqi,

385
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,020
I've spent

386
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,020
my life in shadow.

387
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,540
I'm so glad to see you now.

388
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,420
I'm so glad to meet you.

389
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,740
You know what?

390
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,020
The happiest time in my life

391
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,860
is when we watched

392
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,540
fireflies together.

393
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,640
I know

394
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,470
I've made many

395
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,260
mistakes my life,

396
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,800
but at least

397
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,470
I did a right thing today,

398
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,100
right?

399
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,300
Don't cry.

400
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,660
Sanqi.

401
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,060
Sorry.

402
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,500
No.

403
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:30,980
No.

404
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,620
Kill them.

405
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,260
Even if

406
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,190
I die here today,

407
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,460
I won't let you leave alive.

408
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,780
Why?

409
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,100
Kite. Let's go.

410
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,310
Young Master has got married.

411
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,400
When will you give me your name ring?

412
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,180
Well.

413
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:30,760
Ah.

414
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,340
Brother,

415
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,920
what's going on here?

416
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,780
It's lively today.

417
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,220
Don't you know it?

418
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,900
Are you new here?

419
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,800
Well, today

420
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,420
Young Lord

421
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,040
and Lady Jinyan

422
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,900
hold wedding ceremonies together.

423
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,710
Why does he

424
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,980
hold it in southern city?

425
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,310
It's a long story.

426
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,940
Well, in short,

427
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,560
Young Lord has suffered a lot.

428
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,000
He grew up

429
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,560
in southern city

430
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,420
and reunited with the lord recently.

431
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,110
So

432
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,760
with the special approval of the lord,

433
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,220
he can get married in southern city.

434
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,800
To come early is not as good as to come in time.

435
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,590
Brother, thanks,

436
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,520
I'll have a look around.

437
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,380
OK.

438
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,100
Sanqi,

439
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,580
back then when you

440
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,740
married me as He Jinxin,

441
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,580
it was a hasty wedding.

442
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,340
But now

443
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,620
I'll give you the perfect wedding in Taoyuan City.

444
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,620
I'll always be with you.

445
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,540
From today on,

446
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,000
they are couples.

447
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,500
Under the witness of their parents and relatives and all people,

448
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,110
from now on

449
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:28,260
they'll love each other forever.

450
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,780
Bow to Heaven and Earth.

451
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,980
Bow to parents.

452
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,260
Bow to each other.

453
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,060
Exchange name rings.

454
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,660
Ceremony is over.

455
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,500
Finally, we are married.

456
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:07,140
We are married.

457
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:47,060
Congratulations to Young Lord on inheriting the position of lord.

458
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,710
Long live Lord.

459
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,600
Long live Lady.

460
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,710
Long live Lord.

461
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,340
Long live Lady.

462
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,540
Smile.

463
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,700
Stand up.

464
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,190
Thank you, Lord.

465
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:18,300
Long live Lord.
