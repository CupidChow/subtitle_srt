00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:33,100
I've Fallen for You


3
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,060
Episode 23


4
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,160
Fa…father.


5
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,440
How dare you call me father?


6
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,240
You added poison to the decoction,


7
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,670
trying to kill me.


8
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,079
Did you know about the poison?


9
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,360
Luckily, Bai Yifei found that the decoction was poisonous.


10
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,240
Otherwise,


11
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,750
I'm afraid I can't stand here today.


12
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,630
So


13
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:51,440
you know it all.


14
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:53,470
Take him down.


15
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,080
Ah! Blood! There's blood.


16
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,670
You stupid servants!


17
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,440
Wait.


18
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:18,880
How come?


19
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:23,520
Just now I found the decoction had a peculiar smell.


20
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,670
And I saw Lord's face is not yellow


21
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,030
as that of common patient with lung disease.


22
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,720
Instead, his ophryon is black.


23
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,720
So I judged that


24
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,800
you were poisoned.


25
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,470
Darned.


26
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,000
Jinyan, ask your brother to come


27
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,470
to investigate it.


28
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,910
Father,


29
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,520
my brother He Zhen


30
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,030
is not your natural son.


31
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,910
Jinyan,


32
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,320
what are you saying?


33
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,600
I don't want to believe it either,


34
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,160
but it seems brother is indeed


35
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,880
a stranger who replaced the young lord


36
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,320
and came to your side.


37
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,790
Impossible.


38
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,550
This is impossible.


39
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,920
Commander Zhang asked me to give this to you.


40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,040
He said you would know seeing this.


41
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,720
Commander Zhang is still alive?


42
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,880
Yes.


43
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Eight years ago, he escorted Young Lord out of the city,


44
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,000
but met with assassination.


45
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,720
He survived in the end.


46
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,230
These years,


47
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,550
he has been secretly protecting Young Lord.


48
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,159
Where's he now?


49
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,320
He came back to the capital with us.


50
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,040
In order not to alert the enemy,


51
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,510
we can't let you meet now.


52
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,070
What do you think?


53
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,640
Lord, please keep calm.


54
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,720
Now we should


55
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,830
deal with the fake He Zhen.


56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,440
Don't try to struggle in vain.


57
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,720
I have trusted followers inside and outside the hall.


58
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,110
Though you're not my natural son,


59
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,830
you've called me father


60
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,270
for many years. I still have affection for you.


61
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,200
As long as you


62
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,110
cooperate with us honestly,


63
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,600
I won't be cruel to you.


64
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,160
Such being the case,


65
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,670
just ask what you want to know.


66
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:34,950
Sanqi,


67
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,720
it was found by you.


68
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,320
You ask him.


69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,480
Yes.


70
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,270
Can you tell us


71
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,040
your real name?


72
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,159
I don't have a name.


73
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,000
I've been named He Zhen


74
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,000
since I was picked.


75
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,200
Just call him He Zhen.


76
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,000
So


77
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,160
you're the real man in black.


78
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,600
How did you find that?


79
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,000
That day, in Shifang Village,


80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,920
we were ambushed.


81
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,640
Zhao Cuo stabbed the man in black on the right arm.


82
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,160
And I found by accident that


83
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,440
your right arm was also hurt.


84
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,830
What's wrong? What happened?


85
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,920
Are you all right?


86
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm fine.


87
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,720
Later,


88
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
I wanted to continue to track down the man in black.


89
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,950
You showed a strange attitude.


90
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,670
You're a girl.


91
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,600
Don't take the risk to continue to investigate it.


92
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,070
But…


93
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,600
Well.


94
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,440
It seemed you didn't want me


95
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,550
to continue to investigate it.


96
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,200
I became suspicious at that time.


97
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,920
But I didn't know


98
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,600
there was such a huge plot


99
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,880
behind you.


100
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,480
It's still imperfect.


101
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,270
Tell us.


102
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,000
Who cultivated you


103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,670
and sent you into the mansion?


104
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,270
Bring her in.


105
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,600
Your Highness. Your Highness.


106
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,950
Master either hit or abused you.


107
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,790
You were beaten black and blue by him.


108
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,510
Why are you still considering for him now?


109
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,830
Your Highness.


110
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,640
Consider for him?


111
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,440
Why should I keep him safe?


112
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,760
I hate him most in this life.


113
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,270
Weren't it for him, I could also


114
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,550
be a man openly,


115
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,350
and I wouldn't have to be


116
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,950
a shadow of someone else.


117
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,510
Such being the case, winner takes all.


118
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,200
You may just kill me.


119
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,670
Take her away.


120
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,070
Your Highness.


121
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,950
He Zhen,


122
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,270
I will spare you


123
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,350
as you used to call me father.


124
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,160
He Zhen,


125
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,520
if you once took Lord as your father,


126
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,400
please tell the truth


127
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,520
so that we can find out the chief plotter.


128
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,909
In this case, your father wouldn't be harmed again.


129
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,110
It's…it's Deputy Lord.


130
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,320
Deputy Lord?


131
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,080
He's not only the Deputy Lord of Taoyuan City,


132
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,910
but also the chief of the men in black,


133
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,030
the master of me and Wumeng.


134
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,440
How would it be him?


135
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,790
Since Lord sent Zhao Cuo


136
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,030
out of Lord's Mansion,


137
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,960
he has started to make the whole plan.


138
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,200
He knew you sent little Zhao Cuo to Shifang Village


139
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,400
in order to avoid the war.


140
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,110
Thus, he wanted to take this chance


141
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,710
to kill Zhao Cuo and replace him.


142
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,880
And he found me.


143
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,760
He sent me to follow him


144
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,200
to learn his every move,


145
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,640
so that I could replace him


146
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,280
without a flaw some day.


147
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,910
Tell me.


148
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,840
Do you want to be Young Lord of Taoyuan City?


149
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,400
I…I miss my dad and my mom.


150
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,350
Your parents have died.


151
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,400
From now on,


152
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,960
your name is He Zhen,


153
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,960
and your dad is Lord of Taoyuan City,


154
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,790
and your mom is


155
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,640
Lady of Taoyuan City.


156
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,590
As long as you listen to me,


157
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,710
you will become Lord of


158
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,400
Taoyuan City in the future.


159
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,320
Where are Taoyuan General and others?


160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,280
They're in southern city.


161
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,000
Their next stop should be Shifang Village.


162
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,000
Good.


163
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,080
You'll send this boy


164
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,440
to Shifang Village a few days later.


165
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,840
Got it.


166
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,470
So you're real.


167
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,200
I'm not in a dream.


168
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,440
See?


169
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,230
You will have to imitate


170
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,670
that boy in the future.


171
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,710
Remember. From today on,


172
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,760
you're him, and he's you.


173
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,470
I'll be waiting for you.


174
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,910
The old locust tree is the witness.


175
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,640
My main task


176
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,910
was to observe and imitate Zhao Cuo.


177
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,640
But I envied him so much.


178
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,280
I envied him as he was carefree


179
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,550
and he could


180
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,350
have a good friend like you.


181
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,200
What about me?


182
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,960
I could only live in the shadow.


183
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,470
That's why


184
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,590
you know everything between him and me.


185
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,110
You know grimace totem.


186
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,640
You know the name ring.


187
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,150
You know that Zhao Cuo said


188
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,880
he would take the fireflies as fireworks


189
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,790
and show them to me.


190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,550
Because you said all those things,


191
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,840
I believed you.


192
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,520
Fireflies? Fireworks?


193
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,320
Didn't you get back all your memories?


194
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,280
But I really


195
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,080
don't remember this.


196
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,280
Why?


197
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,030
It's normal that he doesn't remember.


198
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,280
Because,


199
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,550
because it was not him


200
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,640
who went to catch fireflies


201
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,110
with you that day,


202
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,230
but me.


203
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,550
What?


204
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,230
Young Master just catches a cold,


205
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,280
so his body is a bit hot.


206
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,840
He'll be fine after taking some rest


207
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,960
and some medicine for two days.


208
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,150
Don't be worried.


209
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,200
I don't want to lie on bed.


210
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,320
I'm going to meet Sanqi.


211
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,000
She's waiting for me.


212
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:58,710
Young Master.


213
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,670
Why are you wearing a veil?


214
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,840
I catch a cold, so I can't be exposed to wind.


215
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,400
Well. Why were you sitting here alone?


216
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,790
I want to watch fireworks at the Peach Flower Festival in the fair,


217
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,550
but my dad doesn't let me go.


218
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,000
Do you like fireworks?


219
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,520
Yes.


220
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,710
Come with me.


221
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,280
I'm going to take the fireworks down for you.


222
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,710
Yes. I remember that


223
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,760
I was sick that day, so I didn't go to meet you.


224
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,110
Later, when I met you, you didn't mention it.


225
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,760
And I was young, so I forgot it.


226
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
Why did you do that?


227
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't have a friend all my life.


228
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,030
What about him?


229
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,710
He could always be with you.


230
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
I only had one chance


231
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
to stay alone with you.


232
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,910
That night


233
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,710
is the only time when


234
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,840
I truly felt happy in my life.


235
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,400
I won't forget it all my life.


236
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,030
Pitifully,


237
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,440
soon after,


238
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,840
Zhao Cuo received the order that he should go back to the capital.


239
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,030
From then on, I also left Shifang Village.


240
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,960
But you're a fake young lord after all.


241
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,320
You'll be exposed sooner or later.


242
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,230
Well, I have to say


243
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,000
it's because of my obsession for you.


244
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,320
No one expected that


245
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,910
it was you who found the flaw.


246
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,230
And Zhao Cuo,


247
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,230
the real Young Lord, has been living in Zhao's Mansion


248
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,200
and been together with you for so long.


249
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,230
You should feel happy.


250
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,670
If I didn't lose my memory,


251
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,080
you would have been found out early by me.


252
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,520
How did you know


253
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,760
Zhao Cuo's real identity?


254
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,440
I was about to take the throne.


255
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,640
For safety's sake,


256
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,960
Deputy Lord dug out


257
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,000
the body of Young Lord who was killed in Shifang Village.


258
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,760
The body was found to have a congenital deficiency of coccyx. Then he knew


259
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,590
that boy was just a substitute.


260
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,520
However,


261
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,590
they soon found


262
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,840
the person you were looking for


263
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,150
was the target of the men in black.


264
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,840
They followed your clue


265
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,320
to look for the real Young Lord.


266
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,440
But Wumeng took action


267
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,790
without telling me at the beginning,


268
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,550
so I didn't go out to look for you.


269
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,880
I see.


270
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,840
So they suspected Zhao Cuo


271
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,400
and Bai Yifei.


272
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,280
In the end,


273
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,760
they wanted to kill you all


274
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,030
as they would rather kill a wrong person than let go any suspected one.


275
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,880
That's why Qin Fang said he would kill the three of us


276
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,960
in Baifang County.


277
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,350
The men in black were the chief plotters


278
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,760
who wanted to kill us behind the three cases.


279
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,840
Yes.


280
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,000
Why did you kill


281
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,440
18-year-old young men in Shifang Village?


282
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,080
It's very simple.


283
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,000
As long as all children


284
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,590
who might see Zhao Cuo were killed,


285
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,080
no one in the world


286
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,280
has ever seen


287
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,350
the real Young Lord.


288
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,030
How dare you!


289
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,910
You actually killed the innocent for your own gain.


290
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,760
You can't be forgiven!


291
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Besides arranging you, a puppet,


292
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,640
to lurk by my side,


293
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,710
does my brother have any other plan?


294
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,400
As for plan,


295
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,000
he just let you take slow poison.


296
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,790
But


297
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,320
you have found it now.


298
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,400
In fact,


299
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,640
according to Deputy Lord's plan,


300
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,950
you would die in a few days.


301
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,680
There wouldn't be any flaw.


302
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:13,880
Let's put this aside.


303
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,310
How many troops, horses and army provisions


304
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,760
he has stored secretly all these years?


305
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,280
You should be clear about it.


306
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,680
Deputy Lord cultivated many trusted followers


307
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,710
at the court and in the army.


308
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,680
As long as something goes wrong,


309
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,230
these generals


310
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,040
will respond to him immediately.


311
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,350
Is there a name list?


312
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,680
There are letters.


313
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,640
They're in the bookcase behind.


314
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,230
The one on the bottom left.


315
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,000
The book at the bottom.


316
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,560
Commander Zhang,


317
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,710
take his tally away.


318
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,190
Got it.


319
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,350
I won't lock you up or kill you today.


320
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,520
Hope you'll cooperate with me.


321
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,230
You want to


322
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,520
catch Deputy Lord. Is that right?


323
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:51,880
As you said,


324
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,710
he cultivated many trusted followers.


325
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,000
From this list, I can see that


326
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,160
many important officials and appointed generals


327
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,950
of Taoyuan City are involved.


328
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,000
Once he rebels in desperation,


329
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,950
there will be a war in Taoyuan City,


330
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,310
and the people will eventually suffer.


331
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,590
I hope it can be solved


332
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,520
through a peaceful way.


333
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,560
You'll ask Deputy Lord


334
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,190
to my resting place early tomorrow morning.


335
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,470
Don't arouse his suspicion.


336
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,560
You'll make amends for your fault by good deeds.


337
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,800
He Zhen, if I am not wrong,


338
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,430
you knew Zhao Cuo's real identity


339
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,160
when you were


340
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,470
in southern city.


341
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,310
You could kill him at that time,


342
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,000
but you didn't.


343
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,640
So I know you have a good nature.


344
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,470
Oh, I've long wanted to kill him.


345
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,350
Why couldn't I bear to do it?


346
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,400
Really?


347
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,070
Yes.


348
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,640
I hate him.


349
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,710
I followed and imitated him since I was a child.


350
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,760
I'm just a shadow. Do you know?


351
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,590
All this


352
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,560
is caused by Zhao Cuo.


353
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,350
Why could he


354
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,950
be born to be Young Lord


355
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,590
while I could only be a puppet?


356
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,160
People can't decide


357
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,000
their birth.


358
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,470
Why can you ask me to do that?


359
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,160
Why should I consider


360
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,680
for you all?


361
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,950
Do you want me to do things for you?


362
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,110
I'm telling you. It's impossible.


363
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,920
I've said what I should say.


364
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,680
You may just kill me.


365
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,110
All you suffer


366
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,400
is not caused by Zhao Cuo,


367
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,920
but Deputy Lord.


368
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,230
Now it's time for you


369
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,070
to shed your puppet identity.


370
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,040
Think carefully about your life.


371
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,590
Do you really want to


372
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,350
end your life as a puppet?


373
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,230
Don't you want to live freely


374
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,110
with your own identity


375
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,430
in Taoyuan City?


376
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,110
Live a new life, He Zhen.


377
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:02,920
Okay.


378
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,640
I agree.


379
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,350
From 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. tomorrow,


380
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,710
I will take Deputy Lord


381
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,230
to Lord's resting place.


382
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,710
You'll stay here tonight.


383
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,680
Take Deputy Lord here


384
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,230
tomorrow morning.


385
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,230
Don't let me down.


386
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,400
Go.


387
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,880
Lord,


388
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,560
can I talk with He Zhen alone?


389
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,760
Hum. Go.


390
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,760
What do you want to say?


391
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,000
In fact,


392
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,190
I want to say thank you.


393
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,190
For what?


394
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,830
For catching the fireflies in the sky


395
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,190
to take them as fireworks for me.


396
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,800
But I am


397
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,280
not him after all.


398
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,350
You don't need to be him.


399
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,640
You are who you are.


400
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,310
After this matter,


401
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
live a life


402
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,560
with your own identity.


403
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,640
Is that you, my real son?


404
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,230
It's me, Lord.


405
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,000
Cuo,


406
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,680
call him dad.


407
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,680
Sorry for


408
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,470
making you adrift for years.


409
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,800
It's not tough to live outside,


410
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,880
because I have a good father.


411
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,190
Yeah. Yeah.


412
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,400
You have a good adopted father.


413
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,560
He's treated you as his own child all these years.


414
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,680
So we can meet today.


415
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,110
Well.


416
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,280
Cuo, go back to dress up.


417
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,430
I'll take you to a place.


418
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:48,830
Got it.


419
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,830
Do you have any accomplice?


420
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,830
He killed himself by taking poison.


421
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,350
Li Gan.


422
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,760
He had been protecting me at my side since childhood.


423
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,000
Why did he want to kill me in the end?


424
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,710
Before taking action tonight,


425
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,160
Lord had made a tight deployment.


426
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:14,880
He thought they are all


427
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,470
trusted followers beside.


428
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,070
Unexpectedly, this one was missed.


429
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,800
Trusted?


430
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,680
In this world,


431
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,350
I trusted my brother most.


432
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,430
Now what?


433
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,350
I exposed him in person.


434
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,070
What else do you think


435
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,280
is trustworthy in the world?


436
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,310
Ruoyao,


437
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,880
no matter who you are,


438
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,950
what identity you have,


439
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,350
I will trust you,


440
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:54,920
because you said


441
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,040
we are sincere to each other


442
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,000
and others are not important.


443
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,880
So I believe


444
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,760
you can believe


445
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,950
I like you.


446
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,070
We…


447
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,430
Bai Yifei.


448
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,430
Hum.


449
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,400
You're so chatty.


450
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,470
Your mom is waiting for you.


451
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,700
An old man


452
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,860
has two sons…


453
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,640
Mom.


454
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,310
Mom.


455
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,710
I'm back.


456
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,160
Cuo follows Lord to


457
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,470
to visit his mother.


458
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,800
Yeah.


459
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,920
Zhao Cuo has never met his mother


460
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,760
all these years.


461
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,310
I guess he has forgotten


462
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,230
what his mother looks like.


463
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,400
He should meet her.


464
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,430
Alas.


465
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,710
Alas.


466
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,310
Well, don't be sad.


467
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,950
Well,


468
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,190
you've supported Zhao Cuo for so many years.


469
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,310
You should know


470
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,950
his temperament and disposition. Right?


471
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,190
Though


472
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,470
he has got back his identity as Young Lord,


473
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,040
he won't forget you.


474
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,470
He said


475
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,400
you are the best father


476
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,230
in front of Lord today.


477
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:43,760
Is that right?


478
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,000
This gratifies me most.


479
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,520
Yes.


480
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,160
My Cuo


481
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,350
has grown up.


482
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,160
Hum.


483
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,230
Well, as the saying goes,


484
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,470
a son has to leave his parents


485
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,520
when he grows up.


486
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,070
Yes.


487
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,230
A good man should go far away from his home and aspire to a great career.


488
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,800
Yeah.


489
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,590
Luckily, at my side…


490
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,190
You have me.


491
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,350
Yes.


492
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,280
I have my Ling.


493
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,590
Ah.


494
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:19,830
My Ling.


495
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,710
Hum.


496
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,230
Look,


497
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,560
the moon is so beautiful tonight.


498
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,040
Well, is there moon tonight?


499
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,400
I know. It's in my eyes.


500
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,640
So shy.


501
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,000
My Ling.


502
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,040
To express my trust in you,


503
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,640
I will sleep with you


504
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,800
tonight.


505
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,400
This is


506
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,590
not good.


507
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,310
I ordered someone


508
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,470
to add a bed in the room.


509
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:14,080
What? I let you sleep in my room,


510
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,949
but you don't want to.


511
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:17,840
No.


512
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
I don't mean that.


513
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,320
So you mean after you saw


514
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,190
the colorful world


515
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,909
and the pretty girls on the street in the capital,


516
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:30,630
you don't want to


517
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,949
be with me anymore.


518
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,870
I don't mean that.


519
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:37,120
I…


520
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,870
That's enough.


521
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,080
Anyway,


522
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,670
after this matter, you'll be mine.


523
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,080
I also want to keep a man in a love nest.


524
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,800
Just live in my room.


525
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,190
I'm wondering how Zhao Cuo is now.


526
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,760
Zhao Cuo went to see his own mother.


527
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,520
He must be so happy.


528
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,280
And he has Sanqi.


529
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,150
You don't need to bother.


530
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,870
Well, I'm sleepy. Go.


531
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,520
It makes perfect sense.


532
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,430
Zhao Cuo grew up without a mother.


533
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,390
I didn't expect


534
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,670
he has gone through so much


535
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,360
and suffered so much.


536
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,910
Now you know it. Right?


537
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,000
And he'll be your good friend


538
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,600
as well as brother-in-law in the future.


539
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,840
I can't accept that


540
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,870
I am Zhao Cuo's brother-in-law.


541
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,040
Will you sleep or not?


542
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:56,910
Yes.


543
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,800
Come on.


544
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,390
Lady Jinyan, Mr. Bai,


545
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,630
Lord asks you


546
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,390
to wait in Taijing Hall.


547
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,870
He said there was something important to discuss later.


548
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,630
It must be very important.


549
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:11,800
Let's go.


550
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,430
Have you met your mother?


551
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,000
Hum.


552
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,630
This is the jade pendent for you from your mother.


553
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,390
I'm returning it to you now.


554
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,470
I've given it to you.


555
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,230
Don't give it back to me.


556
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:48,910
No need.


557
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,120
I have this bag with a doll you embroidered,


558
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,190
and that's enough.


559
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,150
Do you remember?


560
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,040
You said seeing this grimace


561
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,150
is like seeing you.


562
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,710
But it's indeed a bit ugly.


563
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,320
So give it back to me.


564
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,230
No, it's mine as you have given it to me.


565
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,630
Do you know?


566
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,470
After you left,


567
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,190
I thought I couldn't


568
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:24,910
meet you again in this life.


569
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,120
It won't happen.


570
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,430
I promised that


571
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,760
we would meet again.


572
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,520
Hum.


573
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,520
At that time, you already decided to come to the capital


574
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,430
to find out the truth, right?


575
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:40,950
Hum.


576
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,630
Why didn't you tell me?


577
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,280
What was the use of telling you?


578
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,430
You didn't remember anything.


579
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,280
And you were the target of the men in black.


580
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,360
I couldn't let you be in danger.


581
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,150
I said that I would


582
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,640
protect my little brother all my life.


583
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,670
Tian Sanqi, I warn you.


584
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,560
You can't do this again.


585
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,800
And,


586
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,430
I will protect you.
