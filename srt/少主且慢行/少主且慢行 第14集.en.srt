[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,120
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,080
Episode 14

4
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,080
Mr. Bai.

5
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,870
Mr. Bai.

6
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,190
What is Mr. Bai doing?

7
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,759
Yeah. Yeah.

8
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,630
Let's go.

9
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,630
Mr. He.

10
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,160
Mr. Bai.

11
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,800
What are you doing here?

12
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,910
I see. You're waiting for me.

13
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,830
No,

14
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,470
I don't.

15
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:15,960
Don't talk nonsense.

16
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,390
So who are you waiting for?

17
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,320
I'm waiting for…

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,470
Sunset.

19
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,190
Sunset is of infinite beauty except impending of dusk.

20
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,600
Sunset connects with the water edge. The whole sky is covered by the autumn scenery.

21
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,110
Sunset…

22
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,670
OK, go on waiting for the sunset.

23
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,550
I am leaving.

24
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,630
Hey, Mr. He.

25
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:40,600
So?

26
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,550
Excuse me,

27
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,440
where were you

28
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,160
these days?

29
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
Why did you stay out all night?

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,670
I went to inspect your northern city.

31
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,030
I went to inspect your northern city.

32
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,240
I didn't joke with you.

33
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,670
If so, you should go with me.

34
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,390
Well,

35
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,750
you're weak.

36
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,240
What if you met a robber outside

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,630
and he wanted to

38
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,600
bully you?

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,960
White Scrag,

40
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,720
what do you mean?

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,550
I'm a bold man.

42
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,190
Don't chatter.

43
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,830
Chatter?

44
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,110
I had been worrying about you.

45
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,160
Didn't you worry about me,

46
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,520
everyone of our Bai Mansion and Sanqi?

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,079
Well,

48
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,270
I need to do something,

49
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,440
so I'm leaving first.

50
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,190
My heart is beating fast.

51
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,360
You just get better.

52
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,800
Can't you go on having a good rest?

53
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,230
You're childish as before.

54
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,760
But I'm not a kid anymore.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,510
OK.

56
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,950
If so, I won't give you this candy.

57
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,760
If the medicine tastes bad,

58
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,920
you can't ask me for it.

59
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,040
Xuewei.

60
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,550
Yes.

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,200
Let's have a good chat.

62
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,600
OK.

63
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,350
Look.

64
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,000
After you left,

65
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,270
I always nicked the tree once a year.

66
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,790
I had done it for eight years.

67
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,070
I know you have been waiting for me

68
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,550
and even worrying that I wouldn't come back again.

69
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,480
But now

70
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,270
I stand before you.

71
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:05,720
I promise you

72
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,880
to stay with you

73
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,390
at any time in the future.

74
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,040
We've missed each other for eight years,

75
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,390
so we're no longer who we were.

76
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,230
Are you kidding?

77
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
Now we stand under this tree.

78
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,040
Everything is the same as before.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,600
I'm back.

80
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,510
Everything is the same.

81
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,230
Yeah.

82
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,790
I also thought that

83
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,480
as soon as you come back,

84
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,640
we'll still be together.

85
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,070
But an unexpected person appeared in my life.

86
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,920
She broke all my assumptions.

87
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,200
I really can’t go back to the past anymore.

88
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,720
Is He Jinxin

89
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,670
the unexpected person you mentioned?

90
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,390
Sorry.

91
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,000
You know that

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,510
she married you by accident

93
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,830
and just happened to appear

94
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,600
when you needed my company.

95
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,550
Now she has left.

96
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,790
There is no obstacle between us.

97
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:12,880
Yeah.

98
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,070
In my opinion, as long as

99
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,270
I can drive her away,

100
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,920
we can be together again.

101
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,200
But when I really drive her away,

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,110
I'm not used to it at all.

103
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,320
I want her to stay with me all the time.

104
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,880
Xuewei,

105
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,320
I don't want to lie to myself anymore.

106
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,830
We really can't be together again.

107
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,230
No, you're kidding.

108
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,320
Look at me.

109
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,230
Now you are just confused.

110
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,270
We can still be together as before.

111
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,640
We can still maintain our previous relationship.

112
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,670
Everything is not late.

113
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,440
I have fallen in love with her.

114
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,110
You've fallen in love with her?

115
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,160
It's ridiculous!

116
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,480
Zhao Cuo,

117
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,830
open your eyes and look at me.

118
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,040
Is He Jinxin superior to me?

119
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,070
She can't be compared with me at all!

120
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,600
I'll give you one last chance.

121
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,110
Which on earth do you love?

122
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,760
Yes, you are right.

123
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,159
Girls like her

124
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,440
are common.

125
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,720
She is stubborn

126
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,720
and always sticks to her guns.

127
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,440
She is neither gentle nor considerate

128
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,920
and doesn't behave like a girl at all.

129
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,110
I also doubt that I am mad,

130
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,760
but so what?

131
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,720
She is such a girl.

132
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,270
If she is not such a girl,

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,320
I probably dislike her.

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,830
But this girl

135
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,440
you like

136
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,110
now stays with Bai Yifei,

137
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,350
and Mr. He also accompanies her.

138
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Just ask yourself.

139
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,480
Does she love you?

140
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:23,950
It doesn't matter.

141
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,790
I'll try harder.

142
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,550
She'll definitely fall in love with me.

143
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,600
She doesn't even care about you.

144
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
She won't come back for you.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,320
Then I'll be cheekier.

146
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,440
No matter how hard it is,

147
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,470
I'll try my best to ask her to come back.

148
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,710
Zhao Cuo.

149
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,960
Have you decided?

150
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,400
I've made up my mind

151
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,110
to do so.

152
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,230
What an infatuated man.

153
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,440
You owe me so much.

154
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,640
How will you pay for it?

155
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,910
I know

156
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
you went to study medicine in Chisang for me for eight years.

157
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,200
I can't pay for it,

158
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,910
so

159
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,640
you can stab me eight times.

160
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,080
You can't,

161
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,960
no,

162
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,400
you two can't pay for

163
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,110
what you've owed me forever.

164
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:54,880
Well,

165
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,760
you lived happily in Zhao's Mansion.

166
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,910
Why do you come to

167
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,880
ask me about the silk bag today?

168
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,960
30 days have passed.

169
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,840
I must come to met you by your appointment.

170
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,440
But why did you

171
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,350
mention the silk bag?

172
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,440
To be honest,

173
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,640
I thought Zhao Cuo suffered from venereal disease

174
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,710
and would be dead one month later.

175
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,670
I didn't know whether they were true or not,

176
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,030
so I asked you to replace me as the bride

177
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,400
and pretend to be dead

178
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,000
one month later.

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,350
Then He Jinxin would disappear in this world forever.

180
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,910
Unexpectedly,

181
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,150
Zhao Cuo was not ill,

182
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,080
and he is an especially handsome man.

183
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,280
I fell in love with him

184
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,710
at first sight.

185
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,110
Therefore…

186
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,640
And then?

187
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,320
Therefore, you take the pill

188
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,280
and pretend to be dead

189
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,110
as planned.

190
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,350
Then I'll tell others that

191
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,000
you kidnapped me

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,910
and threatened my parents

193
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,000
to marry you off into Zhao's Mansion.

194
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,470
At last,

195
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,150
as this thing is revealed,

196
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,710
you commit suicide.

197
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,150
In this way,

198
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,110
I can marry into Zhao's Mansion

199
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,710
as the real He Jinxin

200
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,350
and be with my Mr. Right aboveboard.

201
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,230
You…

202
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,550
I married him for you,

203
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,670
but you'll frame me!

204
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,640
What's more,

205
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,520
you must die in Zhao's Mansion

206
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,790
and show your corpse before Zhao Cuo

207
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,710
to make him despair.

208
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,640
You liar!

209
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,320
I won't!

210
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,470
Don't you promise it?

211
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:13,960
No, I won't.

212
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,790
Well,

213
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,760
have you decided,

214
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,000
Young Lady?

215
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,000
Don't,

216
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,590
don't talk nonsense.

217
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,150
Don't play innocent.

218
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,670
That day you

219
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,910
hid in our mansion

220
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,400
in quite a gorgeous wedding dress.

221
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,230
On the same day,

222
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,880
Young Lady was missing,

223
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,590
and you said that

224
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,640
you came from Shifang Village.

225
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,200
They were

226
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,150
too coincident.

227
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,470
I find you dress so gorgeously.

228
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,910
I guess you are going to marry a rich and influential family, huh?

229
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,710
Yes.

230
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,400
Why did you escape from marriage?

231
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,110
I… Well…

232
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,470
Anyway, it's a long story.

233
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,110
I don't think you have the same accent as the locals.

234
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,670
Is it a distant marriage?

235
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,200
Yes.

236
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,520
I'm from Shifang Village.

237
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,840
I will get married in the capital.

238
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,350
Capital?

239
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:14,880
I see.

240
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,400
Well, Young Lady,

241
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,670
I have something

242
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,590
on you.

243
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,640
You escaped from marriage,

244
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,440
so you had committed the capital crime.

245
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,350
Just think about

246
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,400
whether you will pretend to be dead or be beheaded.

247
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,520
It'll be also good,

248
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,550
if my false death

249
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,960
can restore everything.

250
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,960
What's wrong with me?

251
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,640
How can I be so mad?

252
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,230
No.

253
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,350
I don't like him.

254
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,000
Calm down.

255
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,960
Calm down.

256
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,670
Who is that?

257
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,520
White Scrag,

258
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,710
open the door.

259
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,590
Oh.

260
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,550
What's the matter?

261
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,640
White Scrag,

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,880
open the door.

263
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,280
No.

264
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,910
Don't come to tease me again.

265
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,710
What? What did you say?

266
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,550
Well, what's the matter?

267
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,960
Go ahead.

268
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,640
I'll tell you a secret

269
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,110
by the river tomorrow.

270
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,710
Secret?

271
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,790
Is he also a gay?

272
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,280
Oh, no!

273
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,280
We can't do it!

274
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,760
Young Master.

275
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,400
Young Master.

276
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,470
Mrs. Zhao is back.

277
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,670
Young Master.

278
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,150
Hello, Young Master.

279
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,710
Jinxin.

280
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,550
Are you better

281
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,960
these days?

282
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,550
Yes.

283
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,550
I'm better after seeing you.

284
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,080
Why, why are you back?

285
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,670
Can't I come back?

286
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,230
Yes, you can.

287
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,790
Have a seat.

288
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,960
Have you eaten?

289
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,710
Are you thirsty or hungry?

290
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,840
I'm pouring a cup of water for you.

291
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,350
I came back

292
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,000
to say goodbye to you.

293
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,710
I'm going to leave the southern city,

294
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,030
so maybe

295
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,710
we won't meet each other forever.

296
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,320
I disagree!

297
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,790
Now that you're back,

298
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,440
you can't leave.

299
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,280
Anyway,

300
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,080
I'll leave here

301
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,640
and the southern city forever.

302
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,200
Take good care of yourself.

303
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,280
Don't annoy Master anymore.

304
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,000
And Xuewei…

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Don't mention others before me.

306
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,470
Now that you are back,

307
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,440
I won't let you go.

308
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,960
Zhao Cuo.

309
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,790
I'm not wrong.

310
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,640
I'm right.

311
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,440
Now that you're back, I won't let you go,

312
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,110
no matter what you will say.

313
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,440
Listen to me.

314
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
No.

315
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,200
Just stay here, OK?

316
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,440
I, I won't bully you in the future.

317
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,960
What's more,

318
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,320
you promised me

319
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,000
to be my wife.

320
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,000
You should be faithful to me,

321
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,640
right?

322
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,280
And I'm aching all over.

323
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
You also promised Immortal.

324
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,840
You can't

325
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,590
go back on your word.

326
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,400
OK, I see.

327
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,640
Won't you leave?

328
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,150
No, I won't.

329
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:46,840
Really?

330
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,400
Yes,

331
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,440
I'll be here

332
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,150
and won't go anywhere.

333
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,550
I'm a little tired

334
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,200
and want to have a rest.

335
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,910
OK.

336
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,590
Have a rest.

337
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,110
Have a rest.

338
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,200
Lie down. Have a rest.

339
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,400
Sanqi.

340
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,000
He Jinxin.

341
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,800
Is Jinxin still in the room?

342
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,160
Hey,

343
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,070
rise and shine.

344
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,230
You should get up.

345
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,040
Today is a nice day.

346
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,470
How about dating me?

347
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,310
Zhao Cuo,

348
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,880
when you read this letter,

349
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,520
I have

350
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,110
left you forever.

351
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,070
I once said that

352
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,110
we should remain faithful to friends.

353
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,430
As long as I'm your wife,

354
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,640
I'll save you.

355
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,560
The most important thing to be a wife

356
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,040
is to be righteous.

357
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,560
Trust me.

358
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,160
But

359
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,920
this time

360
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,400
I go back on my word.

361
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,590
Sorry.

362
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,160
In fact, I lied to you.

363
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,400
I'm not He Jinxin.

364
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,470
I replaced her

365
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,590
as your bride.

366
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,400
You are my immortal brother.

367
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
I finally found you.

368
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,920
But we

369
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,040
are even.

370
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,710
Because since we met each other,

371
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,920
you had bullied me in many ways.

372
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,070
You thought I was ugly…

373
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,350
So ugly.

374
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,590
Fat-headed, big-eared with a pig belly.

375
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,680
…asked me to set fire

376
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,710
and always shouted at me.

377
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,590
You can follow me,

378
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,350
but you must

379
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,000
listen to me.

380
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,800
I was generous,

381
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,070
so I made friends with you.

382
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,350
In fact,

383
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,230
you are good.

384
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,160
Zhao Cuo!

385
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,880
Please don't pretend to be a bully.

386
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
You're so weak. You rubbish.

387
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,680
Don't beat him. Don't beat him.

388
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,040
Now I'm dying.

389
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,400
Please forgive me.

390
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,880
If I have a chance,

391
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,680
I hope that I can know you

392
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,640
as Tian Sanqi.

393
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,110
[By Tian Sanqi]

394
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Wake up.

395
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,280
Sanqi.

396
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,190
Sanqi.

397
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,040
Wake up, OK?

398
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,760
Wake up, Sanqi.

399
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,950
Sanqi, you said you would leave,

400
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,040
so you left in this way?

401
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:10,710
Sanqi.

402
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,520
Sanqi.

403
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,280
You're good at lying to me.

404
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,760
Lie to me.

405
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,680
Lie to me forever, OK?

406
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,310
Please don't leave me.

407
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,280
Well,

408
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,950
from now on,

409
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,430
I won't stop following you

410
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,950
and going after you

411
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,070
until you're willing to marry me.

412
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,070
Sanqi,

413
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,160
I'll follow you outdoors

414
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,230
in the future, OK?

415
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,640
I will

416
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,350
listen to you.

417
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,560
You can ask me to do everything,

418
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,800
as long as you wake up now,

419
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,950
OK, Sanqi?

420
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,070
OK?

421
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,830
I'm wrong.

422
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,640
I beg you.

423
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,040
Wake up, OK?

424
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,710
I beg you.

425
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,310
I'm wrong.

426
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,680
I order you to wake up!

427
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,350
Sanqi.

428
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,070
Great.

429
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,950
You're awake. You're awake.

430
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,470
Great.

431
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,040
Why are you crying?

432
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,230
Add another requirement.

433
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,680
As my husband,

434
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,520
you must only giggle in the future.

435
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,040
OK.

436
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,880
You can't cry.

437
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,590
OK. OK.

438
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,520
I can

439
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,000
promise you everything,

440
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
as long as you won't leave me.

441
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,800
It's good that you're awake.

442
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,400
You scared me.

443
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,400
Don't, don't hold me tight.

444
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,470
I can't breathe.

445
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,040
OK.

446
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,230
Don't smile.

447
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,560
You know what? You scared me.

448
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,070
Come on.

449
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,110
You are changed so soon.

450
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,000
I can recite

451
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,110
what you just promised.

452
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,430
You will…

453
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,190
OK.

454
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,070
As long as you don't leave,

455
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,040
I can promise you anything.

456
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,000
Never

457
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,640
scare me again.

458
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,350
How did you know that I was Tian Sanqi?

459
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,640
I knew what you talked

460
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,040
with kidnappers when you

461
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,760
were kidnapped last time.

462
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,310
And I also

463
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,350
know what was going on

464
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,040
with you and He Jinxin.

465
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,560
Why didn't you disclose me early?

466
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,070
I'm not a fool.

467
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,000
If you were disclosed,

468
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,430
you would have a reason to leave me.

469
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,070
I were not so stupid.

470
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,310
So

471
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,160
what happened today?

472
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,350
I played dead.

473
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,640
I agreed with He Jinxin that

474
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,110
I would exchange identity

475
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,710
with her after a month.

476
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,400
She's very cunning.

477
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,590
Why did you agree her?

478
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,880
I'll tell you a story

479
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,760
about an immortal brother.

480
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,830
OK.

481
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,590
The incense burns so slowly.

482
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,310
Tian Sanqi,

483
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,560
wait and see.

484
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,430
When the incense burns out,

485
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,640
I'll kill you.

486
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,000
It's really touching.

487
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,680
You did a lot

488
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
for the brother back then.

489
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,160
How dare you mention

490
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,680
another man before me

491
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,800
without concern!

492
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,800
Come on,

493
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,560
I met him first,

494
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,070
OK?

495
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,760
I met him at 10.

496
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,430
I don't care.

497
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,640
He hasn't shown up since you first met.

498
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,310
It's his fault.

499
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,800
Zhao Cuo,

500
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,110
how can you say that?

501
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,310
Do you dare to repeat it?

502
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,040
Stop.

503
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,640
OK.

504
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,070
Tell me.

505
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,830
What if

506
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,040
he shows up now?

507
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,160
I…

508
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,800
Listen.

509
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,680
You can only belong to me.

510
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,830
Tian Sanqi.

511
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,280
Why are you still here?

512
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:07,830
Listen.

513
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,680
She will always be here.

514
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,070
Mister.

515
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,640
Mister.

516
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,830
Don't be fooled by her.

517
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,560
I'll tell you the truth today.

518
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,070
He Jinxin

519
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,070
is me,

520
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,190
but not her.

521
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,000
You,

522
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,880
go to yamen with me.

523
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,110
Are you He Jinxin?

524
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,000
Yes.

525
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,000
Is she Tian Sanqi?

526
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:30,800
Yes.

527
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,920
You even asked my wife to take medicine!

528
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,000
I wanted to hit you a long time ago.

529
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,000
Now you even come here.

530
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,470
I won't hit women.

531
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,070
Go out.

532
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,680
Mister,

533
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,590
do you know who she is?

534
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,350
I advise you not to get into trouble.

535
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,590
I'm asking for trouble.

536
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,800
I know who she is.

537
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,560
She is my wife.

538
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,000
If you make her unhappy,

539
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,470
I would kill you.

540
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,800
Tian Sanqi,

541
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,950
wait and see.

542
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,310
Go.

543
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,040
I told you to guard the door well.

544
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,040
Are you alright?

545
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,000
OK.

546
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,920
Let's go on.

547
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,280
Go.

548
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,560
It's fine that he doesn't come.

549
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,070
Mr. Bai.

550
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,680
You're…

551
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,310
What?

552
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,110
You can't recognize me as I change my clothes.

553
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,070
What?

554
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,520
Mr. He?

555
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,710
You're a girl.

556
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,110
You asked me if

557
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,350
girls in Taoyuan City

558
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,310
like to disguise as boys, right?

559
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,640
What do you think now?

560
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,350
Great.

561
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,160
You're a girl. Great.

562
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,760
You're a girl. Great.

563
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,430
Knowing I am a girl,

564
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,800
you look unhappy.

565
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,230
Do you prefer me to be a man?

566
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,070
Nonsense.

567
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,430
As an upright man,

568
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,310
I won't like a man.

569
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,000
So you're worried about this.

570
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,040
Well, Mr. He,

571
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,590
You cheated me

572
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,070
and mocked me.

573
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,430
Come on. What're you going to do to me?

574
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:29,950
Well,

575
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,830
Dad.

576
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,950
Oh,

577
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,230
you're back. Great.

578
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,400
You're back. Great.

579
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,000
You're back. Great.

580
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,590
You're back. Great.

581
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,400
I'm back, too.

582
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,680
Well,

583
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,880
You're great to take her back.

584
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,190
We're back, too.

585
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:44,710
Come on.

586
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,310
Who are you?

587
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,230
Can't you recognize me?

588
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,430
Yes.

589
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,400
She is Mr. He.

590
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:55,710
Oh, no.

591
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,230
Miss He.

592
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,430
Is, is Mr. He

593
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:04,950
actually a girl?

594
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,640
A girl with such a big head?

595
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,560
I'm smart. Do you know?

596
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,920
Young Lord,

597
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,040
a woman outside the mansion wants to see you

598
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,710
and tell you something

599
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,590
very important.

600
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,590
I'm too busy

601
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,230
to see her now.

602
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,110
But she said

603
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,160
there was news of Young Lady.

604
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,640
Bring her in.

605
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,040
Yes.

606
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,160
I'm He Jinxin.

607
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,230
Greetings to you, Young Lord.

608
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,310
Stand up.

609
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,800
I heard that

610
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,640
you have news of Young Lady.

611
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,520
Yes.

612
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,710
She is in southern city.

613
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,880
She escaped from marriage

614
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,040
and designed to take away my husband.

615
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,280
Please help me.

616
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,000
Stand up.

617
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,710
Young Lord,

618
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,190
if you don't help me,

619
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,230
I won't stand up.

620
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,310
How do you

621
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,590
prove that she is Young Lady?

622
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,590
This is her name ring.

623
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,070
Please have a look.

624
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,880
Young Lord.

625
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,230
Young Lord,

626
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,430
its pattern

627
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,760
matches that of the one

628
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,920
submitted in southern city.

629
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,880
Tell me the details

630
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,920
about how she

631
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,950
took away your husband.

632
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,110
Yes.

633
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,000
What's this?

634
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,640
This is my name ring.

635
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,310
You always want it, right?

636
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,070
Now that you have your identity reinstated

637
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,070
and become my wife,

638
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,920
I should give it to you.

639
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,160
I was wrong.

640
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,110
This isn't brother's name ring.

641
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,470
You mean Young Lady,

642
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,590
namely Tian Sanqi

643
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,070
was born in Yizhuang, Shifang Village.

644
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,560
Yes.

645
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,470
Why didn't I know about it?

646
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:47,950
Young Lord.

647
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,800
You don't care about the marriage very much.

648
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,760
Lord

649
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,430
chose her for you

650
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,160
and sent betrothal gifts and money.

651
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,160
But you haven't

652
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,640
bothered about it.

653
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,470
That is to say,

654
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,350
you knew it.

655
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,310
Yes.

656
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,160
By the way,

657
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,950
when she escaped,

658
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,190
did she leave a letter for me?

659
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,710
Yes.

660
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,040
Fetch it for me now.

661
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,680
Dear Young Lord,

662
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,000
I escaped before I even met you.

663
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,280
I'm so sorry.

664
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,830
When I was 10,

665
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,230
I exchanged my name ring

666
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,350
with someone else

667
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,800
under an old locust tree

668
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,190
in my village, namely, Shifang Village.

669
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,190
I've been engaged,

670
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,470
so I can't marry you.

671
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,070
I hope you'll marry another nice girl.

672
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,590
Tian Sanqi.

673
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,160
Old locust tree.

674
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,830
It's you.

675
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,430
Prepare for riding.

676
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,800
I will go to southern city in person.

677
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,280
Yes.

678
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,070
Sanqi.

679
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,040
Oh, Sanqi.

680
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,070
Stop embroidering.

681
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,920
Zhenzhu told me that

682
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,870
He Jinxin went to the capital,

683
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,800
but we don't know

684
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,670
why she went there.

685
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,120
I think she went to tell Young Lord

686
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,560
that I'm in southern city.

687
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,360
Well,

688
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,360
hide somewhere, OK?

689
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,000
I can't always hide all my life.

690
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,190
I have to try to solve it.

691
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,230
Have you found a way?

692
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,949
No.

693
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:36,190
I'll deal with it,

694
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
but whatever happens,

695
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,560
I can't get Zhao Cuo involved.

696
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,840
Young Master, Miss He.

697
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,710
Hello, Young Master.

698
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,120
What's up?

699
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,360
This is a letter for you, Miss He.

700
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,150
You can go.

701
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,520
What makes you so happy?

702
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,840
My brother said he would come to see me

703
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,870
from the capital in a few days.

704
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,870
He is in the capital?

705
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,760
What's his job?

706
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,360
He is

707
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,230
an important official.

708
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,670
Bai Yifei,

709
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,470
when my brother is here,

710
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,430
I'll ask him to agree with our marriage, OK?

711
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,950
What do you mean with that expression?

712
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,230
Don't you want to marry me?

713
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,840
I even proposed you as a girl.

714
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,560
What do you mean by saying nothing?

715
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,150
If so, I'll leave.

716
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,560
Well,

717
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,760
I do.

718
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,280
I would

719
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,670
marry you

720
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,470
this life

721
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,080
and next life.

722
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,280
You're annoying.

723
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,120
I'll tell Sanqi the news.

724
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,710
Bye.

725
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,470
I never

726
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,150
expected that

727
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,670
I would fall in love with Zhao Cuo.

728
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,230
What if

729
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,360
brother shows up.

730
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,150
Now I have to deal with Young Lord.

731
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,230
I have to make it clear to Ruoyao.

732
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,670
Just in time.

733
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,430
I want to talk to you.

734
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,150
What's wrong?

735
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,760
I see what happened.

736
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,630
So you escaped the marriage

737
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,190
for the agreement with brother.

738
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,870
Later mysteriously,

739
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,360
you met Zhao Cuo

740
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,320
and Bai Yifei.

741
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,760
Yes.

742
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,910
Luckily,

743
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,630
Mr. Bai is excluded.

744
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,560
He isn't the one I'm looking for.

745
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,600
However, I'm very distressed.

746
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,320
If brother

747
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,520
really shows up,

748
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,150
what should I do?

749
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:30,600
Well,

750
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,710
don't worry.

751
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,390
First,

752
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,320
are you sure that

753
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,950
he is still alive?

754
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,670
Now that he hasn't shown up for years,

755
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,470
perhaps

756
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,560
he has got married in Taoyuan City.

757
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,000
You haven't met each other for years.

758
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,760
Though you keep missing him,

759
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,560
he may not miss you.

760
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,430
It has been 8 years.

761
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,800
Perhaps,

762
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,870
perhaps, he forgets it.

763
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,870
You seem

764
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,760
to have a point.

765
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,520
Yes.

766
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,560
So

767
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,040
if you really fall in love with Zhao Cuo…

768
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,000
Hush!

769
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,080
If you really fall in love with him,

770
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,040
don't miss Zhao Cuo.

771
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,040
Tian Sanqi.

772
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,320
Well, I mean it.

773
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:28,910
If you can't make up your mind,

774
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,670
you may miss the one you love.

775
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,760
As for my brother,

776
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,190
don't worry.

777
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,950
I'll try my best to help you.

778
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,280
Really?

779
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,430
But after all, he is Young Lord.

780
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,600
Never mind.

781
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,150
Though he is Young Lord,

782
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,080
he is always reasonable.

783
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,560
Moreover,

784
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,910
I'm here to help you

785
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:53,800
as his sister.

786
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,710
He spoils me,

787
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,670
so he will agree with me.

788
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,190
I hope so.

789
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,320
By the way,

790
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,080
what else do you want to tell me?

791
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,390
In fact, it has something to do with what you said.

792
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,080
Well,

793
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,600
my brother

794
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,360
will come to southern city.

795
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,800
It seems that Zhao Cuo and Bai Yifei

796
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,630
aren't our targets.

797
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,430
Keep

798
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,800
following Tian Sanqi.

799
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,430
Take action as soon as

800
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,040
you find a new target.

801
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:37,870
Yes.

802
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,870
What about Zhao Cuo and Bai Yifei?

803
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,630
It's better to kill by mistake than let them go.

804
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,150
Yes.

805
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,430
The great cause will be started soon.

806
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,600
Make no difference at this moment.

807
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,230
His Lord told us

808
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,470
to kill anyone related to

809
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,840
what happened back then.

810
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,670
Yes.
