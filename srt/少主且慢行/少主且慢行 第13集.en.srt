[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,900
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,020
Episode13

4
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,600
Please go in.

5
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,150
White Scrag.

6
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,640
Why are you two firmly attached to each other?

7
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,960
Do you

8
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,750
investigate together?

9
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,830
Nonsense.

10
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,190
Jinxin can't go back to Zhao's Mansion recently,

11
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,720
so I try to

12
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,360
convince her to move here

13
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,110
and to help investigate

14
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,470
if there're unjust cases in northern city.

15
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,520
No, no.

16
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,270
Mr. Bai,

17
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,230
I won't move here.

18
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,390
I'll stay in an inn.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,630
Never mind. It won't disturb me.

20
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,600
Jinxin,

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,720
if you stay alone in the inn,

22
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,920
I won't rest assured.

23
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
Someone.

24
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,470
Arrange a room for Jinxin.

25
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,030
OK.

26
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,880
The easternmost one. Got it?

27
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,390
The room next to yours.

28
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,280
Shut up.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,030
Well, son, finally you wake up.

30
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,920
Thank God!

31
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,390
Where is Jinxin?

32
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,280
Well, she is…

33
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,630
She isn't here now.

34
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,560
Have a good rest first.

35
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:23,870
Impossible.

36
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,950
I heard her just now.

37
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,230
You misheard.

38
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,110
I've been taking care of you here.

39
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,829
She didn't come.

40
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,670
I'm tired

41
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,079
and want some rest.

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,790
Young Lady, go back.

43
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,640
It'll be troublesome if someone sees you.

44
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,880
Sh!

45
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,720
Remind him to take it while it's hot.

46
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,480
Young Lady,

47
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,040
you've repeated it many times.

48
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,030
I see.

49
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,640
Well, take medicine.

50
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,430
No need.

51
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,710
I'm not a kid.

52
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,550
Don't feed me every time.

53
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,000
You're always

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,790
the little patient

55
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,310
to me.

56
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,480
Look.

57
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,710
You're sick now.

58
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,230
Well. How do you feel?

59
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,920
How about supporting you to have a walk?

60
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,430
No need.

61
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,920
I mean

62
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,440
it's busy in the clinic,

63
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,310
so don't bother to go.

64
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,720
I have to boil medicine

65
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,960
and have acupuncture for you every day.

66
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,470
I'll leave things there behind.

67
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,240
What?

68
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,990
Do you blame me for sticking to you every day?

69
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,240
I don't mean that.

70
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,520
Do you also stand on ceremony to He Jinxin?

71
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,590
Well. By the way,

72
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,800
why didn't she come to me?

73
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,430
What's wrong with her?

74
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,160
After your coma,

75
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,550
she came to me,

76
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,640
asked me to take care of you

77
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,990
and moved to Bai's Mansion.

78
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,270
That's impossible.

79
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,240
How could this happen?

80
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,960
Yes.

81
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,670
She is kind,

82
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,640
but I wonder why she hasn't visited you once

83
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,120
when you are sick.

84
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,640
Maybe there is something important

85
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,150
for her to discuss with Mr. Bai.

86
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,470
I'm tired.

87
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,840
Mr. He.

88
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,680
How did you come in?

89
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,760
Through the door,

90
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,640
not underpass.

91
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,640
I locked the window

92
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,030
and checked under the bed,

93
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,429
but I forgot to lock the door.

94
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,750
I was so careless.

95
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,200
Mr. He.

96
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,840
This is Mr. Bai.

97
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Recently I wanted to paint,

98
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,030
but I didn't know what to paint.

99
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,520
It came to me suddenly.

100
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,440
When passing his room,

101
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,710
I saw him practicing,

102
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,430
so I painted him.

103
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,430
Great.

104
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
Jinxin,

105
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,870
what do you want to do?

106
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,990
What a coincident!

107
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,550
You saw it at the very moment

108
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,320
when he was practicing.

109
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,720
Where did you see him?

110
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,550
Right at the door of his room.

111
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,550
Well, he is thin

112
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,960
like a boiled chicken.

113
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,400
It was unpleasant to see that.

114
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,960
But Mr. Bai you painted

115
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,520
is like a fierce tiger

116
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,720
rather than a boiled chicken.

117
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,030
I felt sorry for him,

118
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,280
so I beautified him.

119
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,200
You even…

120
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,280
Wait.

121
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,350
Tell me.

122
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,840
Did you see any birthmark

123
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,110
on his waist?

124
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,430
His waist?

125
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,640
I saw

126
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,200
nothing.

127
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,320
That's impossible.

128
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,470
Think again.

129
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,840
A red birthmark like flame.

130
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Red?

131
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,030
I'm sure no.

132
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,110
You know what?

133
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,230
He has good skin.

134
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,080
I mean it.

135
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,960
It's as white as snow and delicate as jade.

136
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,600
It's as white as snow and delicate as jade.

137
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,600
I'm talking nonsense.

138
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,200
What?

139
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,440
The kite is yours.

140
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,110
Yes.

141
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,030
You drew

142
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,400
the picture above.

143
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,480
I drew it personally.

144
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,160
Since there is no birthmark on Mr. Bai's waist,

145
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,720
he isn't the brother,

146
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,440
but how come he knows

147
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,400
grimace totem?

148
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,960
When I was 10,

149
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,400
I did meet a girl.

150
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,230
I agreed with her

151
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,520
to be with each other for a lifetime.

152
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,910
Who was he talking about?

153
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,350
No, something is wrong with it.

154
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,910
But

155
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,870
without the birthmark, he isn't the brother.

156
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,230
Who is the one I'm looking for?

157
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,160
Is it…

158
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,550
Tian Sanqi,

159
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,200
look for the brother

160
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,310
seriously.

161
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,910
Well, wait.

162
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,550
You asked so many questions.

163
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,110
You like Mr. Bai.

164
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,000
Come on. Nonsense.

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,960
He is also a bro to me

166
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,310
like you, OK?

167
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,520
Bro.

168
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,910
Yes.

169
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,590
But listen.

170
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,200
To girls in northern and southern cities,

171
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,520
Mr. Bai is the most elegant young man.

172
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,590
Many young girls

173
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,080
want to marry him.

174
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,760
If you don't believe it,

175
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
shout out in the street now that

176
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,640
Mr. Bai is coming,

177
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,150
and many girls will surge forward.

178
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,110
What?

179
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,750
Bai Yifei

180
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,520
flirts with girls using his appearance.

181
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,870
What a bad guy he is!

182
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,400
Why are you angry?

183
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,040
I'm not angry.

184
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,760
I, I don't like him

185
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,840
fishing for fame.

186
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,960
If I had been

187
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,470
born here,

188
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,160
all girls would have liked me.

189
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,990
No one will care about him.

190
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,750
Why are you laughing?

191
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
OK.

192
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,320
Now that

193
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,840
you dislike Mr. Bai,

194
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,640
how about asking him

195
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,840
to fight with you

196
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,910
to see who is

197
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,470
stronger, OK?

198
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,310
OK.

199
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,910
Come on.

200
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,910
I'm going to fight with him.

201
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,600
Invitation at midnight.

202
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,400
Is it from Jinxin?

203
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,900
[I sincerely invite you to go sightseeing in the countryside of northern city tomorrow.]

204
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,350
I will never decline

205
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,960
Jinxin's invitation.

206
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,750
Jinxin…

207
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,350
Why are you here?

208
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,990
Where is Jinxin?

209
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,280
Didn't she send you letter of challenge?

210
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,350
I'm here today

211
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,480
to fight with you.

212
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,550
What?

213
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,550
Mr. He,

214
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,670
tell me now.

215
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,640
Where is Jinxin?

216
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,550
She said the wood over there

217
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,760
was right for us to fight,

218
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,160
so she is waiting for us there.

219
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,150
It's just a fight.

220
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,470
Why bother choosing this beautiful place?

221
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,480
Let's go now.

222
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,910
Wow. Unexpectedly,

223
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,990
it's so beautiful in the countryside.

224
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,670
Well,

225
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,790
slow down.

226
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,080
There's no beast.

227
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,400
Are you afraid that you'll be bitten?

228
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,670
As the saying goes, soft light covers the delicate body, and the charming color warms the delicate skin.

229
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,670
It's a pity that someone spoils it.

230
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,350
Ah?

231
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,670
What did you say?

232
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,760
Well,

233
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,080
I said let's go now,

234
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,600
or Jinxin has to wait for us.

235
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,990
Come on.

236
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,550
What a blockhead!

237
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,670
How dull he is!

238
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,430
Is it this wood?

239
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,430
I can't see Jinxin.

240
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,640
Why hasn't she come yet?

241
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,400
It's the wood.

242
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,990
Hello.

243
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,110
I didn't practice swords.

244
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,750
What's the next?

245
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,280
It's a nice day.

246
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,200
It's a nice day.

247
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,110
I'm leaving.

248
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,080
Humph, are you afraid?

249
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,870
afraid?

250
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,430
I'll never be afraid.

251
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,110
Then just fight directly.

252
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,110
OK.

253
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,080
Today,

254
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,640
I'll make you admit that you're a loser.

255
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,510
Wow.

256
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,390
Mr. He,

257
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,390
what do you mean?

258
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,720
How beautiful!

259
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,510
It's beautiful sunset.

260
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,120
Forget that.

261
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,190
But I've never seen such

262
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,390
beautiful sunset since my childhood.

263
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,150
What?

264
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,630
That's impossible.

265
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,550
I mean it.

266
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,520
I used to live in a yard

267
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,560
with a very high wall

268
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,190
and my dad didn't allow me to get out,

269
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,040
so I could just see

270
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,600
the sky in the yard.

271
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,150
The setting sun

272
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,390
has boundless beauty,

273
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,910
just because the yellow dusk is so near.

274
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,480
That's how it feels.

275
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,910
There are both the joy of seeing the beautiful scenery

276
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,550
and the melancholy

277
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,760
of the fleeting beauty.

278
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,960
So things that go easily

279
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,120
are always the most memorable.

280
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,400
Look.

281
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,390
Butterflies.

282
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,480
There are even butterflies here.

283
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,960
Mr. He,

284
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,120
what for?

285
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,830
He Jinxin,

286
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,040
what's wrong with you today?

287
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,960
Why didn't you come?

288
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,280
Well,

289
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,920
did you fight with Mr. Bai today?

290
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,590
No.

291
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,310
Without you there,

292
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,000
there wasn't a witness,

293
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,950
so we didn't fight.

294
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,830
What?

295
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,430
Where did you go?

296
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,350
We enjoyed the sunset.

297
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,920
You know what?

298
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,430
I didn't see

299
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,710
such beautiful sunset before.

300
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,280
So

301
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,390
you two had a good time today.

302
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,310
Not bad.

303
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,710
Bai Yifei always blames others seriously,

304
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,280
but today he wasn't as annoying

305
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,600
as he is at ordinary times.

306
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,800
So you like him today.

307
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,760
Don't,

308
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,400
don't talk nonsense.

309
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm a man.

310
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,310
That's impossible.

311
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,110
Ruoyao,

312
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,240
stop disguising.

313
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,830
Come on.

314
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,070
You knew it?

315
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,710
Humph, I knew it long ago.

316
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,000
When?

317
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,950
When you fell into the river

318
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,000
in which Mr. Bai took showers,

319
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,110
I saw it.

320
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,840
You saw it.

321
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,760
How embarrassing!

322
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,600
Then

323
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,510
do Bai Yifei and Zhao Cuo know that?

324
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,800
No.

325
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,000
I think there is a reason

326
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,640
for you to disguise as a man,

327
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,840
so I didn't tell them.

328
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,110
Great.

329
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,080
How nice you are!

330
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,590
But I really wonder it.

331
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,040
Now that you're a girl,

332
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,190
why did the Lord

333
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,760
send you

334
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,510
to patrol around?

335
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,200
Because he is my dad.

336
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,840
What?

337
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,960
My dad is the Lord.

338
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,350
See you.

339
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,240
Well.

340
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,670
Tian Sanqi.

341
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,630
I've actually already known who you are.

342
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,640
You're

343
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,760
my sister-in-law.

344
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,190
You're the girl in Shifang Village that my brother will marry,

345
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,910
right?

346
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,360
How did you know that?

347
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,590
Last time

348
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,310
you failed to disguise.

349
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,710
I suspected it when you said that

350
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,710
you would go to Shifang Village.

351
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,510
Moreover, your aunt and uncle

352
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,000
actually are your parents, right?

353
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,000
Why didn't you disclose that?

354
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,830
I thought there was a reason

355
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,550
for you to escape the marriage

356
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,680
and disguise

357
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,000
as someone else.

358
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,000
Moreover,

359
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,710
you look kind,

360
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,790
so I hide it from others.

361
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,560
You're great.

362
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,830
You look kind, too.

363
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,830
No.

364
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,920
You're better.

365
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,200
You're kind and clever.

366
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,280
No.

367
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,070
You're clever

368
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,120
and beautiful.

369
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,950
You're more beautiful.

370
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,520
Come on.

371
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,110
Come on.

372
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,550
You're most beautiful.

373
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,470
Enough.

374
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,390
We go too far. Stop.

375
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,000
But I'm still

376
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,030
curious about you.

377
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,760
You said

378
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,760
so many girls wanted to marry my brother,

379
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,400
but why did you refuse

380
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,480
and even escape?

381
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,760
Don't you want to be the Young Lady?

382
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,950
Well,

383
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,480
my brother will be the Lord.

384
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
Others want to,

385
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,000
but I don't.

386
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,190
The Young Lord I haven't met

387
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,720
isn't the one I love.

388
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,150
I want to pursue the one I love.

389
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,030
OK.

390
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,120
That's fine.

391
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,920
My brother

392
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,710
doesn't want to marry

393
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,760
for the same reason with yours.

394
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
He also said he would pursue the one he loved.

395
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,630
But

396
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,640
I'm still a bit worried

397
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,710
It isn't a good idea for me

398
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,280
to hide outside alone.

399
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,920
I'll help you.

400
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,190
Don't worry.

401
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,160
Go to the one

402
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,000
you really love.

403
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,920
At most,

404
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,630
I'll tell them that you die

405
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,430
when I go back.

406
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,030
Really?

407
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,520
You're so kind.

408
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,110
Don't worry.

409
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,830
I'll help bring together

410
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,350
you and Mr. Bai.

411
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,230
What?

412
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,390
I don't want to be with him.

413
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,710
Don't you?

414
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,560
Then I won't bother.

415
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,270
Well,

416
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,240
I want to.

417
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,270
I want to.

418
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,080
Help me.

419
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,950
You're annoying.

420
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,360
Come on.

421
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,800
Will you help me?

422
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,160
Will you help me?

423
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,720
How can Sanqi do that?

424
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,830
When she is here,

425
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,200
I'll ask her

426
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,790
why she didn't come

427
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,310
and kept Mr. He and me waiting for a long time today.

428
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Mr. Bai.

429
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,550
Jinxin,

430
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,360
why didn't you come today?

431
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,710
Sorry.

432
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,950
I was going to play with you two,

433
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,230
but I was informed to do something urgent

434
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,430
by Taifu Magistrate yamen,

435
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,560
so I couldn't go.

436
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,710
It's my fault.

437
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,400
OK. Never mind.

438
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,360
Public affairs should come first.

439
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
Now that we couldn't do it today,

440
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,110
let's enjoy flowers

441
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,310
at Shili Pavilion tomorrow, OK?

442
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,160
Really?

443
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,310
That's what I want to.

444
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,520
I'll inform Mr. He now.

445
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,240
OK.

446
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,200
Mr. He?

447
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,600
Why are you here?

448
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,430
Where is Jinxin?

449
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,310
Won't she come?

450
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,200
She said

451
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,350
suddenly she had to investigate a case in yamen,

452
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,760
so I came here alone.

453
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,600
OK. Make way.

454
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,790
Hello? Are you going to leave?

455
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,070
I promised Jinxin

456
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,510
to draw the scenery here.

457
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,910
I see, Bai Yifei.

458
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,120
You must be afraid

459
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,760
of making a fool of yourselves,

460
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,670
right?

461
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,590
It seems that

462
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,280
I have to draw the scenery here alone

463
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,030
to dazzle Jinxin with it.

464
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,160
You're not really

465
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,520
good at drawing.

466
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,480
Not bad.

467
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,120
Do you

468
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,840
dare to show me yours?

469
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,360
Look.

470
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,910
It's OK.

471
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,720
But yours is not

472
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,790
comparable to that of Zhao Cuo, let alone mine.

473
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,030
What?

474
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,310
I'm better at drawing than Zhao Cuo.

475
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,120
You're worst.

476
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,000
Humph. How dare you be so arrogant!

477
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,360
You destroy

478
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,120
my drawing

479
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,030
as you can't compete with me.

480
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,790
How mean you are!

481
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,230
I destroyed it.

482
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:13,590
So what?

483
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,670
Hit me.

484
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:25,160
Bai Yifei, I won't forgive you.

485
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,840
I want to kill

486
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,200
you today.

487
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,830
The elements are propitious

488
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,230
and the people are enjoying a good and prosperous life

489
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,480
under you rule in northern city.

490
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,680
I also learned that

491
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,800
your son is also well-educated

492
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,720
and outstanding at present.

493
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,430
I wonder

494
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,470
whether I will be

495
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,000
lucky enough to meet him today.

496
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,760
He went out to sketch.

497
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,080
He should be

498
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,760
coming back now.

499
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,080
These two young men coming from over there

500
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,590
look funny

501
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,840
and dirty.

502
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,160
I, I don't think your son is among them, right?

503
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,590
Yes.

504
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,520
He is…

505
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,270
Dad.

506
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,840
Look. How beautiful

507
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,400
the rosy clouds are!

508
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,080
Dad.

509
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,480
Butterflies are flying freely and the flowers are blooming purposely.

510
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,150
Look. It's beautiful in the garden.

511
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,110
Look here.

512
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,720
How beautiful it is in my garden!

513
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,760
I'll show you a set of Taiji Boxing.

514
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,790
Let's see how I'm doing.

515
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,840
Look here.

516
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,790
Although Mr. He was annoying at first,

517
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,390
he's pretty good at both culture and martial arts

518
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,910
and is comparable to me.

519
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,880
He seems to be from a wealthy and influential family.

520
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:43,430
Click click, and click click click. By the doorway Mulan weaves.

521
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,240
When all at once the shuttles cease, a sigh is heard with solemn grief.

522
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,720
That the hare is a he or she?

523
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,150
Well, Mr. He,

524
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,560
what's wrong?

525
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,080
You're so upset.

526
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,110
Well,

527
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,760
I was here with Bai Yifei day and night these days.

528
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,280
Now I'm leaving,

529
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,000
but I don't really want to.

530
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,960
Where are you going?

531
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,160
I'll go back to the capital

532
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,880
to report to

533
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,760
my brother and dad.

534
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,430
Don't worry.

535
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,480
I won't tell upon you.

536
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,720
Good friend.

537
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,950
Good friend, you…

538
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,880
I'll keep an eye on Mr. Bai

539
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,720
and stop other girls getting close to him.

540
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,960
Mr. He.

541
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,080
Mr. He, are you there?

542
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,950
Why is Mr. Bai coming to Mr. He?

543
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,960
Mr. He.

544
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,150
Do you want to meet Mr. He?

545
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,040
Jinxin,

546
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,200
have you seen Mr. He?

547
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,920
I haven't seen him for several days.

548
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,880
No.

549
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,390
I haven't seen him for days.

550
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,520
What's wrong?

551
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,910
Do you miss him?

552
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,830
No.

553
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,840
I won't miss him for no reason.

554
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,190
I won't miss him.

555
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,120
Well, indeed.

556
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,030
But he may never come back.

557
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,950
Never come back.

558
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,670
Yes.

559
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,040
Why?

560
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,280
Look, your dad

561
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,230
manages it well here.

562
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,760
There is no case to be investigated.

563
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,670
I see.

564
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:04,710
Well,

565
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,640
I'll write to him in the capital to and ask him

566
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,640
not to come here again.

567
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,560
See you.

568
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,270
Well.

569
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,120
Wait.

570
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,200
What's wrong, Mr.Bai?

571
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,280
It seems that someone is setting fire.

572
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,040
Who?

573
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,630
Who is setting fire?

574
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,270
Who is setting fire?

575
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,120
It seems

576
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,120
to be you.

577
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,150
Yes.

578
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,960
Mr. He,

579
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,480
I'm not setting fire.

580
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,280
You're not setting fire now,

581
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,720
but you'll do it later.

582
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,720
I, I, no.

583
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,430
I won't set fire.

584
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,600
You will.

585
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,910
No. I, well.

586
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,670
Tell me

587
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,710
where I should set fire.

588
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,670
Listen.

589
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,200
Don't retort.

590
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,310
Later,

591
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,310
set fire

592
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,480
to the archives

593
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,670
and then run over the wall.

594
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,400
And you'll

595
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,070
tell my dad what happens.

596
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,840
What?

597
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,110
Go.

598
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,840
Work hard.

599
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,640
No. Mr., Mr., Mr. Bai, I…

600
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,150
Don't stand here. Go now.

601
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,480
Now as he sets the fire,

602
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,630
there'll be a case to be investigated.

603
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,790
Mr. He will be back.

604
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,960
What?

605
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,510
The fire makes the sky red.

606
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,080
How beautiful!

607
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,790
Yes.

608
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,030
The fire was set.

609
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,030
Why hasn't Mr. He come back yet?

610
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,000
4 days.

611
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,870
It has been 4 days since Mr. He left.

612
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,760
What's wrong with me?

613
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,520
Why am I so upset?

614
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,239
I'm counting off the days.

615
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,520
Why is there accompaniment?

616
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:34,350
You come closer to me step by step.

617
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,719
You come closer to me step by step.

618
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,560
Bright red.

619
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,480
A rainbow told me that

620
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,350
true love was coming.

621
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,780
Really?

622
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,940
You saw through

623
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:52,219
my tempting heart.

624
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,320
Really?

625
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,670
Your eyes twinkle like stars.

626
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,360
Since I met you,

627
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,670
it seems that it's sunny every day.

628
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,620
There are rainbows in my world

629
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,420
every day.

630
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,540
It's strange that the sun never sets.

631
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,480
My heart goes pit-a-pat

632
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,670
like deer bumping the earth upside down.

633
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:25,080
You set off a little whirlwind

634
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,280
and

635
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,000
take me to the big universe.

636
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,240
Are you so free?

637
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,630
No.

638
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,870
If I like him,

639
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,720
I can't face my ancestors.

640
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,620
No.

641
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,800
I have to try to confirm it.

642
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,300
[Secret Book of Women]

643
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,670
Why are you so serious?

644
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,070
Well.

645
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,430
Zhao Cuo,

646
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,960
how did you get in?

647
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,120
Through the door,

648
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,280
not underpass.

649
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,350
I checked the window

650
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,590
and under the bed,

651
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,390
but I forgot to lock the door.

652
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,720
I was so careless.

653
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,390
Well.

654
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,710
I see.

655
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,420
You always praise yourself as a gentleman,

656
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,800
but you're improper.

657
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,320
No,

658
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,910
I'm not.

659
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,800
Don't talk nonsense.

660
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,910
Well,

661
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,840
we're adults.

662
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,870
I'll give you a new one later.

663
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,430
This is too old.

664
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,560
No.

665
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,670
I'm immune to women.

666
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,480
Well,

667
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
I mean

668
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,960
I have no improper thought of women.

669
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,760
Listen,

670
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:30,320
you can like anyone else

671
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,760
except Sanqi,

672
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,830
or I would kill you.

673
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,240
Sure.

674
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,240
OK.

675
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Well,

676
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,760
have you recovered?

677
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,280
Why are you here?

678
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,760
Well. Yes,

679
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,150
I'm here for Jinxin.

680
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,190
Yes.

681
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,390
Jinxin. Jinxin.

682
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,040
Dear,

683
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,760
open the door first, OK?

684
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,520
Dear.

685
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,840
Now that you've recovered,

686
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,040
I'm rest assured.

687
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,520
Thank you

688
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,390
for helping me.

689
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,040
Why didn't you come to me these days?

690
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,120
Don't you want to make sure

691
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,630
if I've recovered in person?

692
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,200
Go.

693
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,200
Don't ever come to me again.

694
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,480
OK.

695
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,280
It's fine that you won't

696
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,120
care me or come to me.

697
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,830
But

698
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,280
do I matter

699
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,430
to you?

700
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,240
No.

701
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,870
I don't care.

702
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,430
Go to the one who really cares about you.

703
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,840
Be good to Xuewei.

704
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,150
Don't come to me again.

705
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,350
Dear,

706
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,080
it's fine that you won't

707
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,470
come to me or greet me.

708
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,110
But, open the door, OK?

709
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,040
Dear.

710
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,390
If you keep forcing me,

711
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,480
I'll leave here.

712
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,720
OK.

713
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,720
30 days

714
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,240
expire.
