00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,400
we have reached the outskirts of the southern city.

Stop.

00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,910
Stop. Stop.

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,030
What can I do for you?

12
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,600
I really need to pee.

13
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,390
I'm also a human being.

when you look at me?

19

Don't embarrass me.

If you run away,

21
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,550
I will die.

22
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,240
I'm lucky enough

23
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,600
to be the wife of Young Lord.

24
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,910
Why do I run away?

25

I won't run away in any case.

thinking about every day?

Have you

29
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,030
seen this rainbow girl?

seen this rainbow girl?

No, I haven't.

00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,320
Young Master,

34
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,000
you've been asking about her all this morning.

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,670
Where on earth

36
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,110
is she?

37
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,880
Well,

38
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,160
I'm also wondering

39
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,630
where I will meet her

40
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,110
next time.

41
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,910
Keep looking for her.

We need to have the power to believe.

43
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,270

Your Excellency Wang, have a look.

Miss,

53
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,790
have you

54

seen this rainbow girl?

62
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,390
it's not a right way

63
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,920
for us to keep looking.

64
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,760
What if this girl

65
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,110
isn't from the southern city

66
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,230
and won't appear in the southern city again?

67
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,440
No way.

68
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,320
I always feel like I've known her before.

69
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,159
I'm sure we'll see each other again.

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,830
OK, Young Master.

71

Separated as we are thousands of miles apart,

72

we come together as if by predestination.

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,790
I can recognize her at a glance,

74
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,510

Jinxin,

121
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,480
when you usually

122
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,440
prick your fingers with an embroidery needle,

123
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,600
you must stay in bed and cry loudly.

124
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,950
Don't you think

125
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,550
it is strange for you to hang yourself this time?

126
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,160
I, He Jinxin, am extremely beautiful.

127
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,550
Marrying such a short-lived man

128
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,760
is simply a disaster.

Honey,

130
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,110
why do you kill yourself?

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,320
As soon as Zhao Cuo dies,

132
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,390
the money of his family belongs to us.

That's right.

136
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,640
Then you can take away the property

137
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,830
and remarry.

138
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,720
Isn't it nice

to earn double betrothal gifts?

140
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,280
Honey, it makes sense.

141
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,590
How smart you are!

Hang yourself.

Take it easy?

What should I do?

157
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,520
I'll be married in six hours.

What should I do?

159
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,280
Unless someone

160

replaces me and marries him.

161
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,880
I'm too old,

162
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,080
or I will replace you and marry him.

Oh, my God!

164
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,550
Save me

165

166

175
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,230
what on earth did you suffer?

176
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,280
Why did you hang yourself on the wedding day?

177
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,200
My parents are greedy for money

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,400
and let me marry a villain.

179
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,670
That villain suffers from a venereal disease.

180
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,590
He is stupid

181
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,550
and stubborn.

182
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,350
He has seized girls

183
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,320
and committed all manner of crimes.

184
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,110
-Darned.
-Darned.

185
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,320
Your parents sell you for money.

186
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,960
They're forced by that villain.

187
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,790
I don't blame them.

188
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,470
If I meet that villain,

189
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,910
I will slap him hard,

190
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,230
and make him half paralyzed.

191
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,400
Girl,

192
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,200
you're so chivalrous.

193
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,030
No, thanks. Drink it.

194
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,910
Girl,

195
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,550
I will give you the address of that villain.

196
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,550
How about you make him half paralyzed?

197
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,000
Take it easy.

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,790
I'm just kidding.

199
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,470
I find

200
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,670
you dress so gorgeously.

201
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,670
I guess you are going to marry a rich and influential family, huh?

202
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,320
Yes.

203
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,960
Why did you escape from marriage?

204
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,710
Anyway, it's a long story.

205
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,280
I don't think

206
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,520
you have the same accent as the locals.

207
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,320
Is it a distant marriage?

208
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,840
I'm from Shifang Village.

209
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,200
I will get married in the capital.

210
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,710
Capital?

211
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,030
Which family are you going to marry into?

212
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,590
Zhao Cuo, Young Master

213
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,110
of Zhao's Mansion in the southern city.

214
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,440
Don't cry. Don't cry.

215
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,150
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

216
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,960
OK. Don't cry.

217
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,320
Beautiful.

218
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,550
How beautiful you are!

219
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,200
Zhao Cuo?

220
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,320
Wait a minute.

221
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,400
What's your name?

222
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,760
He Jinxin.

223
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,280
Oh, no.

224
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,640
She is He Jinxin whom I pretended to be that day.

225
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,760
What a mess.

226
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,110
I heard that

227
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,840
Zhao Cuo went on a blind date throughout the southern city.

228
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,110
It turns out that he takes a fancy to you.

229
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,110
Have you two met?

230
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,350
No.

231
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,790
That's the weird part.

232
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,550
He hasn't even met me,

233
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,960
but he gave me betrothal gifts and is going to marry me.

234
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,880
But I'm famous for my beauty

235
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,710
in the southern city.

236
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,790
When I think of that,

237
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,640
I don't think it is weird.

238
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,840
Yes.

239
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,280
That's right.

240
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,350
Oh, no.

241
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,280
It seems that I made this marriage possible.

242
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,110
Oh, my God!

243
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,400
Are you kidding me?

244
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,670
This woman doesn't seem smart at a glance.

245
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,110
How about we fool her

246
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,200
into replacing me and marrying into Zhao's Mansion

247
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,880
in this case?

248
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,080
Yes. What a good idea!

249
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,230
You came down from the sky and saved my life.

250
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:37,960
How about

251
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,200
you do me

252
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
one more favor?

253
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,670
Miss,

254
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,550
my lady has long had

255
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,200
a sweetheart Mr. Zhang,

256
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,230
But Master dislikes Mr. Zhang because his family is poor

257
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,710
and doesn't allow my lady to marry him.

258
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,640
He insists on marrying her to Zhao Cuo.

259
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,470
Mr. Zhang.

260
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,880
They have agreed that

261
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,670
if they can't be together in this life,

262
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,670
they will commit suicide together for love

263
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,640
on today's wedding.

264
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,030
Miss,

265
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,000
I beg you.

266
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,080
I beg you.

267
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,520
I beg you.

268
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,400
You have two lives in your hands.

269
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,000
Please help our lady.

270
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,880
After all,

271
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,440
Miss He and Mr. Zhang are both my victims.

272
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,520
I can't ignore two lives.

273
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,400
Besides, Zhao Cuo can't marry her.

274
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,150
OK. I will help you.

275
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,230
This matter…

276
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,000
That's a deal.

277
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,880
OK.

278
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,590
Don't worry.

279
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,030
I won't keep you trapped in Zhao's Mansion all the time.

280
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,350
But

281
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,080
you have to promise me two things.

282
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Go ahead.

283
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,910
First,

284
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,230
the promise lasts a month.

285
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,150
You can't

286
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,150
reveal your identity to anyone in a month.

287
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,960
You are the daughter of the He family.

288
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,470
Do you understand?

289
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,470
Yes.

290
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,520
I, He Jinxin,

291
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,150
am the daughter of the He family.

292
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,710
That's right.

293
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,230
What about a month later?

294
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,590
Here is a silk bag.

295
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,030
There's a trick

296
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,710
to get you out of there.

297
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,080
You open it after a month.

298
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,400
OK, it's a deal.

299
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,760
By the way,

300
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,840
you just mentioned

301
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,910
Zhao Cuo suffers from a venereal disease.

302
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,910
What's venereal disease?

303
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,880
There is something wrong with

304
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,400
this part of his body.

305
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,080
It turns out that there is something wrong with his legs.

306
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,400
It's okay. It's okay.

307
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,910
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

308
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,550
Well,

309
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,710
the name ring.

310
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,440
Hurry up.

311
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,230
Cover it. Cover it.

312
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,640
Don't forget

313
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,880
what you have promised my lady.

314
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,440
Slow down. Slow down.

315
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,790
That's all right.

316
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,670
I'll use He Jinxin's identity

317
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,710
to find out

318
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,110
if Zhao Cuo is the brother

319
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,030
I'm looking for.

320
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,400
Anyway, as soon as the one-month period arrives,

321
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,550
I can escape

322
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,080
and now I can hide in Zhao's Mansion

323
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
as Zhao Cuo's wife.

324
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,030
I will kill two birds with one stone.

325
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,310
The game begins.

326
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,310
I caught you.

327
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,880
I wasn't wrong.

328
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,520
I really wasn't wrong.

329
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,160
Really?

330
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,230
Get out.

331
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:53,830
50 laps.

332
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,040
Yes.

333
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,070
Your Highness Jinyan,

334
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,230
what are you doing?

335
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,920
I'm in a hurry to report on completion of a task to Young Lord.

336
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,760
What am I doing?

337
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,520
What am I doing?

338
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,760
Father doesn't allow me to go out

339
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,280
to hunt,

340
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,280
so I take you as prey.

341
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,430
Run fast. Run fast. Run fast.

342
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,680
It's boring.

343
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,430
Life is so tiring.

344
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,230
I just eat and sleep every day.

345
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,880
I can't help it.

346
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,260
I'll be bored to death.

347
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,040
Jinyan.

348
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,190
I know.

349
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,040
I just make fun of them.

350
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,470
Look at your face.

351
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,190
It's so dirty.

352
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,590
Am I pretty, brother?

353
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,280
You should

354
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,070
learn more knowledge in the books

355
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,000
and etiquette and upbringing from your teacher.

356
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,520
I don't want to.

357
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,680
That old fogey

358
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,560
always uses

359
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,800
archaisms.

360
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,590
I don't want to keep staying with him.

361
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,100
It makes me uncomfortable.

362
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,110
You unruly girl.

363
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,070
No one dares to marry you later.

364
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,110
I don't want to marry.

365
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,350
Brother,

366
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,280
look what this is.

367
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,470
Is your wife coming soon?

368
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,470
Well, don't sigh.

369
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,160
I'll help you think out a way to control her

370
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,680
and let her know our power.

371
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:06,880
Don't make trouble.

372
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,760
General Li,

373
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,070
why are you still there?

374
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,400
Don't you pull out the arrow?

375
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,710
Arrow?

376
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,560
What arrow?

377
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,880
Where is it?

378
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,720
No.

379
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,230
What's the matter?

380
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,760
Young Lord, please forgive me.

381
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,230
I failed to make it.

382
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,590
I just received a secret report from the bride escorting team,

383
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,830
saying…

384
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,950
What?

385
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,520
Young Lady is missing.

386
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,880
Missing?

387
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,680
It's reported that

388
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,520
she left the sedan herself

389
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:58,950
and ran away.

390
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,830
How did this happen?

391
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,400
By the way,

392
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,520
don't bother my dad with this matter.

393
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,560
Since she wanted to leave,

394
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,520
that's God's plan.

395
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,640
You can say

396
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,070
she died suddenly

397
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,560
on the way.

398
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,590
But I already told Lord

399
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,280
and said I would

400
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,040
look for her whereabouts.

401
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,280
I said I would find her

402
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,430
even if I covered everywhere inside and outside Taoyuan City.

403
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Well done.

404
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,640
Fool.

405
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,310
Young Lord,

406
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,590
I didn't hear clearly.

407
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,760
I wonder

408
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,920
how you plan to look for her.

409
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,230
I found Young Lady's portrait.

410
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,110
I'll post notices.

411
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,830
She is really pretty

412
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,830
with a small mouth, an oval face

413
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,950
and leaf-shaped brows.

414
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,560
Good.

415
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,590
Go and look for her.

416
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,310
Young Lord, well…

417
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,310
Go and look for her now.

418
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,040
Listen.

419
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,920
If you can't find Young Lord's wife,

420
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,710
I'll kill you.

421
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,350
Yes.

422
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,230
What do you think?

423
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,640
You naughty girl.

424
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,520
Jackal, Wolf, Tiger, Leopard,

425
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,110
receive the guests.

426
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:01,920
Coming.

427
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,430
Good. Good.

428
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,070
Coming.

429
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,640
Come on.

430
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,230
To you. To you.

431
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,110
Enjoy yourselves.

432
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,520
Come on.

433
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,470
Cheers.

434
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,560
Congratulations, Master. Congratulations, Master.

435
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,880
Good. Good. Good.

436
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,800
Enjoy yourselves.

437
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,040
Come on. Cheers. Cheers.

438
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,920
Congratulations, Master. Congratulations, Master.

439
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,230
Good. Good. Good.

440
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,830
You can kill me, but you can't humiliate me.

441
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,040
Conduct yourself well.

442
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Come on,

443
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,950
bastard.

444
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,310
What are you doing?

445
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,590
Stop pretending.

446
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,920
In the whorehouse,

447
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,710
you coveted my fair face.

448
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,350
Don't wait.

449
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,590
I just want to see

450
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,070
whether you have that.

451
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,760
Stop talking.

452
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,400
I am a normal man.

453
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,680
You…

454
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,040
From tonight,

455
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,230
my soul is dead.

456
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,920
Are you really willing?

457
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,710
I am tied

458
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,350
like a lamb to be slaughtered.

459
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,160
Stop talking. Come on.

460
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,590
Good.

461
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,190
I'll check now.

462
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,710
So I don't need to talk more with you.

463
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,760
Well, that's what you said.

464
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:55,710
Well.

465
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,560
Why are you so hungry?

466
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,400
Listen.

467
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,110
I have venereal disease.

468
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,680
It isn't horrible.

469
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,800
Isn't there something wrong with that part of your body?

470
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,590
Listen.

471
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,830
This disease is so horrible.

472
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,560
Isn't there something wrong with your legs and feet?

473
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,400
It isn't horrible at all.

474
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,950
Well,

475
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,430
do you know what venereal disease is actually?

476
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,920
I, I have no mood

477
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,710
to explain to you.

478
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,560
Well, directly

479
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
kill me.

480
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,070
Give me

481
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,920
the name ring

482
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
or let me take off your trousers.

483
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,000
Make a choice.

484
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,160
Listen.

485
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,000
I'll give my name ring to the girl I like.

486
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
I don't make a choice.

487
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,590
Deal with me as you like.

488
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,680
Zhao Cuo,

489
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,350
would you rather die than marry me?

490
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,680
Are you so fed up with me?

491
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,800
More than that.

492
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,760
I hate you.

493
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,640
Jinx.

494
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,040
I don't want to marry you.

495
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,880
But for you,

496
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,230
I wouldn't have missed her appointment.

497
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:45,800
What appointment?

498
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,310
Whom did you make an appointment with?

499
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,950
The girl you love?

500
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,710
Yes.

501
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,590
Listen.

502
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,110
I don't want to marry you at all.

503
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,520
Like a fairy,

504
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,710
she is much prettier

505
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,950
and softer than you.

506
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,160
I'd rather die than marry you.

507
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,400
Where is the girl you love?

508
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,560
How did you know each other?

509
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,000
I won't tell you.

510
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,280
If there is really such a person,

511
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,760
I guess I must make a mistake.

512
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,000
I won't baffle you again.

513
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,520
I'll leave your mansion after daybreak.

514
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:21,710
Really?

515
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,400
Now can you tell the story

516
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,680
between you and her?

517
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,000
Yes.

518
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,070
I knew her

519
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,920
at the age of 10.

520
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,040
I felt familiar with her at that time.

521
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,880
I felt as if I had known her the previous life.

522
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,830
Keep our appointment in mind.

523
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,110
I'll wait for you.

524
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,280
So we've had an appointment that

525
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,040
when we meet again at the age of 18,

526
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,310
we'll marry.

527
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,160
At the age of 10, you and a girl agreed

528
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,280
to marry at the age of 18.

529
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,830
Is this girl me?

530
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,800
Brother,

531
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,040
the girl you want to marry is just before you.

532
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,160
It turns out she isn't with you.

533
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,280
Have you kept looking for her?

534
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,400
It's none of your business.

535
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,470
In a word,

536
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,190
leave now.

537
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,040
After you leave, I can marry her.

538
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,830
Right?

539
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,830
Zhao Cuo, in fact…

540
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,350
In fact, you don't have to wait till daybreak.

541
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,520
You can climb over the wall and leave my mansion now.

542
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,310
No, it's not true.

543
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,430
The girl you're waiting for… She…

544
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,520
No.

545
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,470
I promised to He Jinxin

546
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,400
I couldn't expose my identity.

547
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,400
Calm down.

548
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,190
In fact, the girl you're waiting for

549
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,070
may appear soon.

550
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,040
Yes.

551
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,920
So leave now.

552
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,760
After you leave,

553
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,920
I can marry her.

554
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,680
Why not

555
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,830
leave my mansion from the back door now?

556
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,590
I don't leave.

557
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,160
Give it to me.

558
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:21,950
What do you mean?

559
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,470
In the wedding evening,

560
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,430
we should exchange our name rings.

561
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,160
I…

562
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,800
You…

563
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,950
You have no credit.

564
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,000
You said you would leave.

565
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,590
What?

566
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,950
There are flaky pastries.

567
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,880
I happen to be hungry.

568
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,230
Will you actually leave?

569
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,560
Damn girl,

570
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,710
you have no credit.

571
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,800
You'll suffer.

572
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,830
Mad woman.

573
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,800
She is foxy, changeable

574
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,590
and hard to be dealt with.

575
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,000
I need to think out a way to escape.

576
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,590
I am tired

577
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,110
and also hungry.

578
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,350
Untie me.

579
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,350
It's stuffed with rose.

580
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,190
So tasty.

581
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,430
Listen.

582
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,000
The name ring is hidden on me.

583
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,800
If you don't untie me,

584
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,110
how can I give it to you?

585
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,760
If I untie you,

586
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,710
won't you escape?

587
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,110
No, I won't.

588
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,160
I am too hungry

589
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,760
to escape.

590
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,040
Damn Zhao Cuo,

591
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,470
you have no credit.

592
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,710
I learn from you,

593
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,760
ugly girl.

594
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,110
You…

595
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,640
Stop. Stop.

596
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,830
Zhao Quandui.

597
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,560
Mad woman.

598
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,110
Stop.

599
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,520
I beat you seriously.

600
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,950
Zhao Cuo, stop.

601
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:04,280
It's here.

602
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,110
I don't give it to you.

603
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,590
Give it to me. Give it to me.

604
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,040
Give it to me. Give it to me.

605
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,560
Give it to me.

606
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,280
Give it to me.

607
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,070
Give it to me. Give it to me.

608
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,430
Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me.

609
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,950
Ugly woman.

610
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,070
Give me. Give me.

611
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,640
Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me.

612
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,400
Give it to me. Give it to me.

613
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,680
Why are your neck

614
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,160
and face so red?

615
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,190
He Jinxin.

616
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,880
Yes.

617
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,430
Don't press me.

618
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,830
Sit over there.

619
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,430
From now on,

620
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,430
keep 1 meter away from me.

621
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,680
Why?

622
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,430
I'm mad.

623
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,230
Because you're poisonous.

624
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,710
Coincidently,

625
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,470
I have some antidote in my bag.

626
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,280
Do I need to give it to you?

627
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,070
But with so red face and neck,

628
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,000
are you OK?

629
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,520
Don't move.

630
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,520
You…

631
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,070
Don't come to me, or I'll strangle myself.

632
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,280
So stupid.

633
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,400
There are thousands of ways to die in this world.

634
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,230
I don't hear someone can strangle himself.

635
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,230
Sit there.

636
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,560
Listen.

637
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,040
He Jinxin,

638
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,350
I have other girl in my mind.

639
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,350
We can't be a real couple.

640
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,470
I see.

641
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,070
Haha.

642
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,640
Yes.

643
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,470
It's a fact that you are married to me,

644
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,880
but we can't

645
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,310
be a real couple.

646
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,760
Then what about our relationship?

647
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
We,

648
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,830
we're friends.

649
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,400
Friends?

650
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:31,950
Jinx.

651
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,920
Monster.

652
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,160
Kill her.

653
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,230
Kill her. Kill her.

654
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,560
If you bully me again,

655
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,950
I'll ask the immortal in heaven

656
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,280
to punish you.

657
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,560
Don't scare us.

658
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,040
I'll count to five.

659
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,950
If the immortal you mentioned doesn't come out,

660
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:45,800
you'll suffer.

661
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,000
Five.

662
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:48,920
Four.

663
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,920
Please. Please.

664
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,430
Three.

665
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,040
The immortal in heaven.

666
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,350
If you can hear me…

667
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:54,920
Two.

668
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
…please help me.

669
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,190
Ghost. Run now.

670
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:07,680
Immortal.

671
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,670
Is that you?

672
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,230
Can you really hear my wish?

673
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
Immortal. Immortal.

674
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,560
If you really can hear me,

675
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,949
can you say something?

676
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,000
Say.

677
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,710
Immortal,

678
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,469
are you a boy?

679
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,150
How old are you?

680
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,389
I am

681
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,360
over 3,000 years old.

682
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,469
3,000 years old.

683
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,120
Why do you

684
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,429
sound like a kid?

685
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,040
Immortal, immortal,

686
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,870
are you still here?

687
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,280
Can I see you?

688
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,710
Surely not.

689
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,360
It turns true.

690
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,870
I am not dreaming.

691
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,360
Are you an immortal in heaven?

692
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,870
Yes.

693
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,430
I'm just an immortal in heaven.

694
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,360
I specially came to help you drive away the bad kids.

695
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,000
Immortal brother,

696
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,190
thank you for protecting me.

697
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,520
But you

698
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,600
fell from the heaven.

699
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
How can you go back?

700
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,560
Then I won't go back.

701
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,840
From now on,

702
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,190
we're friends.

703
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,560
I won't let anyone bully you again.

704
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,630
Friend.

705
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:50,910
I finally have a friend.

706
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,320
I finally have a friend.

707
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,080
Yes,

708
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,000
friends.

709
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,910
From now on,

710
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,120
you're my friend.

711
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,150
I won't let anyone

712
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,080
bully you later.

713
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,520
And

714
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,080
do you know what the most important thing

715
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,600
to be friends is?

716
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,080
Loyalty.

717
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,320
What's loyalty?

718
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,470
You should respect

719
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,560
your friend's decision

720
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,000
and consider

721
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,190
for your friend

722
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,190
even if your interest is harmed.

723
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:21,390
Understand?

724
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,040
Yes.

725
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,230
Tonight,

726
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,470
you sleep on the floor and I on the bed.

727
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,230
No problem.

728
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:27,760
OK.

729
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,950
From today on,

730
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,840
we're friends.

731
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,800
I won't let anyone bully you again.

732
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,560
Zhao Cuo,

733
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,230
it's the first day when we become friends.

734
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,280
I am too excited to fall asleep.

735
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,800
Really?

736
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,360
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

737
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,120
Me too.

738
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,430
Then look forward to tomorrow.

739
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,230
Brother,

740
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,320
I finally found you.

741
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,190
Although I can't tell you my identity for the time being,

742
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,840
I'll take good care of you.

743
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,630
What habit?

744
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,390
What are you doing here?

745
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:16,910
Go to work.

746
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,280
Brother,

747
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,910
morning.

748
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,760
Damn Zhao Cuo.
