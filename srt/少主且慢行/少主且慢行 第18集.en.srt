2
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,020
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,100
Episode 18

4
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,080
Young Lady, are you looking for me?

5
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,120
Yes.

6
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,870
Li Jia, I need you to tell Zhao Cuo that

7
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,160
this afternoon, I have something to tell him

8
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,550
at the bridge in the backyard.

9
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
OK.

10
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,870
You say Sanqi wants to see me?

11
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,360
Yes.

12
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,270
At the bridge this afternoon?

13
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,760
Yes.

14
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,669
She wants to elope with me, doesn't she?

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,830
Ah, this...

16
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,440
Let me tell you

17
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,880
actually,

18
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,880
two tactical plans have already been successful.

19
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:21,079
Sanqi must covet my handsomeness

20
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,000
and admire my talent and appearance.

21
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,960
But it never occurred to us that

22
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,670
there came the Young Lord.

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,750
So there's no way,

24
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,079
but we have to implement the third plan,

25
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,800
that is the elopement.

26
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,750
Brother Cuo,

27
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,190
I don't want to go to the capital

28
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,520
with Young Lord.

29
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,800
I want to be with you forever.

30
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,190
I want to elope with you.

31
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,750
Sanqi, don't worry.

32
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,030
I must take you out of here,

33
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,750
even if I will lose

34
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,720
my reputation in the future.

35
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,880
Ah, my dear!

36
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,030
You are so kind! Dear! Dear!

37
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,320
Honey!

38
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,240
Dear! Dear!

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,829
My honey!

40
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,910
Dear! Dear!

41
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,440
Wait a minute.

42
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,440
No, it should be like this.

43
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,520
Sister Qi.

44
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,320
Zhao Cuo.

45
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,520
From this day on, I will elope with you.

46
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,190
We will travel to the ends of the world and make our happy home everywhere.

47
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,360
Well.

48
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,520
You are the best swordswoman of southern city,

49
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,080
and I will follow you.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,160
We will travel to the ends of the world and make our happy home everywhere.

51
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,350
It is too bad that Young Master is really possessed.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,550
Sanqi,

53
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,830
Sanqi,

54
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,480
you've got something to tell me, right?

55
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,000
Do you remember I told you

56
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,670
I was looking for the brother?

57
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,920
He shows up and comes for you?

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,480
Yes.

59
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,350
Is he Young Lord?

60
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,230
Yes.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,480
I don't believe it.

62
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,230
When I knew it,

63
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,160
I was astonished as you were.

64
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,270
But he exactly is the brother

65
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,670
that made the

66
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,270
promise with me in the childhood.

67
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,830
I'm sure.

68
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,640
So what?

69
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,920
So I will go to the capital with him.

70
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,920
Just because of the stupid promise,

71
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,000
he comes and takes you away

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,159
whenever he wants.

73
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,040
I once made a promise with him

74
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,950
under the tree that

75
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,760
I would be with him forever.

76
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,320
Now, the entire Taoyuan City knows that

77
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,550
I will marry him.

78
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,320
God makes it happen.

79
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,200
I'm destined to be inseparable with him.

80
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,350
Destined?

81
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,760
I, Zhao Cuo, never believe in the destiny.

82
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,230
And I'm destined to be with you.

83
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,480
I'm sorry, Zhao Cuo.

84
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,640
I can't leave him alone again.

85
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,110
Did you ever consider how I feel?

86
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,670
Are you abandoning me?

87
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,790
Did you ever think that

88
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,920
if I keep staying with you,

89
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,880
Lord would blame us

90
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,110
and the whole Zhao's Mansion would be involved?

91
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,640
So what?

92
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,830
So I have to let you go?

93
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,720
It will be the best for everyone that

94
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,320
I go back and stay with him.

95
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,110
Is this your final decision?

96
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,110
Yes.

97
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,640
Well,

98
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,159
I can let you go.

99
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,440
But Tian Sanqi, remember

100
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,550
it's your own decision.

101
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,760
I, Zhao Cuo, only accept you as my lover all my life.

102
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,000
You are the only one I love,

103
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,670
and the only one I want.

104
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,550
Have you really made up your mind?

105
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,470
Actually, you don't have to.

106
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,790
If you don't want to go,

107
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,080
I'll beg my brother for you,

108
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,150
and beg for my dad's pardon.

109
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,960
I've made up my mind.

110
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,710
After the case of Gui Jianchou,

111
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,550
I've realized that

112
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,200
true love

113
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,400
is not about taking possession of

114
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,960
the other person.

115
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,550
If Zhao Cuo and I

116
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,110
hold on to this love,

117
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,470
it will only hurt more people.

118
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,470
But Sanqi,

119
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,030
do you love my brother?

120
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,670
Your brother talked to me a lot

121
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,110
about the story that

122
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,910
he left Shifang Village eight years ago,

123
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,230
and he felt sorrowful and unhappy.

124
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,670
I choose to go with him

125
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,320
because of the promise we made in the childhood.

126
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,760
The promise means a lot,

127
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,670
so I must obey it.

128
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,230
Comparing with Zhao Cuo,

129
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,400
your brother needs me more.

130
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,350
I also hope Zhao Cuo can understand me.

131
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,520
Zhao Cuo,

132
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,200
why are you drinking wine alone?

133
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,000
If there is a problem,

134
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,350
go to find Young Lord and make it clear.

135
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,280
Solve the problem

136
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,440
like a real man.

137
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,080
Bai Yifei, what are you talking about?

138
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,030
That's my brother.

139
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,910
Do you still want to marry me?

140
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,030
Lady Jinyan and Young Masters,

141
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,150
there's a letter from Young Lord that

142
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,230
he wants you to get to southern city quickly.

143
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,230
There is a command from Lord.

144
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,550
Stand down.

145
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,000
No way!

146
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,710
I won't marry Young Lord

147
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,760
of Qifan City.

148
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,760
Look,

149
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,520
it says the Lord of Qifan City will send

150
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,670
their Young Lord to come in person for

151
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,440
expressing the kindness

152
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,960
to our Taoyuan City,

153
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,440
wishing a intermarriage with our Taoyuan City.

154
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,000
Brother!

155
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,230
Ruoyao,

156
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,590
this is related to our relationship

157
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,840
with Qifan City.

158
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,280
Anyway,

159
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,520
you'd better see him first.

160
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,230
It's not too late to make plans

161
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,200
after you see him.

162
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,320
We must not be rude,

163
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,910
must we?

164
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,710
Mr. Zhao.

165
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,150
Yes.

166
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,710
Young Lord of Qifan City

167
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,000
will arrive at south city in a few days.

168
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,350
If Young Lord of Qifan City and

169
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,280
Lady Jinyan are satisfied

170
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,760
with each other,

171
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,080
according to what my dad said,

172
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,520
I myself will preside over the ceremony for them

173
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,840
to exchange name rings and get engaged to each other.

174
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,760
By then, I hope you can make good

175
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,640
preparations in advance.

176
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,030
I see,

177
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,790
I'll arrange it well.

178
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,320
Good.

179
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,110
What should I do?

180
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,030
What should I do?

181
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,760
What should I do?

182
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,080
What should I do?

183
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,150
Alas, Ruoyao, stop moving around;

184
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,150
I'm so dizzy.

185
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,110
Sanqi, what should I do?

186
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,400
How about escaping marriage as you did?

187
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,150
I'm afraid it's not good.

188
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,440
One side is Taoyuan City; the other side is Qifan City.

189
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,790
If Lady Jinyan of Taoyuan City escapes marriage openly,

190
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,710
Lord will lose face.

191
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,710
If so,

192
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,960
it would put the cat among the pigeons.

193
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,880
What should I do?

194
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,400
I've just found my true love.

195
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,350
I can't let that stupid

196
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,910
Young Lord take advantage of us.

197
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,080
What about Bai?

198
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,880
I have no idea.

199
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,910
I can only wait until

200
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,470
the Young Lord of Qifan City comes.

201
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,200
There will always be a correct way to deal with this problem.

202
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,280
Bai Yifei,

203
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,150
why do you hide from me?

204
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,760
No, I don't.

205
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,230
Come here, then.

206
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,640
Do you know how many times

207
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,550
I have come here today?

208
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,000
Do you know how long I've been

209
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,320
squatting here?

210
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,030
Just because my dad is going to

211
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,910
marry me to Young Lord of Qifan City,

212
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,470
you are scared, aren't you?

213
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,230
You dare not even fight for it?

214
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,840
I always think

215
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,110
as long as two people love each other,

216
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,640
it is unstoppable.

217
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,840
Love stays afar over the ocean, but it can be reached if love is true.

218
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:21,670
But

219
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,280
your marriage with him

220
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,910
is determined by your dad.

221
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,520
There is Young Lord

222
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,080
between you and me,

223
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,670
which is like a million miles away.

224
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,230
So you hide

225
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,280
and drink alone.

226
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,640
You don't even have the courage

227
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,400
to look at the ocean, right?

228
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:56,840
Well,

229
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,470
when Young Lord of Qifan City comes,

230
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
I'll marry him.

231
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,790
Take your time.

232
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,230
It pisses me off!

233
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,470
Who's that?

234
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,150
It's me.

235
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,030
Get over here.

236
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,069
I'm coming.

237
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,710
Oh, isn't this White Scrag?

238
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,310
Why do you become a mouse today?

239
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,680
Why do you come to me,

240
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,520
as I will be the lady of Qifan City's Young Lord?

241
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,950
I won't let

242
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,920
you marry him.

243
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,000
Did someone say that

244
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,590
he was a million miles away

245
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,110
from me like the ocean?

246
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:01,890
Oh!

247
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,190
I lost my mind after

248
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,920
hearing the

249
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,350
command of Lord.

250
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,280
So I was wrong.

251
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,280
Well,

252
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,950
then tell me how you're going to

253
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,040
fill up the ocean.

254
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,110
I will learn from Jingwei

255
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,560
to fill it with stones.

256
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,110
At last, I will fill it up.

257
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,760
What?

258
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,230
That is to say,

259
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,760
well...

260
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,040
When Young Lord of Qifan City

261
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,520
comes,

262
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,710
I'll surely make him give up.

263
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,800
If it doesn't work,

264
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,070
I will go find your dad at the Lord's

265
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,800
Mansion of Taoyuan City.

266
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,880
Even if it risks my life,

267
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,680
I will also make him take back his command.

268
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,760
Shorter!

269
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,760
Hmm...

270
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,280
Lower!

271
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,800
What if Young Lord of Qifan City

272
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,920
and my dad don't agree?

273
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,000
Hmm...

274
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,310
Are you willing to run away to

275
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,280
the ends of the world with me at the risk of

276
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,520
becoming a sinner

277
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,680
of the two cities?

278
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,080
Of course, I am.

279
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,000
But you might suffer

280
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,080
a lot with me.

281
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,350
Although I grow up in

282
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,830
a rich family,

283
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,560
I am not afraid of hardship.

284
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:29,830
Bai Yifei,

285
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,280
as long as you are determined,

286
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,400
I will go with you

287
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,190
wherever you go.

288
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,350
With your words,

289
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,280
I'll try my best to

290
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,040
make you happy.

291
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Bye-bye!

292
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,400
Bai Yifei,

293
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,590
what a coward you are!

294
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,310
I'm He Zhen, Young Lord of Taoyuan City.

295
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,720
I'm Qin Fu, Young Lord of Qifan City.

296
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,470
I'm Han Ming, the Bodyguard of Young Lord of Qifan City.

297
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,350
Thank you so much.

298
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,230
Young Lord.

299
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,400
Oh!

300
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
I heard Lord of Taoyuan City was going to marry Your

301
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,920
Lady Jinyan to me.

302
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,430
Where is she now?

303
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,400
And I want to see her.

304
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,350
Young Lord, oh damn.

305
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,800
He wants to see me at the first day.

306
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,640
So curious!

307
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,760
When you see Young Lord of Qifan City,

308
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,190
control yourself

309
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
and don't be rude.

310
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,830
Got it?

311
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,710
Yes.

312
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,880
Young Lord, please.

313
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,870
Young Lord.

314
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,160
Young Lord.

315
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,400
Is he blind?

316
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,640
Young Lord.

317
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,800
Did you call me?

318
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,070
I thought

319
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,680
I heard a fairy voice.

320
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,310
I'm flattered.

321
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,160
Lady Jinyan, do you know

322
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,880
what I see in your eyes?

323
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,310
Stars in the sky.

324
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:03,470
Stars are in the sky, but you are in my heart.

325
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,800
The corners of your eyes are like the sickle moon.

326
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,710
Young Lord,

327
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,640
it is the first time that we meet each other.

328
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,400
Don't say that.

329
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,080
No!

330
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,640
Although it is the first time,

331
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,830
your beauty

332
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,000
has already deeply shocked my heart.

333
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,280
It is like the current

334
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,230
going through my body.

335
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,230
I've already got our baby's

336
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,400
name in my mind.

337
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:32,950
The boy's name is Qin...

338
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,950
Young Lord.

339
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,920
I know I look good,

340
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,470
but it's not as exaggerated as you said.

341
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:44,040
And I don't want to have a baby with you.

342
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,190
No, that's no exaggeration.

343
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:49,920
Words can no longer

344
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,590
express your beauty.

345
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,920
Do you know

346
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,830
when I first met you,

347
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,680
I thought you looked very familiar,

348
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,160
just like my wife.

349
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,040
He Ruoyao, you must hold back.

350
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,880
Don't beat him!

351
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,350
Don't beat him!

352
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,160
But

353
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,800
my God, who can help me?

354
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,710
She must be tired.

355
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,400
Young Lord of Qifan City is a little bit flighty,

356
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,310
just like his name. His name is

357
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,040
so appropriate.

358
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,800
How is it going?

359
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,190
Are you happy to see future husband?

360
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,680
Do I look happy to you?

361
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,760
Don't tell me!

362
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,190
Though he is not as good as Mr. Bai,

363
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,560
he is Young Lord

364
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,520
of Qifan City.

365
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,470
You haven't seen him.

366
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,680
He must have graduated from the school of

367
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,190
vulgar chat-up lines.

368
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,640
Tian Sanqi, to be frank,

369
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,230
I won't marry him.

370
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,680
What should I do?

371
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,950
How about telling him directly?

372
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,590
Let him break off the engagement.

373
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,190
Young Lord,

374
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,640
today, I invite here to ask if you can tell

375
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,640
my dad that you want to break off the engagement?

376
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,190
Why?

377
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,160
My handsomeness, humor

378
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,590
and sweet words

379
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,520
can't touch you?

380
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,800
I really don't love you.

381
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,000
Tell me

382
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,040
how to make you love me.

383
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,590
Tell me

384
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,590
how to make you hate me.

385
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,350
No matter how, I will always love you.

386
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,070
Young Lord, how about this?

387
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,430
Let's regard it as a meeting by chance,

388
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,000
and then we forget each other, okay?

389
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,310
If you don't give me a reason,

390
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,310
I won't break off the engagement.

391
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,590
I've got the one I love.

392
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,680
I know, and I also love you.

393
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:58,350
Not you, Young Lord.

394
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,760
You don't want your future wife

395
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,880
to love someone else in her heart.

396
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,110
Is he Zhao Cuo of southern city?

397
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,520
No, how could it be him?

398
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,070
He's Bai Yifei of northern city.

399
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,800
Otherwise, I can't think of anyone.

400
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,830
It must be Bai Yifei of northern city.

401
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,040
Stop!

402
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,590
Bodyguard Han,

403
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,800
I heard that there was a fire in the posthouse last night.

404
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,760
How is Young Lord now?

405
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,800
Your Highness,

406
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,680
my Young Lord is alright.

407
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,310
It is the storeroom which stores tributes on fire.

408
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,310
The storeroom had been burnt.

409
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,070
The watchman died from burning in it.

410
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,710
Have you discovered the cause of the fire?

411
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,640
Not yet.

412
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,070
How about tributes?

413
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,680
The flammable ones have been burnt.

414
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,710
After counting the rest tributes,

415
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,640
it is tentatively found that

416
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,430
tree luminous pearls,

417
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,800
several pearl necklaces,

418
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,070
and three jade pendants have been stolen.

419
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,400
That thief must covet the tributes

420
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:03,920
of Qifan City.

421
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,350
He set fire and stole them during the night.

422
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,880
This is our oversight.

423
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,310
I'll find out

424
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,310
and give Young Lord an explanation.

425
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,560
Don't blame yourself.

426
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,880
You also don't want

427
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,160
it happen.

428
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,230
By the way,

429
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,230
I found this jade hairpin

430
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,590
in the storeroom,

431
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,400
hoping it may help.

432
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,310
Bai? Could it be Mr. Bai of Bai's Mansion?

433
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,710
What's up?

434
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,800
You know the master of this jade hairpin?

435
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,310
Wumeng,

436
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,430
go to Bai's Mansion to investigate it with my warrant.

437
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,280
If there's any evidence,

438
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,350
no matter who he is, bring him back.

439
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,880
I'll go with you.

440
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,110
OK.

441
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,310
Go buy some vegetables later; we have guests tonight.

442
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:56,950
Your Excellency,

443
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,950
what happened?

444
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,800
We're ordered to search for the suspect with Young Lord's warrant.

445
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,590
Go search!

446
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,070
Who are you?

447
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,880
Excuse me, Mr. Bai,

448
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,430
is this your hairpin?

449
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,470
Yes.

450
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,470
Your Excellency,

451
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,470
you guys, go in to search.

452
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes.

453
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,950
Hey, hey, hey,

454
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,070
what are you doing?

455
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,400
Hey, what are you going to do?

456
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,950
Your Excellency,

457
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,190
these are found in the room.

458
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:40,830
Mr. Bai,

459
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,440
please go with us for investigation.

460
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:44,870
Lord,

461
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,950
I've never done such things

462
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,470
like murdering,

463
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,520
setting fire and stealing tributes.

464
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,560
And I was in my own

465
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,640
mansion last night.

466
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,920
Servants in the mansion can vouch for me.

467
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,830
Yes, Young Lord.

468
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,190
My son is righteous, well-educated

469
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,110
and always able to follow the teaching of the saints.

470
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,280
He has never done things like murdering,

471
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,640
setting fire and stealing.

472
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,510
Please make it clear.

473
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,920
But why was the hairpin of Mr. Bai

474
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,310
found at the scene of

475
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,230
the fire?

476
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,400
This...

477
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,110
Brother, Young Lord Qin,

478
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,590
I think there are a lot of doubts about it.

479
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,950
I hope we can make a further plan after

480
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,950
finding out the truth.

481
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,470
What are the doubts?

482
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,590
He was caught with the loot.

483
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,640
Are you going to cover up

484
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,830
for the criminal?

485
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,350
Imperial Bodyguard Han,

486
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
as far as I know about him,

487
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,430
he wouldn't do

488
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,000
such bad things.

489
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,710
Since he is the son of Taifu Magistrate of northern city,

490
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,040
how could he covet the wealth of

491
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,710
the tributes?

492
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,000
Even if you guess right,

493
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and he is the criminal,

494
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,880
would he be foolish enough to

495
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,470
place those tributes in his own room?

496
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,680
When people see them, they'd

497
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,430
suspect him, right?

498
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,760
This case hasn't been ascertained yet.

499
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,640
When the evidence is conclusive,

500
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,230
I assure you that we will never let go of any of

501
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,880
bad guys.

502
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,400
But

503
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,470
we won't wrong a good man.

504
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:21,950
Bai Yifei.

505
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,920
Bai Yifei.

506
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,190
Don't be so depressed, OK?

507
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,710
I will find out

508
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,760
and prove your innocence.

509
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,070
If something really happens,

510
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,880
I'll share the burden with you.

511
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,520
Who on earth wants to frame me?

512
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,040
What's his intention?

513
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,710
If he doesn't make it this time,

514
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,160
he must make a further move.

515
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,040
Then I will make him expose himself.

516
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,280
Ah, wait, wait, wait.

517
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,950
I have an idea.

518
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,040
This case has been ascertained,

519
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,590
and we've found the criminal.

520
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,560
Who's the criminal?

521
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,190
The criminal is a servant of Bai's Mansion.

522
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,230
He saw the tributes you brought here,

523
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,310
and was moved to commit crimes.

524
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,400
We have caught him up.

525
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,520
He confessed everything

526
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,350
and he is in prison now.

527
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,710
As you say,

528
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,310
I'm wronging Mr. Bai.

529
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,230
Qin Fu, do I have to

530
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,160
tease you with my brother?

531
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,160
Oh, no!

532
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,870
I certainly believe you.

533
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,520
Anyway, the criminal has been caught,

534
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,310
so forget it.

535
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,310
I'm afraid you are conspiring to

536
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,160
cover up for the real criminal

537
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,920
by finding a scapegoat.

538
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,160
Bodyguard Han.

539
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,350
Bodyguard Han, what are you talking about?

540
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,640
I, Jinyan, would guarantee

541
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,950
Bai Yifei's innocence with my life.

542
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:57,950
No, no, no,

543
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,310
Ruoyao, my baby.

544
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,280
Stop arguing and listen to me.

545
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,400
The criminal has been caught,

546
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,190
so forget it.

547
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,040
Let's go!

548
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,080
Young Lord.

549
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
It's okay, let's go.

550
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
It is you.

551
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,870
Now you need to go with us.

552
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,840
Young Lord He Zhen,

553
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,390
what is it for at this late hour?

554
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,190
Han Ming? What's going on?

555
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,760
You guys?

556
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,560
Young Lord Qin Fu.

557
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,320
I'm going to ask you.

558
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,040
Why did you steal yourselves,

559
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,950
and order your henchman to murder, set fire

560
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,150
and frame Mr. Bai?

561
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,800
What, what are you talking about?

562
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,710
Why should I have done such things?

563
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,670
These are my own business.

564
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,190
It's not related to Young Lord.

565
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
He knows nothing about it.

566
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,520
Han Ming.

567
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,140
What on earth are you talking about?

568
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,600
Now that I'm caught, I confess.

569
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,840
You can do everything as you please.

570
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,120
Han Ming.

571
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,560
I command you to

572
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,390
say immediately.

573
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,520
I think maybe it is

574
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,910
because of the engagement between Young Lord and me.

575
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,840
You knew I loved Bai Yifei,

576
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,430
and I didn't want to marry Young Lord.

577
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,670
So you were moved to commit crime.

578
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,840
But Han Ming, did you know

579
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,000
you made a

580
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,390
stupid plan?

581
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,840
It is true, Han Ming.

582
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,710
I have done

583
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,840
so for the interest of Qifan City.

584
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,190
Bullshit,

585
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,000
Qifan City doesn't need to do

586
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,910
such things.

587
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,560
Before coming to Taoyuan City,

588
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,150
Lord called me specifically.

589
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,040
He told me that

590
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,910
apart from keeping

591
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,800
you safe,

592
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,120
I must make sure that

593
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,560
you could marry Lady Jinyan.

594
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,710
That day, I heard

595
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,520
Lady Jinyan said she didn't want

596
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,390
to marry you at the arbor

597
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,150
and she loved Mr. Bai.

598
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,800
And I made this plan,

599
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,710
so I must kill Mr. Bai.

600
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,670
If Lady Jinyan wants to

601
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,470
marry me, she will.

602
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,360
If she doesn't,

603
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,560
we can't force her.

604
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,280
How could you

605
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,600
do such despicable things?

606
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,000
Young Lord, it doesn't matter to me.

607
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,840
But you

608
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,430
must marry Lady Jinyan.

609
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,520
The hope of Lord and Qifan City

610
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,230
is on you.

611
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,350
Shut up!

612
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,950
You've done such a thing.

613
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,360
I have no face to ask for the engagement?

614
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,360
How can I

615
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,840
marry Ruoyao?

616
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,150
Young Lord,

617
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,800
Lady Jinyan,

618
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,120
please forgive me

619
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,230
if I have offended you before.

620
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,470
It's so happy to be with you.

621
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,040
And I really love you.

622
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,360
I wish you happiness with Mr. Bai all your life.

623
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,000
Thank you!

624
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,840
This case has been ended,

625
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,390
and Mr. Bai has been proved to be innocent.

626
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,910
You two can be

627
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:43,670
together justifiably.

628
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,600
So

629
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,080
do I deserve to be

630
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,040
the best detective of the capital?

631
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,040
Let me tell you

632
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,670
in celebration of Bai

633
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,630
Yifei regaining his innocence,

634
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,080
let's go to have a dinner in the restaurant today.

635
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,150
Great!

636
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,630
I will eat as much I can.

637
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,080
Thinking of the roast pigeon,

638
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,600
tender inside but crispy outside, fat but not greasy,

639
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,800
my mouth is watering.

640
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,910
OK, just enjoy yourself.

641
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,630
Let me tell you,

642
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,520
after you go to the capital,

643
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,280
you can't taste such

644
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,480
delicious food of southern city.

645
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,320
Um...

646
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,470
I mean

647
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,710
when Sanqi comes back next time,

648
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,560
it means she would have got married.

649
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,120
I'm sorry, and shut my mouth up.

650
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,430
This case has been ended,

651
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,600
and I am going to

652
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,320
the capital with Young Lord.

653
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,520
Are you leaving now?
