I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,780
Episode 6

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,910
Son,

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,229
why did you commit such a stupid act?

6
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,400
You did lose our ancestral house.

7
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,000
As the saying goes,

8
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,479
money will come and go.

9
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,440
People can't bring money with them when they were born or take money with them when they die.

10
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,120
Why did you kill people?

11
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,509
Dad,

12
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,040
are you crazy?

13
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,160
I didn't kill anyone.

14
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,680
You didn't?

15
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,680
As another saying goes,

16
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,000
there are three forms of unfilial conduct, of which the worst is to have no descendants.

17
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,360
Jinxin happens to be here.

18
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,440
I'll go out later.

19
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,670
You can consummate your marriage here

20
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,190
so that our family can have a descendant.

21
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,720
We Zhao family have had one son for seven generations in a row.

22
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,110
I don't allow you to leave no grandson for me.

23
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,630
Son,

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,390
if so,

25
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,000
how can I face the ancestors of our family?

26
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,720
Son, heard?

27
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,720
I am still alive, dad.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,960
Zhao Cuo,

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,520
tell me everything

30
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,630
about what happened that day.

31
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,460
Do you really want to investigate into the case?

32
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,600
OK.

33
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,750
We should make every possible effort.

34
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,670
Don't look down upon on me.

35
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,110
I…

36
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,320
I am good at

37
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,910
investigating into cases.

38
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,630
OK.

39
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,550
Then I'll tell you in detail.

40
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,880
Think over

41
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
whether there was anything special

42
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,910
before you passed out.

43
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,470
That day

44
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
after I went there,

45
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,520
I waited for a long time.

46
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,440
Seeing no one came,

47
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:17,800
I wanted to leave.

48
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,000
However, when I left,

49
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,079
there was a mist in front of me.

50
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,880
Mist?

51
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,720
Yes.

52
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,800
Then

53
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,550
I had hallucinations,

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,800
there was a purple light before me

55
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,190
and I passed out.

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,320
Purple light?

57
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,600
People usually have hallucinations

58
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,960
after being poisoned.

59
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,320
You must have been poisoned by someone.

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,360
He trapped you on purpose.

61
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,630
The murderer was so sinister.

62
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,910
Who wanted to trap my son?

63
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,240
It's a pity that letter is gone.

64
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,830
Recall carefully

65
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,190
whether there is any clue

66
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,630
about the handwriting on the letter.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,760
No.

68
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:24,950
Jinxin.

69
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,160
Mr. Bai, why are you here?

70
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,040
I come to help you investigate into the case.

71
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,480
That day,

72
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,790
you said ruthlessly,

73
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,670
so I worry about you…

74
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,070
I worry about the safety of you and Zhao Cuo.

75
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,880
Thank you.

76
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,880
Well,

77
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,480
have you found any clue?

78
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
No.

79
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,830
According to Zhao Cuo,

80
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,390
he seemed to have hallucinations that day.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,070
There was double vision before him.

82
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,159
Before he passed out,

83
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,760
there was a purple light before him,

84
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,000
so I suspect

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,790
the murderer let us think the dead committed suicide

86
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,550
after stunning them

87
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,480
in the same way.

88
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,200
But the dead showed no signs of being poisoned.

89
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:04,950
Wait.

90
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,670
The purple light you just mentioned

91
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,830
reminds me of something.

92
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,640
What?

93
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,040
I am not sure.

94
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,760
Go. Let's go and have a look in the study.

95

[Collection of Herbal Medicines]

96
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,440
Let me help you.

97
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,230
Wait.

98
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,880
I will, I will find it soon.

99
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,830
I found it.

100
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,160
Where?

101
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,350
Yes, it's just this plant.

102
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,550
Datura stramonium.

103
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:15,300
[Datura stramonium grows in the desert of the West Regions.]

104
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,920
Datura stramonium is poisonous

105
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,230
and people in the Western Regions usually use decomposing corpses as fertilizer to grow it.

106
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,270
Its juice is colorless and tasteless after made into poison.

107
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,510
The poisoned person becomes weak and has hallucinations.

108
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,040
And he can see purple light after passing out.

109
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,670
This is just the symptom of Zhao Cuo.

110
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,880
He is OK after poisoned,

111
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,390
showing this poison isn't fatal.

112
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,830
You're right.

113
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,950
It also says in the book

114
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,200
the toxins can make people have hallucinations

115
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,070
and weak.

116
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,000
But they can be excreted directly

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,110
with sweat and urine

118
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,230
in three days,

119
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,920
so it's so hard to check such poison.

120
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,480
The murderer knew

121
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,760
to make poison with such a strange flower of the Western Regions

122
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,070
and frame Zhao Cuo,

123
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,159
so he must have premeditated it.

124
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,200
It seems that

125
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,440
the death of Yang Yong and Wen Xiao isn't the simple suicide.

126
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,640
Let's go to the mortuary now.

127
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,320
Open your mouth.

128
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,830
It can remove the stinking smell.

129
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,270
What do you want to do?

130
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,830
Perform an autopsy.

131
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,830
Miss,

132
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,160
how can you

133
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,950
do such a scary thing?

134
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,600
Let me do it,

135
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,200
OK?

136
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,159
The poison in the body of a living person

137
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,640
is excreted in three days.

138
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,480
After the corpse decomposes a few days later,

139
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,950
the toxins will go deep into the bone marrow,

140
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,720
so now we only

141
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,440
have a way to figure it out.

142
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,070
That is, check whether there is such poison

143
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,000
after we get blood from the joint of the corpse.

144
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,060
Where are you?

145
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,550
Look, I found something.

146
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,550
As expected, the blood marrow becomes dark.

147
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,070
When a coroner checks a corpse,

148
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,000
once he finds it has no fatal injury

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,320
or the signs of being poisoned,

150
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,880
he'll ask people to close the coffin and bury the corpse hurriedly.

151
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,200
The murderer is so careful.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But he didn't expect

153
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,200
such poison still survived well in the decomposing corpse

154
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,640
and its toxins could enter the bone marrow.

155
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,669
Look.

156
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,640
It's the same as we thought.

157
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,200
The three dead people were all poisoned with datura stramonium.

158
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,910
Yes.

159
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,030
So I think

160
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,960
it is

161
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,640
a serial-murderer case.

162
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,710
The murderer first stunned two people with datura stramonium,

163
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,000
killed them, and let us think they committed suicide

164
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,790
in order to

165
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,000
blind the investigating people

166
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,550
and frame others.

167
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,030
But Yang Yong

168
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,590
jumped into the river and drowned himself

169
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,760
in public.

170
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,470
How can we explain it?

171
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,880
I also can't figure it out.

172
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,710
There is a print.

173
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,550
Be careful.

174
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,150
After the paper boat is put on the river,

175
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,110
it goes with the water and can't be found.

176
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,470
And you should also be careful

177
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,350
with the surging undercurrents.

178
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,110
Don't fall into the river.

179
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,670
What did you say?

180
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,280
Repeat it.

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,640
I asked them to be careful

182
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,150
not to fall into the river

183
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,110
as the river is full of surging undercurrents.

184
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,790
No. No.

185
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,470
The previous sentence.

186
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,400
After the paper boat is put on the river,

187
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,280
it goes with the water

188
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
and can't be found.

189
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,350
That's it. I'll go back to my mansion.

190
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,520
It can't work out.

191
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,670
I said it should be the same tall and big as you.

192
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Young Lady,

193
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,200
please tell me

194
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,710
what you want to do.

195
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,590
You'll know tomorrow.

196
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,000
Sorry.

197
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,440
Master,

198
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,790
you've sighed a lot.

199
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,520
Well,

200
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,710
let me tell you.

201
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,590
I wonder how this case works.

202
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,790
We often hear a man saves his woman

203
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,840
and the husband protects his wife.

204
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,760
But Cuo…

205
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,470
Master, don't worry. Don't worry.

206
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,670
Young Lord will be OK.

207
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,200
I know that.

208
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,230
But now I find Jinxin

209
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,910
is increasingly reliable.

210
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,400
She knows

211
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,230
to care about us.

212
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,080
But I don't how whether she can solve the case.

213
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,400
Don't worry. Sanqi…

214
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,440
Sanqi?

215
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,910
I mean…

216
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,710
Who is Sanqi?

217
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,280
Anyhow,

218
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,000
the case will be solved, right?

219
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,840
Well, I…

220
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,550
So don't worry.

221
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,640
Well.

222
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,110
Young Lady is so clever,

223
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,790
so she can solve it for sure.

224
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,030
Right? There is no problem.

225
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,760
No problem. No problem.

226
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,790
No problem.

227
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,520
No problem.

228
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
No problem.

229
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,110
That's right.

230
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,710
Young Lady,

231
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,440
are we investigating the case?

232
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,110
Why do you need a doll?

233
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,320
Make an experiment.

234
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,440
Throw it to the river now.

235
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,350
Stop being so surprised.

236
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,320
Throw now.

237
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,880
Go. Let's have a look in the lower reaches.

238
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,790
This is where Yang Yong's corpse was salvaged.

239
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,550
How long did the doll float down the river?

240
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
One hour and 45 minutes.

241
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,520
That's strange.

242
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,080
That day, when the officers and soldiers were salvaging Yang Yong's corpse,

243
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,400
they found it here

244
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,230
in two hours.

245
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,080
At the speed of the current,

246
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,000
the corpse should float farther.

247
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,350
Maybe it was blocked by the reefs

248
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,440
in the river.

249
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,910
Impossible.

250
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,910
The water is deep enough

251
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,470
to sail boats,

252
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,640
so there aren't any reefs.

253
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,470
And there was no sign of a collision

254
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,670
on Yang Yong's corpse.

255
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,320
Have you found it?

256
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,590
Yes.

257
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,280
Great.

258
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,550
We finally found the first piece of evidence.

259
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,670
What can this prove?

260
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,280
If I guess right,

261
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,400
Yang Yong had been tied to an iron chain

262
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,230
and sunk into the river.

263
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,400
The iron chain was connected to the gaily decorated boat,

264
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,670
so the corpse didn't float far.

265
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,550
And the person jumping down from the view boat

266
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,710
wasn't Yang Yong himself.

267
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,760
Then who was that person?

268
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,960
If we find him,

269
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,000
we can also find the murderer.

270
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,150
Wen Xiao didn't commit suicide

271
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,020
but was killed by someone.

272
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,230
At least, at least

273
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,080
a young and strong man

274
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,400
could hang him

275
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,350
from the beam

276
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,350
after killing him.

277
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,440
But the range is too big.

278
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,910
Most guests are young and strong men

279
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,910
in the whorehouse.

280
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
No. Before the music master came,

281
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,670
it's proven no one

282
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,640
could enter this room,

283
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,230
so it formed a typical secret chamber.

284
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,590
I guess

285
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,080
the murderer must have been in this room.

286
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,520
After we entered, he mingled in the crowd.

287
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,280
The murderer must have hidden among us.

288
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,670
You,

289
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,200
procuress of the whorehouse,

290
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,760
Zhao Cuo,

291
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,440
Leimo,

292
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,000
Liang Xiangsong and I.

293
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,760
There were a total of these people.

294
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Liang Xiangsong died.

295
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,840
When the tweedle sounded,

296
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,710
Leimo was performing

297
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,000
and the procuress of the whorehouse was also off the stage.

298
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,760
Mr. Bai,

299
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,200
do you still remember?

300
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,400
According to the music master of the whorehouse,

301
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,110
he got that score

302
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,000
from Mr. Zhang

303
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,110
of the tailor store in southern city.

304
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,000
It's said Mr. Zhang helped Lan's Troupe

305
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,760
make many costumes three years ago.

306
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,320
According to the music master,

307
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,590
the three dead people are all related to

308
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,200
the then murder case of the Lan family.

309
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:14,880
I think

310
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,670
we must go to visit

311
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,470
Mr. Zhang.

312
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,150
Sir, lady,

313
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
our store provides complete cloth

314
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,080
and novel design.

315
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,670
Mr. Zhang,

316
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,540
[You live downstream by the Yangtze River]

317
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,520
we don't want to make clothes.

318
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,550
I want to ask

319
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,470
whether this score

320
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,590
belonged to you.

321
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,280
Do you want to ask what happened to the Lan family three years ago?

322
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,470
How do you know?

323
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,200
Ghosts of the Lan family who had been killed for no reason came to revenge these days.

324
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,910
The cases in which three young masters were killed

325
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,110
were discussed widely.

326
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,110
I knew

327
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I would be asked about it sooner or later.

328
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,790
What actually happened to the Lan family

329
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,960
three years ago?

330
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,590
I know nothing

331
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,880
but the whole family was killed in a fire.

332
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,190
Did no one

333
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,560
of the Lan family survive?

334
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,589
In fact, one survived.

335
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,190
Really?

336
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,109
Back then, Troupe Leader Lan, his wife

337
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,950
and his daughter were killed in the fire,

338
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,710
but Troupe Leader Lan's apprentice survived.

339
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,230
He is called Lan Muyan.

340
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,880
He is Troupe Leader Lan's apprentice,

341
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,620
but in fact he was the adopted son of the Lan family

342
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,780
as Troupe Leader Lan and his wife treated him so well.

343
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,590
Where is

344
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,520
Lan Muyan now?

345
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,190
Is he still in southern city?

346
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,040
I don't know.

347
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,880
After his family had the accident,

348
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,430
he came to me once.

349
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,640
He was covered with dirt

350
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,640
and seemed to climb out of the fire.

351
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,880
He didn't say anything to me

352
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,950
but asked me for some money.

353
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,430
Seeing he was so pitiful, I gave him.

354
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,400
What about later?

355
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,230
Where did he go later?

356
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,070
I don't know.

357
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,710
I haven't seen him again later.

358
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,110
Could Lan Muyan perform on the stage

359
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,160
when he was in the Lan family?

360
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,880
Yes.

361
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,470
He performed female roles since he was a kid

362
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,590
and often performed the same plays with Lan Mudie

363
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,070
on the stage.

364
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,710
How was the relationship between Lan Mudie and Lan Muyan?

365
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,800
Troupe Leader Lan treated him

366
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,920
so well.

367
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,800
I think he probably wanted Lan Muyan to be his son-in-law.

368
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,190
I see.

369
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,760
According to Mr. Zhang,

370
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,470
if Lan Muyan is still alive,

371
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,000
we can know the then truth

372
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,280
only by finding him.

373
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,950
There is such a big world.

374
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,640
Where can I find him?

375
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,760
There is something wrong.

376
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,430
There is something wrong.

377
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,040
Master Bai

378
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,710
will have Young Master beheaded.

379
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,040
Zhao Cuo,

380
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,760
what else do you want to say?

381
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,190
I didn't kill anyone.

382
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,590
So stubborn and reluctant to admit your crime.

383
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,280
Stop that, damn old man.

384
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,110
You usually think my dad is a corrupt official.

385
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,190
You're just a corrupt official.

386
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,800
You.

387
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,800
Well.

388
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,110
Now I sentence

389
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,830
Zhao Cuo is found guilty of

390
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,470
the murder of the three people.

391
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,230
Make way. Make way. Make way.

392
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,190
I didn't kill anyone.

393
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,470
Cuo.

394
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,000
Stop.

395
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,000
Brother,

396
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,560
I won't let anyone kill you.

397
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,580
Leave here.

398
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,660
What,

399
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,040
what do you want to do?

400
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,950
Stop aside.

401
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,760
Master Bai,

402
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,710
you failed to keep faith.

403
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,560
You promised me.

404
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,190
Zhao Cuo is indeed guilty,

405
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,000
so I don't need your permission.

406
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,160
Behead him.

407
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,280
Stop.

408
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,350
I know who the murderer is.

409
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,560
Your Excellencies,

410
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,190
this case has been solved.

411
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,110
The real murderer

412
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,110
is just in this room.

413
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,710
Ridiculous.

414
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,160
Then tell us

415
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,710
who the murderer is here.

416
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,280
It's just her, Leimo.

417
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,350
Miss, please don't wrong me.

418
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,280
I am so weak.

419
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,830
How could I kill three young masters?

420
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,280
Surely you could kill them.

421
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,310
But you

422
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,110
couldn't create

423
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,310
such smart crime scenes

424
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:05,920
alone.

425
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,350
In fact, if you

426
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,800
didn't frame Zhao Cuo,

427
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,680
I might not prove

428
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,950
how you actually finished

429
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,680
these murder cases

430
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,640
and created

431
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,560
such a perfect alibi forever.

432
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,400
After Zhao Cuo told me

433
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,350
his symptom after being poisoned and passed out,

434
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,590
I had some clues.

435
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,710
Then, then what's the poison that stunned Cuo?

436
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,310
Datura stramonium.

437
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,310
Such poison is colorless and tasteless and can't leave any trace in the body

438
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,430
until the corpse decomposes.

439
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,070
Common coroners can't find it at all.

440
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,950
This is also the reason

441
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,520
why the two cases are deemed as suicides.

442
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,760
I found the residual datura stramonium flower juice

443
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,310
in the bones of Yang Yong and Wen Xiao.

444
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,190
After some investigation,

445
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,160
I finally understand

446
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,230
how Leimo

447
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,070
finished these cases.

448
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,070
First of all, she knew the music master eavesdropped

449
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,350
the talk of Yang Yong and the other two persons.

450
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
He wanted to blackmail them three by her.

451
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,230
So she turned his trick to her own use.

452
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,110
Here's the point next.

453
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,230
Leimo could finish these murder cases

454
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,400
and create

455
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,350
such a perfect alibi,

456
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,800
showing you're not the only murderer.

457
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
She also had a helper.

458
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,160
This helper could help her kill people

459
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,760
and replace her

460
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,800
to appear before us.

461
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,470
In the murder case of Yang Yong,

462
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,430
Leimo first plotted

463
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,710
to lure Yang Yong to enter the gaily decorated boat.

464
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,160
Leimo's accomplice first hid beside.

465
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,400
After Yang Yong appeared,

466
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
the accomplice stunned him with poisonous datura stramonium powder,

467
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,640
took off Yang Yong's clothes

468
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,760
and let us think he committed suicide.

469
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,680
After they drowned Yang Yong,

470
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,430
they first fixed Yang Yong's corpse

471
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,310
with an iron chain at the bottom of the boat

472
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,800
to prevent it from floating on the river in advance.

473
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,430
After that, on the gaily decorated boat, the false Leimo sang

474
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,040
“You Live Downstream by the Yangtze River”,

475
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,640
creating Leimo's alibi.

476
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,560
After hearing the tweedle signal,

477
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,470
the real Leimo went

478
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,950
into the sight of the crowd in Yang Yong's clothes,

479
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,110
pretended the false impression of being possessed by the tweedle

480
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,190
and jumped into the river.

481
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,590
Then Leimo went back to the gaily decorated boat quietly

482
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,950
and released Yang Yong's corpse.

483
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,560
After the corpse floated on the river,

484
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,590
it went with the river,

485
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,190
letting others think

486
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,710
Yang Yong jumped into the river to commit suicide.

487
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,920
In this way,

488
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,880
Leimo finished Yang Yong's suicide scene

489
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,590
and created the perfect alibi

490
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,950
for herself.

491
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,110
Yang Yong's corpse

492
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,680
also met the appearance

493
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,350
of a truly drowned person.

494
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
However, you forgot the speed of the current.

495
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,430
Through my experiment,

496
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,430
according to the time when Yang Yong jumped into the river,

497
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,560
his corpse should

498
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,520
be found in a place more west of the trestle road.

499
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,400
But you ignored the time

500
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,310
when Yang Yong struggled and died when being trapped at the bottom of the gaily decorated boat

501
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,590
and you united the iron chain,

502
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,160
thus shortening the moving distance

503
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,230
of the corpse.

504
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,000
I remember in the second case,

505
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,400
Leimo was the last one to enter the room.

506
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,040
Back then, there was no second person

507
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,400
but her in the room.

508
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,640
In fact, Leimo didn't

509
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,560
perform on the stage at all.

510
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,040
She kept staying in this room.

511
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
What?

512
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,280
Am I right,

513
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,070
Leimo?

514
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,520
Yes.

515
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
First of all, I eavesdropped

516
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,190
the talk between the music master and Wen Xiao,

517
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,040
so I hid in the room in advance.

518
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,190
To blackmail Wen Xiao,

519
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,470
the music master asked him to meet in the room,

520
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,350
so I added datura stramonium powder

521
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,710
to the wine pot in the room.

522
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,470
I asked someone to delay the music master,

523
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,520
so Wen Xiao first entered the room.

524
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,680
Then I hid inside the room

525
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,800
and waited for Wen Xiao's appearance.

526
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,800
Wen Xiao loved drinking so much.

527
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,190
After knowing he would be blackmailed,

528
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,040
he felt unhappy

529
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,520
and would drink the wine I prepared.

530
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,640
After he passed out,

531
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,640
I hung him from the beam and let others think he committed suicide.

532
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,350
Then I began to play “You Live Downstream by the Yangtze River”,

533
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,560
creating the false impression that Wen Xiao was killed by the tweedle

534
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,160
and attracting your attention.

535
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,950
It's “You Live Downstream by the Yangtze River”.

536
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,400
A room upstairs.

537
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:53,920
Go.

538
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,920
After you went upstairs,

539
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,680
I hid behind the door.

540
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,350
After you entered,

541
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,190
you would be attracted by his corpse

542
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,710
and ignored my existence.

543
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,680
And I

544
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,070
mingled in the crowd

545
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,310
quietly at this time

546
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,110
and pretended a faint.

547
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,230
Leimo.

548
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,400
I think the person performing on the stage

549
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,920
was also Leimo's substitute back then.

550
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,350
When others panicked,

551
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,470
she left quietly

552
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,190
and let them think

553
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,430
it's the real Leimo who performed on the stage.

554
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,710
Then when others asked,

555
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,830
she deliberately revealed the music master's clue

556
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,680
and attracted others to go there.

557
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,190
So she had the chance to kill the third person,

558
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,830
Liang Xiangsong,

559
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,880
and framed Zhao Cuo.

560
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,470
But Leimo is a weak woman.

561
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,560
How could she carry

562
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,190
an adult man?

563
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,160
No, Leimo isn't a woman

564
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,680
but a man.

565
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,110
Am I right,

566
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,160
Lan Muyan?

567
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,520
Lan Muyan?

568
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,310
The adopted son Lan Muyan of the leader of Sifu Troupe?

569
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:10,710
Yes.

570
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,400
That day, I learnt from Mr. Zhang

571
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,560
of the tailor store in southern city

572
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,310
not all the four people of Sifu Troupe

573
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,430
had been killed

574
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,070
and Lan Muyan survived.

575
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,880
And Lan Muyan learnt to perform female roles since childhood,

576
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,350
so he resembles a woman in both figure and tune.

577
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,520
Then I began to suspect him

578
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,830
and figured out everything.

579
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:36,800
Yes,

580
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,160
I am just Lan Muyan.

581
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,710
Yang Yong, Wen Xiao and Liang Xiangsong were all killed by me.

582
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,000
Their death is not to be regretted.

583
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,280
Since you found it,

584
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,190
take me away

585
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,040
and deal with me as you like.

586
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,000
No,

587
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,800
you haven't told us your accomplice yet.

588
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,740
You couldn't finish

589
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,350
these murder cases alone.

590
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,230
These cases were all plotted

591
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,560
and carried out by me.

592
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,800
That person was just exploited by me.

593
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,070
I already killed her.

594
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,070
I don't think so.

595
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,160
When I came to question you with Mr. Bai that day,

596
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,110
I already felt strange.

597
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,230
Here is empty

598
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,400
without any heavy furniture.

599
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,830
Why are there cumulative scratches?

600
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,760
I think there must be a secret chamber

601
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,110
behind this cabinet.

602
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,160
Is it used to hide someone?

603
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,520
Don't talk nonsense.

604
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,310
There isn't any secret chamber

605
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,680
in such a big room.

606
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,640
You were Lan Mudie's substitute

607
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,680
in Sifu Troupe back then.

608
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,470
If she couldn't perform, you could replace her.

609
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,520
The people of Sifu Troupe were killed

610
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,920
and you created such astonishing revenge cases.

611
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,400
I believe Lan Mudie must have joined you.

612
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,640
Nonsense.

613
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:55,710
Mudie,

614
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,880
Mudie already died.

615
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,560
Muyan,

616
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,230
stop talking.

617
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,710
Tell them everything.

618
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,590
I am just Lan Mudie,

619
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
the second murderer

620
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,430
you want to find.

621
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,830
What? You're just Lan Mudie.

622
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,230
Why do you wear a veil?

623
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,760
Remove it.

624
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,590
I wear it to avoid frightening you.

625
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,680
Now Muyan and I revenged my dead parents,

626
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,430
so we will receive the following punishment

627
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,590
without any complaint.

628
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,710
Why?

629
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,710
Why must you

630
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,560
kill them three?

631
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,800
Were they really related to

632
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
the murder case of Sifu Troupe?

633
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,760
This matter

634
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,040
is a very heavy memory to Mudie.

635
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,640
Let me tell you.

636
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,950
Lan Mudie, Young Master.

637
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,800
Lan Mudie.

638
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,830
Young Master, Lan Mudie.

639
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,710
Lan Mudie is coming.

640
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,350
She is going downstairs. Look now.

641
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,920
So pretty.

642
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,310
She is indeed so pretty.

643
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,000
Pretty.

644
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,040
Lan Mudie.

645
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,470
Beauty Lan comes out.

646
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,830
[Music note]

Good.

656
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:30,710
Lan Mudie. Lan Mudie. Lan Mudie.

657
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,070
Since we Sifu Troupe

658
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,470
gave the premiere,

659
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,310
we became so popular.

660
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,350
Mudie was greatly favored by guests.

661
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,230
Inevitably,

662
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,880
she was targeted by those shameless men.

663
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,560
Sirs, your dish.

664
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,310
Waiter.

665
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,230
Where is Lan Mudie?

666
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,190
Call Lan Mudie here

667
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,560
for me now.

668
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,470
Sorry, sir.

669
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,560
My lady only performs on the stage, but doesn't accompany guests.

670
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,160
What the hell?

671
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,470
Do you know who I am?

672
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,950
I am the son of General Yang of southern city.

673
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,640
If you don't obey me,

674
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,400
I won't let your troupe

675
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,000
exist for a day.

676
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,920
Sir. Terribly sorry, sir.

677
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,560
Well.

678
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,350
Fu, leave first.

679
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,680
Let me take care of them.

680
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,430
But lady…

681
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,950
It doesn't matter. Leave first.

682
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,400
Yes.

683
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,280
Here you come.

684
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,400
Well.

685
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,430
As long as

686
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,830
you listen to me

687
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:44,110
obediently,

688
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,950
I'm sure you Sifu Troupe

689
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:52,110
develop smoothly in southern city.

690
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,040
Sirs,

691
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,280
the performance of our troupe finished today.

692
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,040
I'll propose a toast to you

693
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,080
as an apology here.

694
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:17,280
You should accompany us to drink heartily.

695
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,320
Come on. Drink. Drink.

696
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,230
Sir,

697
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,080
please show me due respect. Sir.

698
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:36,600
Show you due respect?

699
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,469
I'll tell you

700
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,360
what respect is.

701
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,429
Go now.

702
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,469
Go.

703
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,000
Go.

704
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,670
Wait.

705
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,560
What's up?

706
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,150
Let's go, Yang Yong.

707
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:05,760
Don't stop here.

708
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:06,870
Well.

709
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,390
What if Lan Mudie reports to the government

710
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,280
after waking up?

711
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,560
If my dad knows

712
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,800
I did this,

713
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,840
he'll beat me to death.

714
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,560
If my dad knows this,

715
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,190
he won't let me go.

716
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,710
Say

717
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,390
what we can do now.

718
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,560
In for a penny, in for a pound.

719
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,360
Let's burn Full Moon House.

720
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,150
A dead person

721
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,080
can't tell anything.

722
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,040
Burn it.

723
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,390
Go.

724
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,080
Zhao.

725
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,860
Mudie.

726
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,540
Mudie.

727
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,430
Mudie, what's wrong with you?

728
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,000
Are you OK?

729
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,040
Muyan,

730
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,470
it hurts a lot. It hurts a lot.

731
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,360
It doesn't matter.

732
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,320
I'll save you out now.

733
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:22,870
Help, help, help.

734
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,910
Help.

735
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,950
Is there anyone?

736
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,150
Help.

737
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,000
Help me now.

738
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,190
Help. Help.

739
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,000
Help me now.

740
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,630
Is there anyone?

741
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,080
Is there anyone?

742
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,120
Help.

743
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,320
Is there anyone?

744
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,080
Is there anyone?

745
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,280
Help.

746
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,520
Help me out.

747
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
Is there anyone?

748
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,150
Someone.

749
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,230
Help.

750
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,630
Someone.

751
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,870
Let me out.

752
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:14,000
Help me. Help me.

753
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,040
Let me out.

754
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,700
Someone.

755
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,630
Mudie.

756
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,520
Help me.

757
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,150
Help.

758
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:27,360
Help. Help.

759
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,280
Someone, please.

760
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,800
Is there anyone? Is there anyone?

761
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,470
Muyan.

762
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,140
In this way,

763
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,360
Mudie and I survived luckily.

764
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,320
But the three bad men

765
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,870
not only raped Mudie

766
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,950
but also set fire and killed my adoptive parents.

767
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,520
From that time on, I swore

768
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
I must revenge them.

769
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,840
Since you both survived,

770
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,470
why didn't you report to the government?

771
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,840
Report to the government?

772
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,630
We know Yang Yong

773
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,670
is the son of General Yang.

774
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,910
You must know

775
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,390
the great power of General Yang in southern city.

776
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,120
How could we common people

777
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,600
win this lawsuit?

778
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,630
I already revenged my parents,

779
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,230
so I have no regret.

780
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,560
Our death

781
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:28,950
is worthwhile.

782
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,080
Datura stramonium flower grows in the Western Regions.

783
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,360
Common people can't get it.

784
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,320
How did you get it?

785
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,600
Don't ask about it again.

786
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,230
You'd better not know it.

787
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,390
Zhao Cuo

788
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,800
favors you.

789
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,670
Why did you hurt him?

790
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,910
Watch the mysterious person.

791
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,150
The mysterious person?

792
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:03,840
Mr. Zhao,

793
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,190
the case was solved.

794
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,280
You're guiltless,

795
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,870
so you can leave.

796
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,080
He Jinxin

797
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,000
looks foolish,

798
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,000
but she solved the case quickly.

799
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,670
Congratulations on your release, Young Master.

800
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,180
[Congratulate the Whirly of Southern City on his release]

801
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:47,950
Young Master.

802
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,800
Stop this. Stop this. Stop this.

803
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,470
You hope everyone knows I was put into prison.

804
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:53,840
Right?

805
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,470
Keep the banner.

806
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,840
Young Master,

807
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,390
I miss you so much.

808
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,430
You should thank Young Lady sincerely this time.

809
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,080
I think without her,

810
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,280
I wouldn't see you.

811
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,870
Come on.

812
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,390
Where is she?

813
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,320
She, she is waiting for you there.
