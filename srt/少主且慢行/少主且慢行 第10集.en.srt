[English subtitles are available.]


2
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,020
I've Fallen for You


3
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,100
Episode Ten


4
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,080
I'm back.


5
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,550
It has been eight years.


6
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,759
My little Medicine Pot has finally grown up.


7
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,120
Look.


8
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,590
When cherry blossoms on the tree become in full bloom for the eighth time


9
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,830
and the petals are flying all over the sky,


10
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,039
I will be back.


11
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,680
Xue…Xuewei.


12
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,120
Zhao Cuo,


13
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,360
who's she?


14
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,800
She's my…


15
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,830
Maidservant.


16
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,440
I'm the Young Master's maidservant, Sanqi.


17
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,910
Hello.


18
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,630
Oh.


19
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,240
Nice to meet you.


20
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,190
My name is Duan Xuewei.


21
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,160
I'm Zhao Xu's fiancée.


22
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,270
Then, Young Mistress,


23
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,880
I'll leave you alone.


24
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,079
Miss Sanqi!


25
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,600
It's so late.


26
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,520
What were you doing with Zhao Cuo in the tub?


27
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,800
I'm here to help Young Master look for his jade pendant.


28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,829
His jade pendant was lost.


29
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,470
Did you find it?


30
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,270
No.


31
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,360
I'll look for it right away.


32
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,880
Right away.


33
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,030
Sorry.


34
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,190
I'm so clumsy.


35
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,750
Don't bother with the jade pendant.


36
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,670
He has drawers of this kind of things.


37
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,880
It doesn't matter.


38
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,550
Just go back to sleep.


39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,470
Zhao Cuo!


40
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,190
You'd rather die than marry me?


41
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,030
Am I such an annoyance to you?


42
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,520
You are not an annoyance.


43
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,360
You are a pain in the ass,


44
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,470
you troublemaker!


45
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,880
I don't want to marry you.


46
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,240
She's like an angel,


47
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,390
much prettier


48
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,720
and much sweeter than you!


49
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,520
I will never marry you!


50
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,190
It turns out the girl Zhao Cuo has been waiting for


51
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,960
is Miss Duan.


52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,440
She's really an angel,


53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,520
much prettier than me.


54
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,750
Tian Sanqi, what are you thinking?


55
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,160
Zhao Cuo is not your husband.


56
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,360
Why are you comparing yourself to Miss Duan?


57
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,829
Oh,


58
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,440
stop thinking about it.


59
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,910
Stop it!


60
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,670
Miss Jinxin.


61
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,270
Mr. Bai,


62
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,160
what are you doing here?


63
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,550
Is Duan Xuewei here?


64
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,760
Yeah.


65
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,000
I didn't know Zhao Cuo's girlfriend is so pretty.


66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,600
Why didn't you guys mention it?


67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,790
That's not right.


68
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Why are you all wet?


69
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,480
It's windy at night.


70
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,200
Don't catch cold.


71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,920
No, no need.


72
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,600
I don't feel cold.


73
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,880
In fact, I feel so hot.


74
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,830
Wet clothes can cool me down.


75
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,230
You don't have to push yourself in front of me,


76
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,720
you know?


77
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,830
Hmm.


78
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,510
Growing up with Zhao Cuo,


79
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,200
you must know a lot about them.


80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,880
Do you really want to listen?


81
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,640
Yeah.


82
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,070
At the age of ten,


83
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,880
My father and Zhao Cuo's father


84
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,510
assumed office at the same time.


85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,230
Miss Xuewei and her mother


86
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,790
came here to practice medicine from Chisang.


87
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,510
That's when


88
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,830
the three of us met.


89
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,950
Hello, my name is Bai Yifei.


90
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,440
Are you drawing something?


91
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,550
Look. What's this?


92
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,070
Listen, how about you teach me to draw


93
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,720
and I give you this?


94
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,320
How's he doing?


95
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,390
I've given him an acupuncture treatment.


96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,070
He'll wake up soon.


97
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,790
You are awake!


98
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,000
Who are you?


99
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,110
My name is Duan Xuewei.


100
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,230
I'm from Chisang.


101
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,480
I'm new in the southern city.


102
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,200
Let's be friends.


103
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,480
Your dad still doesn't allow you to go out?


104
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,830
No.


105
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,350
Dad said I'm still sick.


106
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,040
I'm bored.


107
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,110
I can play with you.


108
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,070
I see you there, Zhao Cuo!


109
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,600
Stop hiding!


110
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,230
Medicine Pot,


111
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,600
we've met before.


112
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,040
Why are you pretending not to know me?


113
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,920
Let's play together!


114
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,320
After Miss Duan left,


115
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,600
Zhao Cuo smiled rarely.


116
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,040
Then there was some misunderstanding between our fathers,


117
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,880
so we went separate ways.


118
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,510
Now I finally know


119
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,110
why he said I disturbed him.


120
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,160
If I hadn't married him,


121
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,230
he would have been Miss Duan's husband.


122
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,720
Maybe it's just fate.


123
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,790
Whether you're together or apart,


124
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,760
it's decreed by fate.


125
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,670
No.


126
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,550
I can't let everything


127
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,600
continue to go wrong.


128
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,000
I must give Zhao Cuo back to Miss Duan.


129
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,440
Then everyone will happy.


130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,880
Will you be happy?


131
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,710
Of course!


132
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,789
Why don't you ask Zhao Cuo


133
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,760
how he really feels?


134
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,400
Wow,


135
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,880
you almost sidetrack me.


136
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,840
You don't think Zhao Cuo loves me, do you?


137
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,320
Haha.


138
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,230
You've got it all wrong!


139
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,350
Miss Duan is so pretty,


140
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,910
just like the stars in the sky.


141
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,350
How can I catch his eyes?


142
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,760
Miss Jinxin, have you ever heard of the story


143
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,150
about a casket and pearls?


144
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,550
There was a man


145
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,910
who spent a lot of money to buy a casket of pearls.


146
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,910
However, he threw away the pearls


147
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,350
and just kept the casket.


148
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,960
Everyone laughed at the fool,


149
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,960
because he didn't know the beauty of pearls


150
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,670
and chose the rotten wood.


151
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,440
But I don't think he's a fool,


152
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,960
because he knows what he loves.


153
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,110
Nothing else could catch his eyes.


154
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:45,790
Hey, wait!


155
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,030
Are you saying I'm the rotten wood?


156
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,910
I'm not!


157
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,590
I just need someone


158
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,080
who really knows my value.


159
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,840
Oh,


160
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,110
you are sidetracking me again!


161
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
It's getting late.


162
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,670
I have to go.


163
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,150
I have a thing for you, but you have nothing for me.


164
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,080
You don't know the one who knows your value is just behind you,


165
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,000
while you have never looked back.


166
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,350
Alas.


167
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,640
Well…


168
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,590
Thank you for being here tonight.


169
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,910
And thank you for telling me this.


170
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,080
Good night.


171
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,030
Good night.


172
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,030
Here, this is your favorite chicken leg.


173
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,520
Have some.


174
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,110
Why aren't you eating?


175
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,550
You used to love chicken legs, right?


176
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,110
Does your taste change?


177
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,590
Yeah.


178
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,550
Our Young Master hates eating


179
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,710
chicken breasts, chicken legs and chicken wings.


180
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,550
They have a strange smell.


181
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,030
Young Master likes pig hearts, sheep hearts and cattle hearts.


182
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,150
Everything with a heart


183
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,550
is our Young Master's favorite.


184
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,440
Right, Young Master?


185
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,030
Leave us.


186
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,440
Oh, I know.


187
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,230
I'll cook animal hearts for you, OK?


188
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,710
Hmm.


189
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,320
Hey, Sanqi,


190
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,640
sit down and eat with us.


191
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,550
No, thanks.


192
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,840
I'm just a servant.


193
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,640
I can't eat at the same table with Young Master and Young Mistress.


194
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,350
Oh,


195
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,470
forget the servant thing!


196
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,640
We are not particular about it at Zhao's Mansion.


197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,670
Alright,


198
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,150
let' have breakfast.


199
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,550
Come on!


200
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,230
Sanqi, have some.


201
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,200
I'm so lucky to have you take care of


202
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,150
this self-willed and spoiled man.


203
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,230
You're welcome, Miss Xuewei.


204
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,640
Hey, Sanqi,


205
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,320
you know what?


206
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,470
Although I come from Chisang,


207
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,760
I don't like


208
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,710
Chisang's food at all.


209
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,760
Oh.


210
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,080
Then you must miss


211
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
those delicious food in the southern city.


212
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,590
Right.


213
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,080
Hey, how about this?


214
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,440
Let's go to the market together later.


215
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,910
All right?


216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,030
Yeah, OK.


217
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,520
Have some food.


218
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,200
Make your choice.


219
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,030
Wavering between them


220
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,080
would only hurt them both.


221
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,230
I thought she wouldn't come back.


222
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,350
I didn't expect her return.


223
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,000
You've been waiting for her,


224
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,350
while she's been waiting for you.


225
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,960
I don't know.


226
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,320
Sanqi is a good girl.


227
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,030
So is Xuewei.


228
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,080
Think over it.


229
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,150
If you hurt Miss Sanqi,


230
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,880
I'll take her away at any time.


231
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,550
Father.


232
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,150
Leave us.


233
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:37,880
You wanted to see me?


234
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
You know, Zhen,


235
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,110
my illness is growing worse and worse.


236
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,910
No, Father.


237
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,760
I'm sure you will get better.


238
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,670
I know my condition.


239
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,670
I have a wish.


240
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,280
Zhen,


241
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,080
can you go out


242
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,320
and get my daughter-in-law back


243
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,350
to fulfill my wish?


244
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,350
Father.


245
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,280
Please allow me


246
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,000
to go out instead of my brother


247
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,200
to look for my sister-in-law.


248
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,440
Father,


249
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,230
you see, you haven't recovered yet.


250
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,150
My older brother


251
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,760
should stay here to help you with the government affairs.


252
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,470
I am a young girl,


253
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,520
but I'm as good as any man in intelligence and martial arts.


254
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,200
You didn't see


255
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,790
how I beat up those guards


256
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,150
when I was practicing martial arts this morning.


257
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,200
You know what?


258
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,590
You are not like a girl at all.


259
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,350
Father,


260
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,550
my little sister is very smart.


261
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,640
If you send her out this time,


262
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,590
maybe she could achieve good results.


263
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,110
Since your brother said so,


264
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,790
I'll leave it to you.


265
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,550
But I have one condition.


266
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,670
You must wear men's clothes.


267
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,200
Do not reveal your identity.


268
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,440
And don't lose your temper like a spoilt gril,


269
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,350
bullying others.


270
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,840
Dad!


271
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,030
Humph! How could you say that?


272
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,840
Fathers always tell their daughters


273
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,110
not be bullied after leaving home.


274
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:30,590
But what about you?


275
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,320
I'm just a vulnerable girl.


276
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,080
Who could I bully?


277
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,710
A vulnerable girl?


278
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,230
You are such a bratty princess!


279
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,150
It's more troublesome to raise you than ten boys.


280
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,230
Thank you, brother,


281
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,230
for putting a good word for me with our father.


282
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,640
You clever girl!


283
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,840
I know you've got itchy feet.


284
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,960
I'd rather set you free and let you enjoy yourself


285
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,670
than see you sneak out.


286
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,350
Now tell me. What's the big case you are going to solve, Mr. He?


287
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,310
You really know me!


288
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,040
Don't worry, brother.


289
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,800
I'm always loyal to friends.


290
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,829
Since you helped me,


291
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,640
I won't let you down.


292
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:14,880
Rest assured.


293
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,230
This Young Lady…


294
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,710
I won't let her enter the mansion smoothly.


295
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,280
If necessary…


296
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,880
How about making her vanish?


297
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,520
Huh? Stay within limits.


298
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,680
Don't go too far.


299
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,040
Don't worry,


300
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,110
I'll make it clean.


301
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
You left Zhao Cuo and returned to your hometown


302
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,680
to treat his nightmare disorder?


303
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,040
Right.


304
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,760
But after coming back this time,


305
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,110
I feel we are not as close as before.


306
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,160
He must be angry with me.


307
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,800
Then why don't you tell him?


308
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,830
When he was young,


309
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,400
Zhao Cuo often fall into a nightmare


310
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,190
and woke up in the middle of the night.


311
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,680
I used my mother's prescription to treat him,


312
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,430
but it didn't go well.


313
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,950
I had to stick around him every night.


314
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,710
Seeing how much he suffered,


315
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,350
I just wanted to grow up quickly


316
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,350
and cure him as soon as possible.


317
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:31,400
No. No. No!


318
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,350
It's fine.


319
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,070
I'm here with you.


320
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,950
But after coming back this time,


321
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,160
I feel relieved.


322
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,070
Thank you so much.


323
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,160
Thank me?


324
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,560
This time,


325
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,680
I can see Zhao Cuo looks great and his pulse condition is steady.


326
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,070
I think


327
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,520
you must have taken good care of him.


328
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,430
Besides, Zhao Cuo talked a lot about you.


329
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,950
He said you are smart and competent,


330
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,950
working in the office


331
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,160
to help his father solve cases.


332
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,190
Not really.


333
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,710
By the way,


334
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,640
tomorrow


335
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,800
I'll move to the magistrate's office.


336
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,280
Why are you leaving?


337
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,070
It's more convenient to handle cases there.


338
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,070
You can come to me when you are free.


339
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,560
OK.


340
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,920
I think we really hit it off.


341
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,070
Later on,


342
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,520
let's be good friends, all right?


343
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,230
Young Master! Young Master!


344
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,040
Bad news!


345
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,830
Young Mistress…


346
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,160
She's gone.


347
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,520
Where did she go?


348
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,400
Did she go to Bai Yifei?


349
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,160
That's not the case.


350
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,950
She moved to the magistrate's office.


351
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,280
To the magistrate's office?


352
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,950
Yeah.


353
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,000
Living in that decaying house?


354
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,590
Yeah.


355
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,350
With the errand boys?


356
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:40,760
Yeah!


357
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,070
Damn it!


358
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,470
Don't move.


359
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,350
They don't have fresh meals in the magistrate's office.


360
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,400
What if she gets an upset stomach?


361
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,800
Go to the storeroom right now


362
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,880
and see if there are


363
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,520
any groceries.


364
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Then have some servants to help you carry them.


365
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,350
Yes.


366
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:02,830
Young Master.


367
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,280
Why should I go there?


368
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,040
Turn around.


369
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,400
Bring groceries to Young Mistress!


370
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,160
Got it, Young Master!


371
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,310
Hey, Li Jia.


372
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,350
You are back?


373
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,000
Is Jinxin at home?


374
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,640
Ling and I have a lot of good stuff for her.


375
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,230
Come. Let's go inside.


376
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,760
You little brat!


377
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,230
I've just been away for a few days!


378
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,190
And you cause me such a big trouble!


379
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,000
Huh?


380
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You kicked Jinxin out of the house.


381
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,280
And there is a strange woman in the house!


382
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,830
What do you mean by strange woman?


383
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,640
You know Xuewei!


384
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,590
Isn't that strange?


385
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,430
Huh?


386
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,920
She's been away for eight years.


387
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,760
Eight years!


388
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,110
And you thought about her day and night like a man without a soul.


389
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,040
What are you to her?


390
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,950
An inn


391
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,400
where she could check in and out at any time?


392
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,640
You are an inn!


393
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,310
Why did she go?


394
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,400
She left to treat your son's nightmare disorder!


395
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,190
She has studied medicine at her hometown


396
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,350
for eight years!


397
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,430
Then how about Jinxin?


398
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,710
Are you going to be a two-timing man?


399
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,760
Men of the Zhao Family


400
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,310
are always loyal to their partners from generation to generation!


401
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,640
How could you be such a swinger?


402
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,230
Tell you what,


403
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,000
I won't accept the promise you made as a young boy.


404
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,560
I'll get Jinxin back.


405
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,950
Wait to clean up the mess!


406
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,470
Ling, let's go!


407
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,310
Jinxin,


408
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,160
look at you!


409
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,830
You've lost weight after leaving home for a few days.


410
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,160
Really?


411
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,430
You married into our house


412
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,800
in a legal manner.


413
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,230
How could you move out?


414
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,590
After dinner,


415
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,430
I'll ask them to bring your luggage back.


416
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,230
Master.


417
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,830
I've prepared the certificate of divorce.


418
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,430
Zhao Cuo and I will no longer be husband and wife.


419
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,760
And I'm going to live in the magistrate's office.


420
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,230
What?


421
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,000
The certificate of divorce?


422
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,560
You little brat!


423
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,800
You are going to divorce Jinxin?


424
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,110
What are you talking about?


425
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,070
When did I say I was going to divorce you?


426
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,590
You don't have to go anywhere.


427
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,160
Just stay here.


428
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,000
That's right, Cuo.


429
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,350
Since you are still a couple


430
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,760
and you don't want Jinxin to leave,


431
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,000
then…


432
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,310
Master,


433
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,070
I have something to say.


434
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,470
Master, Ling,


435
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,000
these days,


436
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,680
I heard about their story.


437
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,520
What they have gone through


438
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,760
reminds me of a childhood friend of mine.


439
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,000
I know better than anyone


440
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,190
how it feels when you miss someone while you can't see him.


441
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,680
Also, I understand


442
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,920
what it is like to wait for someone you care about.


443
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,560
They finally managed to get together.


444
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,800
I hope you can support them.


445
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,160
You ask me to support them?


446
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,470
Yes.


447
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,560
I'm the one who should go.


448
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,070
Master, Ling,


449
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,920
please forgive my rudeness.


450
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,400
I shall leave.


451
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,830
Xuewei,


452
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,110
you don't have to


453
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,350
take my father's words to heart.


454
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,880
It's not what your father said.


455
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,190
Then what's it?


456
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,950
I just received a letter today.


457
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,230
My mother introduced me to


458
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,680
the Ghost Buster's Clinic in the southern city,


459
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,760
so that I can study medicine with the doctor.


460
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,470
I will report to the clinic tomorrow.


461
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,920
That's great.


462
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,560
In fact, after I leave,


463
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,430
you can ask Miss He to move back here.


464
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,590
It's not good for a girl


465
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,280
to live in the magistrate's office.


466
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,160
Besides, when I'm not around,


467
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,400
she can take care of you,


468
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,070
which really makes feel relieved.


469
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,310
Xuewei, I…


470
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,110
You don't have to explain anything to me.


471
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,560
I trust you.


472
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,040
Whoever you meet,


473
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,950
you'll always come back to me in the end.


474
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,430
Right?


475
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,920
Bye.


476
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,680
Oh.


477
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,110
Master,


478
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,000
you want to see me?


479
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,110
But let me be clear.


480
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,190
No matter what you say,


481
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,230
I won't go back.


482
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,000
Jinxin!


483
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,350
Oh, I know you're disappointed.


484
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,590
I won't try to persuade you.


485
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,350
Just do whatever you want.


486
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,190
However,


487
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,640
I have something to discuss with you this time.


488
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,560
Those who kidnapped you earlier


489
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,160
are found.


490
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,830
Really?


491
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,260
Where are they now?


492
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,590
Oh, they are dead.


493
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,590
Huh? How could it be?


494
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't know.


495
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,590
They just said dead bodies were found on a barren hill


496
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,560
in Shifang Village, Baifang County.


497
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,760
What's going on?


498
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,000
Ah, many problems


499
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,710
have arisen in Baifang County lately.


500
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,560
It gives me a headache at the thought of it.


501
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,310
What happened?


502
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,190
I hope my parents are fine.


503
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,400
Just now,


504
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,830
Master was asking for my advice.


505
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,680
Two official documents were sent here


506
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,110
together with the kidnappers' news.


507
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,040
Both documents


508
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,590
are from Baifang County,


509
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,560
saying that a plague broke out in Baifang County.


510
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,760
A plague?


511
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,470
Is it serious?


512
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,070
Oh, it's not very serious.


513
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,640
Although many people are infected,


514
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,110
there have been no reports of fatalities.


515
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,280
What about the other document?


516
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,830
Oh, it says in Baifang County,


517
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,800
a plasterer surnamed Liu


518
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,950
clashed with a ritualist


519
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,160
in Taoyuan Temple


520
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,880
and murdered him.


521
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,760
Baifang County sent an official document demanding his death sentence.


522
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,430
A plasterer surnamed Liu committed murder?


523
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,880
That's impossible!


524
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,800
How do you know it's impossible?


525
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,920
Liu is a neighbor of my family.


526
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,760
He's a good guy.


527
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,680
How could he be a murderer?


528
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,230
Oh, Jinxin.


529
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,160
the two cases are the reason


530
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,920
why I asked you to come.


531
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,710
These government affairs


532
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,470
really give me a headache.


533
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,590
Oh, oh, oh!


534
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,640
Master, how about this?


535
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,430
Let me go to Baifang County to investigate the cases.


536
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,160
I will definitely


537
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,070
figure out everything.


538
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Sanqi comes from Shifang Village in Baifang County.


539
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,290
Oh.


540
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,000
She's probably worried about her families in the village.


541
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,230
That's why she's so anxious to go.


542
00:27:59,230 --> 00:27:59,950
I think so.


543
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,560
Ling,


544
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,760
what do you have in mind?


545
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,070
Just let her go.


546
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,830
She's so smart.


547
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,070
There should be no problem.


548
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,520
Fine. You are the boss.


549
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,520
OK.


550
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,470
I'll leave it in your hands.


551
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,160
Now I appoint you


552
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,710
as the Special Constable of the Taifu Magistracy of southern city.


553
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,000
You shall go on an inspection in disguise.


554
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,590
Be careful.


555
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:24,950
Of course.


556
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,640
Thank you, Master.


557
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,470
Good day, officer.


558
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:39,950
Jinxin!


559
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,800
I heard you have cases to solve in Baifang County.


560
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,190
Please let me go with you.


561
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,280
If you run into danger,


562
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,000
I can protect you.


563
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,880
Thank you so much, Mr. Bai.


564
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:58,990
Yeah.


565
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:06,830
Young Master.


566
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,520
Where is He Jinxin?


567
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:16,640
I don't know.


568
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,040
This morning, Master called her to his office.


569
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,400
I haven't seen her since then.


570
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:21,880
Leave us.


571
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,710
Where did she go?


572
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,170
Young Master.


573
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,520
Are you looking Young Mistress?


574
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,160
You saw her?


575
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,310
This morning,


576
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,310
I saw her and Mr. Bai


577
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,760
talking at the door of the magistrate's office.


578
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,950
Then they rode


579
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,000
towards the city gate.


580
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,160
They eloped?


581
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,230
But it makes sense.


582
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,680
If I were her,


583
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,160
the Young Mistress of the house


584
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,110
who was suddenly swept out


585
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,230
by another woman,


586
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,070
I would also run away.


587
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,710
Oh!


588
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,560
Old man, I need some troops.


589
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,760
Troops?


590
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,190
Yeah.


591
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,160
For what?


592
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
To arrest people.


593
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,280
Are you crazy?


594
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,950
I don't mind the small troubles you make.


595
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,190
But now, you want to call out troops to arrest people?


596
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,430
Who are you going to arrest?


597
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,590
He Jinxin and Bai Yifei!


598
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,430
They eloped.


599
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,640
Young Master,


600
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,160
who told you they eloped?


601
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,350
We don't know Bai Yifei's whereabouts,


602
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,430
but He Jinxin left for Baifang County.


603
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah.


604
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,520
She went back to Baifang County?


605
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,000
Yeah.


606
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,040
Her parents' home?


607
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,710
Your kidnappers were found dead


608
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,280
on a hill there.


609
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,310
And a plague broke out in Baifang County.


610
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,070
Jinxin called for an investigation,


611
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,350
so I sent her there.


612
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,920
Oh. I see.


613
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,430
What's wrong with you, old man?


614
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,110
You asked a girl


615
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,400
to run into danger herself!


616
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,000
Why didn't you tell me?


617
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,520
And Bai Yifei…


618
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,520
Right,


619
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,230
Bai Yifei must be planning to save her in distress and be her hero.


620
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,040
I can't let that happen.


621
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,920
Just wait, old man.


622
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,950
I'll have it out with you when I get back.


623
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,000
Hey!


624
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,280
Sir, a plate of steamed stuffed buns, please.


625
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,350
Another woman dressed as a man.


626
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,920
It's interesting.


627
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,400
She must not be a common girl.


628
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,950
What's her purpose to come here?


629
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,760
Why does this young man in indigo


630
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,760
keep staring at Sanqi?


631
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,350
So frivolous.


632
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,590
Sir, your steamed stuffed buns.


633
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,470
You…


634
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,110
You are the blind guy who kidnapped me that day!


635
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,350
Don't run.


636
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,400
Stop!


637
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,110
Stop!


638
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,830
Stop!


639
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,350
Don't run!


640
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,640
Stop!


641
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,200
Stop!


642
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,230
Zhao Cuo, catch the man in front.


643
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:56,760
Giddyap!


644
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,350
Let's go!


645
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,430
It's you, fatty!


646
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,070
Tell me,


647
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,590
why did you want to kidnap Zhao Cuo?


648
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,800
Who's behind you?


649
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,470
Say it!


650
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,350
You felt good


651
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,160
when beating me, didn't you?


652
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,710
I'll tell you everything.


653
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,800
A man came to our boss…


654
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,870
Catch them!


655
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,280
Great!


656
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,190
How dare you commit murder under broad daylight?


657
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,360
We have witnesses and evidence.


658
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,190
No, no, no!


659
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,840
We didn't kill him!


660
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,630
Stop quibbling.


661
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,230
You have the weapon in your hand


662
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,000
and we see no one else here.


663
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,870
If it's not you, who could it be?


664
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,190
Guards!


665
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,080
Arrest them!


666
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,909
How dare you!


667
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,040
I'm the Special Constable from Taifu Magistracy of southern city.


668
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,949
The Magistrate sent me to investigate the case.


669
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:55,710
This is Zhao Cuo, son of Taifu Magistrate of southern city.


670
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,600
And this is Bai Yifei, son of Taifu Magistrate of nothern city.


671
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,390
Mr. Zhao. Mr. Bai.


672
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,520
Sorry for not recognizing you.


673
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,710
This is a misunderstanding.


674
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,320
I'm Qin Fang, head of Baifang County.


675
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,800
The body…


676
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,520
He's one of the kidnappers


677
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,000
the Taifu Magistrate of southern city ordered to search for.


678
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,950
We just caught him


679
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,950
and was about to question him.


680
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,120
But a group of men in black came out and killed him.


681
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,560
Men in black?


682
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,710
Where are they?


683
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,840
They were defeated by us


684
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,320
and run away.


685
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
Who the hell are they?


686
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,470
Why did they try to kill us?


687
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,190
Gentlemen,


688
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,910
this is not a good place to talk.


689
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,470
Let's go to the county office.


690
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,320
You know what?


691
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,390
If I hadn't been there in time,


692
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,800
you could have been in danger.


693
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,710
Why didn't you tell me you went out?


694
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,520
This is official business.


695
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:55,850
Besides,


696
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,070
I don't have to tell you everything.


697
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,430
It's none of your business.


698
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,320
What do you mean it's none of my business?


699
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,040
You are my wife!


700
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,080
Isn't it my business?


701
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,230
Hey!


702
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,560
Zhao Cuo.


703
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,390
That's not true.


704
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,190
Now that you have chosen Miss Xuewei…


705
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,110
Piss off!


706
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,710
And Miss Sanqi has left your home!


707
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,950
Hurry up!


708
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,280
Your Excellency.


709
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,240
Be seated, please.


710
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,390
I was wondering…


711
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,430
Master,


712
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,910
there is a person outside,


713
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,230
saying she's the inspector


714
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:51,670
from the capital of Taoyuan City.


715
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,710
And she would like to meet you.


716
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,440
My name is He Ruoyao.
