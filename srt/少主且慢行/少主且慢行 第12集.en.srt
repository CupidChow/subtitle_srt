Let's go.

Hey, do you hear that

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,120
His Excellency has caught the criminals

Oh, they were caught so soon.

Yes.

13
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,270
I heard that two thieves

wanted to sneak into His Excellency's mansion for assassinating him last night.

Oh, no.

How did you know it?

107
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,230
When I first went to the temple,

108
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,440
I felt very strange.

109
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,640
It was very bustling in the temple,

110
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,960
but the hall and statue were very old.

111
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,200
After asking about it,

112
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,080
I learnt that you forbade refurbishing the statue.

113
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,880
That day

114
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,790
I smelt the carrion in the hall

115
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,960
but I didn't find the corpse.

116
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,280
The statue is hollow.

117
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,550
I think

118
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,230
you hid the corpse

119
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,470
in the statue,

120
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,230
so you forbade refurbishing the statue.

121
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,280
I sneaked into your back room

122
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,320
and saw Qin Fang's memorial tablet last night.

123
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,550
The corpse hidden in that statue

124
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,080
is the real Qin Fang, right?

125
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,710
You disguised as Qin Fang and worked as the county magistrate in Baifang County.

126

I thought this secret

129
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,000
would be kept forever.

130
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,030
But that old abbot did not listen to me

131
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,110
but insisted on refurbishing the statue.

132
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,590
That's why you killed the abbot

133
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,790
and framed the plasterer, right?

134
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,080
Now that you all have guessed it,

135
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,440
let me tell you a story.

136
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,790
I'm indeed not Qin Fang.

137
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,200
In fact, Qin Fang is my master,

138
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,440
and I'm just

139

My real name is Liu Qi.

141
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,000
Back then, Qin Fang passed the examination

142
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,760
and was dispatched to work as the county magistrate in Baifang County.

143
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,880
He came here with his wife and me,

144
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,230
but he didn't know that

145
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,520
his wife and I,

146
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,110
his wife and I were childhood sweethearts

147
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,790
who grew up together,

148
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,350
but we couldn't be together

149
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,840
because of our status.

150
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,470
I wanted to see her more,

151
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,960
so I served him by his side.

152

158
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,230
I've had enough of such life.

nobody knows us, OK?

162
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,030
OK.

163
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,350
In order to destroy the evidence,

164
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,440
I hid my master's corpse

165
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,550
into the statue in the hall of the temple.

166
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,520
After I calmed down,

167
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,230
I decided to

168
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,910
make this temple bustling

169
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,110
all the time.

170
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,030
I also hired an abbot to clean the statue

171
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,880
and worshipped him by setting up a memorial tablet at home.

172
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,790
So you replaced him

173

and came to take office in Baifang County.

174

Yes.

175
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,790

176
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,230
and did more good deeds

177
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,280
to atone for my sins.

178
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,710
But you didn't expect that

179
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,790
the abbot hired by you refurbished the statue

180
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,880
before informing you

181
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,470
and then found your secret.

182
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,880
After the abbot discovered the corpse in the statue,

183
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,550
he guessed I was the murderer

184
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,110
and came to ask me about it.

185
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,790
I, I…

186
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,590
I, I had no choice

187
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,350
but to

188
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,400
kill him.

189
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,590
Then, then I imputed it to the plasterer.

190
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,550
But these are all old things.

191
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,790
Why did you spread

192
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,760
a man-made plague in Baifang County?

193
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,550
I always wonder

194
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,470
how you discovered the clue in the well.

195
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,840
Because I

196
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,910
found the residue of Biluo Root by the well.

197
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,710
Then I thought of

198
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,670
the big water vats in your mansion,

199
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,880
so I associated these two things.

200
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,320
In the beginning, I just thought that

201
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,280
you put poison in the well

202
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,760
to spread a man-made plague

203
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,280
for blocking off Baifang County

204
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,030
so that you could kill

205
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,470
those people you wanted to kill.

206
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,400
Later, you ordered the clinic to distribute herbs

207
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,470
and secretly added the powdered Biluo Root to herbs

208
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,840
for imputing it to the doctor.

209
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,280
However, even if you had a careful plan,

210
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,000
you were still thoughtless.

211
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,440
Well water has strong self-purification ability.

212
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,440
In order to maintain Biluo Root's toxicity

213
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,670
in the well water,

214
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,840
you must put

215
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,790
Biluo Root in the well at set intervals,

216
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,710
so I could discover

217
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,910
the residue of Biluo Root by the well.

218
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,960
At the same time, in order not to be poisoned,

219
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,910
you stored a lot of clear water in your mansion.

220
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,230
Because of

221
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,350
all these clues,

222
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,670
I started to doubt you.

223
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,080
I shouldn't underestimate you.

224
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,030
So we deliberately spread the news that

225
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,000
the well water is poisonous in the village

226
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,400
to catch your attention.

227
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,470
Then Zhao Cuo and Bai Yifei

228
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,640
waited for windfalls,

229
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,760
while Jinxin and I

230
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,440
went to your room for evidence.

231
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,550
Unexpectedly, we really found the conclusive evidence

232
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,080
Biluo Root.

233
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,000
But I

234
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,110
have a question for you.

235
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,520
You had deceived everyone

236
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,550
and became Qin Fang,

237
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,150
but why did you take the risk

238
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,000
of being a murderer?

239
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,880
To kill those damned people.

240
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,200
Who are damned people?

241
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,520
No comment.

242
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,790
No comment?

243
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,960
Open your eyes and look at us.

244
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,000
Consider the current situation.

245
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,790
You are not an official

246
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,880
but a criminal.

247
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,910
Just tell us

248
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,080
everything you know.

249
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,470
What if I make a confession?

250
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,670
Is the man in black the evil backstage manipulator?

251
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,200
Is your Biluo Root

252
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,760
given by the man in black?

253
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,470
As a county magistrate,

254
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,000
you couldn't get it at all.

255
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,960
You would better stop finding it out.

256
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,150
Now that the man in black escaped today,

257
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,150
you can pretend that you had never seen him.

258
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,440
You don't know

259
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
what kind of force

260
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,470
you're facing at all.

261
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,000
Why did you become a murderer for them?

262
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,760
You could be Qin Fang all the time.

263
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,320
But they found me.

264
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,200
They knew that you replaced Qin Fang

265
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,110
and threatened you with it?

266
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,910
Yes.

267
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,150
In this case,

268
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,080
why don't you

269
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,470
tell us everything,

270
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,760
including the real identity of the man in black

271
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,030
so that we can find out the truth?

272
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,470
Then you can redeem your sins by it.

273
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,910
OK.

274
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,280
I'll tell you.

275
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,710
Your Excellency.

276
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:47,960
Your Excellency.

277
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,150
Your Excellency, hold on.

278
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,200
I call a doctor for you right now.

279
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,880
Go to chase him!

280
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,350
Your Excellency, hold on.

281
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,400
I call a doctor for you right now.

282
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:09,560
Just, just give up.

283
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,829
You can't defeat them.

284
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,349
Your, Your Excellency.

285
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:26,430
Did you chase him?

286
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:47,680
How is he?

287
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,070
Does Young Master get better?

288
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,040
He suffers a severe internal injury

289
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,640
and needs to recuperate slowly.

290
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,400
When can he wake up?

291
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,040
I just treat him through acupuncture

292
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,920
and prescribe some medicines for recuperation.

293
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,160
He may wake up in a few days.

294
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:06,760
That's good.

295
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,590
Xuewei, give me the prescriptions.

296
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,110
I'm going to buy the medicines.

297
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,800
Thank you, Sanqi.

298
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:14,950
But I can do it.

299
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,800
Well,

300
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,560
what else can I

301
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,000
do for you?

302
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,560
No need.

303
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,160
From now on,

304
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,470
I'll take care of

305
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,560
Zhao Cuo personally.

306
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,400
I'll always accompany him

307
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,590
to prevent him from being hurt again.

308
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,310
What do you mean?

309
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,000
It's not Sanqi's fault.

310
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,110
I don't mean it.

311
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,230
Stop that.

312
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,400
[Quandui Hall]

313
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,710
Wait a minute.

314
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,400
I'm a little confused.

315
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,880
Let me get my ideas into shape.

316
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,000
You are legal wife of Zhao Cuo.

317
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,560
Duan Xuewei is his childhood sweetheart

318
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,680
who has left for eight years.

319
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,520
Now she is back,

320
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,640
so you have to give way to her

321
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,880
and leave Zhao's Mansion?

322
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:13,800
Well,

323
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,470
hey, since you're good at investigating into cases,

324
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,400
you must not be a fool.

325
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,760
Well, he is your husband.

326
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,560
Duan Xuewei is shameless.

327
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,400
How can she

328
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,110
be the other woman aboveboard?

329
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,560
Anyway, I have to do so.

330
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,520
Xuewei was kind to me,

331
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,760
and I also treat her as my friend.

332
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,000
Well, you are magnanimous that

333
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,070
you can treat her as your friend.

334
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,160
No wonder

335
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,280
she was so angry

336
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,470
with you.

337
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,950
Duan Xuewei loves Zhao Cuo

338
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,520
so much,

339
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,110
but as a result,

340
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,110
Zhao Cuo is now in a coma

341
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,070
for saving you.

342
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,760
In my opinion,

343
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,000
you will be

344
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,760
her enemy soon.

345
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,400
What should I do?

346
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,680

Now that we had solved the cases in Baifang County,

as an inspector,

370

wrongful conviction won't surely occur in the southern city,

a betrayer's apology

520
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,640
is useless,

521
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,070
and he can only be forgiven

522
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,760
after stabbing himself.

523
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,310
How about this?

524
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,230
As long as you stab yourself,

525
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,350
we'll still be good friends,

526
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,310
OK?

527
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,640
You are

528
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,470
hypocritical

529
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,520
and stupid.

530
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,350
These years,

531
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,830
I didn't accompany Zhao Cuo,

532
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,950
so he loses his heart to you who are hypocritical.

533
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,950
I almost didn't like him.

534
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,680
Xuewei,

535
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,230
what, what did you say?

536
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,680
You're stupid.

537
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,160
However, remember,

538
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,070
I won't give up liking him.

539
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,230
The more you like him,

540
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,070
the more I'll like him, too.

541
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,190
I don't like Zhao Cuo.

542
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,830
Zhao Cuo likes you.

543
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,350
He and I…

544
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm not a fool.

545
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,800
I'm not so simple that I will believe all your words.

546
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,430
He Jinxin,

547
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,070
I had known your relationship

548
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,590
when I first met you,

549
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,560
but I thought you were just a replacement for me

550
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,950
when he felt lonely.

551
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,800
However,

552
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,950
he hesitated between you and me.

553
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,310
You really become my rival.

554
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,830
It seems that

555
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,350
I underestimated you before.

556
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,880
But now I wonder

557
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,830
whether you're qualified to be my rival or not.

558
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,560
Well,

559
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,160
I forget to tell you something.

560
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,430
In fact, when I first met you,

561
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,470
I had disliked you very much.

562
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,680
Therefore,

563
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,280
I beg you

564
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,800
to stop mentioning

565
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,280
our sisterhood or friendship in the future,

566
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
because it's annoying.

567
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,310
What's wrong with your face?

568
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:27,800
Let me see.

569
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,430
Get your hands off it. Let me see.

570
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,680
You can't cover it forever.

571
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,280
Hurry up.

572
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,070
Well,

573
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,560
you went to apologize to her,

574
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,800
but she went too far.

575
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,230
It's my fault.

576
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,640
I shouldn't ask you to apologize to her.

577
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,160
It's not your fault.

578
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
You did it out of kindness.

579
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,680
What will you do?

580
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,920
Move out of Zhao's Mansion

581
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
and leave Zhao Cuo forever.

582
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,110
Have you decided?

583
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,190
Leave Zhao Cuo?

584
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,350
Well,

585
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,880
I really can't understand

586
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,950
your love triangle.

587
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,110
How about this?

588
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,400
I'll hinder Duan Xuewei for you.

589
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
Then you go to meet him again.

590
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,760
Zhao Cuo,

591
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,950
don't be so quiet, OK?

592
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,680
I'm really not used to this.

593
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,680
I always thought you bullied me,

594
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,000
but whenever I was in danger,

595
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,190
you came to protect me.

596
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,520
From now on,

597
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,920
I won't bother you anymore.

598
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,400
Sorry.

599
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,760
You said that

600
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,640
we should remain faithful to friends,

601
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,830
but this time I have to go back on my word first.
