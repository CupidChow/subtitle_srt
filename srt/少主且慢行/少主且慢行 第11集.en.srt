2
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:33,340
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,259
Episode 11

4
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,240
Do youâ€¦

5
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,280
Master.

6
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,550
Someone claiming

7
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,870
to be from the capital of Taoyuan City.

8
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,310
comes for inspection.

9
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,640
He wanted to see you.

10
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,560
I am the imperial commissioner.

11
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,830
I'm He Ruoyao.

12
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,880
I'm Qin Fang, magistrate of Baifang County.

13
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,640
Do you have any identity proof?

14
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,200
Your Excellency.

15
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,150
Your Excellency.

16
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,560
Free.

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,240
This is a special guard from Southern City.

18
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,080
He Jinxin.

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,960
This is the son of Taifu Magistrate of southern city.

20
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,640
Zhao Cuo.

21
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,670
Your Excellency.

22
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,000
This one is the son of Taifu Magistrate of northern city.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,800
Bai Yifei.

24
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,000
Sit down.

25
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,390
Thank you, Your Excellency.

26
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,110
Thank you, Your Excellency.

27
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,030
Your Excellency,

28
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,320
could you please tell me why you come here?

29
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,240
At the order of the lord of Taoyuan City,

30
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,360
I tour and inspect around Taoyuan City.

31
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,320
I encountered gangsters doing violence in the suburbs.

32
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,800
So I come to see

33
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,590
what happened.

34
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,830
Your Excellency.

35
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,720
Several kidnappers intended to

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,030
kidnap the son of Taifu Magistrate of southern city.

37
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,630
Recently we received news of death

38
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,800
of kidnappers from the county magistrate.

39
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,270
In the suburbs,

40
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,720
we accidentally found a surviving kidnapper.

41
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,160
However,

42
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,240
he was killed by men in black.

43
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,800
I see.

44
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,550
Soldiers of my county yamen

45
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,829
found corpses of four kidnappers

46
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,960
on the barren mountain in the south of the city.

47
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,720
Coroner of my country yamen

48
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,110
deduced that kidnappers killed each other

49
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,320
due to uneven division of spoils.

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,630
Where are the kidnappers' corpses?

51
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,720
They have been buried in place.

52
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,320
Why is there a plague in Baifang County?

53
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,280
Plague?

54
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,390
There is a plague here?

55
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,880
Baifang County had good weather

56
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,870
without disaster these days.

57
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't know why the plague broke out there.

58
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,670
There are still many sick people in the county.

59
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,280
Is that serious?

60
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,080
Not particularly serious.

61
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,630
Although they are infected,

62
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,950
they are not serious yet.

63
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,830
But rest assured.

64
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,870
I have ordered the medical houses to try best to treat them.

65
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,830
In order to prevent

66
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,030
the spread of the disease,

67
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,910
I have ordered

68
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,320
to block all the main roads in Baifang County.

69
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,200
I can meet you today

70
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,320
also for this reason.

71
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,149
As a county magistrate, you did a good job.

72
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,350
Your Excellency, rest assured.

73
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,390
We must try our best

74
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,800
to help you if needed.

75
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,710
I still have important things to do next.

76
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,150
I have to go.

77
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,870
Okay, Your Excellency.

78
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:34,990
By the way,

79
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,640
I also asked Taifu Magistrate

80
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,920
for a review file of the death penalty.

81
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,640
Have you brought it?

82
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,080
No.

83
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,440
Taifu Magistrate thinks

84
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,000
there are still questions about this case.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,750
So it's not sentenced temporarily.

86
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,400
You are a woman?

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,360
You solved the case of Lan Muyan in three days.

88
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,470
Put down your hand.

89
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,360
Amazing.

90
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,950
Thank you.

91
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,030
I'm flattered.

92
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,760
Just call me Mr. He.

93
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,480
You know what?

94
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,670
I'm also good at solving cases.

95
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,030
Have you heard of the case of the girl in red?

96
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,430
I solved it.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,920
That case was solved by you?

98
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,160
You are great.

99
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,070
Unexpectedly, I can

100
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,720
even meet my fellow here.

101
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,830
Since we are so attached,

102
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,390
how about I investigate it with you?

103
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,000
Then of course it's best.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,720
Does Mr. He take a fancy to Sanqi?

105
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,640
He is so attentive.

106
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,270
Think of a way

107
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,950
to get him away

108
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,840
no matter who he is.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,840
Mr. He.

110
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,150
It's dangerous here.

111
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,710
And there is a plague.

112
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,750
You are delicate.

113
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,390
You'd better not go.

114
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,080
Right.

115
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,920
How can this be?

116
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,790
As an inspector , I'm not afraid of this little danger.

117
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,070
What do you mean?

118
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,800
Look down on me?

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,230
I'm worried about you now.

120
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,270
You are delicate.

121
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,960
Path.

122
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,760
I He Ruoyao helped the weak

123
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,720
for so many years.

124
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,680
I am afraid of nothing.

125
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,920
I think you are weak.

126
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,310
You who are whiter than a woman

127
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,990
must be weak.

128
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,760
I persuade you well.

129
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,920
But you refuted impolitely.

130
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,600
So what?

131
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,110
I said.

132
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,920
Hit me.

133
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,640
White Scrag.

134
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,640
You.

135
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,320
Alright. Alright.

136
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,600
Everyone is tired today.

137
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,880
How about we go upstairs and rest.

138
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,760
Let's talk tomorrow.

139
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,640
Let's talk tomorrow.

140
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,760
Just before it gets dark,

141
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,159
I'd like go to the river to take a bath

142
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,270
to clean dust.

143
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,710
I'm leaving.

144
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,520
Bath? Golden chance.

145
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,870
Is there a birthmark on Mr. Bai?

146
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,240
White Scrag.

147
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Mr. He.

148
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,840
Why are you sneaking here?

149
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,710
Who sneaks here?

150
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,270
Is this river yours?

151
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,990
Can't I come here to bathe?

152
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,150
How ridiculous!

153
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,270
Then why do you hold

154
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,080
my clothes in your hands?

155
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,200
I saw them by the river.

156
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,520
They might get dirty placed on ground.

157
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,720
So I picked them up for you.

158
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
I see.

159
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,750
Thank you so much.

160
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,430
I'm sorry for my aggressive words.

161
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,520
I didn't expect you to be so generous.

162
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,670
Thank you for forgiving me.

163
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,790
If you have nothing to do, go back first.

164
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,550
How about

165
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,550
we take a bath together?

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,750
Take off your clothes.

167
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,470
What?

168
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,160
What do you want?

169
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,230
Why is Mr. He so shy?

170
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,110
Don't bother.

171
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,710
Is he a woman

172
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,790
dressed as a man as I do?

173
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,080
I can take it off for you

174
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,960
to rub your back.

175
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,880
What do you think?

176
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,550
Damn.

177
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,990
You are annoying.

178
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,160
Don't you young man

179
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,230
have any things to do yourself?

180
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,080
Right.

181
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,720
What are you doing?

182
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,590
You said that I am as thin as a chicken.

183
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,550
Rethinking it again and again,

184
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,080
I think it's because of insufficient training.

185
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,670
So I make up my mind

186
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,870
to be stricter with myself.

187
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,910
Come on.

188
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,520
Feel it.

189
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,080
How is it?

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,840
Right now,

191
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,880
kidnappers, plague and homicide

192
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,080
occurred one by one.

193
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,840
Where to start?

194
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,710
That's right.

195
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,550
So many clues.

196
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,310
Please get an idea.

197
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,710
I want to go back to the Tian family of Yizhuang in Shifang Village

198
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,400
to visit my distant relatives first

199
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,080
while inquiring some information.

200
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,750
Huh?

201
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
You have relatives in Shifang Village.

202
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,880
Right.

203
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,600
My maternal uncle and his wife.

204
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,100
[Street of Baifang County]

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,040
Why is it so deserted here?

206
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,280
There is nobody in the shop.

207
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,840
Is it here?

208
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,520
Yeah.

209
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,640
Come with me.

210
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,350
Hello?

211
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,350
Scared me.

212
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,910
Uncle, aunt.

213
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,670
Sanqi.

214
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,430
Sanqi.

215
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,520
Sanqi.

216
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,590
I haven't seen you for 12 years. I miss you so much!

217
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,350
Jinxin also misses you.

218
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,320
What?

219
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,990
3 times 7 is 12 for your Shifang Village?

220
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,550
It does not matter.

221
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,350
What matters is that I want to have a talk

222
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,480
with them.

223
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,430
What happened?

224
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,110
It seems that

225
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,960
they are Sanqi's parents.

226
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,960
Mom.

227
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,280
I'll make it short.

228
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,110
After fleeing marriage, I used He Jinxin's identity.

229
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,520
They don't know my true identity.

230
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,320
And they don't know I am

231
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,960
the fleeing Young Lady.

232
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,110
You dare to escape even the marriage of young lord

233
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,320
We thought

234
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,550
we would be troubled

235
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,670
so we made coffins overnight and lay inside.

236
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,400
We wait for the punishment.

237
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,040
But it seems all right until now.

238
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,710
That's great.

239
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,670
You have to act well.

240
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,880
Don't expose it.

241
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,590
Okay.

242
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,080
Don't worry.

243
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,520
Your mom and I are good actors.

244
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,640
Now I count three.

245
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,400
Let's turn together.

246
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:14,910
Three.

247
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,550
Three.

248
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,750
Jinxin.

249
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,160
I haven't seen you for a long time. You are grown.

250
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,590
Yeah.

251
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,750
Oh, it's rare for you to come back.

252
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,480
You also brought these friends to meet us.

253
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,750
Eh.

254
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,400
Who are these three young men?

255
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,350
I'm Zhao Cuo, son of Taifu Magistrate of southern city.

256
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,790
You can call me Cuo.

257
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,550
Bai Yifei, son of Taifu Magistrate of northern city.

258
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,400
Northern city.

259
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,550
I'm He Ruoyao.

260
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,200
What?

261
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,670
What?

262
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,280
Ouch, great.

263
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,150
Right.

264
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,550
All are distinguished guests.

265
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,790
Please invite the guests to sit in the room.

266
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,350
Honey,

267
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,760
hurry up and smash some coffin boards

268
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,590
to make seats for guests.

269
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,280
Yeah.

270
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,350
Smash the old ones

271
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,640
with cases.

272
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,350
Go.

273
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,430
This way, please.

274
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,550
This way, please.

275
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,000
Come here.

276
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,590
Distinguished guests.

277
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,150
Take a seat.

278
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,080
Please take a seat.

279
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,470
That coffin is old,

280
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,880
but it's comfortable.

281
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,520
Very smooth.

282
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,910
Not stingy at all.

283
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,040
Take a seat.

284
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,720
We'd better stand.

285
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,320
Come here.

286
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,670
Please drink tea. Drink tea.

287
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,310
Aunt.

288
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,280
Take a seat.

289
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,990
Let me do it.

290
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,110
Stop pretending.

291
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,280
Let me do it.

292
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,310
Please drink tea.

293
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,790
Take a look. Take a look.

294
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,870
Such a young man.

295
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,670
You are handsome and polite.

296
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,840
How I wish

297
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,200
I was 20 years younger.

298
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,110
Come here.

299
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,110
20 years younger.

300
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,470
However young you are,

301
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,640
he won't like you.

302
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,230
Pooh.

303
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,320
Why so?

304
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
I was a famous beauty

305
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,480
in Shifang Village back then.

306
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,880
Yes.

307
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,790
Beauty.

308
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,030
Countryside beauty.

309
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,280
Countryside beauty.

310
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,200
Aunt is so funny.

311
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,160
Well,

312
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,110
uncle and aunt,

313
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,080
we come this time.

314
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,880
to investigate the plague in Baifang County.

315
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,470
Do you know

316
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,790
why there is a plague in Baifang County?

317
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,960
I don't know what happened.

318
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,150
Suddenly everyone became ill.

319
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,880
Thanks to the government's early discovery.

320
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,080
And they ask the drugstores

321
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,400
to make the medicine soup and deliver it to people.

322
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,840
So they controlled the disease, right?

323
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,670
Yes.

324
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,670
Fortunately, everyone is not seriously ill.

325
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,520
They take the medicine

326
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,790
and feel better.

327
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,790
No one died.

328
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,640
Uncle, aunt.

329
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,550
Are you all right?

330
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,670
Yeah.

331
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,150
We are fine.

332
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,280
Very good.

333
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,960
Well,

334
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,470
I heard a few kidnappers died on the mountain.

335
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,400
Did the county yamen ask you to collect the dead corpse?.

336
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,160
Kidnappers?

337
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,470
No.

338
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,520
No.

339
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,030
Yeah, I haven't heard of it.

340
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,280
If this really happened,

341
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,110
they would definitely ask us to collect the dead.

342
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:58,960
Yeah.

343
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,670
No.

344
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,350
Well,

345
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,110
why don't you just ask the county magistrate

346
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,230
where the corpses were buried.

347
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,550
No.

348
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,080
We can't ask the magistrate.

349
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,310
I always think there is something wrong.

350
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,030
When such unknown corpse appeared in the village,

351
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,880
they would ask Yizhuang to collect it.

352
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,040
Why is it not the same this time?

353
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,280
Do you suspect anything wrong with this county magistrate?

354
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,720
I haven't found anything yet.

355
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,080
Hey.

356
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,280
How about we

357
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,960
go to the mountain.

358
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,200
to look for the kidnappers' corpses in moonlight tonight?

359
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,910
What?

360
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,520
Go to look for the dead corpse in the middle of the night?

361
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,080
Mr. He,

362
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,030
if you are scared.

363
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,200
you can go back to rest first.

364
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,480
I am scared?

365
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,160
That's impossible!

366
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,990
Are you scared?

367
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,550
Those female ghosts in the old forest in the mountains

368
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,590
like fine-skinned white men

369
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,040
as you.

370
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,670
Enough

371
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,280
Stop it.

372
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,880
We have no clue now.

373
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,079
Where can we find them in such a big forest?

374
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,000
Don't worry.

375
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,839
When I was a kid, I grew up, lived

376
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,030
in Shifang Village.

377
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,560
I'm familiar with the surrounding environment.

378
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,190
And near the place where the corpse was buried,

379
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,680
the soil must be softer.

380
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,760
There must be excavations near the new grave.

381
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,790
I believe I can find it.

382
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,710
Okay.

383
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,760
So where do we start?

384
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,520
It's early now.

385
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,310
We can go to

386
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,470
take a look at the front temple.

387
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,150
Let's go.

388
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,480
Good masters.

389
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,230
We're here to investigate the murder of abbot.

390
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,920
Can you take us

391
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,760
to the crime scene?

392
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,590
Isn't this case ended?

393
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,040
What else needs to be investigated?

394
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,800
Taifu Magistrate of southern city thought that

395
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,070
this case still had many doubts.

396
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,630
He asked us to take a look at the site.

397
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,270
Can you please help us?

398
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,470
Okay.

399
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,030
Please follow me.

400
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,040
This temple is so small.

401
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,270
Just one hall and two side halls.

402
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,430
But it's quite popular.

403
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,520
Although our temple is small,

404
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,640
abbot was always

405
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,520
kind and charitable,

406
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,480
being respected by people.

407
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,950
However,

408
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,080
good man as him didn't get good rewards.

409
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,590
The plasterer surnamed Liu

410
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,200
is really sinful.

411
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,200
What is wrong with this statue?

412
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,230
That plasterer not only killed my master

413
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,760
but also smashed with this statue

414
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,310
I'm afraid he will be punished by Taoyuan God.

415
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,720
What do you find?

416
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,630
Why is it empty?

417
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,670
These plasterers

418
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,630
can't even make statue well.

419
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,030
They are really countrymen.

420
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,280
I seem to smell

421
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,040
the state of rotten corpse.

422
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,760
Here?

423
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,670
There is a corpse?

424
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,000
Please do not make false statements.

425
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,040
This is the shrine.

426
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,080
How could there be a corpse?

427
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,670
Well,

428
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,760
how about we go first?

429
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,710
Obviously it's a shrine.

430
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,430
But I feel it's spooky.

431
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,760
I'm not afraid.

432
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,000
I'd like to go to the toilet.

433
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,880
Doctor, doctor, doctor.

434
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,670
Line up outside to get medicine.

435
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:00,960
Keep taking medicine.

436
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,000
Your Excellency.

437
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,350
Your Excellency.

438
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,310
What's up?

439
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,590
I just want to know

440
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,880
whether the current situation of the plague.

441
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,040
is serious

442
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,430
and can be controlled.

443
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,830
Your Excellency.

444
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,680
Although this plague happened suddenly,

445
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,720
it's not serious.

446
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,830
As long as patients take the medicine normally,

447
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,960
it won't be a big deal.

448
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,310
I see.

449
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,230
Thank you.

450
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,150
You dispense medicine first.

451
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,240
It seems that

452
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,880
this plague is not as dangerous as I thought.

453
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,430
We can leave it alone temporarily.

454
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,560
Let's wait for the dark.

455
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,000
We'll go up the mountain to dig dead corpses.

456
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,800
What are you doing?

457
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,670
I'm not afraid.

458
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,670
Right there.

459
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,670
Are you sure?

460
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,280
What to do if we get it wrong?

461
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,310
What if it's wrong?

462
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,270
Sanqi.

463
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,430
Are you sure?

464
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,480
Right.

465
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,790
I'm sure.

466
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,630
Why?

467
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,960
What to do if you get it wrong?

468
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,670
We still have to be cautious.

469
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,160
Look at that open space.

470
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
It has soft soil

471
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,560
with no weeds.

472
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,430
It must be that.

473
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,480
Dig.

474
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,000
We can't dig it casually.

475
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,040
What if we get it wrong?

476
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,000
Right?

477
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,310
What if we dig other's tomb?

478
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,760
What if it's not those four kidnappers?

479
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,430
Right.

480
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,400
What I said makes sense.

481
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,110
Take a look.

482
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,430
You are so reckless.

483
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,680
I think, Xiao,

484
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,560
sometimes you

485
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,800
are pretty good.

486
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,400
We can't dig casually.

487
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,230
We really can't dig casually.

488
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,190
Look at you.

489
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,880
Yes.

490
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,000
Wrong ghosts retreat.

491
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,550
Leave it to you.

492
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,880
Dig it.

493
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,390
When can we dig it out?

494
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,430
What is that?

495
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,080
What was that?

496
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,120
It seems

497
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:32,790
to be ghost.

498
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,480
Ghost!

499
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,430
Don't squeeze me.

500
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,920
My wife is so good.

501
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,480
You know to support me with your hand..

502
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,910
We dig it out!

503
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,070
What are you waiting for?

504
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,310
Get the corpse out quickly.

505
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,560
No way.

506
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,470
I won't do this.

507
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,600
Ahâ€¦

508
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,000
Stop vomiting. Okay?

509
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,030
No.

510
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,960
Sanqi,

511
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,840
have you found any clue?

512
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,720
Is there anything I can help?

513
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,800
She doesn't need your help.

514
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,510
Besides, you can't help anything.

515
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,800
Mr. Zhao,

516
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,880
why do you look pale?

517
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,070
I am a bit sick today.

518
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,000
Hush, shut up.

519
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,230
These corpses have stab wounds

520
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,240
in more than one place.

521
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,430
You mean

522
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,630
they may die from killing each other.

523
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,080
for property?

524
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,520
Zhao Cuo.

525
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,720
Raise the torch closer.

526
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,920
Wrong.

527
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,310
They didn't die from the knife wounds.

528
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,880
These corpses

529
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,710
have purple face, and protruding eyes.

530
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,080
Knife injuries are not fatal.

531
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,480
Sure enough.

532
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,520
They were poisoned.

533
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,040
So the knife wounds on them

534
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,560
were injuries especially made by the murder

535
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,670
to cover the truth.

536
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,200
So it seems that

537
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,670
these kidnappers died for some other reasons.

538
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,480
Yeah.

539
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,160
Conditions are too bad here.

540
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,600
I can't check them more carefully.

541
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,920
After burying the corpses,

542
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,720
let's go.

543
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,480
We have to bury them?

544
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,000
Yeah.

545
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,590
I remember you told me before

546
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,590
those kidnappers were bought

547
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,720
to kill Zhao Cuo?

548
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,910
Indeed.

549
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,080
The men in black poisoned the kidnappers first

550
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,830
and made up

551
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,270
an illusion of killing each other.

552
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,190
Unexpectedly, one ran away

553
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,360
and was encountered by us.

554
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,470
So men in black had to kill them

555
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,790
in front of us.

556
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,270
But one thing is unknown.

557
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,310
Why did the men in black kidnap Zhao Cuo?

558
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,200
They also tried to assassinate us.

559
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,240
I think

560
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,150
it must be because Zhao Cuo is willful usually,

561
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,600
so many people want to kill him.

562
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,550
Dear, look at him.

563
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,360
He slanders me.

564
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,680
You still vomit.

565
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,390
Humph.

566
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,910
Just Face.

567
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,390
Listen up.

568
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,840
Don't ever try to find topic.

569
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,240
Those who want to kill me also include you.

570
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,080
I won't quarrel with you.

571
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,510
Shut up.

572
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,350
Hurry back.

573
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,030
I always have an ominous hunch.

574
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,910
Dear.

575
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,880
That man's hand smells bad.

576
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,560
It seems that something happened before.

577
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,510
Let's go and see.

578
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,830
Everybody.

579
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,510
Be quiet.

580
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,510
Everybody.

581
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,840
What happened, County Magistrate?

582
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,840
Mr. Zhao, Mr. He and Mr. Bai.

583
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,550
Your Excellency.

584
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
Here is the thing.

585
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,880
Yesterday,

586
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,160
two villagers in Shifang Village were infected with the plague.

587
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,000
Because of serious illness,

588
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,880
they called on a doctor to diagnose them.

589
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,920
However,

590
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,720
they died

591
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,390
of serious illness this morning.

592
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,830
These two families

593
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,270
think this doctor killed them,

594
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,150
so they come for explanation.

595
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,360
I'm wronged.

596
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,880
My prescription is the same

597
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,790
for all people.

598
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,190
Yesterday's prescription for them

599
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,470
was also the same.

600
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,230
I do not know why either

601
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,720
they would get worse and die.

602
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,070
All quibble.

603
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,710
Obviously you are the quack doctor

604
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,520
and killed them.

605
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,430
Yeah.

606
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,470
You quack doctor killed them.

607
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,710
You have to pay.

608
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,640
Pay your life for it!

609
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,430
Your Excellency, I didn't!

610
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,150
Take him down.

611
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,630
Your Excellency, I didn't!

612
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,190
Everybody.

613
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,080
Please listen to me.

614
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,790
Calm down first.

615
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,560
I will definitely investigate the facts

616
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,720
to show you the truth.

617
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,120
Your Excellency.

618
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,510
I really did not intentionally kill them.

619
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,270
You can test the prescription.

620
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,200
Then what is this?

621
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,910
Biluo Root.

622
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,110
"Rare Herbal Medicine Collection"

623
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,430
records this herb.

624
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,470
It's a rare poison.

625
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,880
It's hard for average people to get it.

626
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,670
Your Excellency,

627
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,600
where did you get it?

628
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,280
We searched it out

629
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,830
from this doctor's

630
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,510
medical house.

631
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,200
Besides,

632
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,040
we also found out the ingredients of Biluo Root

633
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,040
from the deaths' medicine residue

634
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,590
and their corpses.

635
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,510
This is not my medicine.

636
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,550
I haven't purchased Biluo root at all.

637
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,350
My medical house wouldn't buy

638
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,550
for no reason.

639
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,160
But this poison

640
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,040
was found from your home.

641
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,240
What's your explanation?

642
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,510
I, I don't know.

643
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,520
I thought you just accidentally killed them

644
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,160
by misusing medicine.

645
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,510
I just wanted to hit you with boards for times.

646
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,920
I did not expect

647
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,510
you to kill them on purpose.

648
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,470
Someone!

649
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,270
Take him down.

650
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:30,960
Behead him another day.

651
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,390
Your Excellency.

652
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,520
There are still many doubts in this case.

653
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,830
As the doctor said,

654
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,710
he has no motivation

655
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,200
to deliberately kill people.

656
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,670
Please review it again.

657
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,120
The evidence is now conclusive.

658
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,190
He is the only one who can

659
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,030
access patients and medications in Baifang County.

660
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,360
I don't think there is any doubt.

661
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,470
If you can find other evidence soon,

662
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,360
I will review it.

663
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,960
But now I have to put him in prison

664
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,520
to pacify people's mind.

665
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,150
Take him down.

666
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,630
Iâ€™ve been wronged.

667
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
Iâ€™ve been wronged.

668
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,630
I didn't poison him!

669
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm wrong.

670
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,480
Your Excellency.

671
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,070
Can you take me to see

672
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,600
the two sick deaths

673
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,120
to check it again?

674
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,800
Thisâ€¦

675
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,240
Take us to see them.

676
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,840
Yes.

677
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,790
It's real.

678
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,670
No.

679
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,830
Why does he look like

680
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,230
those kidnappers on mountain?

681
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,310
They all have purple eyes and black lips.

682
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,710
The county magistrate said

683
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,960
they died of the poison of Biluo Root.

684
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,310
That means,

685
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,360
kidnappers on the mountain

686
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,520
were also poisoned by the poison of Biluo Root.

687
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,200
Yeah.

688
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,400
So two kidnappers

689
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,110
were also poisoned by the doctor.

690
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,790
Yeah.

691
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,910
No.

692
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,390
We can't draw such a conclusion rashly.

693
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,000
Help me.

694
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,800
I will check them again.

695
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,510
Maybe there is something new to discover.

696
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,600
Come over.

697
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,600
Come over.

698
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,600
In addition to being poisoned,

699
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,310
these two deaths

700
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,510
have no other clue.

701
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,840
And the background has nothing to do with the doctor.

702
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,080
Why did the doctor poison them?

703
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,640
Is it really

704
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,710
impossible that

705
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,120
the doctor killed them?

706
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,270
He had no motivation.

707
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,670
If they had nothing to do with each other,

708
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,430
why did he poison them?

709
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,670
Is that murderer

710
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,790
a freak killer?

711
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,080
Path.

712
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,240
Hey.

713
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,360
I have read in books before.

714
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,830
Such killers killed people based on their own preferences

715
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,000
without any purpose.

716
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,600
You can read such anecdotes for fun.

717
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,150
Don't take it seriously.

718
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,160
Hey, no.

719
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,040
Then who

720
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,550
killed them besides perverted killers?

721
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,760
The killer must have his reason.

722
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,150
But we haven't found evidence yet.

723
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,110
What's the connection between these two deaths

724
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,360
and kidnappers?

725
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,150
Who?

726
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,550
Where is he?

727
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,640
You don't have eyes?

728
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,280
Will he wait for you there?

729
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,080
We lost him.

730
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,360
Where is He Jinxin?

731
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,790
Oops.

732
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,390
I thought she followed us.

733
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,200
Waste.

734
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,030
Sanqi.

735
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,120
Sanqi.

736
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,190
Where is he?

737
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,040
Did you find him?

738
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,200
Where were you?

739
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,310
I followed the man in black

740
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,000
near the county yamen and lost him.

741
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,910
What's wrong with you?

742
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,670
I thought you were taken away.

743
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,920
I just found something by the well.

744
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,360
So I stayed for a look.

745
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,040
You said you followed him to the county yamen

746
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,000
and then lost him?

747
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,670
Yeah.

748
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,310
I have a clue about this case.

749
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,760
Go.

750
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,670
Let's go back to the inn.

751
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,670
Hey, also run.

752
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,360
Water is coming.

753
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,080
The vinegar you want.

754
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,790
Wait a minute.

755
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,360
Sure enough.

756
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,360
I've inquired it.

757
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,510
Let me say first.

758
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,880
Don't interrupt me.

759
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,950
How come I think

760
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,390
you are more and more like a bickering couple?

761
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,030
Nonsense!

762
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,270
Let me say first.

763
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,430
The big water tanks in yamen

764
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,430
were only been activated in the last week.

765
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,800
This county magistrate

766
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,400
uses water for daily living

767
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,720
from the water tanks.

768
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,630
Mr. Zhao, have you finished it?

769
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,880
Yeah.

770
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,760
Can I speak now?

771
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,350
Go ahead.

772
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,480
I didn't stop you.

773
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,510
I also went to Taoyuan Temple.

774
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,150
The little monk in the temple said

775
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,520
the county magistrate of Baifang County

776
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,560
is devout to Taoyuan God.

777
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,800
Incense money of the temple was

778
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,000
all provided by him.

779
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,040
There is perennial incense in the temple.

780
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,520
The only difference is

781
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:18,630
this statue is very old.

782
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:19,870
Why?

783
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,230
Because the ancestors said that they should keep the original appearance of the statue,

784
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,480
so no refurbishment is allowed.

785
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,710
Then why did abbot in the temple

786
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,560
hire the plasterer to renovate it?

787
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,909
Abbot felt the statue

788
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,080
was too old,

789
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,719
so he privately decided to renovate it

790
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,070
and tell the county magistrate after renovation.

791
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,520
How is your experiment?

792
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,000
Why is it purple?

793
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,360
Because this water contains Biluo Root.

794
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,070
No.

795
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,560
Strictly speaking,

796
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,389
the source of water for the entire Baifang County

797
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,710
contains Biluo Root.

798
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,630
How did you check it out?

799
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,389
I once read from books that

800
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,520
poison of Biluo Root

801
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,600
is colorless and tasteless

802
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,560
and dissolved in water.

803
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,520
I took this pot of water.

804
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,910
from the water tank in the inn.

805
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,150
This can explain

806
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,630
now the water source of Baifang County

807
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,630
has been polluted.

808
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,230
Then why haven't people in Baifang County

809
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,960
gotten poisoned?

810
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,520
Because there is not enough content of Biluo Root in the well

811
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,200
to poison people.

812
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,600
It only makes people chronically poisoned.

813
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,430
This is the plague they mention.

814
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,720
I see.

815
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,840
Who is so evil

816
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,280
to do such a thing?

817
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,800
I'm not sure.

818
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,230
I need to confirm

819
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,560
something else.

820
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,150
Hey, stop.

821
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,000
Stop fetching water.

822
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,080
The water in this well is poisonous.

823
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,320
Don't drink it anymore.

824
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,040
Nonsense.

825
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,470
I have used water of this well for decades.

826
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,430
I'm fine.

827
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,590
Where's the poison?

828
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,710
It's poisonous.

829
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,590
I see you are poisonous.

830
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,040
Exactly.

831
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,800
I drink this well water from a young age.

832
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,950
Stop talking nonsense.

833
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,520
Why don't you believe it?

834
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,710
There is no plague in our county.

835
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,710
Someone has poisoned this well

836
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,630
to make everyone chronically poisoned.

837
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,430
I don't believe it.

838
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,710
You said it was poisoned.

839
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,560
Why am I fine?

840
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,960
Moreover,

841
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,040
what evidence do you have that this water is poisonous?

842
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,870
Take a look.

843
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,080
This bottle is vinegar.

844
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,360
Vinegar encountering this poisonous water.

845
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,630
will turn purple.

846
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,630
Take a look.

847
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,720
It really turns purple.

848
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,110
So,

849
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,190
listen to me.

850
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,390
Don't drink

851
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,190
this water anymore at home.

852
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,470
Test it first.

853
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,520
In case it is really poisoned...

854
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,000
It really turns purple.

855
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,240
â€¦something bad happened.

856
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:45,840
Go home now.

857
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,760
Hurry up.

858
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,150
We have no water at home.

859
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,230
Your Excellency, please save us.

860
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,120
You have to find out

861
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,520
who actually poisoned our well water.

862
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,560
Yes, Your Excellency.

863
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,520
The water in our village is not drinkable now.

864
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,950
Please open the check points,

865
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,320
so that we can go outside to drink water.

866
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,230
Am I right?

867
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:03,840
Yes.

868
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,430
Yes, Your Excellency.

869
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,630
Everyone, calm down.

870
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,870
I've known that the well water

871
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,800
I you said is poisonous.

872
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,360
But as for whether there is someone

873
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,670
poisoning in well water,

874
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,240
I will definitely investigate it.

875
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,190
I will open the check points

876
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,630
of each important county roads

877
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,040
for four hours every morning,

878
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,320
so that everyone can go out to get water at this time.

879
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,760
However,

880
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,390
before things are investigated out,

881
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,630
the check points cannot be easily cancelled.

882
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,150
I hope everyone understands this.

883
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,760
How's it going?

884
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,950
You know what?

885
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,430
That the water is poisonous

886
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,000
has spread in the village.

887
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,230
Great.

888
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,000
In this case,

889
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,600
we have become the thorn in the murder's side.

890
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,430
Now we only need

891
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,280
to wait for them to come over

892
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,230
to deal with us.

893
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,630
Hey, you guys come over.

894
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,590
Hi, dude.

895
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,040
How about we go over the wall?

896
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,830
Why is there nothing?

897
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,800
Check carefully.

898
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,390
Caught him?

899
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,630
He runs away.

900
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,760
All right.

901
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,150
There is one left.

902
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,560
Try him well.

903
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,120
I advise you to give up.

904
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,910
You can't beat us by yourself.

905
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,560
See who you are.

906
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,710
Master.

907
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,430
Chase him?

908
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,710
We can't beat him.

909
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,190
Don't chase him.

910
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,910
Okay.

911
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,560
Fine.

912
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,560
The room of a small county magistrate

913
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,760
actually has a secret chamber.

914
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,870
There must be a problem.

915
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,200
What we are looking for must be here.

916
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,600
Yes.

917
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,280
Hurry up.

918
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,240
Look.

919
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,280
What is this?

920
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,630
Yes.

921
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,630
It's really Biluo Root.

922
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:55,960
Leave now.

923
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,860
