[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,229
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,080
Episode 22

4
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,400
Zhen, be good.

5
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,229
Lady.

6
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:41,950
So

7
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,400
the person with this jade pendant is your son,

8
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,910
right?

9
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,800
My son is alive.

10
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,830
My son is alive.

11
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,590
That's too late.

12
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,509
Follow me to meet lord.

13
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,800
No.

14
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,270
They are all crazy.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,190
They are crazy.

16
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,440
They want to kill me.

17
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,120
No.

18
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,870
No way.

19
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,720
He is in danger.

20
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's hurry up and tell Lord.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,760
Hurry up.

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,190
Save Zhen.

23
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,440
Kill him.

24
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,960
Zhao Cuo, are you okay?

25
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,960
Commander Zhang?

26
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,520
Master.

27
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,880
Come.

28
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,830
Why are you here?

29
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,080
Cuo.

30
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,360
You call Commander Zhang master.

31
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,960
What's going on?

32
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,000
It's a long history.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,630
Why is this door so difficult to open?

34
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,440
Somebody is coming.

35
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,960
Never let them know that I am here.

36
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,470
Sorry.

37
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,320
Sorry, Lady.

38
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,960
I will definitely bring

39
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,360
your real son to meet you.

40
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,190
My son.

41
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,829
Return my son. Return my son. Return my son.

42
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,079
Return my son.

43
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,829
Return my son.

44
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,829
Return my son.

45
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,630
Return my son.

46
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,030
They should not catch up.

47
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,550
Alas.

48
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,000
Commander Zhang.

49
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,720
Why are you here?

50
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,000
After that happened,

51
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,910
actually I have been living in seclusion near southern city.

52
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,440
Oh.

53
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,160
You taught Cuo martial arts?

54
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,829
Yes.

55
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,110
Since he was twelve,

56
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,000
I secretly taught him martial arts in bamboo forest.

57
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,470
But I told him again

58
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,600
not to expose it easily.

59
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,800
Zhao Cuo.

60
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,880
Are you okay?

61
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,240
I'm fine.

62
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,080
When dad was chopped just now,

63
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,320
I recalled a lot.

64
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,760
of things I forgot.

65
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,270
Hey.

66
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,790
Can anyone tell me

67
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,200
what happened exactly?

68
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,440
How come I didn't

69
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,830
understand a word of you?

70
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,720
Zhao Cuo.

71
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,040
What do you recall?

72
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,159
What happened to those men in black?

73
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:35,950
Oh, moreover,

74
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,720
Commander Zhang,

75
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,790
who are you?

76
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,110
Can anyone explain this?

77
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,600
Who is she?

78
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,830
This Lady Jinyan

79
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,350
is the daughter of Lord.

80
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,320
Lady Jinyan.

81
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,600
Please pardon my rudeness.

82
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,920
Explain to me

83
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,000
the entire thing now.

84
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,000
Hey.

85
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,950
Why do you two appear?

86
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,760
It's Sanqi.

87
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,550
Sanqi entrusted us to protect you secretly.

88
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,510
She is afraid you will be killed by men in black.

89
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,640
Unexpectedly,

90
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,600
we are still one step late.

91
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,880
Fortunately, Commander Zhang is here,

92
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,600
so you are safe.

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,200
Yes.

94
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,160
Sanqi was mysterious at that time.

95
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,880
She stopped me from telling my brother.

96
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,320
Mr. Bai.

97
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,670
Before leaving,

98
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,830
I have one more thing to ask you.

99
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,160
Go ahead.

100
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,350
That day you said,

101
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,230
the grimace totem is taught by an old friend.

102
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,830
Can tell me now

103
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,950
who your old friend is?

104
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,350
It's Zhao Cuo.

105
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,880
When I was ten,

106
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,480
Zhao Cuo first came to southern city.

107
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,550
I met him for the first time.

108
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,920
He also

109
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,640
hummed a strange ballad

110
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,320
and then drew some grimace totems on the ground.

111
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,600
How about this?

112
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,830
You teach me to draw.

113
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,350
I'll get this for you, okay?

114
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,000
Draw another mouth and “san (three)” on the head.

115
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,440
Why doesn't he

116
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,720
remember the grimace totem now?

117
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,670
I don't know.

118
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,110
Mr. Bai, Ruoyao.

119
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,040
This matter is very important.

120
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,160
You must listen to me.

121
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,390
Zhao Cuo must

122
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,880
be assassinated by men in black halfway.

123
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,720
You two must protect him.

124
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,510
Did you find anything?

125
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,110
I can't say more now.

126
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,110
But remember.

127
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,110
This matter

128
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,040
must not be disclosed to anyone,

129
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,160
including your brother.

130
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,110
Sanqi is really smart.

131
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,670
She seems to be aware

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,440
of these things.

133
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,880
Dad,

134
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,830
at this time,

135
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,760
don't hide it any more.

136
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:54,760
Okay.

137
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,390
Lady Jinyan.

138
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,880
It seems that

139
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,720
I have to tell you

140
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,110
something.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,510
I hope that

142
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,040
you could be prepared to accept it.

143
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,550
In fact,

144
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,040
the real Young Lord

145
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,950
is Zhao Cuo.

146
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,720
He is your real brother.

147
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,000
What?

148
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,640
Ah.

149
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,760
Master Zhao.

150
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,200
Are you kidding me?

151
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,070
He Zhen is my brother.

152
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,510
Zhao Cuo.

153
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,159
What are you talking about?

154
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,440
At this moment,

155
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,670
will I joke with you?

156
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,880
What I said is true.

157
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,070
You don't believe it?

158
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,440
Commander Zhang.

159
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,880
Tell her.

160
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,200
Lady Jinyan.

161
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,480
I'm a commander governed by Taoyuan General.

162
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,230
I was one of the guards escorting

163
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,270
Young Lord out of the city.

164
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,040
Zhao Cuo in front of you now

165
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,950
is indeed the true Young Lord.

166
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,640
Then who is my brother, the current Young Lord

167
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,160
of Taoyuan City?

168
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,200
I don't know either.

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,230
But he must be false.

170
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,830
I don't believe it.

171
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,040
You know what?

172
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,200
You'd better tell me the truth honestly.

173
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,390
Otherwise I won't believe any of you.

174
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,000
Tell her.

175
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,150
Eighteen years ago,

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
war between Taoyuan City and Lincheng City

177
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,400
extended to the capital city.

178
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,320
At critical situation,

179
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,470
to protect Young Lord who was just one month old,

180
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,080
Lord ordered Taoyuan General

181
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,400
to escort Young Lord out of the city.

182
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,200
Since then, he hid his real identity

183
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,470
and lived everywhere.

184
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,320
He is entrusted to you.

185
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,880
Be careful.

186
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,910
Yes,

187
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,440
my lord.

188
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,280
Go.

189
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,030
To avoid eyes,

190
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,760
besides general, several martial arts generals and me,

191
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,910
only two or three

192
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,670
teenager servants

193
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,000
escorted Young Lord

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,960
out of the city.

195
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,350
Eight years ago,

196
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,960
the war ceased.

197
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,080
Taoyuan General received the decree to return home.

198
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,880
Can we really go home?

199
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,710
The real home?

200
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,320
Yes.

201
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:06,710
Go home.

202
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,150
Can we come back later?

203
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,030
I still have a friend here.

204
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,790
I have an appointment with her to be together.

205
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,760
Who are you?

206
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,590
Someone killing you.

207
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,230
How ignorant!

208
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,080
Before speaking,

209
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,320
check who your opponent is.

210
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,400
I certainly know who you are.

211
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,880
You.

212
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,960
Taoyuan General.

213
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,150
First War General of Taoyuan City.

214
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,640
In the carriage behind you,

215
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,840
there should be Young Lord of Taoyuan City.

216
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,470
Since you know this,

217
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,280
make way now.

218
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,640
But we just want to kill you.

219
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,200
Up yours!

220
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,110
General.

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,880
What should we do now?

222
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,030
Remember.

223
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,110
Anyway,

224
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,400
we must protect Young Lord.

225
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes.

226
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,150
I can only make you suffer today.

227
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,550
Commander Zhang.

228
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,030
Change Young Lord's clothes with his.

229
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,080
Go.

230
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,590
Okay.

231
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,000
Go.

232
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,960
Commander Zhang.

233
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,320
I'll lead them away.

234
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,200
You take Young Lord to find Zhao Quandui.

235
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,670
General.

236
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,790
I should go

237
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,710
to lead them away.

238
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,230
No.

239
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,840
If I escape,

240
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,840
they will never give up.

241
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,880
These people don't

242
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,520
look like the spy sent by the enemy city

243
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,840
but those with ulterior motives

244
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
in the capital.

245
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,760
Remember.

246
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,760
From now on,

247
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
take care of Young Lord and hide your real identity.

248
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,230
Don't go to the capital again.

249
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,230
Commander Zhang.

250
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,440
What happened?

251
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,670
Leave. Leave.

252
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,230
Tell me.

253
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
Someone is killing Young Lord.

254
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,590
What?

255
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,110
General and I escort Young Lord to the capital as decreed.

256
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,110
But we encountered assassins on the way back.

257
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,790
What about General?

258
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,230
He closed the rear.

259
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,350
He asked me to send Young Lord to your house

260
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,590
and let Young Lord

261
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,150
hide his real identity forever.

262
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,080
Your Excellency.

263
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,760
Huh?

264
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,320
Can I trust you?

265
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,350
Please rest assured.

266
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,670
Lord knew and promoted me.

267
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,520
General and I always best friends.

268
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,840
Even if I will risk my life,

269
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,230
I will take good care of Young Lord.

270
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,000
Okay.

271
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,910
Young Lord.

272
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,150
From now on,

273
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,550
you are surnamed Zhao

274
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,590
and you were born in the Zhao family.

275
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,320
You don't know me.

276
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,440
or general,

277
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,790
got it?

278
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,760
No.

279
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,960
I want to go back.

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,230
You can't go to find them anymore.

281
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,670
Why?

282
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,910
I told her we would be together forever.

283
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,280
I have to go there.

284
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,150
Young Lord.

285
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,670
They are dead.

286
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,200
They,

287
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,200
their whole family were killed by the fire.

288
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,000
From now on,

289
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,110
you can only stay in the Zhao family.

290
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,710
Did you hear it?

291
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,230
No.

292
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,520
Your Excellency.

293
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,030
Huh?

294
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,400
Take care of Young Lord.

295
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,000
Commander Zhang.

296
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,640
Where are you going?

297
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,880
I'll save general.

298
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,000
Anyway,

299
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,640
I can't leave General alone to cover the rear.

300
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,000
Commander Zhang.

301
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Be careful.

302
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,520
Young Lord.

303
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,550
Young Lord.

304
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,230
After Commander Zhang left,

305
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,280
he never came back.

306
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,110
I hid Young Lord in my house

307
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,000
and drove everyone away.

308
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,350
I told

309
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,790
the new servants that

310
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,670
Zhao Cuo was my biological son.

311
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,790
I remember that

312
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,840
the next day after I came to dad's house,

313
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,760
I went to Shifang Village.

314
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,590
You went to find Sanqi?

315
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,080
Yes.

316
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,880
I wanted to tell her I was not dead.

317
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,000
In addition,

318
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,670
I got under the big locust tree we agreed.

319
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,880
But I did not see her.

320
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,880
Ugh.

321
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,470
Why did he die

322
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,560
at this young age?

323
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,069
Yes.

324
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,000
Let's go and see.

325
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,680
Damn.

326
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,310
Young Lord.

327
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,680
Don't come here later.

328
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,280
Come back with me.

329
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,160
Come here.

330
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,800
So the immortal brother Sanqi has been

331
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,920
looking for is you.

332
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,640
Then why didn't you recognize her?

333
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,880
At that time,

334
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,800
you were already ten years old.

335
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,760
You must remember

336
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,950
things happening back then.

337
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,110
He really

338
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,560
didn't remember it.

339
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,760
A witch doctor.

340
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,680
Oh.

341
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,880
Duan Xuewei's mother

342
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,400
hypnotized him

343
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,310
and made him forget

344
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,350
all memories ten years ago.

345
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,800
After he woke up,

346
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,160
he just remembered he was my son,

347
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,640
Zhao Cuo.

348
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,880
So Sanqi made

349
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,230
a young appointment with Zhao Cuo.

350
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,880
The brother growing up with me

351
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,520
is not my real brother.

352
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,640
How is this possible?

353
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,680
Lady Jinyan.

354
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,310
I know you have a hard time accepting it.

355
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,310
But Zhao Cuo is indeed your biological brother.

356
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,310
The jade pendant on him

357
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,880
and that of lord is a pair.

358
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,640
Lady put it on Zhao Cuo.

359
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,400
Even He Zhen

360
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,310
didn't know this.

361
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,070
Jade pendant?

362
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,310
Show it to me.

363
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,760
When Sanqi left,

364
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,950
I gave it

365
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,520
to her.

366
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,000
Right now,

367
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,470
it should be in the capital.

368
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,310
According to the request of Miss Sanqi,

369
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,190
she has doubts about He Zhen.

370
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
If she accidentally exposes her intention,

371
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,230
she will be in danger.

372
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,000
I am going to save her.

373
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,520
Stop.

374
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,110
Son.

375
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,880
Do you think that He Zhen knows nothing?

376
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,590
How can you

377
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,710
break into Lord's mansion alone?

378
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,640
Besides, his wedding is coming.

379
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,070
More soldiers are now stationed outside the city.

380
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,680
You can't get in.

381
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:03,920
So what?

382
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,800
I can break in forcibly.

383
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,830
Son. Stop.

384
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,560
Listen to me.

385
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,760
I have left office

386
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,110
and have no soldiers now.

387
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,230
We several people

388
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,160
can't defeat He Zhen's powerful soldiers.

389
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,400
We can report

390
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,310
everything to Lord

391
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,230
and let Lord come forward.

392
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,070
Lady Jinyan.

393
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,400
I heard that

394
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,350
Lord has handed over military power to He Zhen.

395
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,880
Is it true?

396
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,040
Yes.

397
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,520
Father is seriously ill.

398
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,110
He Zhen will succeed after his wedding.

399
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:39,880
Anyway,

400
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,190
I can't let Sanqi marry him.

401
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,640
Even if it's fatal,

402
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,110
I have to go.

403
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,190
Have you ever thought that

404
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:48,920
if you go there,

405
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,590
both Sanqi and my father will be in danger?

406
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,230
And I can see that,

407
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,950
regardless of He Zhen's identity,

408
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,160
he truly loves Sanqi.

409
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,470
Sanqi will be fine.

410
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,040
But you are different.

411
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,000
If you really go to stir

412
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,800
Lord's mansion,

413
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,760
she will be in danger.

414
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
The top priority now is that

415
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,880
I have to meet my father

416
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,800
and tell him everything.

417
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:20,710
Ruoyao.

418
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,160
Help me.

419
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,560
Help!

420
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,190
Young Lady, where are you going?

421
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,350
I just turn around.

422
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,520
Just turn around.

423
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,560
This is Lord's mansion.

424
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,710
You can't turn around casually.

425
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,430
I'm not sure whether

426
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,310
something bad will happen to you

427
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,950
if you see something you shouldn't see.

428
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,160
Wet Nurse Lan.

429
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,310
Is the etiquette today not yet learned?

430
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,830
I suddenly want to learn etiquette.

431
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,280
Thinking of the approaching wedding,

432
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,800
I'm a little nervous.

433
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,830
If you show

434
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,830
such an attitude earlier,

435
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,920
you won't be nervous.

436
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,520
The wedding will be held in days.

437
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,760
Young Lord said

438
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,000
you should rest

439
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,760
in room these days

440
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,520
and shouldn't go out again.

441
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,520
If you have any accident,

442
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,350
I can't afford it.

443
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,470
Okay. Okay.

444
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,000
I know. I know.

445
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,070
Bai Yifei and Ruoyao haven't returned yet.

446
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,350
I can't discuss with anyone.

447
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,040
Lord flatly would not believe me.

448
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,400
What should I do?

449
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:47,880
Let's go.

450
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,280
Lord.

451
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,040
Lady Jinyan is back.

452
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,350
She is waiting outside the hall.

453
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,640
Tell her to come in.

454
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,190
Yes.

455
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,310
Here are my greetings, father.

456
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,070
Here are my greetings, lord.

457
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,710
Get up.

458
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,070
Thank you, lord.

459
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,680
After having enough fun outside,

460
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,880
you finally come back

461
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,880
and bring a sweetheart over.

462
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,590
How do you know it?

463
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,680
Let me introduce.

464
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,190
This is Bai Yifei, the son of Taifu Magistrate of northern city.

465
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,190
What do you think?

466
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,710
You bring him here.

467
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,230
You know how he is.

468
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:06,920
Pretty good.

469
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,640
That's it.

470
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,710
Do you want to get married on the same day with your brother?

471
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,560
Father,

472
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,280
what did you say?

473
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,800
Blood!

474
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,760
Blood.

475
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,560
How did you guys serve him?

476
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:48,680
Wait.

477
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
What happened?

478
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
This medicine is hot.

479
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,430
He should drink it after it turns a bit cold.

480
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,190
You leave first.

481
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,470
Yes.

482
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,430
Oops. Wet Nurse.

483
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,310
Just let me go out.

484
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,000
Lady Jinyan and I are good friends.

485
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,230
Just let me meet her

486
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,000
before my wedding, okay?

487
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,520
Young Lord ordered that,

488
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,640
before the wedding.

489
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,950
except for him,

490
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,000
no one can enter.

491
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,920
So you'd better stay in your room.

492
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,800
Father.

493
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,950
He Zhen?

494
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,470
Why didn't you come here without a notice?

495
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,880
I heard that

496
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,800
Jinyan is back.

497
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,310
Brother.

498
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,400
You left

499
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,040
many days earlier than me,

500
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,800
why are you back now?

501
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,310
I enjoyed the scenery on the way.

502
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,470
He Zhen.

503
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,590
I really like

504
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,590
Sanqi so much.

505
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,280
I hope that before I die,

506
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,830
you two can hold your weddings.

507
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,710
Don't be discouraged, father.

508
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,680
You will be fine.

509
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,430
Don't comfort me.

510
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,950
As long as you get married,

511
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,830
I will leave Taoyuan City to you with peace of mind.

512
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,520
Yes, father.

513
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,190
I hope the wedding

514
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,920
could be more lively and festival.

515
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,760
Do you have any idea?

516
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,760
Father.

517
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,190
Why don't you leave it to me?

518
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,640
We can invite some folk troupes to come over.

519
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,950
I haven't watched dramas for years.

520
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,760
Well,

521
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,880
we can make brother's wedding

522
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,950
a big festival event.

523
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,040
I haven't watched dramas for long.

524
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,590
Leave it to me.

525
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,640
You?

526
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,110
Yeah.

527
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,680
I'm familiar with the opera troupes in the capital.

528
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,310
In addition,

529
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,830
brother is busy with government affairs

530
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,680
and planning his wedding.

531
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,710
Let me do such trivial things.

532
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,160
I want to help brother too.

533
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,350
Yeah.

534
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,230
It's your brother's wedding after all.

535
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,280
You must help him.

536
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:19,760
You should

537
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,350
find the best troupe.

538
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,040
Got it.

539
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,430
Decree of Lord.

540
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,280
Young Lord's wedding is approaching.

541
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,830
To celebrate it

542
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,310
with all people in the city,

543
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,350
I order

544
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,280
an amnesty.

545
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,040
Besides heinous culprits,

546
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,680
all prisoners will be pardoned.

547
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:14,760
Taxes will be relieved for three months in Taoyuan City.

548
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,470
Congratulations, Lord.

549
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,760
I've waited for it for so many years.

550
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,230
It finally comes.

551
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,040
Yes.

552
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,430
Sanqi.

553
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,190
From now on,

554
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,190
I will let you

555
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,950
be the happiest woman in the world every day.

556
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,800
I believe you.

557
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,470
I want to spend my life

558
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,640
with my immortal brother

559
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,070
Young Lord.

560
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,950
The troupe from southern city invited by Lady Jinyan

561
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,280
is performing outside.

562
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,160
Okay. I know.

563
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:23,000
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

564
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,920
Bravo.

565
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,760
Bravo.

566
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,160
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

567
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,830
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

568
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,310
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

569
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,110
Only we know this grimace.

570
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,110
I send it to protect you for me.

571
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,880
When I am not by your side,

572
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,950
it will

573
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,350
represent me.

574
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:26,470
An old man

575
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,230
with two ears

576
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,280
has no meals for three days,

577
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,160
so he is so hungry that he's busy with cooking.

578
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,350
He bought two onions with 0.33 tael.

579
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,680
He bought two watermelons with 0.66 tael.

580
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,310
He bought two loofahs with 0.77 tael.

581
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,470
And also two sticks of sugarcoated haws.

582
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,640
An old man

583
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,680
with two ears

584
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,640
has no meals for three days,

585
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,640

588
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,560
I made my name ring with bamboo chips.

589
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,470
I give it to you now.

590
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,590
We are destined to be together.

591
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,230
You are my immortal brother.

592
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,920
I finally found you.

593
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,070
An old man

594
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:56,070

00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,000
has no meals for three days.

596
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,110
As long as I'm your wife,

597
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,160
I'll save you.

598
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,160
The most important thing to be a wife

599
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,640
is to be righteous.

600
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,350
Trust me.

601
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,590
He bought two onions with 0.33 tael.

602
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,470
I will never

603
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,400
let anyone bully you later.

604
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,640
He bought two watermelons with 0.77 tael.

605
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,310
Zhao Cuo.

606
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,830
Didn't you eat?

607
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,160
You garbage.

608
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,590
Stop.

609
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,640
If you have any difficulty in the future,

610
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,040
I will be the first to come to you.

611
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,070
An old man

612
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,830

618
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,430
And also two sticks of sugarcoated haws.

619
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,590
Bow to Heaven and Earth.

620
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,920
Bow to parents.

621
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,590
Bow to each other.

622
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,430
Step into the wedding room.
