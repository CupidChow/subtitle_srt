I've Fallen for You

00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,900
Episode 5

4
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,759
Someone dies. Help.

5
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,400
Someone dies.

6
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,229
Someone dies. Someone dies.

7
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,509
Taifu Magistrate of southern city is investigating a case.

8
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,400
Irrelevant people, please avoid.

9
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,630
Why did someone die?

10
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,229
Taifu Magistrate of northern city is investigating a case.

11
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,220
Irrelevant people, please avoid.

12
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,440
Was the corpse recovered?

13
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,600
Yes, it was recovered.

14
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,720
We sent a lot of fishermen

15
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,160
to find it.

16
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,720
What affected manners!

17
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,079
How hypocritical!

18
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,720
Where was the corpses found?

19
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
In the middle of the river

20
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,960
to the north side.

21
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,960
Did you hear that?

22
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,270
To the north side.

23
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,800
This is the case of northern city.

24
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,270
Oh,

25
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,880
there's a homicide in northern city.

26
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,550
Your Excellency,

27
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,750
the dead is a resident of southern city.

28
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,240
Why do you laugh, Bai?

29
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,440
We agreed in advance that

30
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,390
we should take the river as the boundary.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,360
That corpse

32
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,720
was to the north.

33
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,550
It belongs to the case of your northern city

34
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,270
and has nothing to do with our southern city.

35
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,800
Let's go.

36
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,360
Taifu Magistrate Zhao Quandui of southern city looks upon human lives.

37
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,829
After a homicide case happened within his jurisdiction,

38
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,390
he passes the buck.

39
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,550
Your Excellency Bai,

40
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,110
stop writing it down.

41
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,320
I will investigate it. I will investigate it.

42
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,960
I will investigate it, OK?

43
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,720
Yamen runner,

44
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,520
investigate the homicide case with me.

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:32,960
Yes.

46
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,910
Let's go.

47
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,670
The corpse looks pale.

48
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,470
The corpse is reddish in color,

49
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,440
with goose bumps

50
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,550
on the thighs, shoulders and arms.

51
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,030
The death time of the dead

52
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,079
shall not exceed two hours.

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,079
Taifu Magistrate,

54
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,550
the time of death is within two hours.

55
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,440
There is no obvious physical injury.

56
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,190
It's algae

57
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,030
on its hand.

58
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,190
There is mud in its nails.

59
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,880
The dead must have struggled in the water.

60
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,670
There is mud in its mouth.

61
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,160
Yes,

62
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,230
the dead did drown.

63
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,790
There is no trauma or bone injury on the dead.

64
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,950
The water temperature is low at night.

65
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,640
Rigor mortis may set in earlier.

66
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,510
There is sediment in its mouth.

67
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,110
It seems that it was drowned

68
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,950
rather than killed or poisoned and dumped in the river.

69
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,440
Yes,

70
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,790
I saw him jump with my own eyes.

71
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,110
Yeah. Yeah. I saw him jump with my own eyes.

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,550
This case has been concluded.

73
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,550
This man threw himself into the river and died.

74
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,860
You can leave.

75
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,440
What?

76
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,350
My daughter-in-law hasn't come back yet?

77
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,510
You! You!

78
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,920
Weren't you with her?

79
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,510
I watched the show of Full Spring Festival.

80
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,760
I don't know where she is.

81
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,830
How, how you dare say that!

82
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,790
A manic murder took place today.

83
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,760
You, you left her alone?

84
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,230
Isn't that suicide?

85
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,070
What suicide?

86
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,600
All in all,

87
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,820
it's dangerous outside.

88
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,790
Let me tell you,

89
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,550
if there's anything wrong with my daughter-in-law,

90
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,160
I will beat you to death.

91
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,040
Li Jia, let's go.

92
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,460
-What are you doing in the middle of the night? -Go and find her.

93
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,670
I'll go and find her.

94
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,880
We've looked around.

95
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,550
Where can that girl go?

96
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,270
Could she…

97
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,110
Young Master, take it easy.

98
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,390
Just Face,

99
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,880
why do you have to fight with me for everything?

100
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,950
You don't even let slip my servant girl.

101
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,040
Zhao Cuo,

102
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,920
what are you talking about?

103
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,880
Miss Sanqi and I are in a clear relationship.

104
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,600
Did he kiss you?

105
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,860
Mr. Bai is a good guy.

106
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,720
Only you will bully me.

107
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,580
I'm a bad guy

108
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,720
and he is a good guy.

109
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,060
Li Jia,

110
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,950
let's go.

111
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,880
I'm leaving.

112
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,070
Don't forget tomorrow's date.

113
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,620
See you tomorrow.

114
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,270
They have an affair.

115
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,480
They were intimate in front of me.

116
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,380
Who am I?

117
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,390
Who am I?

118
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,270
Young Master,

119
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,620
I don't understand.

120
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,980
Don't you always want to get rid of

121
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,920
He Jinxin?

122
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,600
That's right.

123
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,350
Indeed.

124
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,320
Why don't I give this jinx to him?

125
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,670
Give this jinx to him.

126
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,160
I'm so happy that

127
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,670
someone can take over this jinx.

128
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,320
Indeed.

129
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,720
Young Master,

130
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,790
we can make use of this opportunity

131
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,640
to be free again.

132
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,600
Listen to me.

133
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,390
Today's weather

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,920
is very good.

135
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,480
It's very suitable for boarding and having fun.

136
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,230
Only you and me?

137
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,790
Yes.

138
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,420
I have a stomachache.

139
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,720
You sit there and wait for me.

140
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,230
I'll go to the toilet

141
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:07,720
and be right back.

142
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,860
Mr. Bai,

143
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,320
why are you here?

144
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,880
Didn't Miss Jinxin

145
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,110
ask me to keep the appointment?

146
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:41,760
Young Master,

147
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,080
is my trick

148
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,140
great?

149
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,230
Think about it.

150
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,670
The lone man and woman

151
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,000
share a boat.

152
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,350
They will be aflame with desire.

153
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:50,880
Shut up.

154
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,280
Think about it.

155
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,230
They will be aflame with desire.

156
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,150
How is my trick?

157
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,520
I ask you to shut up.

158
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,880
Shut up.

159
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,910
Shut up.

160
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,470
Why is the boat leaking?

161
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,150
What should we do?

162
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,640
I can't swim.

163
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,880
How about this?

164
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,230
You can swim with the driftwood later

165
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,900
and leave me alone.

166
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,320
The water is rising high.

167
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,940
What should we do?

168
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,760
Is there anyone here?

169
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,150
Help.

170
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,760
Help.

171
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,840
Help.

172
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,400
Do something.

173
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,550
So terrible.

174
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,660
Young Master,

175
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,790
I have another trick.

176
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,110
I'm sure they will be together.

177
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,900
What do you mean by that?

178
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,790
I made a small hole in the boat,

179
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,710
which is filled with mud.

180
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,460
When the boat reaches the middle of the lake,

181
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,110
it will leak.

182
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,710
They'll get wet after the leak.

183
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,840
When they're wet, they must…

184
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,910
Are you a fool?

185
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,960
Just Face can't swim at all.

186
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,710
That girl is so stupid.

187
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,080
Young Master, wait for me.

188
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,840
He Jinxin, I'm here to save you.

189
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,350
He Jinxin, Bai,

190
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,200
wait for me. I'm here to save you.

191
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,780
Zhao Cuo,

192
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,670
why do you take off clothes

193
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,380
here?

194
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,000
So hot.

195
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,840
Are you OK?

196
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,230
Do you get choked?

197
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,000
Did you not know how to swim when you were a kid?

198
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,080
Why didn't you choke to death?

199
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,550
Luckily, Miss Jinxin saved me.

200
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,520
How did you know

201
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,400
we would get drowned?

202
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,230
I can tell fortune.

203
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,880
Zhao Cuo,

204
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,960
what's your progress

205
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,880
in these years?

206
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,030
You're even joking about human life.

207
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,110
Well,

208
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,150
I figure out

209
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,320
I should go home.

210
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,840
Come back.

211
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,200
Why do you quarrel as soon as you meet?

212
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,760
It's a long story. I…

213
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,640
Sir, come here.

214
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,030
Sir, come here to have fun.

215
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,320
See you.

216
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,590
See you, sir.

217
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,550
Come again.

218
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,230
Next time. Next time.

219
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,760
Hurry up.

220
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,230
Welcome. Welcome.

221
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,910
Mr. Zhao,

222
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,550
are you looking for Mr. Wen and Mr. Liang?

223
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,000
The two of them are in a private room here.

224
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,230
This way please.

225
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,880
Mr. Wen,

226
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,280
Yang Yong died.

227
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,150
Does the ancestral house of Zhao Cuo

228
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,000
count?

229
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,000
Why?

230
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,440
Have a look.

231
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,030
What is this?

232
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,470
Isn't this the written pledge

233
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,550
signed by Zhao Cuo that day?

234
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,110
Why is it in your hands?

235
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,550
We set up a trap that day.

236
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,150
It was not easy to lead him to the hook.

237
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,470
How can we let him go?

238
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,150
He should blame himself for being stupid

239
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,840
and losing his ancestral house for nothing.

240
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,280
Thanks to

241
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,710
your performance as his brother.

242
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,100
Brother?

243
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,550
I'm not his brother.

244
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,470
To be honest,

245
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,640
he is a good-for-nothing.

246
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,550
What did you

247
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,640
pour on me?

248
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,550
Swill.

249
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,320
It is given to pigs to eat.

250
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,440
You should thank me.

251
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,150
You're welcome.

252
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,080
My Young Master let me tell you

253
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,700
he doesn't want to be a friend with you brats.

254
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,590
Zhao Cuo. Zhao Cuo.

255
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,000
I told you

256
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,640
they were bad guys.

257
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,030
They are finally exposed.

258
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,550
Don't be upset.

259
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,200
Such friends are nothing.

260
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,100
Leave me alone.

261
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,000
How can I leave you alone?

262
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,150
They are freeloaders who spend your money

263
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,000
and treat you as a fool.

264
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,840
Yes,

265
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,400
I'm a fool.

266
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,200
People throughout southern city all know

267
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,590
I'm rich.

268
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,910
I'm willing to spend money making friends.

269
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,640
It's none of your business.

270
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,080
All I do is to have fun.

271
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,640
You!

272
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,200
You're helpless.

273
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,670
So what?

274
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,590
Mr. Zhang,

275
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,640
the show hasn't started yet.

276
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,790
Why are you leaving?

277
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,880
I have drunk too much today.

278
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,030
Take it slow next time.

279
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,280
You drank too fast.

280
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,200
I can't believe

281
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,400
you look so good in men's clothes.

282
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,470
The show is about to begin.

283
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,520
Let's go in.

284
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,910
Miss, is something on your mind?

285
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,280
Nothing.

286
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,080
Let's get in.

287
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,200
Slow down. Slow down.

288
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,470
See you.

289
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,880
Mr. Zhao.

290
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,760
Mr. Zhao, what are you doing?

291
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,590
So many people are watching.

292
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,320
Don't stir up trouble.

293
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,080
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

294
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,910
Let's talk about it nicely.

295
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,230
Wen Xiao,

296
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,110
I will get even with you

297
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,520
after tonight.

298
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,590
It's too hot.

299
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,150
Calm down. Calm down.

300
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,080
Don't be angry. Don't be angry.

301
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,520
Don't get angry.

302
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,840
The wine is ready for you.

303
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,350
I'll be right back with you.

304
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,840
Just a moment.

305
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,400
Mr. Wen,

306
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,670
come here. This way. This way.

307
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,670
Xiaohong, hurry up.

308
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,000
Take care of them two.

309
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,320
They two are in a bad mood today.

310
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,400
You must make them satisfied.

311
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,880
Did you hear me?

312
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,470
Yes.

313
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,590
I'm a little busy.

314
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,550
I'll be back later.

315
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,230
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

316
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,030
Boss, go ahead with your business.

317
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,760
OK.

318
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,710
Coming.

319
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,150
Mr. Wen.

320
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,520
I'm going to the toilet.

321
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,400
Go. Go.

322
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,230
OK.

323
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,400
How beautiful!

324
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,710
So beautiful.

325
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,440
I want that too.

326
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,030
She dances so well.

327
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,960
Indeed. Indeed.

328
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,920
She is so beautiful, isn't she?

329
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,190
Yes, she is.

330
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,680
Get out of the way.

331
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,069
I'm going to the toilet.

332
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,830
Great.

333
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,880
Great.

334
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,830
Listen to the tweedle.

335
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:45,000
I live upstream and you downstream by the Yangtze River.

336
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,230
It's “You Live Downstream by the Yangtze River.”

337
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,190
I think of you day after day, but you are not in view.

338
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,400
The private room upstairs.

339
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,000
Go.

340
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,640
Leimo.

341
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,280
Leimo.

342
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,470
Leimo.

343
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:25,760
Mr. Wen.

344
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,800
Mr. Wen.

345
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,040
It's impossible.

346
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,640
It's impossible.

347
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,880
Get out of the way. Get out of the way.

348
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,230
Why should I investigate this case?

349
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,760
This man hanged himself.

350
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,350
Leave.

351
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,590
Taifu Magistrate Zhao,

352
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,470
it's a matter of life.

353
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,350
You'd better be careful.

354
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,470
Have you checked?

355
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,880
Was anyone here tonight?

356
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,400
I have asked about it.

357
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,040
It's true that no one came in or out.

358
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,920
The first person to find out is our old music master.

359
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,230
At that time, I heard the tweedle coming out.

360
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,680
I took a peep

361
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,430
because I was curious.

362
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,520
I didn't expect that…

363
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,880
The window is locked from the inside.

364
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,520
No one can get in from the outside.

365
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,710
You mean

366
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,140
it's impossible for someone to get in and out of this room

367
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,430
before the old music master comes in,

368
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,950
right?

369
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,040
Yes.

370
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,700
Why hasn't the coroner come yet?

371
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,190
Coming.

372
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
Coming. Coming.

373
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,950
Coming.

374
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,760
Hurry up.

375
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,830
You need to find out how he died.

376
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,070
The face is purplish swelling,

377
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,800
the tongue is exposed,

378
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,820
the body is bleeding in spots,

379
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,140
the marks on the neck are in the same depth

380
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,350
without interruption,

381
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,560
and the body surface is non-invasive.

382
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,340
This man was strangled to death by hanging.

383
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,560
Your Excellency,

384
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,710
this man was strangled to death by hanging.

385
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,560
What did I say?

386
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,400
He was strangled to death by hanging.

387
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,310
You can leave.

388
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,280
You can leave. You can leave.

389
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,710
When the two men died, there was tweedle.

390
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,710
Is it a ghost killing?

391
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,830
What ghost killing?

392
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,110
What tweedle?

393
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,800
The tweedle mentioned by this man

394
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,110
was “You Live Downstream by the Yangtze River”

395
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,920
played by Miss Leimo.

396
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,350
We heard the same tweedle

397
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,110
before we found this corpse.

398
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,350
That's right. She killed him. Sure.

399
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,830
What are you talking about?

400
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,000
Are you all stupid?

401
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,430
You really believe that tweedle can kill people?

402
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,800
Why not?

403
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,830
Why did you play

404
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,580
the long lost “You Live Downstream by the Yangtze River”

405
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,800
that day,

406
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,640
Miss Leimo?

407
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,880
Your Excellency Taifu Magistrate,

408
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,640
I just accidentally got the score

409
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,950
from the street vendor.

410
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,560
I don't know the origin of this.

411
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,800
That's right.

412
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,350
Leimo hasn't been in southern city for a long time.

413
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,310
What's more, Leimo was playing the zither in public

414
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,300
on the crime scene.

415
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,040
What else do you want to say?

416
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,040
Fine. Stop fighting.

417
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,640
Tweedle can't kill people,

418
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,920
let alone gods or ghosts.

419
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,800
The case has been concluded.

420
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,000
This man was strangled to death by hanging.

421
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,520
You can leave. Leave.

422
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
The case has been concluded. Go.

423
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,460
Go.

424
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,560
Have a look.

425
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,710
Hot steamed buns.

426
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,000
Fresh steamed buns.

427
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,040
Hot steamed buns.

428
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,110
Any kind of stuffing.

429
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,230
Any kind of stuffing.

430
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,830
Hou, did you hear about

431
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,520
last night?

432
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,190
It's said that on the night

433
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,950
when Sifu Troupe was burned three years ago,

434
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,470
there was tweedle from the ruins.

435
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,260
It was such a song that was played.

436
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,400
It's so scary.

437
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,560
The evil influence must linger on

438
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,640
and run into the city to scare people.

439
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,280
Then I will move to northern city.

440
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,230
Southern city is no longer a place for people to stay.

441
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,640
Everyone in southern city feels in danger.

442
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
It's time for me to restore honor

443
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,400
and protect southern city.

444
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,760
Great, dad.

445
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,560
Take your time.

446
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,280
You do it.

447
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,560
Stop pretending.

448
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,640
Everyone knows

449
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,560
you're in a good relationship

450
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,350
with the entertainer Leimo.

451
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,190
Go and inquire about it.

452
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,070
Dirty old man.

453
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,400
Let's replace alcohol with tea.

454
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,070
Yang Yong

455
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,310
jumped off the boat under the bridge that day

456
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,110
and was found here

457
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,800
two hours later, right?

458
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,160
Yes.

459
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,160
We also saw him jump into the river.

460
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,310
The autopsy report says

461
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,280
he drowned.

462
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,950
Did he really commit suicide?

463
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,470
Let's go to the whorehouse again.

464
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,430
You really didn't know that?

465
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,350
No, I didn't.

466
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,590
I won't lie to you.

467
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,950
If I knew it, I would have long told you about it.

468
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,760
Indeed.

469
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,880
Is this Just Face of northern city?

470
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,190
Why do you intervene in

471
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,830
the case of our southern city?

472
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,830
You even bring my,

473
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,880
my servant girl with you.

474
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,580
I…

475
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,300
It is the dead that matters.

476
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
Northern city and southern city shouldn't be divided.

477
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,760
Let's do it based on our own ability.

478
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,230
OK.

479
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,190
Leimo, don't be afraid.

480
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,920
Tell me if there is anything.

481
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,830
They all said my tweedle

482
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,590
killed Yang Yong.

483
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,280
I didn't.

484
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
You said

485
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,000
you bought your score on the market.

486
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,830
Do you remember where it was?

487
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,710
Actually, I lied that day.

488
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,560
I got the score from the music master.

489
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,000
I found the melody was novel and mellow,

490
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,190
so I performed it

491
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,000
on the day of Full Spring Festival.

492
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,470
The procuress was afraid that

493
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,710
we would get involved in a murder case,

494
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,430
so she didn't allow me to tell the truth.

495
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,560
Young Master.

496
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,470
Young Master, I was just asked to give this to you.

497
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,560
Go.

498
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,880
You go first.

499
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,430
I'll be with you in a minute.

500
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,160
Tell me

501
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,760
why you killed people.

502
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:47,920
I was wronged.

503
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,710
I didn't kill anyone.

504
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,880
It's not him.

505
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,400
He has a serious problem with his leg.

506
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,000
He couldn't hold Wen Xiao

507
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,760
on the rope with his power.

508
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,830
Yes.

509
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,400
That's right.

510
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,590
I saw you hide something that day.

511
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,920
What on earth did you take from the dead?

512
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,590
Here.

513
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,790
[I already know the secret of the fire three years ago.]

514
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:27,260
[Come to the whorehouse's guest room with bank notes of 3,000 taels of silver.]

515
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,260
You're the one that Wen Xiao wanted to see that day?

516
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,640
What was the secret three years ago?

517
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,920
I passed by the private room

518
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,400
and overheard their secret that day.

519
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,560
Yang Yong,

520
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,560
what do you mean by that?

521
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,230
You got the ancestral house

522
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,070
of Zhao Cuo

523
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,470
because we set a trap together.

524
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,300
You just share a little bit with us.

525
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,470
Do you think we're beggars?

526
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,680
Do you think

527
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,710
everyone has a share?

528
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,660
You two

529
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,000
are so greedy.

530
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,470
Yang Yong,

531
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,590
you're ungrateful.

532
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,400
We three

533
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,230
are always in the same boat.

534
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,920
I think you forgot

535
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,710
the fire in Sifu Troupe three years ago.

536
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,470
You!

537
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,800
You think you two can get rid of

538
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,640
what happened three years ago?

539
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,580
They set the fire three years ago.

540
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,820
I was trying to figure out how to blackmail them.

541
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,420
But before I did,

542
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,590
I had to scare them.

543
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,740
I spent a lot of effort

544
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,500
to get the score of that year

545
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,140
from Mr. Zhang of a tailor store in southern city,

546
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,780
and then…

547
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,500
I wanted to scare them.

548
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,830
How could I know that Yang Yong really died?

549
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,160
I wanted to blackmail Wen Xiao and run away,

550
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,060
but I didn't expect…

551
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,800
[I already know the secret of the fire three years ago.]

552
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,860
[Come to the whorehouse's guest room with bank notes of 3,000 taels of silver.]

553
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,400
Wait a minute.

554
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,680
You said there were three people

555
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,880
involved in the extermination case in the past.

556
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,580
Who else is it

557
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,710
besides Yang Yong and Wen Xiao?

558
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,040
And,

559
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,920
and Mr. Liang Xiangsong.

560
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,460
Oh, no.

561
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,780
…and you downstream by the Yangtze River.

562
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,350
Zhao Cuo,

563
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,110
why are you here?

564
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,160
I fainted when I came here.

565
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,470
I wake up like this.

566
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,710
Someone dies.

567
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,920
He's dead.

568
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,040
He killed a person.

569
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,230
He's the murderer. Punish Zhao Cuo severely.

570
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,310
He's the murderer.

571
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,710
Zhao Cuo is the murderer.

572
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,800
He's the murderer. Punish Zhao Cuo severely.

573
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,230
I didn't kill him.

574
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,400
He's the murderer.

575
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,280
Get out of the way. Get out of the way.

576
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,110
Zhao Cuo is the murderer.

577
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,520
Punish Zhao Cuo severely.

578
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,590
Zhao Cuo can't be the murderer.

579
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,180
Who said my son killed someone?

580
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,680
Stand out. Stand out.

581
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,920
Cuo, go with me.

582
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,800
Stop.

583
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,920
You need my permission

584
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,280
before you want to take the suspect away.

585
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,190
Now I'm taking over

586
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,590
this case.

587
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,310
You can't be involved in this case anymore.

588
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,950
Bai,

589
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,520
why?

590
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,420
Have a look,

591
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,900
these are all people in southern city.

592
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,760
The dead died in the area of southern city

593
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,710
and was a resident of southern city.

594
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,710
You want to take over the case?

595
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,710
How can you take it over?

596
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,400
How?

597
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,280
You don't see what's going on now?

598
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,560
Your son is a suspect.

599
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,040
Don't you know how to avoid suspicion

600
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,830
as a court official?

601
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,310
I…

602
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:10,920
Get out of the way.

603
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,160
Don't prevent me from handling the case.

604
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,160
Your Excellency,

605
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,280
Liang Xiangsong was stabbed in the heart

606
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,880
with a sharp weapon.

607
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,680
The shape and size of the wound

608
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,950
were exactly the same as those of this sword.

609
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,640
Step back.

610
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,760
Zhao Cuo,

611
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,040
what else do you have to say?

612
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,710
I didn't kill him.

613
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,740
I was here for an appointment.

614
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,420
I received a letter this noon,

615
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,280
signed by Liang Xiangsong.

616
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,920
He had the truth to tell me.

617
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,280
But not long after I got here,

618
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,040
I was so weak that I fainted here.

619
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,680
Letter?

620
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,520
What letter?

621
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,880
Take it out.

622
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,590
You don't have evidence.

623
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,180
Someone.

624
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,190
Detain him.

625
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:15,830
Dad,

626
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,560
the murderer should not be Zhao Cuo.

627
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,590
Though he is naughty,

628
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,880
he can never kill people.

629
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,920
What are you talking about?

630
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,040
Who else is the murderer except him?

631
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,950
Now I suspect all three of them

632
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,190
were killed by Zhao Cuo.

633
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,110
He lured us into thinking

634
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,830
it was done by the ghosts with tweedle.

635
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,560
Step back.

636
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,470
You're slinging mud at me.

637
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,800
Zhao Cuo,

638
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,760
let me ask you.

639
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,230
Where were you

640
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,400
when Yang Yong died?

641
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,640
Where were you

642
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,160
when Wen Xiao died?

643
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,760
I watched a show on the boat

644
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,000
when Yang Yong died.

645
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,590
I went to the toilet

646
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,110
when Wen Xiao died.

647
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,280
We all watched the show that day.

648
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,230
Why were you on the boat?

649
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,400
That was a boat

650
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,140
specially reserved for Young Master by Leimo.

651
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,000
You can ask Miss Leimo.

652
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,220
We all know

653
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,310
Leimo is Zhao Cuo's sweetheart.

654
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,280
What's the use in asking her?

655
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:06,760
Am I right?

656
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,590
Yes.

657
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,830
Who can prove it?

658
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,460
No one can prove it.

659
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,350
It was Zhao Cuo.

660
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,070
It must be him.

661
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,560
Zhao Cuo killed them.

662
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,230
That day, I saw

663
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,590
Zhao Cuo lose the ancestral house to Yang Yong in person.

664
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,110
He took his revenge on them.

665
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,580
He killed them.

666
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,950
That's right. I saw

667
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,710
Zhao Cuo, Wen Xiao and Liang Xiangsong

668
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,800
fight in the restaurant that day.

669
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,400
It's him. It's him.

670
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,350
He killed them.

671
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,280
He's the murderer.

672
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,800
OK.

673
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,900
Now it's been proven that

674
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,950
you three have hatred.

675
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,160
You killed them in anger.

676
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,430
You hid yourself very well

677
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,040
when you killed the two people before.

678
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,310
But now you've been caught by me.

679
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,500
It makes sense. It makes sense.

680
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,680
It makes sense.

681
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,760
Yes. That's right.

682
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,560
I don't think there is any doubt about this case.

683
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,830
The evidence is certain.

684
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,040
Someone.

685
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,590
Detain Zhao Cuo.

686
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,190
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

687
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,400
Who dares to lay a finger on my son!

688
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,590
Who dares to lay a finger on my son!

689
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,310
Zhao Quandui,

690
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,560
your son killed people.

691
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,310
Do you want to bend the law for your son?

692
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,070
I think you can be removed

693
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,400
from your post today.

694
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,760
I will write a memorial to the throne to report on you.

695
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Whatever.

696
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,350
Let me see

697
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,950
who dares to lay a finger on my son!

698
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,400
I will fight with him desperately.

699
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,350
Yamen runners, get ready.

700
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,160
Let me have a try.

701
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,070
Have a try.

702
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,230
I won't bend the law for your son

703
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,400
and let go of the murderer.

704
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,000
Someone.

705
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Your Excellency Bai,

706
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,310
there are many unsolved mysteries in this case.

707
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,520
Now it's too arbitrary to say he's the murderer.

708
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,400
Three days.

709
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,830
You give me three days.

710
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,190
If I can't find out the truth,

711
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,710
I'm willing to die with Zhao Cuo.

712
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,110
Who are you?

713
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,700
I'm Zhao Cuo's…

714
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,310
Servant girl.

715
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,100
What's the value of a servant's life?

716
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,040
Step back.

717
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,620
I won't go.

718
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,800
Mr. Bai,

719
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,140
please accept my request.

720
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,860
Well…

721
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,060
He Jinxin,

722
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,400
believe it or not,

723
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,230
I'll divorce you with a divorce certificate now.

724
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,520
Whatever.

725
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,710
As long as I'm your wife,

726
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,000
I'll save you.

727
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,350
The most important thing to be a wife is to be righteous.

728
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:06,920
Trust me.

729
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:10,280
Your Excellency Bai,

730
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,320
if I can't find out the real murderer in three days,

731
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,040
I'm willing to die with Zhao Cuo.

732
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,670
Please decide.

733
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,469
She really overestimates herself.

734
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,230
Your Excellency, don't worry.

735
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
She can't find it out

736
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,909
in 30 days,

737
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:24,670
let alone three days.

738
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,520
What can

739
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,120
a servant girl do?

740
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,320
Jinxin,

741
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,870
I know you're in a hurry to save Cuo's life.

742
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,710
But you're a weak woman.

743
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,280
How can you solve the case?

744
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,000
Dad, I believe Zhao Cuo.

745
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,280
As long as he is innocent,

746
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,909
I will prove his innocence.

747
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:42,909
Trust me.

748
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,469
OK.

749
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,120
Bai,

750
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,389
you can take him away.

751
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,360
But did you hear

752
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,840
what my, my servant girl said

753
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,800
just now?

754
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,190
What do you think?

755
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,300
Dad, there are still many doubts in this case.

756
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,710
You must not close this case.

757
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,390
It's against your intelligence.

758
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,430
Why don't you

759
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,320
just give her three days to solve the case?

760
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,280
OK.

761
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
I'll give you three days.

762
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,230
If you can't get the evidence three days later,

763
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,080
Zhao Cuo's death sentence is inevitable.

764
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,150
Someone, detain Zhao Cuo.

765
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,870
Don't touch me.

766
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,080
I can walk myself.

767
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,390
Are you okay?

768
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,910
Trust me.
