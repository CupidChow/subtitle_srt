00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:33,100
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,020
Episode 19

4
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,720
This case is solved.

5
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,270
Mr. Bai is proved to be innocent.

6
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,800
You finally can be together

7
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,550
openly.

8
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,479
See?

9
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,000
Am I worthy of the name

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,950
the Best Detective in the Capital?

11
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,910
Let me tell you.

12
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,550
Today,

13
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,509
in order to celebrate Bai Yifei's being proved to be innocent,

14
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,440
we have to have a meal in a restaurant.

15
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,160
Okay.

16
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,229
Then I will eat as much as I can.

17
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,950
At the thought of roast pigeon,

18
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,480
which is tender with a crispy crust, fat but not greasy,

19
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,760
I am so greedy.

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,760
Just eat.

21
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,800
You have to eat more.

22
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,520
Let me tell you.

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,389
After going to the capital,

24
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,110
you can't eat the delicious food

25
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,160
of southern city.

26
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,390
Well, I mean,

27
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,600
even if Sanqi comes back,

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,440
she will be visiting her family after marriage…

29
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,030
Sorry, I'll keep my mouth shut.

30
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,470
This case is solved.

31
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,000
So I'll go back to the capital with Young Lord.

32
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,470
Are you going now?

33
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,160
I'll be going these days.

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,720
I wanted to tell you earlier,

35
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,910
but I was afraid

36
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,030
I would be loath to leave before I said it.

37
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,470
Sanqi, so many things happened

38
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,390
in southern city recently. Are you really willing to

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,670
leave all these things and people?

40
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,800
No,

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,470
especially roast pigeon.

42
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,750
I can't wait to enjoy it now.

43
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,160
How about going tonight, Ruoyao?

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,240
Okay.

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,240
You go first.

46
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,550
I'm not going.

47
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,190
Zhao, do you just give up like this?

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,079
They both want to

49
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,829
marry each other.

50
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,600
So I'm redundant.

51
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,829
What can I do

52
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,630
if I don't let go?

53
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,550
If you don't try,

54
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,390
how do you know the result?

55
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,960
Bai.

56
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,520
I won't give way.

57
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:39,270
Zhao,

58
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,550
please listen to me.

59
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,160
Life is short and we'll meet a lot of people.

60
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,750
When we meet true love,

61
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,079
we should strive to get it.

62
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,750
Human effort is the decisive factor.

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,030
I believe you.

64
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,110
Strive for it. Okay?

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,520
Okay.

66
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,360
Zhao,

67
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,440
why is your face red and white alternately?

68
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,000
Is… is it?

69
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,360
It isn't.

70
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,720
Well, it's red again.

71
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,070
Could you first let go?

72
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,440
Oh.

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,510
Well, they're getting married.

74
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,390
I'm really at the end of my tether.

75
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,200
But I still should thank you.

76
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,320
I'm going.

77
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,110
I have an idea.

78
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,550
Go ahead.

79
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,110
Mr. Bai.

80
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,440
Young Lord.

81
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,600
What's the matter?

82
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,550
Well.

83
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,440
I'd like to recommend someone to you.

84
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,040
Who do you want to recommend?

85
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,550
Yes.

86
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,720
It's me.

87
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,510
What?

88
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,550
I'm taking the liberty of recommending myself to you.

89
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,600
I've had a crush for your sister for long.

90
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,760
Please help me.

91
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,550
Oh, I see.

92
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,510
My sister has been spoiled

93
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,950
by my father since childhood.

94
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,920
She's too obstinate.

95
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,000
I worried that she couldn't marry before.

96
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,640
Since you

97
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,720
can conquer her,

98
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,320
I will definitely help you.

99
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,670
Not really.

100
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,320
Lady Jinyan is sharp-witted with both ability and wisdom.

101
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,880
It's my greatest luck

102
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,920
to be with her.

103
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,880
Then I

104
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,760
wish you happiness.

105
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,790
Oh.

106
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,350
Thank you. Thank you.

107
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,720
It's okay. It's okay.

108
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,000
Mr. Bai,

109
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,640
is there anything else?

110
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:21,720
Well.

111
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,160
There's something else.

112
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,880
There is.

113
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,920
Please go ahead.

114
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,830
Well…

115
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,640
Er…well…

116
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:50,920
Oh, I'm very interested in Lady Jinyan.

117
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,720
I want to know

118
00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:01,600
her interests and hobbies.

119
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,760
My sister usually likes to

120
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,040
let me take her to practice martial arts and horse riding.

121
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,110
She's like a boy.

122
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,670
Good. Horse riding.

123
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay.

124
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,070
Does she have any other hobby?

125
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,670
Well. What else do you want to know?

126
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,230
So she likes grapes.

127
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,440
Does she like grapes with seeds

128
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,110
or without seeds?

129
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,880
So she once kept a dog

130
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,640
named Lingdang.

131
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,790
She's really naïve, romantic

132
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,470
and lovely.

133
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,470
What did you say?

134
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,640
Did you say anything?

135
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,550
Oh.

136
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,760
I was hearing voices.

137
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,640
Where does Black Potato

138
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,400
put the name ring?

139
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,440
It has been a tradition that

140
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,150
the boy and girl must exchange name rings to marry in Taoyuan City.

141
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,760
I heard that

142
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,080
Sanqi's name ring is in He Zhen's room.

143
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,520
You may steal it

144
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,080
so that they can't get married.

145
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,200
Bai,

146
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,440
usually you look like a gentleman.

147
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,790
Now you want me to do such dirty things.

148
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,110
It's just a suggestion.

149
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,110
You may consider it.

150
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,670
Hum.

151
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,110
Surprise package.

152
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,110
Consider?

153
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,790
I'll steal it tonight.

154
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,590
Where does Black Potato

155
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,590
put the name ring?

156
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,230
Don't be

157
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,670
false of heart.

158
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,280
You just like Zhao Cuo, do you?

159
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,550
Bullshit.

160
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,670
I don't like him.

161
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,840
I like my little brother.

162
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,640
Let me ask you.

163
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,440
When thinking of your little brother,

164
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,710
will your heart beat fast?

165
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,910
No.

166
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,280
When thinking of Zhao Cuo,

167
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,200
do you feel happy

168
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,550
and want to laugh?

169
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,280
Look at you.

170
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,550
I'm also like this when thinking of Bai Yifei.

171
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,520
So it proves that

172
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,840
you like Zhao Cuo.

173
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,440
You don't like my brother.

174
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,520
No.

175
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,790
You're lying.

176
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,520
I like him. I like him.

177
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,590
If you like him,

178
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,470
go and tell him.

179
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,550
Hum.

180
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,440
It's here.

181
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,640
Go.

182
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,880
Why are you here?

183
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,710
Why are you here?

184
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,030
Stand up.

185
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,350
Don't touch my armpit.

186
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,230
I might be pregnant.

187
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,640
Be pregnant?

188
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,470
My head aches.

189
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,520
I'm going to sleep.

190
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:47,960
Come back. Don't move.

191
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,230
Don't move.

192
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,280
Come back.

193
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,840
Why do you come to Black Potato's room

194
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,350
in the middle of the night?

195
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,590
Black Potato?

196
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,320
He Zhen?

197
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,880
This is He Zhen's room?

198
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,440
You…

199
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,470
You drank and came to a man's room

200
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,350
in the middle of the night.

201
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,400
Do you know what this is?

202
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,790
No, I don't.

203
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,320
It's very dangerous.

204
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,350
It's none of your business.

205
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:26,960
Your Highness,

206
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,440
I still have many things

207
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,790
to talk with you.

208
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,320
Mr. Bai,

209
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,470
it's too late.

210
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,910
Let's talk tomorrow.

211
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,400
Your Highness.

212
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,880
Let's have a deep talk till midnight.

213
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,400
I'm really tired.

214
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:47,960
Next time.

215
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,790
Well…

216
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,760
Your Highness.

217
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
If so,

218
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,110
hope you'll have a good night and a good dream.

219
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,960
I'm going.

220
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,640
Just Face

221
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,710
even can't hold him back.

222
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,400
What did you do with Bai Yifei?

223
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,320
Don't talk about this.

224
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,400
Let's hide.

225
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,400
It can't be opened.

226
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,350
You…

227
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,790
Why are you here?

228
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:32,960
Well…

229
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,520
Yeah. Why am I here?

230
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,910
And you're on my bed.

231
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,030
Yeah.

232
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,550
Here's the thing.

233
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,910
Thinking that I'm going to leave southern city,

234
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,710
I feel so sad that

235
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
I can't fall asleep.

236
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,440
So you mean,

237
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,520
you can fall asleep on my bed?

238
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,200
Yes.

239
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,350
In your room, the bed is high and the pillow is soft.

240
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,350
Once I lie on it,

241
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,080
I am so sleepy

242
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,280
and feel like sleeping.

243
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,230
So let's put out the lamps

244
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,910
and sleep early.

245
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,710
Don't, don't. Don't come over.

246
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,230
What's wrong?

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,790
I'm not used to the bed.

248
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,910
I can only fall asleep

249
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,910
when holding my pillow.

250
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,350
Then we must take your pillow

251
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,030
when going back to the capital.

252
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,110
Okay.

253
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,640
How about you go to bring it here now?

254
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,400
Bring your pillow here and put it beside mine?

255
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,030
Yes, that's right.

256
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,520
I'll go right now.

257
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,550
What were you doing?

258
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,400
What did you say?

259
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,350
Are you still in the mood to fight with me? Go.

260
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,880
Eh.

261
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,520
Sanqi?

262
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,230
What's that look?

263
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,320
What did you want to steal in He Zhen's room?

264
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,710
Nothing.

265
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,910
Will you say it or not?

266
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,910
I'll count to three. Three.

267
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,400
Your name ring.

268
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,640
Why do you want my name ring?

269
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,590
I don't want you to leave.

270
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,640
I don't want you to marry him either.

271
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,320
And I don't want him to own your name ring.

272
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,030
Are you satisfied now?

273
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,350
Go to sleep early.

274
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,350
Take good care of yourself in the future.

275
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,830
I will, Young Madam.

276
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,520
What are you thinking, Young Master?

277
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,350
Nothing.

278
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,880
Well, Sanqi will leave the day after tomorrow.

279
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,040
I know.

280
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,560
In fact, I really don't want her to leave.

281
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,880
Though she's not

282
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,800
my lady,

283
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,590
I have taken her

284
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,310
as my own daughter.

285
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,280
So it's quite good to

286
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,140
make the best of a mistake.

287
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,920
Wet Nurse Ling, what do you want to say?

288
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Well, I don't want to persuade you.

289
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,280
I'm a middle-aged woman.

290
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,040
I don't truly understand

291
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,950
the love in the world.

292
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,950
But I think

293
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,160
there are many ways to love.

294
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,400
Sometimes,

295
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,190
letting go can make you really have it.

296
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,520
Wet Nurse Ling.

297
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,920
Just like you, I don't want her to leave.

298
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,640
Let's pray for her from now on.

299
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,520
Wish her happiness

300
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,230
this life.

301
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,040
It's enough as long as she's good.

302
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,560
Hum.

303
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,280
If she can lead a happy life,

304
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,230
I'll also feel happy for her.

305
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,680
It's her birthday tomorrow.

306
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Let's celebrate her birthday together

307
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,000
as the last celebration.

308
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,190
Okay.

309
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,400
Which one to choose?

310
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,520
This one?

311
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,000
This one?

312
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,560
This one?

313
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,430
I'll choose you.

314
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,400
Hum. Good.

315
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,230
It's a perfect start.

316
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,680
Oh, Young Master, what's wrong with you?

317
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,590
I'm fine. I pricked my finger by accident.

318
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,350
Well. What are you holding the needle and thread for?

319
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,590
If you want to sew clothes,

320
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,470
you may ask the servant girls to do it.

321
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,520
Have a look. How do you think of it?

322
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,760
Is it good?

323
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,350
Young Master,

324
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,350
what irritates you?

325
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,000
You are doing embroidery.

326
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,310
What irritates you? You touched my head.

327
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,640
It's Sanqi's birthday tomorrow.

328
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,590
Her small bag

329
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,400
happens to have a hole.

330
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,640
And I don't know what gift I should give her.

331
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,590
So I embroider a doll for her.

332
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,590
Well.

333
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,160
Is it good?

334
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,590
What, what's wrong?

335
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,590
It's too ugly?

336
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,040
No, Young Master.

337
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,920
Since childhood,

338
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,470
you've never sewn your own clothes.

339
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,880
Now you suddenly embroider this for Young Madam,

340
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,310
no, for Sanqi. I…

341
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,400
I just embroider a doll.

342
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,560
It's not difficult.

343
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,710
Young Master,

344
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,920
if you really feel sad,

345
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,710
you may beat me.

346
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,160
Kick my ass.

347
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,880
You can do anything to me.

348
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,800
Please don't act like this.

349
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,680
But if you really can't stand it,

350
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,430
I will help you take

351
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,640
Sanqi back by force at any cost.

352
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,000
Don't say such stupid things, Li Jia.

353
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,110
Well, I've come round.

354
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,590
I just want to

355
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,470
make Sanqi happy

356
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,400
before she leaves.

357
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,710
I don't have any other request.

358
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,400
I, Whirly of Southern City,

359
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,680
won't be beaten so easily.

360
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:28,920
Is that right?

361
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,560
Young Master, I'll be with you.

362
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:34,880
But, to be honest,

363
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,520
you're really ugly when crying.

364
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,280
Zhao Cuo, what's this?

365
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,640
Isn't it Sanqi's haversack?

366
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,520
There's an ugly doll on it.

367
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,310
That's really ugly.

368
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,680
Young Master stayed up all night to

369
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,680
embroider it in person.

370
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,190
Hum.

371
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,680
This is too ugly.

372
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,830
Well, Zhao Cuo.

373
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,800
Is it you?

374
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,350
Look, its head is so big.

375
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,520
Its body doesn't look like a body.

376
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,280
What's this?

377
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,560
Don't you think he looks much like you?

378
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,430
Such a big head.

379
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,430
It's not for you.

380
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,230
I don't want it even if it's for me.

381
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,710
Eh.

382
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,560
Zhao Cuo,

383
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,470
you stayed up all night

384
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,040
to embroider this for Sanqi.

385
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,680
What do you want to do?

386
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,710
It's Sanqi's birthday today.

387
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,190
Young Master wants to make her happy.

388
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,230
You take this as her birthday gift?

389
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,400
That's good.

390
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,830
Is it so ugly?

391
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,470
Well, does it have anything to do with you?

392
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,230
You're so annoying.

393
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,310
Yeah.

394
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,310
Don't give me such ugly things in the future.

395
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,800
Where's it?

396
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,400
Cuckoo.

397
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,430
Cuckoo.

398
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:35,880
Cuckoo.

399
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,040
Cuckoo.

400
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,430
Zhao Cuo, why are you here?

401
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,280
I have something to tell you.

402
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,430
Sanqi, open the door.

403
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,110
I have something to tell you.

404
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,470
Well, Young Lord,

405
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,920
wait a moment. I'll dress up.

406
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,520
I'll be there soon.

407
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,760
What are you doing?

408
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,920
So mysterious.

409
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,520
Let me ask you.

410
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,350
Do you have anything

411
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,400
you like very much?

412
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,190
I like very much?

413
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:08,830
Sanqi,

414
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,560
I'll be waiting for you in the yard.

415
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:11,830
I have something to show you.

416
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,230
Let me ask you.

417
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,350
Do you have anything you like?

418
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,470
For example, silks and brocades,

419
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,070
rouge and powder.

420
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,470
Then I'll give you a gift.

421
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,000
Don't laugh at me.

422
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,350
What's it?

423
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,350
You're so mysterious.

424
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,920
Sanqi, come out.

425
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,160
Three, two, one. Happy birthday.

426
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,880
Wow, firework!

427
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Sanqi, come over.

428
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,880
What's going on?

429
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,400
Why isn't there anyone on the street?

430
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,040
Because

431
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,430
the whole southern city is yours today.

432
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,070
Go. Let's go for a visit.

433
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,430
Young Lord, where are we going?

434
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,280
Don't be anxious. We'll be there soon.

435
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,560
This is my eighth gift to you.

436
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,190
Is it exactly the same as it was eight years ago?

437
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,110
We seem to go back to the past.

438
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,430
I also think it's like a dream.

439
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,590
In the eight years,

440
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,520
I'd been thinking

441
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,110
whether I could

442
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,590
see you again.

443
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,190
Unexpectedly,

444
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,880
you were also waiting for me and looking for me.

445
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,710
Finally, this day comes.

446
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,430
The eight gifts for you today

447
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,830
are just to make up

448
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,000
the eight years when I was absent.

449
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,590
From now on,

450
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,160
I want to be with you

451
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,070
every year.

452
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,950
I won't be absent again.

453
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,400
Please go back to the capital with me tomorrow

454
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,070
so that I can make up

455
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
for the days I missed.

456
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,680
Is that okay?

457
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:22,860
Hum.

458
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:27,760
Well.

459
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,920
Young Lady,

460
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,110
please take care of me in the future.

461
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,429
Little brother,

462
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,320
take me to the city

463
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,870
to see the real fireworks, okay?

464
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,949
Okay. Be good.

465
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:23,120
I will take you to

466
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,389
see the fireworks all over the sky. Okay?

467
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,389
Hum. Deal.

468
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:38,190
When you were a child,

469
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,520
you asked me to take you to see fireworks.

470
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,230
I promised you

471
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,389
I would show you fireworks some day.

472
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:48,909
Now,

473
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:50,630
I've fulfilled my promise.
