[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:33,300
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,100
Episode 21

4
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,270
Come in.

5
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,400
Young Lord.

6
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,229
Mr. Zhao,

7
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,360
what can I do for you so late?

8
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,310
Young Lord,

9
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm offering you my resignation.

10
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,360
Resignation?

11
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,190
Why?

12
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,830
Young Lord, you came to southern city.

13
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,550
I should have done my best

14
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,910
to protect your safety

15
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,030
and life,

16
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,270
but you were

17
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,910
attacked by gangsters

18
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,750
in Shifang Village.

19
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,829
I really don't have the face

20
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,910
to take the post of Taifu Magistrate of southern city again.

21
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,550
Is that the reason?

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
You don't have to take it to heart.

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,190
This time the gangsters didn't hurt me.

24
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,320
But your son, Zhao Cuo,

25
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,520
captured one of the gangsters bravely.

26
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Those gangsters

27
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,390
are the rebel bandits who assassinated me in the past.

28
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,390
Oh, you have flattered him.

29
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,390
He wasn't brave.

30
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,520
He just masters some kung fu.

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,910
You're too modest.

32
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,750
I find Zhao Cuo is good at kung fu

33
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,800
and not inferior to the masters in the capital.

34
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,110
I'm still thinking about

35
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,600
finding a post of military officer for him in the capital.

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,390
No way. No way.

37
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,000
He really doesn't deserve this.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,190
My son has no rules when doing things.

39
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,270
I can't afford it

40
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,670
if he makes trouble in the capital.

41
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,110
I hope you will allow him

42
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,630
to go back to seclusion with me.

43
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,830
We'll live in peace

44
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,000
for a few days,

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,750
Young Lord.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,600
If you insist so much,

47
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,030
I'll have to agree.

48
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,830
Thank you, Young Lord.

49
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,270
In fact, people's life in southern city

50
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,360
is quite stable under your management.

51
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
This time I will go back to

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,880
the capital

53
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,270
and ask my father to reward you.

54
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,240
Oh, I dare not

55
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,030
accept any reward.

56
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,520
As long as I'm allowed to go back to seclusion,

57
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,630
I'm willing to return to the mountains and forests

58
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,880
and enjoy a common life for a few days.

59
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,630
You're humble.

60
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,960
Thank you, Young Lord.

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,720
I'm leaving.

62
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,240
Zhao Quandui is in a hurry to leave at this time.

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,910
The more he tries to hide, the more he is exposed.

64
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,320
I guess he must have been an insider.

65
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,110
He must have noticed something,

66
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,320
so he wants to take Zhao Cuo away.

67
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,000
Young Lord,

68
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,080
if we let the tiger go back to the mountain again,

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,390
the consequences will be unimaginable.

70
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,110
I know.

71
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,600
Don't act on your own this time.

72
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,240
We'll deal with them

73
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,750
when Sanqi and I get back to the capital.

74
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,110
Young Lord.

75
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,600
Step back.

76
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,350
Hey,

77
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,350
what are you doing here, Bai?

78
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,230
I heard from my son that

79
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,270
Zhao is going to resign.

80
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,040
I'm here to see him.

81
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,350
Well, I don't think you're well-intentioned.

82
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,510
Zhao just resigned from office

83
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,640
and is in a bad mood.

84
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,040
You want to make him feel worse, huh?

85
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,760
Listen,

86
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,920
I'm not a woman to be trifled with.

87
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,830
What are you talking about?

88
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,159
I'm here…

89
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:46,670
She said

90
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,040
she is not a woman to be trifled with.

91
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,230
Well, aren't you the servant in Episode 1?

92
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,390
What are you doing

93
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,830
in the final episodes?

94
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,320
Sorry. Sorry. Farewell.

95
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,720
Go. Go.

96
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,920
Where were we just now?

97
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,350
I'm not a woman…

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,600
Well,

99
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,670
I'll drink with Zhao.

100
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,000
Drink?

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,070
I think the sun rises in the east.

102
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,390
Oh, no.

103
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,920
The sun does rise in the east.

104
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,200
Hey, wait for me.

105
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,830
Zhao,

106
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,920
we have fought for so many years.

107
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,230
I didn't expect you to quit.

108
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,480
I'm quite lonely

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,880
without you in northern and southern cities.

110
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,440
I'm not longer

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,920
in northern and southern cities.

112
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,640
Without me, your eyesore,

113
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,790
you can live freely

114
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,790
in northern and southern cities.

115
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,000
You're wrong.

116
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,600
In the past,

117
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,880
it was because of your comparison

118
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,720
that I came out of the mud without being stained.

119
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,550
But now that you're gone,

120
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,320
a flower like me has lost its cow dung.

121
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,880
Damn,

122
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,640
what a bad expression!

123
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,480
This harms me without benefiting yourself.

124
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,550
Look, look at your ill temper.

125
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,950
Humph.

126
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,320
This is just an impression.

127
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,000
Cheers.

128
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,160
Bai,

129
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,350
to tell you the truth,

130
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,230
in the future,

131
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,600
without me, a fatuous official, at the bottom,

132
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,320
you should be a better official.

133
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,670
This officialdom is full of traps.

134
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,600
You have to be careful.

135
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,350
You're a good man,

136
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,000
even though you're not good at business.

137
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,950
Well, it is a pity that

138
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,160
time flies.

139
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,110
Or

140
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,160
we may be good friends.

141
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,040
Cheers.

142
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,320
I have nothing to say.

143
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
Yes.

144
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,040
It is expressed in the wine.

145
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,270
Indeed. Cheers.

146
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,920
Zhao Cuo,

147
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,950
you've asked me to play

148
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,159
the drinkers' wager game today.

149
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,830
Do you want me to see you drunk?

150
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:42,670
I know,

151
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,600
Miss Sanqi is going to leave tomorrow,

152
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,070
which is a big blow to you.

153
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,230
Humph,

154
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,480
Bai Yifei,

155
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,830
am I

156
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,790
so vulnerable in your eyes?

157
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,670
Who says I did this for a woman?

158
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,000
Who did you do this for?

159
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,320
What do you mean by that?

160
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,440
This first cup of wine

161
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,510
is to you.

162
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,040
You stood up and begged your dad for me

163
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,950
in the case of Leimo.

164
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,000
I'd like to offer you the second cup of wine

165
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,230
for saving my life in the deserted temple.

166
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,110
I'd like to offer you

167
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,200
the third cup of wine

168
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,400
for fighting with me

169
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,440
every time the man in black appeared

170
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,760
and never escaping.

171
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,960
Anyway, thank you.

172
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,230
Zhao Cuo.

173
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,520
Enough.

174
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,000
Don't pull a long face.

175
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,960
Let me tell you,

176
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,590
after drinking all this wine,

177
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,470
I won't owe you anything.

178
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,200
I will diss you relentlessly.

179
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,000
Fine.

180
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,200
I will keep you company.

181
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,110
Let's drink our fill today.

182
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,200
OK. That's great.

183
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,080
From now on…

184
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,110
No.

185
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,200
What's the future?

186
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,080
After I go to the capital

187
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,960
with Ruoyao and Sanqi tomorrow,

188
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,150
you will go home with your dad.

189
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,670
I'm afraid we'll never see each other again.

190
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,000
Hope we'll

191
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,710
see each other again.

192
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,550
I have a favor to ask of you.

193
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,030
Go ahead.

194
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,280
Sanqi

195
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,790
is entrusted to you.

196
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,320
I have received

197
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,960
your gratitude today.

198
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,280
Here's to you.

199
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,080
Stop.

200
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,230
Why?

201
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,110
We met and became friends when we were young.

202
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,960
I was ignorant when I was a kid

203
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,590
and called your dad fatuous official with them.

204
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,150
Do you remember

205
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,230
you fought with me that time?

206
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,320
Since then,

207
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,350
we had parted.

208
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,640
I owe you an apology.

209
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,230
Yes.

210
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,670
I beat you with your head broken and bleeding

211
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,280
and your nose was crooked

212
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,320
in that fight.

213
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,280
It was you

214
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,470
who couldn't get out of bed for a month,

215
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:11,960
OK?

216
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,470
Well, why are you talking nonsense?

217
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,030
Why should a man be ashamed to confess it?

218
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,280
Come on, let's repeat it.

219
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,960
This little notebook

220
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,230
records all your wrongful convictions,

221
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,320
wrongs, ignorance and laziness since you took office.

222
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,440
It's all recorded here.

223
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,230
Bai, you're really something.

224
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,640
There is fire here.

225
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,670
Let's burn it, OK?

226
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,670
Hey, who says I will burn it?

227
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,280
How could I burn

228
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,230
my years of hard work so easily?

229
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,440
How about this?

230
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,440
Let's play the drinkers' wager game.

231
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,200
If you lose,

232
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,550
we'll burn this little notebook.

233
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,110
If I lose,

234
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,670
nothing will happen.

235
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,590
Is that okay?

236
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,840
Come on,

237
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,640
nice try.

238
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,110
Every word here

239
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,840
is written by me.

240
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,320
It's all evidence of your muddled career.

241
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,000
How could you take this little notebook away easily

242
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,150
by just playing the drinkers' wager game?

243
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,790
What do you want?

244
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,520
I'll take this opportunity to help you recall it.

245
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,960
OK. Let's recall it.

246
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,790
Five years ago,

247
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,080
you handled 27 wrongful convictions.

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,280
Four years ago,

249
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,550
because of your ignorance and laziness,

250
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,520
your southern city lost

251
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,280
20,000 tael of silver.

252
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,910
Let me see.

253
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,840
A year and a half ago,

254
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,470
Zhao Quandui

255
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,320
lost 15,000 tael of silver

256
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,400
by messing around.

257
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,200
Why did you write it down so clearly?

258
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,350
I will accept this little notebook.

259
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,400
Hey.

260
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,320
Your son will marry Her Highness

261
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,200
soon

262
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
and you'll be promoted at once.

263
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,320
It's no use for you to keep this little notebook.

264
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,760
Can you just give it to me?

265
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,280
I, I don't buy it.

266
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,110
Favor

267
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,030
doesn't work now.

268
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,520
Bai,

269
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,280
you're not gracious at all.

270
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,640
Where are you?

271
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,640
You're in Zhao's Mansion.

272
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,590
I won't let you get out of Zhao's Mansion.

273
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,840
Do you believe it?

274
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,320
Well, show me

275
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,440
what you can do.

276
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
I will show you.

277
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,230
I, I will slap your face.

278
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,640
I will hit you on the nose.

279
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,960
I will hit you black and blue.

280
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,520
I will hit you. I will hit you.

281
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,840
What are they doing?

282
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,880
They were close just now.

283
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,030
How come they fight now?

284
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,320
I will pull your eye.

285
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,960
I will scratch your foot.

286
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,200
I will kick you.

287
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,670
Ling, help me.

288
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,550
Oh, right now.

289
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,640
Ling, hurry up.

290
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,080
Let's do it together.

291
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,880
Let's never meet again.

292
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,470
Leave.

293
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,910
Farewell.

294
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,400
Get out.

295
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,080
Rubbish.

296
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,200
Damn.

297
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,080
Bah.

298
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,840
Humph.

299
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,350
Come on.

300
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,760
The carriage moves forward.

301
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,840
I am going to bring Young Master's horse here.

302
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,710
Take another look.

303
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,200
We can't see it when we come back to the capital.

304
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:57,910
Oh,

305
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,000
you mean

306
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,470
we will never come back after going to the capital?

307
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,590
Yes, and you have to be prepared

308
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,670
to be locked in my room every day.

309
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,590
There are too many little girls in the capital.

310
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,840
If they all fall in love with you,

311
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,030
I can't handle it myself.

312
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,790
What are you talking about?

313
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,200
Even if they are fairies,

314
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,670
I won't look at them.

315
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,320
You are the only one in my eyes.

316
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,150
Really?

317
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,320
OK. I believe you for the moment.

318
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,470
Take another look.

319
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,840
We will join Zhao Cuo and my brother later.

320
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,960
Brother,

321
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,710
you're too slow in the carriage.

322
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,640
I will ride back with Mr. Bai first.

323
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,520
Don't be playful on the way

324
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,000
and come back home early.

325
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,640
I know.

326
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,200
Take care.

327
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,710
OK.

328
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,640
Sanqi,

329
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,200
the capital is not your home.

330
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,150
After you go to Lord's Mansion,

331
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,520
you must be a good wife

332
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,280
and treat your parents-in-laws well.

333
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,000
But don't be bullied by others.

334
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,760
Here is

335
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,350
some money.

336
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,640
That's right. Take it. Take it.

337
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,840
Use it to buy over servants

338
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,880
and let them help you.

339
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
If you live well,

340
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
I will feel relieved as your dad.

341
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,910
Come on, you're not her dad.

342
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,470
What if Young Lord heard it?

343
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,640
That's right.

344
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,350
Sanqi will be Young Madam.

345
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,320
Be careful.

346
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,470
That's right. I'm not her dad.

347
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,790
I have long regarded you

348
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,000
as my families.

349
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,109
After I reach the capital,

350
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,710
I will miss you day and night.

351
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,589
Dad.

352
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,950
Mom.

353
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,310
Sanqi, it's not early. Let's go.

354
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,800
Well, that brat.

355
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,640
He always doesn't show up at the critical moment.

356
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,520
Take care.

357
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,310
Remember to eat more and don't be hungry.

358
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,400
What's wrong with you?

359
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,230
Are you not feeling well?

360
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,400
Nothing.

361
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,920
I have been in southern city for a long time,

362
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,880
so I'm a little willing to leave it.

363
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,040
Sanqi.

364
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,710
Sanqi.

365
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:27,800
Hurry up.

366
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,520
Watch out.

367
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,160
Come on,

368
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,920
you are so careless.

369
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,830
Sanqi,

370
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,430
I wish you a safe journey.

371
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,710
Zhao Cuo,

372
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,680
I thought

373
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,310
you wouldn't come to see me off.

374
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,310
I'm Whirly of Southern City

375
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,110
and not a mean guy.

376
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,000
Here.

377
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,520
This is the bean paste cake just made in the morning.

378
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,950
Eat on the way when it is still hot.

379
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,560
It isn't sold in the capital.

380
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,040
This is

381
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,470
the roast pigeon in Zuixianlou Restaurant

382
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,040
that you can eat three at a time.

383
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,880
And this is

384
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,680
your favorite rose cake.

385
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,280
And this is…

386
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,310
You disappeared in the morning

387
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,230
to buy these?

388
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,350
Right. And this.

389
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,430
It's a pity that

390
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,310
your favorite flower petal cake

391
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,040
fell on the ground and is dirty.

392
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,230
It's dirty. Hey.

393
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,110
I love flaky pastry best.

394
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,000
It tastes great.

395
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,310
Oh,

396
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,280
here you are.

397
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,040
This is from my mom.

398
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,710
I've been wearing it since I was born.

399
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,310
I haven't given you a decent gift

400
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,680
since I met you.

401
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,310
Take it

402
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,830
as a souvenir.

403
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,000
Zhao Cuo,

404
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,950
we will certainly

405
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,590
meet again.

406
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,280
Oh, silly girl.

407
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,680
We won't part for ever.

408
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,280
We will meet again.

409
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,640
Well,

410
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,110
if there is nothing else,

411
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,110
I will leave.

412
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,040
Go back.

413
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,230
I will eat the flaky pastry for you.

414
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,760
Tian Sanqi,

415
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,400
remember,

416
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,230
the most important thing to be a friend

417
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,040
is to be righteous.

418
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,160
If you have any difficulty in the future,

419
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,000
I will be the first to come to you.

420
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,040
You have to remember

421
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,920
you still have me.

422
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,430
Young Madam.

423
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:21,920
Young Madam.

424
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,590
This is the song of brother.

425
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,070
There is someone else who knows this song.

426
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,190
Where is this place?

427
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,640
What does it have to do with brother?

428
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,640
Young Madam, you're running around again.

429
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,520
Why do you run around as soon as you come here?

430
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,710
Father's waiting in there.

431
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,430
This dress is too tight.

432
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,520
I feel uncomfortable.

433
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,880
Do I have to wear this kind of clothes in the future?

434
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,950
No, it's a formal dress.

435
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,680
Today, after all, you meet father for the first time.

436
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
You need to dress modestly.

437
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,680
When you enter the hall,

438
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,070
you should pay attention to your words and deeds.

439
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,680
Don't be impolite.

440
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,680
Oh, I see.

441
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,110
Young Lord.

442
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,590
Yes.

443
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,640
Lord asks you go in with Young Madam.

444
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,430
Okay, we'll be right there.

445
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,350
Stand properly.

446
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,880
Father.

447
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,950
Lord.

448
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,590
Get up.

449
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,350
Thank you.

450
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,710
Are you Tian Sanqi?

451
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,160
Yes.

452
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,110
Why did you escape from marriage?

453
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,590
Were you not afraid that I would punish you?

454
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,110
Father, Sanqi…

455
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,310
Let her speak.

456
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,680
To be honest,

457
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,230
I had an engagement with someone since I was a child.

458
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,470
The word once spoken

459
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,040
can never be recalled.

460
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
How dare you

461
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,830
refuse the marriage decided by me

462
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,560
and come back!

463
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,920
In fact,

464
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,430
you already know the reason.

465
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,070
Am I right, Lord?

466
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,230
Sanqi,

467
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,470
when others see me, they dare not even say anything,

468
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,310
but you dare to ask me back.

469
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,190
Lord, although you don't

470
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,040
get out of the house,

471
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,640
you know everything

472
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,680
in Taoyuan City.

473
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,310
If you really want to blame me,

474
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,280
how can I see you here?

475
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,760
You're not only bold

476
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,110
but also quick-witted.

477
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,310
It struck me that

478
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,190
I could find a daughter-in-law for my son in Shifang Village.

479
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,430
I had been looking for the one

480
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:33,560
and actually found someone

481
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
who an appointment with him

482
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,280
in his tender youth.

483
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,520
That's you.

484
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,160
Shifang Village

485
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,800
is really my son's lucky place.

486
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,000
Alas,

487
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,470
Zhen,

488
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,950
show Sanqi around.

489
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,830
I'm a little tired.

490
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,680
Yes.

491
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,070
Lord, this is wrong.

492
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,710
Sanqi, what are you talking about?

493
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,680
Father isn't wrong.

494
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,000
Well,

495
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,190
what did I do wrong?

496
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,190
Lord, you look pale.

497
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,110
The sun does not shine directly into the room.

498
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,640
You cannot bask in the sun.

499
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,520
My mom says

500
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,310
if we are ill, we can't lie in bed.

501
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,560
You should get up and walk more.

502
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,430
Oh,

503
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,710
my mom taught me a set of physical exercise.

504
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,040
How about I teach you?

505
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,430
More exercise is good for your health.

506
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,470
Sanqi, stop it.

507
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,710
There are so many imperial doctors around my father

508
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,590
to take care of him.

509
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,920
Why does he need this set of physical exercise?

510
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,430
Well, it's okay.

511
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,520
Let her show me.

512
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,710
OK.

513
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
This dress

514
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,430
is too completed for me to do exercise.

515
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,160
That's all right.

516
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,590
I will practice with you later.

517
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,230
You can leave.

518
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,680
Yes.

519
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,160
Yes, Lord.

520
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,070
Let's go.

521
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,920
Sanqi, this is Wet Nurse Lan.

522
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,640
She is familiar with all kinds of etiquette in Taoyuan City.

523
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,680
You can learn from her

524
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,880
from now on.

525
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,920
Is it really necessary?

526
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,000
Yes.

527
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,040
Of course, I don't care what you do in private.

528
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,880
But you're going to be

529
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,760
my wife.

530
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,470
You can't lose face

531
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,040
in front of outsiders.

532
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,710
Well, I will work first.

533
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,880
You must study hard.

534
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,800
Thank you, Wet Nurse Lan.

535
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,430
Wet Nurse Lan,

536
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,520
why don't you laugh

537
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,430
and pull a long face?

538
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,190
Young Madam,

539
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,800
the first lesson you are going to learn today

540
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,110
is not to have too many unreasonable expressions

541
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,920
in the mansion,

542
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,760
such as laughing.

543
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,520
What? I can't even laugh?

544
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,680
As Young Madam,

545
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,230
you should always pay attention to your identity,

546
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,590
remind yourself that

547
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,110
you can't exaggerate your expression in the mansion,

548
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,800
and make sure you don't show your teeth

549
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,310
and smile like a spring breeze.

550
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,470
Oh.

551
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,920
Young Madam, learn from me.

552
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,280
I can't imagine that

553
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,920
there is such a place in Lord's Mansion.

554
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,760
It's so cold and cheerless.

555
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,470
This lock doesn't look old.

556
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,830
It means that people often go in and out.

557
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:33,760
A hamper.

558
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,000
It shows that there are traces of life here.

559
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,070
I have to find a way in.

560
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,000
Li Jia.

561
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,520
Yes?

562
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,710
Don't you think

563
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,760
the valley is very quiet?

564
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:07,880
Young Master,

565
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,909
there are no people or carriages

566
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:11,600
in the wild.

567
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,040
There must be no noise.

568
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,909
Fool.

569
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,320
There should be chirps in the wild.

570
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,360
Well, Young Master.

571
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,760
Listen, here is the sound.

572
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,190
What's wrong?

573
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,840
Are you okay?

574
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,389
Let me have a look.

575
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,190
Cuo, what happened?

576
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,150
Be careful, dad.

577
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,320
There is an ambush.

578
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,840
What?

579
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:16,430
Dad,

580
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,760
let me deal with it.

581
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,520
How do you know there's an ambush?

582
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,710
Humph, you don't need to ask.

583
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,360
Protect yourself.

584
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,390
Li Jia.

585
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,320
Yes.

586
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,470
Protect Wet Nurse Ling.

587
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,760
Bros,

588
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,910
go.

589
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,800
Cuo.

590
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,040
Cuo.

591
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,910
I have a headache.

592
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,710
Here you are.

593
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,080
Who are you?

594
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,120
Who are you?

595
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,470
Why did you take my child away?

596
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,080
Where is my child?

597
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,470
Where is my child?

598
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,710
My child.

599
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:40,910
Phoenix robe.

600
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,840
Lady.

601
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,360
Lord.

602
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,760
I want to see Lord. I want to see Lord.

603
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,390
He was cheated.

604
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,560
I want to see him. Take me to see him.

605
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,670
My son.

606
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,190
Give my son back to me. Give my son back to me.

607
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,120
Son.

608
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,870
Are you,

609
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,950
are you talking about He Zhen?

610
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,600
No.

611
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,080
Liar. He's false. He's false.

612
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,910
He's false. He's false.

613
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,840
Don't cry.

614
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,430
I'll bring your son to see you.

615
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,000
No. No.

616
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,120
He's not my son. He's not my son.

617
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,390
He's not my son.

618
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,040
What are you talking about?

619
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,040
Cuo, what's wrong with you?

620
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,710
Well.

621
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,390
Someone, come to protect Young Master.

622
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,080
He's not my son. He's not my son.

623
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,040
He's not my son.

624
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,000
What are you talking about?

625
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,710
Jade pendant.

626
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,360
Shifang Village. Zhen.

627
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,360
It's his jade pendant.

628
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,390
Zhen is still alive.

629
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,360
My son is still alive.

630
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,040
My son is still alive.

631
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,520
My son is still alive.

632
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,390
This is from my mom.

633
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,120
I've been wearing it

634
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,120
since I was born.

635
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,710
Take it.

636
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,630
Did you leave

637
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,630
this jade pendant for your son?

638
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,390
My son.

639
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,360
My son is back.

640
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,710
It hurts.

641
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,320
No, I'm going to find my friend.

642
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,120
You can't go to them anymore.

643
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,800
Why?

644
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,520
I told her

645
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,040
we would spend our whole life together.

646
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,560
I must go. I must go.

647
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,120
Young Lord,

648
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,800
they died.

649
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:39,910
Their,

650
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,320
their whole family was killed by the fire.

651
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,080
You come to a red forest.

652
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,710
There is a red coffin in the forest.

653
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,600
I want you to lie in.

654
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:05,950
Slowly

655
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,910
close

656
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,320
your eyes.

657
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,150
Go to sleep.

658
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,360
Forget the past.

659
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:26,080
Your name will be Zhao Cuo from now on.
