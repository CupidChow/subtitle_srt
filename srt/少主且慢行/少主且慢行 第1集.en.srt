[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:33,140
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,259
Episode 1

4
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,479
Long, long ago,

5
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,680
in a remote paradise,

6
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,000
whenever the peach blossoms fade and fly,

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,560
the annual Peach Blossom Festival is coming.

8
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,039
Boys and girls aged 18

9
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:55,080
exchange name rings and get engaged mutually.

10
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Blessed by the God of Paradise,

11
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,320
they make a lifelong agreement.

12
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,470
This year's Peach Blossom Festival is coming.

13
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,400
In this festival,

14
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,960
what kind of story will the God of Paradise witness?

15
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,000
Tian, start working.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Go to collect a corpse by the river.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,870
I'm coming.

18
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,030
Zhang. Li. Niu.

19
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,110
Let's start working.

20
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,550
Here comes the jinx.

21
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,520
Run, everybody.

22
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,720
What rotten luck is it to marry her

23
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,110
and become Tian's son-in-law.

24
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,590
You.

25
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,640
Auntie Sanqi.

26
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,560
Go to hell! You're not my son.

27
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,630
Good afternoon, I'm here.

28
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,110
Excuse me...

29
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,000
They run so fast today.

30
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,390
This dead friend,

31
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,110
please forgive me.

32
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,390
If you have something to say before your death,

33
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,110
please tell me now.

34
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,030
Look at that jinx.

35
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,720
She is talking to the dead again.

36
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,280
Oh, my God. It's so horrible.

37
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,030
He's about 18 years old.

38
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,590
It's bloated and white all over his body.

39
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,079
Half clenched fists in both hands.

40
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,870
Sediment in his mouth and nose.

41
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,640
No fatal injuries on his body.

42
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,360
The cause of death was drowning and suffocation.

43
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
Yeah.

44
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,390
He is a stranger here.

45
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,670
Sir, you're not from the village.

46
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,920
Excuse me.

47
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,519
Who knows this man?

48
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,070
All right.

49
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,040
Friend.

50
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,600
Since no one's coming to claim you,

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,470
go back to Yizhuang with me.

52
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,600
Ouch!

53
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,680
It really hurts!

54
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,200
I remind you repeatedly.

55
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,790
No sleeping in the coffin.

56
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,440
No collecting corpses in the village.

57
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,990
How can you forget these?

58
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,550
Sanqi.

59
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,159
Tell me, as a girl,

60
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,950
how could you have

61
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,830
such a bad habit?

62
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,670
Ouch!

63
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,159
It really hurts.

64
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,550
I reminded you repeatedly that

65
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,790
we should have bought a cradle for her.

66
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,320
Who let our daughter sleep in a coffin as soon as she was born?

67
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,800
What a bad old man you are!

68
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,600
Jiaojiao.

69
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,920
May I beg your pardon?

70
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,440
Be gentle.

71
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,720
I'm educating our daughter.

72
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,640
You are to blame.

73
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,670
Since our daughter was a kid,

74
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,270
she has seen the dead more than the alive.

75
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,320
If no one wants to marry her,

76
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,590
I won't forgive you.

77
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,680
Old locust tree.

78
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,240
Do you know

79
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,360
the agreement between immortal brother and me?

80
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,040
When he's not there for me,

81
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,550
he would send this grimace totem to protect me.

82
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,000
It's been eight years.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,240
I've been waiting for my brother here.

84
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,800
I'm not marrying anyone else.

85
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,710
I made my name ring with a piece of bamboo.

86
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,920
Now I give it to you.

87
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,950
We are meant to be together.

88
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,830
When you're 18,

89
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,590
I will come back for you.

90
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,640
Wait for me.

91
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,270
Yes, I will wait for you.

92
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,270
Witnessed by the old locust tree...

93
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,320
When I receive your name ring, you will stay with me all the life.

94
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,150
I won't marry Wang Mazi even if I die.

95
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,590
Why doesn't he come for me yet?

96
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,470
How about running away from home?

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,840
Ouch!

98
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,400
It hurts.

99
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,200
Dates.

100
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,550
Look for...

101
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,270
Do you want me to look for my brother?

102
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,470
Yeah.

103
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,200
Instead of sitting around here,

104
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,430
let me make the first move.

105
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,830
Wow, how nice you are, old locust tree.

106
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,800
You are so wise.

107
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,030
OK, I'll go now.

108
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,880
Bad news.

109
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,720
Bad news.

110
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,270
Bad news. Young Master,

111
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,600
the master knows you're in the whorehouse.

112
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,800
He's coming to catch you.

113
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,960
Oh, my God.

114
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,110
Taifu Magistrate of south city is coming.

115
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,640
What should we do?

116
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,960
Let's enjoy ourselves timely.

117
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,750
Come on.

118
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,920
Zhao. Zhao.

119
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,200
Taifu Magistrate is coming.

120
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,030
How about...

121
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,670
Pour them in.

122
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,200
Whoever sees it owns it.

123
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,920
Young Master.

124
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,790
What to do with the one

125
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,590
who harassed Leimo?

126
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,070
Make him fly.

127
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,950
OK.

128
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,680
Come back.

129
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
Remember to

130
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,950
make him fly to my house.

131
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,240
What? I see.

132
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,640
The higher, the better.

133
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,680
OK.

134
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,960
There's a gold.

135
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,920
Over there.

136
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
Oh, look.

137
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,830
What a big kite.

138
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,280
There's someone up there.

139
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,960
Zhao Cuo.

140
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,600
Oh damn!

141
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,150
What a miserable man he is.

142
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,400
He's flying up in the sky again.

143
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,030
Because he offended the first evil master in south city.

144
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,990
Right.

145
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,000
Wow.

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,640
There's a man up in the sky.

147
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,960
But why are you flying so high?

148
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,440
Miss. Miss.

149
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,880
Be quiet. Stop yelling.

150
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,110
The man offended the young master Mr. Zhao in south city

151
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,790
so he is sent to sky.

152
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,160
Mr. Zhao

153
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,160
Grimace totem.

154
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,030
Immortal brother.

155
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,470
Excuse, sir,

156
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,670
where is the kite-flyer now?

157
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,310
You mean Zhao Cuo?

158
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,840
He is nowhere but

159
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,110
at the whorehouse.

160
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,670
Go. Go.

161
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,720
Whorehouse?

162
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,910
I am of humble origin.

163
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,310
Thank you for your grace.

164
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,720
Thank you.

165
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,200
Forget about it.

166
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,590
You're my friend.

167
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,600
I'll protect you.

168
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,470
Listen to me,

169
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,230
as a girl,

170
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,280
you should not come here.

171
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,790
Oops!

172
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,960
But you're also a woman.

173
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,910
Get out of the way. I'm looking for someone.

174
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,640
What are you doing? What are you doing?

175
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,350
Who are you looking for?

176
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,520
I'm looking for my brother.

177
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,640
Oh. Brother?

178
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,910
We just have little sisters here.

179
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,110
No brother.

180
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,760
Go away.

181
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,520
You...

182
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,310
So what?

183
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,600
Zhao Cuo.

184
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,000
You bad boy.

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,840
What a bad boy you are.

186
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,790
Come over here.

187
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,550
Come here.

188
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,550
Look what you look like.

189
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,230
How can you find a good wife?

190
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,080
Listen to me, Dad.

191
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,790
Among those vulgar girls you find for me,

192
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,080
I don't like any of them.

193
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,790
If you like them,

194
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,600
keep them yourself.

195
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,520
You don't like them?

196
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,750
Zhao Cuo.

197
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,400
Your reputation

198
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,790
is bad ten miles away.

199
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,030
You're still so picky.

200
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,470
Are you waiting for

201
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,760
an immortal girl from the heaven?

202
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,160
Ah! Ouch!

203
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,670
Who are you?

204
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,870
Where do you come from?

205
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,720
Up is north, down south, left west and right east.

206
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,440
I'm from the west.

207
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,400
I come here for someone.

208
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,030
The one you're looking for is not here.

209
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,110
Get out of here now.

210
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,590
No.

211
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,840
I must find the man.

212
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,670
I'm looking for the owner of the kite.

213
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,310
Is she coming to help Yang Yong?

214
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,670
I am not afraid of her.

215
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,760
Then let me tell you

216
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,110
the kite

217
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,440
is mine.

218
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,110
If you want to avenge him,

219
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,470
go ahead. Come on.

220
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,670
Say it again.

221
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,200
I am not afraid of you.

222
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,110
Go to ask someone.

223
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,150
Everyone knows that this kind of human kite

224
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,590
is a fine tradition I invent.

225
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,310
What is the matter?

226
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,230
Brother,

227
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,280
what is this?

228
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,040
This is the grimace totem I invented.

229
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,280
The grimace is only known to you and me.

230
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,280
You are my immortal brother.

231
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,910
I finally found you.

232
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,870
Let, let, let go of me.

233
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,200
No, I don't.

234
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,030
If you don't want to die, let go of me.

235
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,350
I don't let you go until I die.

236
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,280
Oops. So many people are watching us.

237
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,910
Don't disgrace me, OK?

238
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,550
Ouch!

239
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,600
It hurts.

240
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,110
It's true.

241
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,400
I'm not dreaming.

242
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,710
Are you a immortal in heaven?

243
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,750
What?

244
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,880
For eight years, one month and three days,

245
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,350
I have been waiting for you under the old locust tree every day.

246
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,600
Brother.

247
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,520
I miss you so much.

248
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,280
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

249
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,710
Come down. Come down.

250
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,440
What the hell are you doing?

251
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,350
Let's get married.

252
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,840
I don't want to marry Wang Mazi.

253
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,280
Come down.

254
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,430
Get married?

255
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,600
What's wrong with you?

256
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,440
Ah, I see.

257
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,670
You are also a sophisticated girl

258
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,640
who wants to marry me?

259
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,150
Listen to me.

260
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,320
I wouldn't marry you,

261
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,990
as you are a vulgar woman.

262
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,670
Jackal Li Jia.

263
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,520
Come to drag her out of here.

264
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,280
What?

265
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,080
Brother, do you lose your memory?

266
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Why do you remember nothing?

267
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
It's me.

268
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,150
Hurry up.

269
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,960
It's me.

270
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,880
Hurry up.

271
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,280
No way. Let go of me. Let go of me.

272
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,550
You dead garbage.

273
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,640
Crazy woman.

274
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,910
Let go.

275
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,400
Let go of me.

276
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,640
I still have something to say.

277
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,840
Brother. Do you remember that

278
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,710
you said you were coming to marry me at the age of 18.

279
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,960
Old locust tree. Do you remember the old locust tree?

280
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,550
You said you'd give me your name ring

281
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,080
under the old locust tree.

282
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,520
Name ring?

283
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,750
Shit.

284
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,720
I have never given you my name ring.

285
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,430
I don't know you at all.

286
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,080
You crazy woman.

287
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,720
Pull her out of here.

288
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,520
Ah. Let go of me!

289
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,080
Let go of me!

290
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,200
Let go of me!

291
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,030
I still have something to say.

292
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,000
Let go of me.

293
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,550
Hey, hey, hey.

294
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,430
Don't intervene in it, you guys.

295
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,590
See? She has got involved with him.

296
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,280
Right?

297
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,670
Calm down.

298
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,600
Stand back. Stand back.

299
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,640
What's wrong, brother?

300
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,080
You can't remember me?

301
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,230
But it happened eight years ago.

302
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,320
It's a long time ago.

303
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,280
No.

304
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,040
I have to manage to get his memory back.

305
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,840
An old man

306
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,230
with two ears,

307
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,230
has no meals for three days

308
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,440
so he is so hungry and walking around the pan.

309
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,400
He bought two onions with 0.33 tael.

310
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,150
He bought a watermelon with 0.77 tael.

311
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,910
He bought two loofahs with 0.66 tael.

312
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,720
And two sticks of sugar-coated haws...

313
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,640
Can you remember who I am now?

314
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,480
You...

315
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,430
You...

316
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,320
You're nuts.

317
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,590
Crazy woman.

318
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,760
No, I'm not crazy.

319
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,670
Since the kite is yours,

320
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,030
you are the right one I'm looking for.

321
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,230
The kite is mine.

322
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,000
You're crazy.

323
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,960
Hurry up.

324
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,590
Drag her away.

325
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,840
Oh. Don't run. Stop.

326
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,880
What are you doing?

327
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,200
Brother has a red birthmark on his waist.

328
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,030
I have no time.

329
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,080
I have to try a tough way.

330
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,400
You made me do this.

331
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,440
Since you can't remember me,

332
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,960
I have to do this trick.

333
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Let go.

334
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,640
No, I don't.

335
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,400
I have to make sure if you have it with my eyes.

336
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,110
I want to take a look at it.

337
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,910
I'll be responsible for you.

338
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,520
No, no, no.

339
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,960
Dad. Take action now.

340
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,110
For eighteen years,

341
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,110
it's the first time I have seen

342
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,600
a man being molested by a girl like this in the whorehouse.

343
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,150
To tell you the truth,

344
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,670
for eighteen years

345
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,310
it's the first time I've seen my bad son begging for mercy.

346
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,829
Forget about it.

347
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:05,599
Cheers.

348
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,390
Master, take action now.

349
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,920
Go.

350
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,720
Fine.

351
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,430
Ah. Ah.

352
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,109
Let me go.

353
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,520
Put me down.

354
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,680
Why do you drag me away again?

355
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,349
Zhao Cuo, wait for me.

356
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,190
I'll see it clearly.

357
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,150
Come here.

358
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,150
Zhao's Mansion. It is here.

359
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,790
Hey, hey.

360
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,920
Who do you want?

361
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,840
What?

362
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,310
Who do you want?

363
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,430
Well.

364
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,510
Is Zhao Cuo living here?

365
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,760
Yes.

366
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,760
Who are you?

367
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,040
I'm his fiancée.

368
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,430
Ask him out.

369
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,430
Are you kidding?

370
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,430
It's just a blind date.

371
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,310
Why do you call yourself his fiancée?

372
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,400
I've seen lots of girls from blind dates.

373
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,590
I've never seen such a cheeky girl like you.

374
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,720
You...

375
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,520
Blind dates?

376
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,960
You said Zhao Cuo had blind dates?

377
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,640
What a bad guy he is.

378
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,520
Let me in.

379
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,360
Let me in. Let me in. Let me in.

380
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,240
Why did you have four-letter word?

381
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,080
That bad guy is not here now.

382
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,790
That bad guy is at Moon Pavilion now.

383
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,310
Moon Pavilion.

384
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,430
Oh, I see.

385
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,360
Moon Pavilion.

386
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,430
I am going to Moon Pavilion.

387
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,160
Boss.

388
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,880
I want this box of peach blossom rouge.

389
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,150
Sister, for today's round-table date at Moon,

390
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,430
you are well prepared.

391
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,710
Look at your clothes.

392
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,200
How calculating you are.

393
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,760
Who is the sister?

394
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,880
Let's get to the point.

395
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,120
We marry Zhao Cuo at the same time.

396
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,910
I don't know who is the wife and who is the concubine.

397
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,790
No watching. Ugly woman.

398
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,390
Hmm.

399
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,000
Boss.

400
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,120
Excuse me, how can I get to the Moon Pavilion?

401
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,310
Miss.

402
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,640
Are you going

403
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,000
to take part in round-table date of Zhao's Mansion?

404
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,070
What?

405
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,790
Are you going to see him in that outfit?

406
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,230
So what should I do?

407
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,070
How about

408
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,190
buying a box of rouge from me?

409
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,080
I'll make sure you'll catch his heart by sight.

410
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,760
Invitation. Where is my invitation?

411
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,360
Where is it?

412
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,590
It's not on me.

413
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,600
What?

414
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:33,920
Lady.

415
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,950
We shouldn't lose the invitation.

416
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,280
We are done if the master knows it.

417
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,190
Let's go to find it now.

418
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,880
Yes.

419
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,280
With this peach blossom makeup,

420
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,590
I make sure you're able to catch

421
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,160
the heart of Mr. Zhao forever.

422
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,120
3 taels in total. Thank you.

423
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,080
Good.

424
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,670
Miss.

425
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,470
Here is your invitation.

426
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,360
You can't get in without it.

427
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,120
He Jinxin.

428
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,270
Let's finish it and go in today.

429
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,080
Wait.

430
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,480
I declare

431
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:30,110
round-table dating conference now begins.

432
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,950
Next

433
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,390
we have a thorough understanding according to order.

434
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,120
My name is Hongling.

435
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,720
I am best at playing the lute to a cow.

436
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,880
My name is Meizhi.

437
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,760
Since childhood, I have tasted all kinds of herbs in person.

438
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,430
I am best at tasting poison with my own body.

439
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,710
My name is Xiuji.

440
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,830
I have learned martial arts since childhood.

441
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,200
I am best at expressing my love with martial arts.

442
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,510
This is my strength.

443
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,510
This is my beauty.

444
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,000
This is my shyness.

445
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,880
All right. All right.

446
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,600
It's good.

447
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,590
Next one, please.

448
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,470
Anyone else?

449
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,240
Me.

450
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,430
What an aunt with peach blossom makeup and strong skeleton.

451
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,960
Aunt.

452
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,480
Why are you coming here?

453
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,400
I'm looking for him.

454
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,000
Go with me.

455
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,720
You know each other?

456
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,560
More than that.

457
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,670
I don't know you.

458
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,350
You can choose her.

459
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,070
No, I can't.

460
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,760
You asked her to come here, right?

461
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,550
Please have a seat.

462
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,630
You are He Jinxin, right?

463
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,430
What talent do you have?

464
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,270
Do I need to have a talent?

465
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,080
Of course.

466
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,480
I'm good at autopsy.

467
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,840
What?

468
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,310
If so,

469
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,920
no matter how you die, from drowning,

470
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,470
burning, poisoning, stifling and choking,

471
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,470
no matter how you die

472
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,710
I can tell it

473
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,720
and check it out in an hour.

474
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,480
Miss. Stop it.

475
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,040
Be obedient. Go away. Go.

476
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,190
No. I am not kidding.

477
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,000
Listen to me.

478
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,280
Don't underestimate my talent.

479
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,800
As a matter of fact, autopsy is also a learned skill.

480
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,350
I...

481
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,080
Shut up.

482
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,630
Let her go on.

483
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,510
Let me start with a simple observation of the corpse.

484
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,710
Professionally speaking,

485
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,280
I observe his left hand and her right hand.

486
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,430
If a man dies from 23:00 to 1:00, 13:00 to 15:00, 5:00 to 7:00, or 17:00 to 19:00, then his left thumb must pinch his middle finger.

487
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,590
If a man dies from 7:00 to 9:00, 19:00 to 21:00, 1:00 to 3:00, or 13:00 to 15:00, then his left hand spreads out.

488
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,560
If a man dies from 3:00 to 5:00, 15:00 to 17:00, 9:00 to 11:00, or 21:00 to 23:00, then his left hand clenches into a fist.

489
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,360
The death time of the dead can be calculated by this method.

490
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,600
Then you may ask me,

491
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,880
if the dead has got only bones,

492
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
what to do with this case?

493
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,670
Then it's a little harder.

494
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,310
We need to steam it

495
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,470
as we do to steamed buns.

496
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,310
After this steaming step,

497
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,560
I can see clearly if there's

498
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
an injury or fracture in the bone.

499
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,590
I finish it.

500
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,000
Ah!

501
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,840
That's toxic.

502
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,390
Good.

503
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,800
Yeah, I like this girl.

504
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,920
Dad.

505
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,280
Up to you.

506
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,000
What?

507
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,840
Oh, my son.

508
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,200
Although your preference is a little strange,

509
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,880
since you like the girl,

510
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,240
of course I say yes.

511
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,150
Dad.

512
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,920
Are you serious?

513
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,030
That's for sure.

514
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,960
What a nice moment it is.

515
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,920
Enjoy yourselves.

516
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,430
I'm going to get a marriage certificate for you.

517
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,790
Li Jia. Let's go.

518
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,510
Hello? Hello, Dad?

519
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,760
I don't mind whoever sent you here to make trouble here.

520
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,080
Anyway,

521
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,840
It's a good idea.

522
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,310
What is this?

523
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,120
What? Want more?

524
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,960
Brother. It's me.

525
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,910
This sounds so familiar.

526
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,590
Immortal brother.

527
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,190
Do you remember

528
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,960
we met at the whorehouse?

529
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,430
Oh, my God.

530
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,390
It's you.

531
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,760
Brother.

532
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,470
Come out now.

533
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,910
I have a lot to say to you.

534
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,390
I have nothing to say to you, ugly girl.

535
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,030
Ugly girl?

536
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,150
You've changed.

537
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,000
You used to say that I was cute.

538
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,310
But now you say I'm ugly.

539
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,760
Listen to me.

540
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,720
I prefer to eat this table

541
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,630
than marry you.

542
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,360
Please look at yourself in the mirror.

543
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,630
Your face...

544
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,550
Here you are.

545
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,510
Thank you.

546
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,270
Oh, my God.

547
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,550
Bai Yifei.

548
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,430
Bai Yifei.

549
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,510
Bai Yifei.

550
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,960
Bai Yifei.

551
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,070
Our young master, Bai Yifei.

552
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,070
He has a handsome look and unique talent.

553
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,710
He is the most handsome in the world.

554
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,720
I think Zhao Cuo from south city is also very handsome.

555
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,000
Bai Yifei. Bai Yifei.

556
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,080
Don't run.

557
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:58,950
Bai.

558
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,520
Bai. Bai. Bai.

559
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,390
Stop.

560
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,630
Don't move.

561
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,200
I smell a man on him.

562
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,800
He's the one with the mask.

563
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,040
Bai. Bai. Bai.

564
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,840
Brother. I'm here to save your life.

565
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:46,240
Brother. I'll protect you.

566
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,040
You...

567
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,400
Do you owe them much money?

568
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,280
Why are they chasing you?

569
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,800
I...

570
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,640
Did I scare you today?

571
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,430
Peach blossom makeup is a little exaggerated.

572
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,040
But see, I've wiped it off.

573
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,310
Take a close look at me.

574
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:13,710
You...

575
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,760
Do you really forget me?

576
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,030
Why don't you answer me?

577
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,070
I...

578
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,950
Don't speak. Don't speak.

579
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,550
Don't say anything.

580
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,040
I...

581
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
Immortal brother,

582
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,920
it's okay that

583
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,880
you don't remember me.

584
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,400
But I remember you.

585
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,040
I just make sure

586
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,880
you're still safe in the world.

587
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,480
It's so good that I can just keep watching you.

588
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,470
Wow. How beautiful.

589
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,510
It's firework.

590
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,560
I remember when I was a kid,

591
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,830
and I said I wanted to see the fireworks,

592
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,120
you filled the house with fireflies you caught for me.

593
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,400
The fireworks you sent me then

594
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,880
were more beautiful than these for today.

595
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,080
Oh. Who are you?

596
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,030
Miss.

597
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,030
I've always wanted to say

598
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,360
you seem to get a wrong person.

599
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,670
But why didn't you say that early, sir?

600
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,430
It is too bad.

601
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,640
I've got things to do. I'm going.

602
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,760
Hey, Miss.

603
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,080
I...

604
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,030
But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent,

605
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,960
and when you do, nothing will ever compare.

606
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,880
I seem to

607
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,360
see the rainbow.

608
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,790
Zhao Cuo, Zhao Cuo.

609
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,430
Do you really forget me

610
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,480
or I've got the wrong person?

611
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,760
But the grimace is only known to you and me.

612
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,150
What should I do?

613
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:31,500
[Bai Yifei]
