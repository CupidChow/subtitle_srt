[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,900
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,940
Episode 16

4
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,310
Kill her.

5
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,000
We must kill her.

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,509
Kill her.

7
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:41,000
Your Excellency,

8
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,400
don't believe in

9
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,910
what Duan Xuewei said.

10
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,910
It's impossible for Sanqi

11
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,630
to kill He Jinxin.

12
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,440
Your Excellency,

13
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,870
don't you think it's strange?

14
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,000
If Sanqi killed He Jinxin,

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,680
how could she faint in the room?

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,270
Ask Duan Xuewei to confront.

17
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,509
No. Well.

18
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,950
Duan Xuewei is missing.

19
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,080
I couldn't find her anywhere.

20
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,440
Your Excellency,

21
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,720
there must be something wrong with it.

22
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,910
Now Duan Xuewei is missing.

23
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,000
Your Excellency,

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,539
please help us.

25
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,750
Jinxin was virtuous and obedient since childhood,

26
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,800
but she died a violent death.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,829
Please help us, Your Excellency.

28
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,160
Yes.

29
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,750
Why did she die for no reason?

30
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,079
Trust me.

31
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,440
I killed no one.

32
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,160
As soon as I entered her room,

33
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,240
I fainted.

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,079
When I woke up,

35
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,520
she was dead.

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,829
Don't believe her.

37
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:33,320
Tian Sanqi is guilty.

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,110
Back then seeing that she was so poor,

39
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,470
we took her in.

40
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,160
However, she returned kindness with ingratitude.

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,079
She disguised as Jinxin

42
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,670
and married to the Zhao family.

43
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,270
When arguing with Jinxin,

44
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,390
she denied it

45
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,270
and killed Jinxin.

46
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,800
She is a wolf in sheep's clothing.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,550
Tian Sanqi tells lies.

48
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,440
She must be the murderer.

49
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,720
She may not be.

50
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,190
We should investigate clearly.

51
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,960
She has

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,750
solved many cases

53
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,630
for His Excellency.

54
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,390
So what?

55
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,550
There is irrefutable evidence now.

56
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,440
A life for a life.

57
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,080
A life for a life.

59
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,670
A life for a life.

60
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,520
Shut up.

61
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,520
It's not true.

62
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,960
There is no

63
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,190
final verdict,

64
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,270
let alone the extreme penalty.

65
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,000
Yifei,

66
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,960
can't you see the situation?

67
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,829
Don't get involved.

68
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:18,360
Dad,

69
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,630
we can't let them put Sanqi in the wrong.

70
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,110
Now that Your Excellency

71
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,190
can't administer justice for us,

72
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,079
don't blame us

73
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,820
for lynching.

74
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,960
Someone.

75
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,880
Take Tian Sanqi

76
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,160
away.

77
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,829
Yes.

78
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:38,390
Take her away.

79
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,320
Stop him.

80
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,190
What are you doing?

81
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,160
This is yamen.

82
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,320
Are you going to

83
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,600
ignore law in court?

84
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,270
I'm coming.

85
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,190
Drive them out.

86
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,110
Drive them out.

87
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,600
Get away.

88
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:49,910
Young Madam,

89
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,910
are you alright?

90
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,880
Li Jia, where is Zhao Cuo?

91
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,750
I don't know.

92
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,750
I looked for him all night,

93
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,720
but I didn't find him.

94
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,190
Let go.

95
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,480
What do you want to do?

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,670
Xuewei,

97
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,320
why are you here?

98
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,950
What do you want to do?

99
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,670
You said

100
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,510
you won't love anyone else, right?

101
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,110
You won't love me, right?

102
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,230
I won't let it happen.

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,230
You will

104
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,110
always belong to me.

105
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,000
Xuewei,

106
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,000
what do you want to do?

107
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,440
Xuewei.

108
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,670
You'll know soon

109
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,440
what I want to do.

110
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,480
What are you doing here?

111
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,040
The criminal there

112
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,600
is your daughter-in-law.

113
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,040
You should avoid trying.

114
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,480
As

115
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,320
Taifu Magistrate of northern city,

116
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,440
now I'll try it

117
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,920
on behalf of you.

118
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,440
Someone.

119
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Wait.

120
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,880
Wait.

121
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,040
You're in northern city,

122
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,110
while I'm in southern city.

123
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,920
You,

124
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,230
you are acting beyond your authority.

125
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,720
Do you want me to impeach you

126
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,000
to the Lord?

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,920
No.

128
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,320
You were arrogant some time ago.

129
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,880
I really want to

130
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,070
impeach you now.

131
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,040
OK.

132
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,340
Bai, wait and see.

133
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,040
Humph,

134
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,510
I'll go behind and impeach you now.

135
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,830
Humph, wait and see.

136
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,390
Criminal Tian Sanqi,

137
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,720
you deceived the He family

138
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,390
and disguised as their daughter.

139
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,640
As what you did came to light,

140
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,920
you killed Jinxin to vent anger.

141
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,950
This is your first crime.

142
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,510
Disguising as Heart-eating Nanny,

143
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,640
you killed many people in southern city.

144
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,070
This is your second crime.

145
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,790
Now

146
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,390
there is irrefutable evidence.

147
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,270
You're unforgivable.

148
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,230
I'm now sentencing

149
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,160
Tian Sanqi to be executed with fire

150
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,830
immediately.

151
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,790
Dad,

152
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,720
how can you do that?

153
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,880
Send her

154
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,070
to the execution ground now.

155
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,270
Master Bai is wise.

156
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,640
Bai Yifei,

157
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,230
your dad must be crazy.

158
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,000
Master Bai is wise.

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,350
Master Bai.

160
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,950
What to do?

161
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,600
Follow them.

162
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,200
Perhaps we have to

163
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,320
break into the execution ground and rescue her.

164
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,440
Humph.

165
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,940
Master Bai administers justice for us.

166
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,670
Master Bai administers justice for us.

167
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,670
Something goes wrong.

168
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,670
The clues of this case are linked up.

169
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,200
Everything is obvious.

170
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,320
It shouldn't be too easy.

171
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,000
The murderer couldn't be so careless.

172
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,440
But what's wrong?

173
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,480
Burn the devil to death.

174
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,880
Burn her to death.

175
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,390
Burn her to death.

176
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,640
Burn the devil to death.

177
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,550
Burn her to death. Burn her to death. Burn her to death.

178
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,350
Zhao Ming knows martial arts.

179
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,720
Yes.

180
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,000
Zhao Ming isn't the murderer.

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,350
But

182
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,790
I still don't know it.

183
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,350
Why did the murderer kill He Jinxin?

184
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,020
Burn her to death. Burn her to death. Burn her to death.

185
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,300
[The Case of Murdering He Jinxin]

186
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,830
Execute.

187
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,720
Is the murderer…

188
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,000
Did she just want to shift the blame onto me?

189
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,790
What are you doing here?

190
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,950
Master said

191
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,510
Zhao Ming would kill someone tonight.

192
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,670
and sent me to catch him.

193
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,720
I'm here to help you.

194
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,760
What's wrong with me?

195
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,950
What's wrong with you?

196
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,640
You killed He Jinxin

197
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,510
when I was away.

198
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,230
This is what I see

199
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,550
when I come back.

200
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,160
But why did she do that?

201
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,030
No. Wait.

202
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,080
Duan Xuewei is missing.

203
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,280
I couldn't find her anywhere.

204
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,030
Li Jia,

205
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,590
where is Zhao Cuo?

206
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,670
I don't know.

207
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,590
I looked for him all night,

208
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,520
but I didn't find him.

209
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,910
Mr. Bai, Ruoyao,

210
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,000
let me down.

211
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,910
Save Zhao Cuo.

212
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,760
He is in danger.

213
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,520
Burn the devil to death.

214
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,440
Sanqi.

215
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,320
Stop.

216
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,910
How dare you!

217
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,550
Who? How dare you break into the execution ground!

218
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,550
Make way. Make way.

219
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,910
Make way.

220
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,350
He is Young Lord of Taoyuan City.

221
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,470
Brother.

222
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,660
Brother?

223
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,520
Brother.

224
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,350
Brother,

225
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,520
you're so late.

226
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,910
What's going on here?

227
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,350
Young Lord,

228
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,670
she disguised as Heart-eating Nanny

229
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,520
and killed many people in southern city.

230
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,790
We're going to execute with fire now.

231
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,520
Nonsense.

232
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,640
She killed nobody.

233
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,030
You decided a case without evidence.

234
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't dare.

235
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,470
Young Lord,

236
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,760
I killed nobody.

237
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,280
We must rush to Qiandu Hall

238
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,030
to save Zhao Cuo now.

239
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,280
Don't talk nonsense.

240
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,230
Save yourself first.

241
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,960
I have no time to explain.

242
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
Zhao Cuo is in danger.

243
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,880
Let me down now.

244
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,520
Young Lord,

245
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,670
believe her.

246
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,350
Brother,

247
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,200
I swear by my life that

248
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,440
she is innocent.

249
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,110
Stand up first.

250
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,790
Thank you, Young Lord.

251
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,280
If she really killed someone,

252
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,640
as Young Lord of Taoyuan City,

253
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,790
I'll find the truth for people in southern city.

254
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,400
However,

255
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,590
It appears complicated now.

256
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,470
I'll investigate personally.

257
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,470
We'll make a final conclusion

258
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,030
after all is clearly investigated.

259
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,230
Wumeng.

260
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,590
What's wrong?

261
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,960
No one is here.

262
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,550
Search separately.

263
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,230
Yes.

264
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,880
The furnishings in this room are Chisang style.

265
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,280
It must be Duan Xuewei's room.

266
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,080
Search now.

267
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,710
Maybe there's a clue.

268
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,400
Ruoyao.

269
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,280
Ruoyao.

270
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Check if there are other keys

271
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,080
in this house.

272
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,350
At this critical moment,

273
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,320
you're looking for keys.

274
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,150
Look.

275
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,520
Why are you looking at me like that?

276
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,840
I,

277
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,470
I'm just worried about

278
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,200
the future of Mr. Bai.

279
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,520
Look.

280
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,440
Heart changing operation.

281
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,110
There is such a secret operation in the world.

282
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,640
It's right.

283
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,350
Those who were killed in southern city

284
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,110
were for performing it.

285
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,840
There must be a secret room in Qiandu Hall for performing it.

286
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,230
Find it out now,

287
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,440
or Zhao Cuo will be in danger.

288
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,590
Go.

289
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,200
Are you ready?

290
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Hurry up.

291
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,080
This pulse condition

292
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,350
is rare in the world.

293
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,280
Xuewei,

294
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,030
his heart

295
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,230
is better than yours.

296
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,400
Gui Jianchou,

297
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,880
you're blocking my blood vessel.

298
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,320
Old man,

299
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,710
let go of me.

300
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,470
Take it easy.

301
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,520
I'm just

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,840
borrowing

303
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,910
your perfect heart.

304
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,550
Did you find it?

305
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,440
We've searched

306
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,960
around Qiandu Hall,

307
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,110
but we found no one

308
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,640
or trace of a secret room.

309
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,350
Why are there

310
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,910
so many herbs and dregs in the yard?

311
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,670
These dregs are the secret recipe of Qiandu Hall.

312
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,110
You can't take them away.

313
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,760
Here it is.

314
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,790
There must be a secret way down there.

315
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,080
Why?

316
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,880
I felt strange when

317
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,760
I was here that day.

318
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,150
This straw mat is

319
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,670
in the shade of the yard

320
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,550
without sunshine.

321
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,960
It's unreasonable to air herbs here.

322
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,150
As a famous doctor,

323
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,550
Gui Jianchou wouldn't air herbs

324
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,400
in the shade.

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,080
He wanted to hide something.

326
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,150
There must be something strange with this land.

327
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,080
It's quite possible that

328
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,200
the secret room of Qiandu Hall is down here.

329
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,590
There must be a mechanism here

330
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,230
to open this secret room.

331
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,350
Let's find it. Go.

332
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,350
Wumeng,

333
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,230
ask several people to dig it out.

334
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:09,710
Yes.

335
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,470
It's very thick.

336
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,400
Without mechanism,

337
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:20,960
we can't open it.

338
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,520
What do you want?

339
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,280
Old man,

340
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,790
you…

341
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,150
I'm here.

342
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,790
Someone seems to save you here.

343
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,590
But calm down.

344
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,880
They can't come in.

345
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,230
It's Zhao Cuo.

346
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,280
I hear him.

347
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,520
Zhao Cuo.

348
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,670
Zhao Cuo.

349
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,150
Zhao Cuo.

350
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,110
Zhao Cuo.

351
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,840
Sanqi.

352
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,320
Sanqi.

353
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,790
Zhao Cuo.

354
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,150
Wumeng,

355
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,670
search for the mechanism now.

356
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,080
Yes.

357
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,520
Zhao Cuo.

358
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,150
Sanqi.

359
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,910
Zhao Cuo.

360
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,960
Search carefully.

361
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,760
Yes.

362
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,840
It is open.

363
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,790
Sanqi.

364
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,470
Wumeng,

365
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:25,960
follow me.

366
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,030
Palace guards,

367
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,710
stay here

368
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,470
in case of any changes.

369
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,960
Yes.

370
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,440
Old man, what do you want to do?

371
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,840
What do I want to do?

372
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,470
You've seen travelling all over the world,

373
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,320
but you even can't tell that.

374
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,230
I'll dig your heart.

375
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,590
So you

376
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,710
dug hearts of those

377
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,910
in southern city.

378
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,550
You're right.

379
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,840
But it's useless

380
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,470
though you know it now.

381
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,350
Why are you doing this?

382
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,350
Why?

383
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,080
I need

384
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,910
a perfect heart

385
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,430
and yours

386
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:05,950
is the one I want.

387
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,470
Wait.

388
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,310
Wait, wait a moment.

389
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,349
Wait.

390
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,950
I had been a sickly child.

391
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,950
My heart

392
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,680
isn't good.

393
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,430
Don't

394
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,310
try to delay.

395
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,349
Don't talk nonsense.

396
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,000
No.

397
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,520
Old man,

398
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,000
listen.

399
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,760
It's so noisy.

400
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,710
Dad.

401
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,430
Dear daughter,

402
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,920
listen to me.

403
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,950
Get some more sleep.

404
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,710
I'll

405
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,160
cure you soon.

406
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,800
Dad,

407
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,680
stop.

408
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,760
Don't do anything terrible again.

409
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,620
No.

410
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,340
I do this

411
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,110
for your sake.

412
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,560
I'm sorry to your late mom,

413
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,350
so I can't let you

414
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,560
die earlier than I do.

415
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,430
No need, dad.

416
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,680
I don't want to change heart.

417
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
I don't want to suffer any more.

418
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,820
Can't you just

419
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,340
let me die

420
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,220
in peace?

421
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,540
Stop killing others.

422
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,820
You were a famous doctor

423
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,220
who helped the world.

424
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,110
but you

425
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,560
become a murderer.

426
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Well,

427
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,380
old man,

428
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,020
did you hear it?

429
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,700
They'll break in soon.

430
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,340
Without my help,

431
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,260
you'll be caught

432
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,900
and have no chance to save her.

433
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,700
What about

434
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,540
working together?

435
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,900
Xuewei,

436
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,500
even you…

437
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,500
Don't worry.

438
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,020
I'll give you my heart

439
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,420
rather than that of an innocent person.

440
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,100
I'm willing to give you my own heart.

441
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,340
No.

442
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,060
If I get your heart,

443
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,340
you'll die.

444
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,340
Don't worry.

445
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,500
I'm not going to die.

446
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,700
What I want is

447
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,140
Zhao Cuo's heart.

448
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,430
But

449
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,000
it depends on your dad.

450
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,710
There isn't much time for you.

451
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,230
Xuewei,

452
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,000
I promise you.

453
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,560
But

454
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,640
you have to kill those who break in.

455
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:13,950
Zhao Cuo.

456
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,760
Zhao Cuo.

457
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,640
Zhao Cuo, are you alright?

458
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,560
Be careful.

459
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,880
Gui Jianchou wants to kill me.

460
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,760
Gui Jianchou,

461
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,710
I thought you were a famous doctor helping the world.

462
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,880
Unexpectedly,

463
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
you were a murderer.

464
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,880
Tell me.

465
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,920
Did you kill

466
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,160
all the innocent people?

467
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,760
Xuewei,

468
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,880
kill them with your secret skill.

469
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,340
Xuewei,

470
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,540
why do you

471
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,460
assist him in the crime?

472
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,700
She loses her head for the moment.

473
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,540
Moreover, Gui Jianchou keeps instigating.

474
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,580
Xuewei.

475
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,140
Don't make more mistakes.

476
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,380
Tell us

477
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,460
the crime of Gui Jianchou.

478
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,940
Humph.

479
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,900
Gui Jianchou,

480
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,900
admit it that

481
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,220
you are the one

482
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,860
who killed so many innocent people.

483
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,860
The one

484
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,340
lying on the chair

485
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,620
is your daughter, right?

486
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,660
I'm afraid that your son-in-law

487
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,220
Zhao Ming, the one onto whom

488
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,260
you try to shift the blame, was killed by you.

489
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,300
What?

490
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,140
Daughter.

491
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,340
Is that true?

492
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,020
Dad,

493
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,020
what's going on?

494
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,060
You told me that

495
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,180
he escaped

496
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,060
and disappeared, right?

497
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,980
What happened?

498
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,420
There was white poria

499
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,500
in the strange fragrance

500
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,420
I smelled in your room that day.

501
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,880
It was also found in the dregs

502
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,860
in the backyard of Qiandu Hall.

503
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,560
It was also on the purchase order

504
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,180
of Zhao's pharmacy.

505
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,580
It's for treating heart disease.

506
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,100
So Miss,

507
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,700
there is something wrong with your heart,

508
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,180
not your lungs.

509
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,780
Am I right?

510
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,820
Yes.

511
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,100
I have palpitations since childhood.

512
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,940
My dad has been treating me for many years,

513
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,260
but it doesn't help.

514
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,110
So

515
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,940
taking the risk,

516
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,640
he performed

517
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,380
heart changing operation from Chisang for you.

518
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,310
I saw the scar

519
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,820
of changing heart on your chest.

520
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,060
I think your dad has tested with

521
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,540
the innocent people

522
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,590
who died miserably.

523
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,300
I'm afraid

524
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,430
your husband

525
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,660
was killed.

526
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,220
Dad,

527
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,070
did you really kill him?

528
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,780
Dad.

529
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,260
Dear daughter.

530
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,940
listen to me.

531
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,020
They're right.

532
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,060
I dug hearts of people of the city

533
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,420
and killed Zhao Ming.

534
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,780
So what?

535
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,460
As long as

536
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,380
I can cure your heart disease,

537
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,100
it's worth doing so

538
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,580
no matter how many people die.

539
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,700
Dad,

540
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,380
why?

541
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,820
Why did you kill my husband?

542
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,100
He didn't

543
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,420
deserve you.

544
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,420
He married you

545
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,180
for the fame

546
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,980
of Qiandu Hall

547
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,420
to get rich.

548
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,340
Listen.

549
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:25,620
That night

550
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,460
when I told him to change heart for you,

551
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,900
he was afraid.

552
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,020
Just forget such

553
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,180
a greedy man.

554
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,420
It's a pity that

555
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,140
he was too weak,

556
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,660
so the operation failed.

557
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,060
So you killed him

558
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,580
on her wedding night

559
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,950
and then forged that

560
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,880
he was the murderer

561
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,260
to distract yamen's attention

562
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,400
to do things conveniently.

563
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,800
You're right.

564
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,460
Send to the bridal chamber,

565
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,260
Father-in-law.

566
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
Father-in-law.

567
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,420
What do you want to do?

568
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,700
I can't understand.

569
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,820
Since Zhao Ming was killed long ago,

570
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,880
how do you know that

571
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,300
I shifted the blame onto him?

572
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,520
That day,

573
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,940
misled by Duan Xuewei,

574
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,940
we went to his home

575
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,710
and did find

576
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,430
the evidence that

577
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,020
he was the murderer.

578
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,540
But you ignored it that

579
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,680
a man who practices martial arts and swords

580
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,680
must be vigorous and powerful

581
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,460
in writing.

582
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,640
As for Zhao Ming's handwriting

583
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,760
on the receipt

584
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,140
we found at Zhao's pharmacy,

585
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,900
the ink didn't permeate the paper.

586
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,340
It showed that he was weak

587
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,060
and poor at martial arts.

588
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,300
However,

589
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,460
in the threatening letter where

590
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,950
He Jinxin tried to imitate his handwriting,

591
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,860
the ink permeated the paper

592
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,710
and each stroke was extremely powerful,

593
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,540
so he wasn't the murderer.

594
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,430
And you told Duan Xuewei to mislead us

595
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,860
to distract our attention,

596
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,950
because you targeted Zhao Cuo.

597
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,500
Well, I see.

598
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,580
But why is Zhao Cuo?

599
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,500
Gui Jianchou planned

600
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,190
to find a right heart

601
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,020
in the city for changing heart

602
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,620
before that day.

603
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,380
Who are you?

604
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,880
I'm Zhao Cuo,

605
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,860
Zhao Quandui's son.

606
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,740
I see.

607
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,470
Your pulse condition is amazing

608
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,780
and rare in the world.

609
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,420
So

610
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,820
from Zhao Cuo's pulse condition,

611
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,460
he realized that Zhao Cuo's heart was suitable for heart changing.

612
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,920
Therefore,

613
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,820
he changed the plan.

614
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,760
So Duan Xuewei appeared that day

615
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,820
to cover Gui Jianchou.

616
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,180
Yes.

617
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,820
That day she went to the He's family

618
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,220
to talk with me.

619
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,590
Seizing the chance,

620
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,580
Gui Jianchou blew numbing incense into He Jinxin's room

621
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,940
and showed up deliberately to attract our attention.

622
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,110
Stay here.

623
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,880
I'll check.

624
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,620
Zhao Cuo was led away.

625
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,680
The noise of heavy objects

626
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,060
falling to the ground in He Jinxin's room

627
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,070
was made when she fainted

628
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,860
due to the numbing incense.

629
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,820
I fainted in her room

630
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,780
for the same reason.

631
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,620
Thus,

632
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,980
Duan Xuewei and Gui Jianchou worked together

633
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,940
to catch Zhao Cuo,

634
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,760
kill He Jinxin

635
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,920
and shift the blame onto me

636
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
to gain time to get

637
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,860
Zhao Cuo's heart.

638
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,340
But they didn't expect us

639
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,820
to come here in such a short time.

640
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,660
But

641
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,140
I still wonder one thing.

642
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,860
Xuewei,

643
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,400
why did you work with Gui Jianchou

644
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,700
to hurt Zhao Cuo?

645
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,740
Because I love him,

646
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,430
I want his heart

647
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,430
to be mine forever.

648
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,020
What?

649
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,580
What did you mean?

650
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,660
If I get his heart,

651
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,900
we would be together.

652
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,350
This is the most romantic thing

653
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,420
in the world, right?

654
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,940
Xuewei,

655
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,830
why do you become so vicious?

656
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,740
You're killing him.

657
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:42,740
Really?

658
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,380
He is also killing me.

659
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,820
He and I lived by each other since childhood.

660
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,940
We regarded each other as our love in this life.

661
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,180
But when I wanted to come back,

662
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,980
he fell in love with Sanqi.

663
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,700
He made my heart wither little by little.

664
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,620
Now

665
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,100
of course I want to get his heart.

666
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,500
It's her.

667
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,070
She took

668
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,420
his heart away.

669
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,460
But

670
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,380
do you think you won?

671
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,860
No.

672
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,350
His heart

673
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,580
will be mine at last.

674
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,900
You lost.

675
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,340
So when you found Gui Jianchou

676
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,780
tried recklessly to cure

677
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,070
his daughter's heart disease

678
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,940
disregarding medical ethics

679
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,500
in Qiandu Hall,

680
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,660
you agreed with him

681
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,300
to replace Zhao Cuo's heart with yours.

682
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,640
But Zhao Cuo had only one heart,

683
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,460
you couldn't share it with his daughter, right?

684
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,590
Today I found that

685
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,940
Gui Jianchou

686
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,060
was just using me.

687
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,780
He didn't even think of

688
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,340
giving me Zhao Cuo's heart.

689
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,340
But all is right now.

690
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,700
I'd made a deal with him.

691
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,190
At last I'll get Zhao Cuo's heart.

692
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,540
How terrible you are!

693
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,420
Are you going to destroy him as you can't get him?

694
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,350
Zhao Cuo is a living person,

695
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,660
but not your possession.

696
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,100
I thought you loved him deeply,

697
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,180
but I didn't expect you only love yourself.

698
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,500
How poor you are!

699
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,800
You don't know what love is.

700
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,380
Don't talk about that with me.

701
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,100
Whether he is dead or alive,

702
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,820
I only want his heart to be mine.

703
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,800
I think

704
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,400
you'd better worry about

705
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,460
your lives.

706
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,470
Now that

707
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,420
all of you are here today,

708
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,860
none of you

709
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,230
will leave alive.

710
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:53,820
Duan Xuewei,

711
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,680
you'd better be captured.

712
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,220
You can defeat us.

713
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,040
And officers and soldiers

714
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,640
are outside now.

715
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,780
I think you can't escape.

716
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,260
Really?

717
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,660
Wumeng, catch her.

718
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,180
Yes.

719
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,540
What's wrong with them?

720
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,420
Staff of Qiandu Hall.

721
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,900
So they're all here.

722
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,420
Wumeng,

723
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,640
they are controlled by Chisang's Puppet Trick.

724
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,580
Don't hurt them.

725
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:49,780
Yes.

726
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,340
Zhao Cuo, let's go.

727
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,220
Zhao Cuo.

728
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,380
Zhao Cuo.

729
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,260
Zhao Cuo.

730
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,020
Zhao Cuo.

731
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,620
Zhao Cuo.

732
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,100
Don't hurt him.

733
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:43,980
Zhao Cuo.

734
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,020
Zhao Cuo,

735
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,940
wake up.

736
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,540
Sanqi.

737
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,380
Tian Sanqi,

738
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,680
you'll know the feeling of

739
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,220
being killed by your beloved.

740
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,900
Kill him

741
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,040
or be killed

742
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,500
by him.

743
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,860
Guess.

744
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,949
How will he feel

745
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,260
when he wakes up

746
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,300
and finds that he kills you?

747
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:29,699
Duan Xuewei,

748
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,540
I misjudged you.

749
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,040
Then show me

750
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,460
how noble your love is.

751
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,380
If I wake up,

752
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,420
tell him that

753
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,540
I'm killed by a puppet.

754
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,220
Zhao Cuo, are you alright?

755
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,820
Zhao Cuo.

756
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,860
Be careful.

757
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,860
Zhao Cuo.

758
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,460
Zhao Cuo.

759
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,700
I told you.

760
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,300
Now that all of you are here,

761
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,100
none of you will leave alive.

762
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,220
Xuewei.

763
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,020
Zhao Cuo,

764
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,340
I told you

765
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,060
when the cherry blossoms bloomed for the 8th time,

766
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,300
I would be back.

767
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,300
Now I'm back,

768
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,780
but why didn't you keep the promise?

769
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,060
Why?

770
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:19,420
I, I…

771
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,060
Never mind.

772
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,980
I won't blame you.

773
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,540
Now

774
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,780
I'll kill her.

775
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,220
Xuewei,

776
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,660
we are friends growing up together.

777
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,220
All will be solved.

778
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,660
Don't make it irretrievable.

779
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,700
Xuewei,

780
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,380
we were good friends when we were young.

781
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,660
Now,

782
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,100
now

783
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,980
we're in a life-or-death struggle.

784
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,940
I still remember that

785
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,700
when I was 10,

786
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,540
a girl in red

787
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,740
said to me…

788
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,430
Be my friend, OK?

789
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,700
…be my friend, OK?

790
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,900
Because of her,

791
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,300
I could

792
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,760
sleep safely

793
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,860
every night.

794
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,900
Xuewei,

795
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,060
if my heart

796
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,940
can make you get rid of hatred,

797
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:48,820
I'll dig it for you by myself.

798
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,780
Xuewei,

799
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,380
I'll kill

800
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,740
Tian Sanqi for you.

801
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,580
Miss. Miss.

802
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,860
Miss. Miss.

803
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,860
How can you be so silly?

804
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,300
Listen to me.

805
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,260
Hold on.

806
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,580
I'll kill them to cure you.

807
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,100
Dad,

808
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,060
don't do that.

809
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,140
In my heart,

810
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,460
you were a famous doctor who helped those in danger.

811
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,820
How could you be like this?

812
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,940
It's my fault.

813
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,660
I get you involved.

814
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,020
Daughter.

815
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,300
Daughter.

816
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,620
Since you're gone,

817
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,860
I don't know

818
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,740
how to face

819
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,940
your mom in the underworld.

820
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,940
Daughter.

821
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,020
Daughter.

822
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:39,840
Zhao Cuo.

823
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,420
Zhao Cuo.

824
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:41,860
Are you alright?

825
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,100
Gui Jianchou,

826
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,360
why did you kill four

827
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,020
18-year-old youths from Shifang Village?

828
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,840
Shifang Village is far away from here.

829
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,710
You wanted just a heart.

830
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,950
Why did you kill them?

831
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:02,540
Daughter,

832
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,660
don't be afraid.

833
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:06,580
Daughter,

834
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,740
I'm coming.

835
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,540
Wait for me.

836
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,700
I

837
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,460
will go

838
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:18,340
to meet your mom

839
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:20,300
in the underworld

840
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:22,900
with you now.

841
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,340
Dear,

842
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:36,580
I'll meet you now

843
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,380
with our dear daughter.

844
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,140
You have many questions to ask me, right?

845
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:53,620
OK. I promise.

846
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:58,430
I'll take you to the hell.

847
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,700
Ask King of Hell.

848
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,670
Oh, no.

849
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:19,380
Go now.

850
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:36,980
Go with us, Xuewei.

851
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:01,820
Xuewei.

852
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:12,940
Xuewei.

853
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:15,000
Xuewei.

854
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,140
Xuewei.

855
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,980
Sanqi, go first. Leave me alone.

856
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,460
Shut up. Let's go.

857
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:11,780
Sanqi.

858
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,430
Sanqi.

859
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:17,260
Sanqi.

860
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,420
Sanqi. Sanqi.
