[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:33,120
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,590
Episode 20

4
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,160
No, oh damn it!

5
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:43,550
Sanqi.

6
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,509
Sanqi, open the door.

7
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,160
I'm Zhao Cuo.

8
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:49,400
Sanqi!

9
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,870
Sanqi!

10
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,229
Sanqi!

11
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,190
Sanqi!

12
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,400
Why are you here?

13
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,160
Why did you knock at the door

14
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,000
of a girl's room brusquely

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,310
early in the morning?

16
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,320
Am I brusque?

17
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,440
Compared with the other man,

18
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,960
I'm not brusque at all.

19
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,630
It's none of your business. Go away.

20
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,630
Sanqi!

21
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,160
Hey,

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,880
what do you mean?

23
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,880
I have a question for you.

24
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,190
Girls like celebrating their birthdays, right?

25
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,440
Well,

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,030
if someone rents the whole southern city

27
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,110
and covers the sky with fireworks for you

28
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,600
on your birthday,

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,000
will you be touched?

30
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,160
Yes, I'll be greatly touched.

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,520
After being touched,

32
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,440
she will be impetuous, right?

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,000
Since ancient times, women have been amorous.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,320
Then she will do

35
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,160
something irrational

36
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,750
after being touched, right?

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,829
When autumn's Golden Wind embraces Dew of Jade,

38
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,550
all the love scenes on earth, however many, fade.

39
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,240
Since ancient times,

40
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,829
many good stories always begin with irrationality.

41
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,390
You mean,

42
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,470
Sanqi and Young Lord…

43
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,600
Sanqi.

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,030
Sanqi.

45
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,110
Sanqi!

46
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,720
Sanqi!

47
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,800
Sanqi.

48
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,360
What do you want to do? What do you want to do?

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,470
Why are you

50
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,440
knocking at the door

51
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
of a girl's room

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,000
early in the morning?

53
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,390
Master Zhao,

54
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,750
Sanqi was irrational.

55
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,750
What?

56
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,440
He Zhen!

57
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,670
Open the door for me! Don't play dead!

58
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,240
Young Lord,

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,720
I want to appreciate a famous painting with you.

60
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,470
Open the door!

61
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,190
Young Lord,

62
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,390
please check today's menu!

63
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,550
Your Highness,

64
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,440
open the door!

65
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,720
Open the door!

66
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,880
I want to report a serious case to you!

67
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,960
It's extremely urgent!

68
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,630
He Zhen!

69
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,670
Open the door!

70
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,600
Open the door!

71
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,720
Why are you here?

72
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,000
No!

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,880
Young Lord had gone out early in the morning,

74
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,270
so I was cleaning the room.

75
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,830
I see.

76
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,910
Where is Sanqi?

77
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,000
They went back to Shifang Village to visit parents together.

78
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,750
They had gone to visit her parents.

79
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,800
Li Jia, go to prepare a horse!

80
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,470
Go to prepare a horse.

81
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,550
Honey,

82
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,230
you can't scare me like this in the future.

83
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,830
I was very scared.

84
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,320
OK?

85
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,640
Don't behave like this

86
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,270
during the daytime.

87
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,320
Well,

88
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,790
horse.

89
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,670
Dad! Mom!

90
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, Sanqi is back.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,159
Oh, Sanqi.

92
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,670
Hurry up.

93
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,159
Well, Sanqi,

94
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,920
you shouldn't come back aboveboard.

95
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,040
After all, you should know that

96
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,070
you are a fugitive.

97
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,510
Yes, your father is right.

98
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,550
If the unlucky Young Lord catches you,

99
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,830
he won't let you go, Sanqi.

100
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,000
Dad, mom,

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,670
this is…

102
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,950
No need to introduce him.

103
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,480
I know him.

104
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,440
It seems that he is not one of those young masters that

105
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,510
you brought here before.

106
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,510
Well,

107
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,160
there is no young master here.

108
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,320
You woodenhead,

109
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,640
don't start a rumor here.

110
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,230
My daughter

111
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,640
is noble

112
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
and pure.

113
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,440
Yes, you're right.

114
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,320
Sanqi,

115
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,270
this young master

116
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,920
dresses more gorgeously than those who came here before,

117
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,920
and he is also tall and handsome.

118
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,159
You can hold your head high

119
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,950
as the daughter of our Tian family.

120
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,640
A spinster can also find her Mr. Right.

121
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,670
Shut up.

122
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,390
Don't talk nonsense.

123
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,350
What do you mean?

124
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,320
A spinster?

125
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,200
Our daughter is,

126
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,920
is,

127
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,270
is an old maid.

128
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,040
An old maid.

129
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,110
Hey. Well, Sanqi,

130
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,159
I'm going to ask you about something.

131
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,320
Don't you really plan to

132
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,510
marry Young Lord?

133
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,159
Well,

134
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,070
don't marry him. Don't marry him.

135
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,670
Maybe Young Lord

136
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,110
is disabled and ugly.

137
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,790
Otherwise,

138
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,720
he wouldn't come to our Shifang Village

139
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,320
to choose Sanqi.

140
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,550
Dad, Mom.

141
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,070
Yes.

142
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,880
This is He Zhen, Young Lord of Taoyuan City.

143
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,270
Oh!

144
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,790
No wonder

145
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,230
you're extraordinary, handsome,

146
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,640
awesome and noble.

147
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,270
It turns out that you're Young Lord.

148
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,880
Yeah. Yeah.

149
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,550
If our daughter

150
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,920
can marry such an especially handsome man

151
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,790
as you,

152
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,270
it'll be a great grace.

153
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,350
Well,

154
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,440
some days ago, our ancestor

155
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,159
really made his power felt,

156
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,640
right?

157
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,159
Had you seen it?

158
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,070
Had you seen it?

159
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,320
Stop that, Tian.

160
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,550
Come over.

161
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,200
Kneel down.

162
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,760
Thank Young Lord for not killing you.

163
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,830
Uncle, Auntie,

164
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,720
stand up.

165
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,440
Stand up. Stand up.

166
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,640
I don't come to punish you

167
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,159
but

168
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,880
to officially propose a marriage

169
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,760
in the name of your son-in-law.

170
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,950
I hope that

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,920
you can bless us

172
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,720
and marry Sanqi off to me.

173
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,040
Young Lord,

174
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,640
these dates are very sweet.

175
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,760
Come on. Eat some.

176
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,320
OK. OK.

177
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,200
Have a taste.

178
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,550
Young Lord,

179
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,670
please sit down and eat them.

180
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,390
Although that coffin

181
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,040
looks old and shabby,

182
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,670
it's smooth, slippery, and won't make your butts ache.

183
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,200
You will feel comfortable after sitting on it.

184
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,110
No need.

185
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,110
I had ridden for so long,

186
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,510
so I don't want to sit down.

187
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,760
Young Lord,

188
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,040
in principle,

189
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,390
Sanqi should

190
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,880
have married into Lord's Mansion early,

191
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,159
but she has been naughty and made trouble

192
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,230
from childhood.

193
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,790
I even worried that

194
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,670
nobody, nobody wouldn't marry her.

195
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,510
I…

196
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,950
We worried that

197
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,950
Sanqi would listen to nobody.

198
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,110
Now she

199
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,350
gets along well with you,

200
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,040
we can be relieved.

201
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,790
Uncle and auntie,

202
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,230
don't worry.

203
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,159
I'll be kind to her in the future.

204
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,160
OK. OK.

205
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,670
Dad, mom,

206
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,390
in the future,

207
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,270
I'll often come back to visit you.

208
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,160
Do take care of yourselves.

209
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,110
OK.

210
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,040
Don't worry, Sanqi.

211
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,550
Silly girl.

212
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,790
Old locust tree, how are you?

213
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,000
I haven't come back to chat with you for a long time.

214
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,760
How are you doing?

215
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:31,760
Me?

216
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,760
I live,

217
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,350
live happily,

218
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,030
except for meeting some little difficulties.

219
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,470
But it's not important.

220
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,030
The important thing is that

221
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,840
I found my brother.

222
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,790
He is He Zhen,

223
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,080
Young Lord of Taoyuan City.

224
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,790
Thank you.

225
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,710
If you didn't ask me to go to look for him,

226
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,640
maybe I now still…

227
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,230
Hey,

228
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,470
I was talking to you,

229
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,440
but why did you hit me?

230
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,320
Well, I forgive you.

231
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,520
But it was a coincidence that

232
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,200
I escaped from his marriage

233
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,110
but he is doomed to…

234
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,640
Ouch.

235
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,790
Ouch.

236
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,200
Oh.

237
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,760
Hey, old locust tree,

238
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
I'll be hurt badly.

239
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,640
You're so cruel.

240
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,230
Sanqi,

241
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,080
I finally found you.

242
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,280
I was very anxious.

243
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,080
Zhao Cuo,

244
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,150
why are you here?

245
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,280
Why am I here?

246
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,230
I couldn't find you everywhere.

247
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,030
You should tell me before you came back to Shifang Village.

248
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,880
What do you find me for?

249
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,670
I, I

250
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,000
want to give you something.

251
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,760
What's it?

252
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,470
My satchel!

253
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,550
Why did you take it?

254
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,790
I couldn't find it everywhere.

255
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,400
Grimace totem?

256
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,150
Yeah.

257
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,230
It looks a little ugly.

258
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,350
I'll buy you a new one.

259
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,880
No need.

260
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,790
I like it.

261
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,710
Do you really like it?

262
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,590
Yes.

263
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,150
I won't exchange it for anything.

264
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,230
But, but

265
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,230
it really looks very ugly.

266
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,590
Hey. Hey,

267
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,640
I personally embroidered it.

268
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,710
Don't be demanding.

269
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,590
I really can't understand

270
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,710
you girls' thoughts.

271
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,200
Hey,

272
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,840
why did you come to give it to me in a hurry?

273
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,550
What?

274
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,590
Well,

275
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,840
you once

276
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,150
said that

277
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,230
you married me because of the grimace totem,

278
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,470
so I embroidered it.

279
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,880
Why did you lie to me?

280
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,790
You liar!

281
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,590
If you didn't lie to me,

282
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,110
I wouldn't

283
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,230
marry you casually.

284
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,470
Because of you,

285
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,590
my life has been messed up!

286
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,440
Well, it's not time

287
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,840
to talk about the kite

288
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,590
and grimace totem.

289
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,760
Hey,

290
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,670
did you carve that grimace totem?

291
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,400
What?

292
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,590
Well,

293
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,640
brother carved

294
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,280
that grimace totem for me.

295
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,590
He said, the grimace totem

296
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,440
would protect me like him.

297
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,550
I see.

298
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,550
An old man with two ears...

299
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:42,400
-He has no meals for three days. 
-So he is so hungry that he's busy cooking.

300
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,840
He bought two onions with 0.33 tael.

301
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,590
He bought two watermelons with 0.77 tael.

302
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,110
He bought two loofahs with 0.66 tael.

303
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,320
And also two sticks of sugarcoated haws.

304
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,910
How do you know this nursery rhyme?

305
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,790
I do not know it, either.

306
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,000
Maybe I kept it in mind

307
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,280
when I first heard

308
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,910
you singing this.

309
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,320
I only sang it once,

310
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,840
but you kept it in mind?

311
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,400
Maybe because it sounded too bad.

312
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,000
Zhao Cuo, why are you here?

313
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,840
I came here for a case

314
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,000
and dropped by someone that I want to meet.

315
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,910
Parents-in-law had served the food.

316
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,440
Let's go back.

317
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,910
Go.

318
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,200
In fact,

319
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,960
I always want to ask you a question.

320
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,910
You told me that

321
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,200
you mistook Zhao Cuo for me,

322
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,880
so you married him.

323
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,760
Why did you mistake him for me?

324
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Do you remember

325
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,760
the mark between us?

326
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,230
Yes.

327
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,110
Zhao Cuo's object

328
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,960
had that grimace totem,

329
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,080
so I mistook him for you.

330
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,790
I see.

331
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,520
But now we've known that

332
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,320
you are my real brother.

333
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,080
I misunderstood it

334
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,000
before.

335
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,030
Come out.

336
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,230
Are we going to kill him?

337
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,470
He had escaped several times.

338
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,030
Now he stays in Shifang Village alone.

339
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,110
It's the best opportunity.

340
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,880
If we miss this opportunity,

341
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,710
after going back to the capital,

342
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,000
how, how will you

343
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,640
explain to them, Young Lord?

344
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,150
I'll consider it

345
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,470
after returning to the capital.

346
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,790
I'm going to return to the capital,

347
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
so I don't want an accident to occur.

348
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:17,840
Are you worried that

349
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,470
Tian Sanqi won't go back with you

350
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,400
after we kill him?

351
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,550
I just don't want to make

352
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,910
her sad on our way back.

353
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,840
You are worried that

354
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,150
Tian Sanqi will be sad,

355
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,760
so you don't have the heart to kill him?

356
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,550
If you make all his efforts

357
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,960
of so many years in vain because of her,

358
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,440
you will

359
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,710
come to a bad end.

360
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,520
You can't ensure Tian Sanqi's safety, either.

361
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
I've decided.

362
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,960
How to explain it

363
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,790
and how to do

364
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,110
depend on me.

365
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,840
It's none of your business.

366
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,230
Why?

367
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,640
Why do you choose her?

368
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,200
Wumeng,

369
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,550
from now on,

370
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,150
you are He Zhen's personal bodyguard.

371
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,440
You must protect him

372
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,110
with your life.

373
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:10,680
Wumeng,

374
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,920
don't try so hard in the future.

375
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,880
No, I must practice martial arts well to protect you.

376
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,400
I grew up with you since childhood.

377
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,069
I always

378
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,430
follow, protect

379
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,589
and serve you.

380
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,040
Why don't you

381
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,710
know my heart?

382
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,590
Why can't you

383
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,310
give me a little of your love?

384
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,830
Rubbish, stand up!

385
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,070
Young Lord,

386
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,400
I won't allow anyone to interrupt your plan.

387
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,430
I'll do this for you.

388
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:38,920
By order of our master,

389
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,470
kill Zhao Cuo

390
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,680
and

391
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,640
Tian Sanqi tonight.

392
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:48,950
Yes.

393
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,640
[Tian Sanqi]

394
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,590
What's that?

395
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,280
Come under the big locust tree.

396
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,430
I want to tell you something.

397
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,160
By Zhao Cuo.

398
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,920
Sanqi,

399
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,230
if I had accompanied you,

400
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,190
drawn the grimace totem

401
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,640
and pleased you

402
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,560
since childhood,

403
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,350
maybe we…

404
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,590
Alas.

405
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,230
Cuckoo. Cuckoo.

406
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,560
Cuckoo.

407
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,350
Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo.

408
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,920
Damned Zhao Cuo.

409
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,520
How dare you fool me again!

410
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,920
Well, forget it.

411
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,710
I'm going back to sleep.

412
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,430
Why are you here?

413
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,560
Why am I here?

414
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,430
You asked me to come here.

415
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,190
What?

416
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,680
Me?

417
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,280
Yes.

418
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,710
Why are you lying here alone?

419
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,800
I want to experience

420
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,280
what you did as a kid.

421
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,000
OK,

422
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,190
enjoy yourself here.

423
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:58,830
I'm leaving first.

424
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,470
Hey, wait a minute.

425
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,560
What do you want to do?

426
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,070
Don't move.

427
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,430
Listen.

428
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,590
There are two men in black over the grass.

429
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,680
After I let go of you,

430
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,000
rush to Yizhuang.

431
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,880
No. What will you do?

432
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,040
Don't worry about me.

433
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,470
I can

434
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,310
beat them.

435
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,470
One.

436
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,000
Two.

437
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,190
Three.

438
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,680
Why did you come back?

439
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,640
I can't leave you here.

440
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,710
You're my friend.

441
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,350
It seems that I had seen it somewhere.

442
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,000
Oh, no.

443
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,830
Let's go to save Young Lord.

444
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,070
This man in black

445
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,920
was the spy of the enemy agent who assassinated him back then.

446
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,710
What's wrong? What's the matter?

447
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,560
Are you OK?

448
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,800
I'm all right.

449
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,520
We were assassinated by men in black just now.

450
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,110
She worries about you.

451
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,350
Yes.

452
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,760
I have another major clue.

453
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,710
Brother, listen to me.

454
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,280
Come in first and then tell me.

455
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,350
Brother,

456
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,110
I want to ask you about something.

457
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,590
Go ahead.

458
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,430
You told me before that

459
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,520
you suddenly disappeared

460
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,880
because of the war in Taoyuan City.

461
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,070
Yes.

462
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,470
And you had been assassinated all the time.

463
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,830
After you returned to the capital,

464
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,400
were those assassins caught?

465
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,430
It seems that they were not caught.

466
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,350
After I returned to the capital,

467
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,280
the situation had been stabilized,

468
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,430
so those assassins disappeared again.

469
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,400
Did you find that

470
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,110
they had something unique?

471
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,560
No.

472
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:31,830
What's wrong?

473
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,950
Today I found that

474
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,350
the man in black who assassinated us

475
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,950
was the one I met on the day

476
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,520
when you disappeared eight years ago.

477
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,920
Had you seen the man in black?

478
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,400
Yes.

479
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,430
The copper hand

480
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,110
is the same.

481
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,040
I'm sure of it.

482
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,160
Brother,

483
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,950
these men in black likely

484
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,760
came to assassinate you again.

485
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,880
You must be careful.

486
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,680
But I feel strange.

487
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,040
Now that those men in black are the enemies,

488
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,800
they should assassinate you,

489
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,160
the young lord.

490
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,640
Why did they always hinder

491
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,800
and assassinate us

492
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,040
in the previous cases?

493
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,520
Do they have anything to do with us?

494
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:14,950
Well,

495
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,470
I don't know why, either.

496
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,230
We can't stay here for long.

497
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,520
We should go back to the southern city

498
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,760
as soon as possible.

499
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,110
Then I'll order more subordinates to find it out.

500
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,280
You go back first.

501
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:37,760
OK.

502
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,640
Be careful.

503
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,590
Don't stay inside.

504
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,710
Apply medicine to my wound.

505
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:36,920
Wumeng,

506
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,760
you shouldn't act without my permission.

507
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,680
Why didn't you allow me to kill Sanqi?

508
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,710
You also heard that

509
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,070
she had seen the men in black eight years ago.

510
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,520
If she is still alive,

511
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,350
he won't feel relieved.

512
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,110
Don't force me in the name of him.

513
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,160
Only I am your master.

514
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,000
Young Lord,

515
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,680
will you really

516
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,230
give up everything

517
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,160
for a woman, Tian Sanqi?

518
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:03,880
Have you

519
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,950
forgotten your mission?

520
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,350
You're just a bodyguard.

521
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,640
How dare you talk to me like this!

522
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,560
Well,

523
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,830
it turns out that

524
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,000
you only treat me

525
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,920
as a bodyguard

526
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,000
and subordinate, right?

527
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,950
I have accompanied you and

528
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,350
tried my best to protect and serve you

529
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,470
for so many years,

530
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,000
but you always ignore me.

531
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,230
Tian Sanqi

532
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,350
only appeared in your life

533
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,470
for a little time

534
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,350
eight years ago,

535
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,710
but you remember her all the time.

536
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,230
Is she superior to me?

537
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,280
She is different.

538
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,760
She is different from others.

539
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,640
Men in black assassinated you?

540
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,430
Are you OK?

541
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,800
Fortunately, Zhao Cuo was sharp-witted.

542
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,880
Then we worked together

543
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
to drive them away.

544
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,470
Don't worry.

545
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,160
Don't believe her.

546
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,190
I fought with them alone.

547
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,400
Don't argue about it.

548
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,160
Did you catch

549
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,680
the men in black?

550
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,230
No.

551
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,640
But I found a major clue.

552
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,760
One of the men in black

553
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,160
is the one who assassinated brother

554
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,830
eight years ago,

555
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,190
so we doubt that

556
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,400
the men in black are actually the enemy agents.

557
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,880
Enemy agents?

558
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,590
The target of enemy agents

559
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,680
should be Young Lord.

560
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,640
They always hindered us

561
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,590
from finding out the cases

562
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,110
and assassinated Zhao Cuo.

563
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,950
Zhao Cuo was a dude

564
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,830
and had enemies everywhere,

565
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,400
but now he has restrained himself.

566
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,350
Just Face,

567
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,640
it's not time to make sarcastic comments.

568
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,680
You would better recall carefully

569
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,310
whether you offended

570
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,400
some powerful and influential people

571
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,230
as a dude these years.

572
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,950
Then we can find out these people

573
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,430
by following this clue.

574
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,310
Well,

575
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,880
come over.

576
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,040
I'll only tell you.

577
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,000
Don't call me dude.

578
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,590
Otherwise, I'll break your teeth and send them to Bai's Mansion.

579
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,430
I just want to solve this case.

580
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,110
Why did you want to

581
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,400
drive me away?

582
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,350
Last night,

583
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,230
I carefully recalled

584
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,800
the cases about men in black

585
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,230
and found something that

586
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,800
was always ignored by us before.

587
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,160
That is, the victims in these cases

588
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,470
were all 18-year-old young men from Shifang Village.

589
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,070
Those who were killed by Qin Fang by taking advantage of

590
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,400
the plague in Baifang County

591
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,230
were just 18-year-old young men from Shifang Village.

592
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,470
In the case of Gui Jianchou,

593
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,430
Gui Jianchou also killed

594
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,000
many 18-year-old young men

595
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,520
from Shifang Village.

596
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,000
Did these men in black

597
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,190
want to take advantage of them

598
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,160
to kill all 18-year-old young men from Shifang Village?

599
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,710
It makes sense.

600
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,280
In Leimo's case,

601
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,040
the mysterious men she mentioned

602
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,280
should be these men in black.

603
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,640
Why?

604
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,470
It's hard for common people to get

605
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,280
the datura stramonium used by Leimo

606
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,710
and Biluo Root used by Qin Fang.

607
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,190
I think

608
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,430
both of them were provided by the men in black.

609
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,590
Zhao Cuo,

610
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,190
had you been to Shifang Village

611
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,710
before you came to the southern city eight years ago?

612
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,280
Or did you

613
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,760
live in Shifang Village?

614
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,710
No.

615
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,230
Their purpose is noticeable.

616
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,230
Assassinate me.

617
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,640
Then take the opportunity to attack Taoyuan City.

618
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,280
Now the most important thing is that

619
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,830
you must go back to the capital with me as soon as possible.

620
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,590
Don't stay here for long.

621
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,560
If you're their only target,

622
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,430
why did they always kill

623
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,760
18-year-old young men in Shifang Village?

624
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:30,800
What's more,

625
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,400
why did they assassinate Zhao Cuo?

626
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,280
I don't think it's so simple.

627
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,160
We must take this opportunity to find out the truth.

628
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,400
The force behind the men in black

629
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,760
has gone beyond your imagination.

630
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,400
As a girl,

631
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,000
don't take the risk of

632
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,710
going on finding it out.

633
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,160
I'll deal with this thing

634
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,400
after we return to the capital.

635
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,000
Leave it to me.

636
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,520
But…

637
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,280
Stop talking.

638
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,040
Leave it aside.

639
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,950
I'll dispatch more subordinates

640
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,710
to protect Zhao Cuo and others.

641
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,230
Sanqi,

642
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,640
just believe Young Lord.

643
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,800
Leave it to him, OK?

644
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:12,880
Resign?

645
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,430
Resign?

646
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,640
Yes.

647
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,350
I've decided to resign and retire from the world.

648
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,830
Cuo,

649
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,280
you must go with me.

650
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,560
Dad,

651
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,350
what's wrong with you?

652
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,950
Are you ill?

653
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,470
Tell me

654
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,430
why you want to resign.

655
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,680
Well,

656
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,590
why not?

657
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,110
I'm tired of intrigues

658
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,880
and conflicts

659
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,520
in the officialdom,

660
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,760
so I want to be a farmer in our hometown.

661
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,640
What's wrong?

662
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,310
Can't I do it?

663
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,310
Yes, you can.

664
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,040
The Chinese cabbages we got from others

665
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,950
during those days when you were treated as a fatuous officer

666
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,350
were sufficient for us for some years,

667
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,710
but you didn't want to resign.

668
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,350
You must be so strange for something.

669
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,040
Tell me why, dad.

670
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,110
Well, no why.

671
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,160
For me,

672
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,800
the fame and fortune in the officialdom

673
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,680
are as transient as a fleeting cloud.

674
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,920
I just want to safely go back

675
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,110
to live as a farmer

676
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,760
and spend my remaining years in comfort

677
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,830
with you and Ling.

678
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,110
I just come to inform you.

679
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,950
Do as I require.

680
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,710
Well,

681
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,680
now Master must want to resign

682
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,070
for something.

683
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,040
There must be a big conspiracy

684
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,880
behind the men in black,

685
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,920
and this conspiracy

686
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,230
maybe has something to do with brother

687
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,880
and Zhao Cuo.

688
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,560
Brother, what's wrong?

689
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,070
Dad wrote to ask us

690
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,880
to go back home as soon as possible.

691
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,680
What's wrong?

692
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,040
My father is dying.

693
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,070
We must go back immediately.

694
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,000
Yeah.

695
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,520
It's been a long time since we came here.

696
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,710
Ruoyao,

697
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,040
Sanqi,

698
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,640
get ready for it.

699
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,640
It's time to set out.

700
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,470
Bai, come back with us.

701
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,830
By then

702
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,950
I'll ask my father to allow us to get married.

703
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,110
After you marry me

704
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,760
and my brother marries Sanqi,

705
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,880
he will get better.

706
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,350
OK,

707
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,710
I'll go with you.

708
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,470
Brother, can I do so?

709
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,590
No problem.

710
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,430
I believe that

711
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,190
dad will be happy

712
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,710
when seeing you marrying a good husband.

713
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,430
Maybe he will

714
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,400
get better.

715
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,160
Don't worry.

716
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,190
The heaven rewards the good,

717
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,400
so Lord will get better soon.

718
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,590
Yes.

719
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,280
To be honest,

720
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,160
I was not a filial son.

721
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,110
When my father

722
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,520
was in poor health,

723
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,470
he had asked me to get married soon,

724
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,070
but I always refused him.

725
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Now I'm going to get married.

726
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,430
After you and I return to the capital,

727
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,950
I think my father will be happy.

728
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,800
Let's set out in a few days.

729
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,880
When will we set out?

730
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,280
One day later.
