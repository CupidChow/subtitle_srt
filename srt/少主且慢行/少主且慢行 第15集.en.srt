00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,220
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,060
Episode 15

4
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,360
Hey, be careful.

5
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,759
Hey, move it to the left a little.

6
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,759
Move it to the left a little.

7
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,479
Hey, OK.

8
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:41,950
My Ling,

9
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,479
how do you think of it?

10
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,120
It is OK if it's moved to the right a little bit.

11
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,000
Did you hear?

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,039
My Ling asked you

13
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,229
to move it to the right a little bit.

14
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:50,910
To the right a little bit.

15
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,440
Master,

16
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,509
what are you doing?

17
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:54,680
Sanqi, come here. Come here.

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,590
Come on.

19
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,270
Come here. Come here.

20
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:56,910
Have a look.

21
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,720
Have a look.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,360
What about this plaque?

23
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,660
[The First Lady of Southern City is here.]

24
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,800
Wow, Master.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
I like the name very much.

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,590
Thanks.

27
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,040
You're welcome.

28
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,080
See?

29
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,640
The First Lady of Southern City is here.

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,190
Dad,

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,910
we both live in the room.

32
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,750
You hang the plaque

33
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,320
that reads "The First Lady of Southern City" here.

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,670
I'll lose face.

35
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,190
Don't strike in.

36
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,030
I haven't finished yet.

37
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:26,360
Sanqi.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,800
Look at this.

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,240
Special Assistant of the Southern Taifu Magistrate?

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,470
Right.

41
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,110
I especially designed the position for you.

42
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,110
Later

43
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,600
you will wear the uniform of southern city

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,960
and assist me in solving cases

45
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,160
on the court.

46
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,390
You'll take full charge

47
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,270
if I am absent.

48
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,320
Why are you staring at me?

49
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,550
Please design a position for me.

50
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,600
You want a job as well?

51
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,880
What can you do?

52
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,520
What do you want to do?

53
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,000
You

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,600
just stay home

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,080
to serve both your wife and the child.

56
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,720
Serve the child?

57
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,240
Come on.

58
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,470
Boy,

59
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,240
when will you give me a grandson?

60
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,390
Master.

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,000
Dad,

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,160
I am the First Whirly of Southern City.

63
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,079
You ask me to stay home and serve both my wife and the child

64
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,720
while you appoint her as your special assistant.

65
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
You are shaming me.

66
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,000
My wife can solve cases.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,520
So can I.

68
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,520
I can also

69
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,960
appoint you as the special assistant.

70
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,520
OK. OK. OK.

71
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,190
I think that is OK.

72
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,000
She solves cases

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,160
while you stamp the papers,

74
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,270
so Xiaoling and I can be free.

75
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,800
Very perfect.

76
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,190
I just stamp the papers?

77
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,160
Yes.

78
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,160
What else do you want to do?

79
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,670
My Ling.

80
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,320
Yes?

81
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,750
Time waits for no one.

82
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,520
Let's go for our vacation.

83
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,390
Let's go.

84
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,390
Go.

85
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,270
Whoops.

86
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,440
What a bad dad.

87
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,800
Let's also go.

88
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,240
Go.

89
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,600
My Ling.

90
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,520
Yes?

91
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,080
Are you tired?

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,720
I am not tired.

93
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,550
My Ling,

94
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,550
it is great.

95
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
Since we have Sanqi,

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,480
I can ask her to handle the cases

97
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,320
on the court,

98
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,720
so I can stay with you

99
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,320
wholeheartedly.

100
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,670
Yes.

101
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,390
Why is the lamp on in the study?

102
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,320
Young Master is staying up to check the files.

103
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,790
Li Jia,

104
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,880
why were you so quiet?

105
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,790
You scared us.

106
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,230
Gosh.

107
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,550
Did you hear

108
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,790
what we said just now?

109
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,270
No.

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,480
Hush.

111
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,720
Young Master doesn't allow me to make a sound.

112
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,230
Bye.

113
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,390
Bye.

114
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,200
Gosh.

115
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,230
It is good for him

116
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,790
to have a wife.

117
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,110
Cuo has grown up.

118
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,320
and he is sensible.

119
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,000
He knows to work hard.

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,390
Yeah.

121
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm going to make some midnight snack for him.

122
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,110
No, no, no.

123
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,440
Don't do it.

124
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,880
You said

125
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
that you had gone home

126
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,920
from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m last night,

127
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,920
but some said they saw

128
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,720
you were near the victim's house from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.

129
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,760
And the victim died

130
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,920
from about 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.

131
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,230
Just confess.

132
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,880
Alas.

133
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,640
That's right.

134
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,830
I killed the person.

135
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,200
Busy?

136
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,320
Yes.

137
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,510
Come on.

138
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:58,600
Here you are.

139
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,480
Dad,

140
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,110
why do you have so many waist tags?

141
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,270
What is this?

142
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,270
Deputy Taifu Magistrate?

143
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,950
You don't want it?

144
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,600
I will take it away.

145
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,510
You have given it to me.

146
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,600
You can't take back

147
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,920
what you already gave.

148
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:19,760
Cuo.

149
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,510
You must keep

150
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,320
the waist tag well.

151
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,720
You are not a common person now.

152
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
You must be strict with your job

153
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,830
since you are Deputy Taifu Magistrate.

154
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,230
Don't disgrace me.

155
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't worry.

156
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,480
I definitely won't

157
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,390
disgrace you.

158
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,390
Did you

159
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,000
figure it out?

160
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,350
Cuo,

161
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,950
I was wrong before.

162
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,230
I shouldn't spoil you for nothing.

163
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,950
I saw

164
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,200
you staying up to read files

165
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,070
last night.

166
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,000
I saw

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,760
you solving a case

168
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,040
on the court today.

169
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,920
Cuo,

170
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,270
you have grown up.

171
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,320
Come on.

172
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,790
Let me hug you.

173
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,670
The talent of

174
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,550
Whirly of Southern City has finally been found.

175
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,720
Dad,

176
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,440
you have grown up as well.

177
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,230
Thanks for your waist tag.

178
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,350
Hey.

179
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,640
How many people have missed since this month?

180
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,830
This is the sixth one.

181
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,670
And it is reported by Shifang Village

182
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,760
that four young men aged eighteen have been missing.

183
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,640
And two young men who have been missing

184
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,480
in southern city

185
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,510
are both about eighteen.

186
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,760
Yes.

187
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,480
The missing persons' portraits have been plastered in southern city.

188
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,320
It can barely fit them.

189
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,350
How weird it is.

190
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,070
A group of people disappeared suddenly.

191
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,790
Are they playing a hide-and-seek game?

192
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,270
Your Excellency,

193
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,880
six bodies were found on the outskirts

194
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,720
of the city.

195
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,670
The cause of death was not immediately known,

196
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,510
but all the hearts of the bodies

197
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,440
were dug out.

198
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,110
Digging out the hearts?

199
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,350
This is crazy.

200
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,390
Go.

201
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,040
Let's go back check the bodies.

202
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,670
Gosh.

203
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,200
Sanqi.

204
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:36,840
Sanqi.

205
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,710
How is the case

206
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,880
going?

207
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,030
Well,

208
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,440
the case is said to be more and more magical.

209
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,230
What do they say?

210
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,880
They say

211
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,880
it is done by Heart-eating Nanny.

212
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,840
Heart-eating Nanny?

213
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,440
Who is she?

214
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,550
It is a legend.

215
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,400
It is said that Heart-eating Nanny

216
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,110
is a siren living near southern city.

217
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,910
She takes human hearts

218
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,910
as food

219
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,150
and survives by sucking human yang qi.

220
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,000
She hides in the wild

221
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,550
at daytime

222
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,840
and

223
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,590
goes to the city to kill people at night.

224
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,150
Right.

225
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,470
I heard of

226
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,230
Heart-eating Nanny as well,

227
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,350
but no one has seen her.

228
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,280
I don't believe there is any siren.

229
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,110
Well,

230
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,230
Sanqi.

231
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,400
It doesn't matter if you believe it or not,

232
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,520
but the ordinary people believe it.

233
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,320
The case has been becoming

234
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,590
more and more magical

235
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,960
and weirder.

236
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,080
Everyone is panic

237
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,910
in southern city.

238
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,670
Sanqi,

239
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,550
you take charge of the case.

240
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,520
You are in full charge of it.

241
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,350
Solve it as soon as possible.

242
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,200
I'm leaving.

243
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Yes, Master.

244
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,790
Come and have a look.

245
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,470
The wounds of the bodies

246
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,760
could not have been done by

247
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,550
the siren or the beast,

248
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,520
because the shape of the wound is very regular

249
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,030
and the incision is cut once

250
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,880
with skilled technique.

251
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,320
There are no other wounds

252
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
in the bodies,

253
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,320
which indicates the victims did not struggle before death.

254
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,230
They must be killed after passing out with knockout smoke.

255
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,790
The murder dug out the hearts skillfully

256
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,280
and

257
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,350
he or she is good at cutting,

258
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,030
which means it must have been premeditated.

259
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,200
This is a serial murder case.

260
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,470
The murderer is so cruel.

261
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,880
If we don't catch him earlier,

262
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,760
he'll kill more people.

263
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,200
I also found these remnants of powder

264
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,640
in the nasal cavity of other bodies.

265
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,280
In my opinion,

266
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
this is the smoke

267
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,400
the murderer used to make the victims pass out.

268
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,280
I have seen it before.

269
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,910
I've read in books

270
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,760
that the smoke is called Seven-Day Drunk.

271
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,910
It means people may be in a coma

272
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,440
for seven days

273
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,080
after taking it.

274
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,320
Four very precious herbs are needed

275
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,350
to make this kind of knockout smoke.

276
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,150
We can start with pharmacies

277
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,840
to check

278
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,400
the herb purchase records of these days.

279
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,910
There might be some clues

280
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,320
and it might narrow down the range of suspects.

281
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,200
That is the only way.

282
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,760
Well, Just Face and I have checked

283
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,030
almost all the pharmacies in southern city,

284
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,710
but we got no clue.

285
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,200
The four herbs are extremely rare.

286
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,640
Now

287
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,470
people seldom take those herbs.

288
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,000
So it appears

289
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,280
that the herbs the murderer purchased

290
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
are not come from pharmacies.

291
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,960
Something happened.

292
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,640
Something happened.

293
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,110
Something happened.

294
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,150
Our yamen is surrounded by people.

295
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,880
What is wrong?

296
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,960
It is said that another person is missing,

297
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,670
so the people came to ask for an answer.

298
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,760
Go. Let's go to check it out.

299
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,320
When can you

300
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
arrest Heart-eating Nanny?

301
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,760
Another person disappeared today.

302
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,470
When will we

303
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,790
lead a peaceful life?

304
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,670
Yes. Yes.

305
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
My fellows in southern city...

306
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,590
You officials

307
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,440
don't deserve our support.

308
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,670
We're on tenterhooks every day.

309
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,350
When do you arrest the murder?

310
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,640
Keep quiet, everyone.

311
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,150
Keep quiet.

312
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,840
Making trouble

313
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,790
can't solve the problem.

314
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,760
The yamen will

315
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,470
certainly find out the murder,

316
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,440
OK?

317
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,200
We must ask for an answer.

318
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,400
We can't feel secure

319
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,840
as long as you don't arrest the murder.

320
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,470
Never listen to the rumor.

321
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,550
Never listen to the rumor.

322
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,710
The murder is not Heart-eating Nanny.

323
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,110
It is a serial murder case.

324
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,080
We will try to find out the murderer.

325
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,030
Bullshit.

326
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,400
Serial murder case?

327
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,110
We heard that

328
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,670
the hearts of the victims were dug out.

329
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,400
It must be eaten by Heart-eating Nanny.

330
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,110
Yes. Yes. Yes.

331
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,000
I saw her before.

332
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,790
I got drunk

333
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,840
and met her

334
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,590
one night.

335
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,880
Gosh.

336
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,670
She

337
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,110
has sharp claws like those of wolf,

338
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,350
a full mouth of sharp teeth

339
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,760
as well as a long tongue.

340
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,590
Gosh.

341
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,280
I was so scared

342
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,590
that I was sober.

343
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,640
I hid behind the tree without moving.

344
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,280
Gosh. I…

345
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,590
Gosh, Master Zhao.

346
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,640
Please work out a way,

347
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,910
otherwise all people in southern city will be eaten soon.

348
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,200
Yes.

349
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,280
Give us an answer.

350
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,030
Be quiet.

351
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,550
I decide to impose a curfew

352
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,320
for the sake of your safety.

353
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,640
from tonight

354
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,110
I will send

355
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,320
some runners and soldiers

356
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,670
to go on patrol in the street.

357
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,320
You

358
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,110
just go back home

359
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,790
and close the windows

360
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,200
as well as the doors.

361
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,110
Don't peek out.

362
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,760
Don't go outside.

363
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,280
Understand?

364
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,280
The curfew will remain

365
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,080
until we arrest the murder.

366
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,910
That's settled.

367
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,400
That's settled.

368
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,590
Master Zhao, don't go.

369
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,110
The curfew will be imposed tonight.

370
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,790
Everybody must close the door

371
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,760
and is forbidden to go out.

372
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,280
The curfew will be imposed tonight.

373
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,760
Everybody must close the door

374
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,670
and is forbidden to go out.

375
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,150
This is the traffic center

376
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,880
of southern city.

377
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,550
Anyone who

378
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,400
wants to do anything

379
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,960
has to go through here.

380
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,640
I don't believe

381
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,670
I can't arrest the murder.

382
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,960
What happened?

383
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,280
What is the sound?

384
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,440
Wedding music.

385
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,030
Who are you?

386
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,400
Don't you know curfew has been imposed at night?

387
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
I am Zhao Ming.

388
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,350
I am the son-in-law

389
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,760
of Doctor Gui Jianchou of Qiandu Hall.

390
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,880
I will go to Qiandu Hall to hold the wedding tonight

391
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,670
by the order of my father-in-law.

392
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,960
I hope you can let us go.

393
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
You can't go even to hold the wedding.

394
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,710
Taifu Magistrate's order was issued today.

395
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,470
It is the first day for the curfew.

396
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,960
Do you want to go against the government?

397
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:07,960
Someone!

398
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,320
Your Excellency!

399
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,710
Arrest him.

400
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,150
How dare you.

401
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,840
Who dares?

402
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,150
Someone!

403
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,440
Arrest them all.

404
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,150
Stop.

405
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,550
Hey, stop. Stop.

406
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,080
Stop.

407
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,550
Stop.

408
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,230
Stop. Stop.

409
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,000
Doctor Gui,

410
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,520
why do you do that?

411
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,150
You know

412
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,280
what happened in southern city these days.

413
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,550
Why do you marry your daughter

414
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,590
on the first day of the curfew?

415
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,110
Hum.

416
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,520
The date and time

417
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,670
of my daughter's wedding

418
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,670
were fixed early.

419
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,030
No matter who comes here,

420
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,080
he can't stop me.

421
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,520
Curfew?

422
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,840
What is curfew?

423
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,790
Well,

424
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,230
Doctor Gui,

425
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,880
can you show me due respect?

426
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,440
Just tell me.

427
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,150
Will you let us go

428
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,030
or not?

429
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,000
How dare you.

430
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,670
Who do you think you are?

431
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,230
Fine.

432
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,150
We'll let you go.

433
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,790
Someone.

434
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,790
Let them go.

435
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,200
Thanks, Your Excellency.

436
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,150
Thanks, Your Excellency.

437
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,590
Let them go. Let them go.

438
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,520
Thanks, Your Excellencies.

439
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,000
Go.

440
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,280
Dad,

441
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,280
you just let him go?

442
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,670
Who is he?

443
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,280
You actually

444
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,320
made such a concession.

445
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,590
Well,

446
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,760
Gui Jianchou is a highly skilled doctor

447
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,960
in southern city.

448
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,520
He was born into a medical family.

449
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,000
He is a genius doctor.

450
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,950
It is said that

451
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,680
he has the skill to bring the dead back to life,

452
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,069
but he is a little cranky.

453
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,280
The poor go to see the doctor for free

454
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,760
in his Qiandu Hall,

455
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,589
while the rich need to pay

456
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,160
a high price

457
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,069
if they go to see the doctor there.

458
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,560
He has a good reputation

459
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,430
among the people of southern city.

460
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,710
I also heard it.

461
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,040
My father turned to him for treatment,

462
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,640
but he was refused.

463
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,070
Gui Jianchou's wife

464
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,470
died when

465
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,280
giving birth to his daughter,

466
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,000
so he treasures

467
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,760
his only daughter very much.

468
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,000
And he is always weird.

469
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,800
We can't stop him

470
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,190
from marrying his daughter today.

471
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,000
Hum.

472
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,560
It is said that

473
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,430
he once cured the lord

474
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,760
in the capital.

475
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,230
We'd better not

476
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,470
offend

477
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:56,710
such a person.

478
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,710
Hum.

479
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,800
That's outrageous.

480
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,040
Calm down. Calm down.

481
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,590
Qiandu Hall.

482
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,280
Xuewei works in this medical hall.

483
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,400
So

484
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,880
there are no good people

485
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,110
in the medical hall.

486
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:12,680
Stop it.

487
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,350
Let's keep guarding.

488
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,800
Go. Go. Go.

489
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,640
Keep guarding. Keep guarding.

490
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,590
Get up.

491
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,680
We found nothing

492
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,280
after guarding for a night.

493
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,800
Well,

494
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,040
let's go to the yamen first.

495
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,160
Have we found out the murder?

496
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,430
Get up. We're going home.

497
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,110
Get up.

498
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,310
Great, Your Excellencies.

499
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,070
You are all still here.

500
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,830
Who are you?

501
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,040
I am an apprentice of Qiandu Hall.

502
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,800
Something happened.

503
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,310
Lady and Mr. Zhao

504
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,680
got married last night.

505
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,400
They both are missing

506
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,760
this morning.

507
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,230
What?

508
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,110
What?

509
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,830
My master doesn't allow me to report to the yamen,

510
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,800
so I sneaked out here

511
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,680
to tell you.

512
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,160
He actually doesn't report to yamen

513
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,230
about his missing daughter and son-in-law.

514
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,920
My master is always like this.

515
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,070
No one can persuade him.

516
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,830
Go.

517
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,040
Let's go to Qiandu Hall to check it out.

518
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,230
You go.

519
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,400
Don't look at me.

520
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,070
He doesn't report it to yamen.

521
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,590
Go.

522
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:29,800
Well.

523
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,760
I'm going back to have a sleep.

524
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,280
It is right here.

525
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,920
The yamen is conducting an investigation.

526
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,400
Open the door.

527
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,070
The hall is closed today.

528
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,950
My master sees no visitors.

529
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,190
Please go back.

530
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,280
Xuewei,

531
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,160
we come here

532
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,710
to investigate the case of

533
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,160
Gui Jianchou's missing daughter and son-in-law.

534
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,520
Please tell him.

535
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,430
It is useless.

536
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,880
My master never likes dealing with the government.

537
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,040
He has his own way.

538
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,160
We don't need the yamen to get involved in it.

539
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,710
He closes the hall

540
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,880
just because he doesn't want to see you.

541
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,430
Nonsense.

542
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,110
He has no right to refuse

543
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,310
since the yamen is investigating cases.

544
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,280
Two persons

545
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,680
are missing

546
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,000
and their lives are uncertain.

547
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,880
The longer time he delays,

548
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,230
the more dangerous his daughter is.

549
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,040
Even if you damn officials all die,

550
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,000
my daughter wouldn't die.

551
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,230
Who are you?

552
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,350
I am Zhao Quandui's son.

553
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,760
My name is Zhao Cuo.

554
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,920
Zhao Quandui's son.

555
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,760
I see your pulse condition is surprising.

556
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,040
It is rare in the world.

557
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,400
Well, what do you mean by that?

558
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,070
It seems

559
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,800
my master agrees to let you deal with the case.

560
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,800
Come in.

561
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,560
Let's go.

562
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,520
What bad temper

563
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,430
of Gui Jianchou.

564
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,520
Gui Jianchou.

565
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,230
This is the room

566
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,800
of Lady and her husband.

567
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,520
Let's start.

568
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,800
There is no sign that the door lock was broken

569
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,680
and the window was opened.

570
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,560
And people outside couldn't come in

571
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,310
because it is locked from inside.

572
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,070
There is no sign of a fight.

573
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,830
Yes.

574
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,760
Our guards didn't hear

575
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,000
anything last night.

576
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,680
Look at this.

577
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,430
This incense smells really strange.

578
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,000
Smell it.

579
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,230
It seems it is the smell of herbs.

580
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,310
It seems white poria.

581
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,920
My master is good at making incense

582
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,520
with a mixture of exotic flowers and herbs.

583
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,230
He made this incense

584
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,680
by himself.

585
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,830
Our Lady had been using it since childhood.

586
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,880
But I've already checked the ash

587
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,950
and there is nothing strange.

588
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,590
Nothing suspicious.

589
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,800
I want to tell you something

590
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
about the case.

591
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,160
But all the people in Qiandu Hall

592
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,560
are my master's spies,

593
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,520
so I can't talk here.

594
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,070
How about

595
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,760
meeting at the pavilion tonight

596
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,560
where we usually went?

597
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:53,950
But

598
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,560
you just can go there alone.

599
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,800
Should we go now

600
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,760
since there's nothing else?

601
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,040
Let's go.

602
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,680
Why is there so much residue of herbs?

603
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,160
Hey, Miss.

604
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,830
Why is there so much residue of herbs

605
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,430
in the yard?

606
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,800
Our Lady used them.

607
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Our Lady was always bedridden

608
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,350
because she was weak and sick.

609
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,190
Luckily her husband

610
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,110
guards and takes care of her

611
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,350
While decocting medicinal herbs.

612
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:46,830
Oh.

613
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,830
Zhao Ming  decoctes the medicinal herbs?

614
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,280
Did Zhao Ming know medicinal herbs?

615
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,350
Of course.

616
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,680
Zhao Ming ran a drugstore.

617
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,230
He delivered all the medicinal

618
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,280
materials of Qiandu Hall.

619
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,070
Well.

620
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,310
It is a pity

621
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,470
that the couple have been taken away

622
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,230
without any news.

623
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,430
I don't know if she can take the medicine on time.

624
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,190
What kind of illness does she suffer?

625
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,880
I don't know.

626
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,710
She suffers lung cancer.

627
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,280
The herbs residue is the secret recipe of Qiandu Hall.

628
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,760
You can't take it away.

629
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,830
Since there are no useful clues

630
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,000
in Qiandu Hall,

631
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,190
let's go back

632
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,590
to yesterday's intersection tonight

633
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,230
and keep looking.

634
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,590
Maybe we can meet Heart-eating Nanny.

635
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,520
I have an appointment tonight.

636
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:44,880
I won't go.

637
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,710
Who will you meet?

638
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,400
What do you want to do?

639
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,880
You won't know her even if I tell you.

640
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,400
For official business.

641
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,800
Hum.

642
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,350
We will know her

643
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,710
if you tell us.

644
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,230
Maybe we are old acquaintances.

645
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,920
Right, Bai Yifei?

646
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,830
Oh.

647
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,160
Don't pretend.

648
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,710
Speak.

649
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,560
Speak.

650
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,040
Oh.

651
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,040
It turns out you have something important at hand.

652
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,830
Well,

653
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,800
just go.

654
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
I will keep guarding

655
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,830
alone tonight.

656
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,590
Bai Yifei.

657
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:25,710
Thank you for

658
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,520
taking care of them.

659
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,760
Hey, Bai Yifei.

660
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,310
How silly you are.

661
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,800
Did I do something wrong?

662
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,760
Nothing.

663
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,230
Just go.

664
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,400
Oh.

665
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,800
Hey, well,

666
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,710
don't you wonder what he's doing?

667
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,950
No.

668
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,430
What if he is going to meet Duan Xuewei?

669
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,230
Didn't you see

670
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,560
they were mysterious?

671
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,430
Never mind.

672
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,590
Oh, you are so generous.

673
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,470
Of course.

674
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,760
Don't you want to follow Zhao Cuo

675
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,560
to check whether he'll meet his ex-lover privately?

676
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,640
Oh.

677
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,880
We shouldn't care about all these about love affair

678
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,950
when dealing with the serious case.

679
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,560
Besides,

680
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,070
I am not stingy and sly, right?

681
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,400
You know me well.

682
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,800
You are here.

683
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,280
Have a seat.

684
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,760
You said you wanted to tell me secret information.

685
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,280
What is it?

686
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,190
Oh.

687
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,470
Actually I want to tell you

688
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,830
my master has other plans.

689
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,830
He said he had known who the murderer was

690
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,640
and he had sent the servants to search for the murderer all around the city.

691
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,160
Who?

692
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,110
My master thought that Zhao Ming took away his daughter.

693
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,400
Zhao Ming?

694
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,230
Why did he take away his wife?

695
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,950
That's a long story.

696
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,920
Zhao Ming's family is engaged in medicinal materials.

697
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,950
The Zhao family had always admired the reputation of Qiandu Hall

698
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,400
and wanted to unite by marriage,

699
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,830
so they could join hands in doing business.

700
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,880
Zhao Ming had also been assiduously pursuing Lady.

701
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,760
But my master thought

702
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,400
that he was only a vain man

703
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,110
so he didn't allow Lady to contact him.

704
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,830
However, Lady was so infatuated with him

705
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,640
that she insisted in marrying him.

706
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,520
Finally, my master asked

707
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,040
Zhao Ming to marry into and live in Qiandu Hall.

708
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,800
Zhao Ming lost face.

709
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,280
So my master thought that Zhao Ming took away Lady

710
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,110
due to a grudge.

711
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,760
There was such a thing.

712
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,280
It seems that

713
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,000
I need to investigate Zhao Ming completely later.

714
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,430
Thanks.

715
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,800
You are leaving?

716
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,280
Do you have to treat me

717
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,070
in this way?

718
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,070
Xuewei.

719
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,710
I have told you.

720
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,950
Do you still remember the pavilion?

721
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,070
This is where we used to play

722
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,590
when we were kids.

723
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,280
Don't you forget it?

724
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,400
No.

725
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,560
Why do you

726
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,160
keep away from me now?

727
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,590
Don't you want

728
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,040
to tell me anything else

729
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,230
except for the case?

730
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,280
I have told you

731
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,680
we can't go back

732
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,640
since it has been eight years.

733
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,830
Just because of that

734
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,470
stupid He Jinxin?

735
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,400
Can the short time

736
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,470
you two spend together

737
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,470
outweigh the long time

738
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,830
we spent together?

739
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,880
I've fallen in love with her.

740
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,800
I can't love anyone else.

741
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:28,880
Sorry.

742
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:35,880
Fine.

743
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,880
I respect your choice.

744
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,680
Bless you and her.

745
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,640
But I hope

746
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,230
you can often come to see me

747
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,520
in the future.

748
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,520
At least

749
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,590
we can be good friends, OK?

750
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,520
I'm leaving

751
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,310
if there is nothing else.

752
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,190
Come out.

753
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,280
Don't hide.

754
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,800
Tian Sanqi.

755
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,710
I mean you.

756
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,190
Oh, you found me.

757
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,800
You're awesome now.

758
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,470
You dare tail after me.

759
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,470
You heard

760
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,350
what I said in the pavilion.

761
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,070
Yes, clearly

762
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,760
and completely.

763
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,040
Well,

764
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,400
so I don't need to say it again.

765
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:10,680
Go. Let's go home.

766
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,470
If I can't get it,

767
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,640
nobody can get it.

768
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,590
Hey.

769
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,590
Well,

770
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,680
given my knowledge of Sanqi,

771
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,160
she must have been following Zhao Cuo.

772
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,310
Would she fight with Duan Xuewei?

773
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,350
Zhao has clearly said that

774
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,190
he had something serious to do before he went.

775
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,710
It would be so abrupt

776
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,920
for Sanqi to go again.

777
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,950
Do you really think

778
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,230
that Duan Xuewei has anything serious?

779
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,070
She's obviously acting for private gain

780
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,880
to rekindle her relationship with Zhao Cuo.

781
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,880
You are not

782
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,310
Miss Xuewei.

783
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,880
How do you know her idea?

784
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,430
Maybe

785
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,190
she really has something serious.

786
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,920
How can you always speak for others?

787
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,430
Oh.

788
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:12,920
Don't argue with me.

789
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,640
Well,

790
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,040
just keep far away from the girls

791
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,230
who look sweet

792
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,350
later,

793
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:20,880
understand?

794
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,920
Understand?

795
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,560
Ouch. Ouch.

796
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
OK. OK.

797
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,160
Let go. Let go.

798
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,640
Gosh,

799
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,160
how sweet you are.

800
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,190
It seemed Duan Xuewei's plan didn't work.

801
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,710
What?

802
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:45,760
Well,

803
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:49,400
someone said business was important,

804
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,590
but followed her lover secretly.

805
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,350
What did Xuewei say?

806
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,880
She said

807
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,310
Zhao Ming's family is also engaged in pharmacy.

808
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,640
And

809
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,640
Zhao Ming wanted to marry Gui Jianchou's daughter,

810
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,880
but Gui Jianchou didn't like Zhao Ming.

811
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,230
However,

812
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,310
Gui Jianchou's daughter fell in love with Zhao Ming.

813
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,350
Therefore,

814
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,000
Gui Jianchou's daughter is missing now.

815
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,310
He doubted that

816
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,880
Zhao Ming took away his daughter.

817
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,280
Let's go to search for Zhao Ming's home tomorrow.

818
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,350
Search quickly.

819
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:17,630
Come and see.

820
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,870
Is this the knockout smoke found

821
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,389
in the nasal cavity of the dead?

822
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:25,120
That's right.

823
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:33,870
Just Face.

824
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,389
Come and see.

825
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,040
Zhao Ming knows martial arts.

826
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,320
Right.

827
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,120
This sword doesn't look like

828
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,870
the one displaced in an ordinary family.

829
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,230
Look, the blade is chipped.

830
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:50,800
It means

831
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,320
the sword

832
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:52,870
is often used.

833
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,280
So

834
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,080
Zhao Ming is really the murderer.

835
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,600
Go to the pharmacy in Zhao's front yard.

836
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,080
Go.

837
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,230
Shopkeeper.

838
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,520
Wait.

839
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:18,950
Guests,

840
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,120
what herbs do you want?

841
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,040
We are not for herbs.

842
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,190
Show me your purchase order.

843
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,950
Our boss isn't here.

844
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,280
Is your boss Zhao Ming?

845
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,800
Yes.

846
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,150
That's him.

847
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,840
Well,

848
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,000
Taifu Magistrate Yamen is investigating a case here.

849
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Shopkeeper, please show me the purchase order.

850
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,630
OK. OK.

851
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,870
Your Excellency, this is the receipt.

852
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,000
Look.

853
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,230
These are the four herbs used to make knockout incense.

854
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,630
He purchased a lot of goods

855
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,870
from other place.

856
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,320
What is up?

857
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,000
Is there any problem?

858
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,190
Shopkeeper,

859
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,080
can we take away the receipt?

860
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,040
Sure. Sure.

861
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,430
Is Zhao Ming really the murderer?

862
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,280
Since the knockout incense was found at his home,

863
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,600
and he also was.

864
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:23,910
good at martial arts,

865
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
so he is very likely to be the murderer.

866
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,120
Come on, everybody.

867
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,360
Tian Sanqi,

868
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,630
how shameless you are.

869
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,000
You not only scramble for my husband from me,

870
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
but also stand together

871
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,190
with him openly.

872
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,280
Do you think she is shameless?

873
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,390
It's you again.

874
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,280
Cuo.

875
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,470
I am He Jinxin.

876
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,470
Don't you know me?

877
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,600
She is a fake.

878
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,360
Shameless.

879
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:46,870
Sanqi, let's go.

880
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,470
Do you know who she is?

881
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,470
Of course we know.

882
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,040
She is the young lady of the Zhao family.

883
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,710
Who are you?

884
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,950
Crazy and stupid.

885
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,760
Hello.

886
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,950
I am the young lady of the Zhao family.

887
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,040
Hey, don't go.

888
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,520
Hey.

889
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,430
Dad,

890
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,840
we have found out the suspect

891
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,800
of the serial killing.

892
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,280
Oh.

893
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,600
Who is it?

894
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,520
The son-in-law of Gui Jianchou,

895
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,080
Zhao Ming.

896
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,000
We found the knockout incense of the crime

897
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,560
in his room.

898
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,560
Dad,

899
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,600
in order to prevent him from committing the crime again,

900
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,120
please send more people

901
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,560
to search for and arrest

902
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,360
Zhao Ming tonight.

903
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:26,870
OK.

904
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,470
I will arrange it.

905
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,000
Someone here.

906
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,080
Don't you think

907
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,000
you have got the clues and evidence of

908
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,320
the case too easily?

909
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,840
I always feel something's wrong.

910
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,040
Do you find something wrong?

911
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,320
Help.

912
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,520
Help me, Cuo.

913
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,120
Heart-eating Nanny is going to kill me.

914
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
What?

915
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,800
Cuo.

916
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,840
Help me.

917
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,230
I don't want to die.

918
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,230
This is Zhao Ming's handwriting.

919
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,190
Dad,

920
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,190
Zhao Ming actually acts recklessly

921
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,320
and audaciously.

922
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,760
Under officials' noses,

923
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,230
he even wants to kill the witness.

924
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,280
Arrest him quickly.

925
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,760
OK.

926
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,870
I will arrange it at once.

927
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,000
Polygala tenuifolia, radix pseudostellariae and white poria

928
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,230
are not included in making incense,

929
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,840
why do they appear

930
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,390
frequently?

931
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:17,910
Bai...

932
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,470
Young Master Bai.

933
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,520
Do you know

934
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,760
what these herbs are used for?

935
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,800
They're for curing palpitations.

936
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,760
Cuo,

937
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,760
you must protect me well.

938
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
I am young and haven't got married.

939
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,430
I don't want to die.

940
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,120
I got it.

941
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,080
Go to sleep.

942
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,710
What are you doing here?

943
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,080
My master said

944
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,560
Zhao Ming would kill someone tonight,

945
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
and sent me to catch him.

946
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,630
I'm here to help you.

947
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,950
Why isn't Bai Yifei here?

948
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,600
Sanqi and I are enough.

949
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,710
I asked Bai Yifei and He Ruoyao

950
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,800
to help my dad.

951
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,040
Just stay here.

952
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,520
Let me go to check.

953
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,520
What is wrong with me?

954
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,390
What is wrong with you?

955
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,120
You killed He Jinxin

956
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,950
when I was away.

957
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,360
This is what I see

958
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,430
when I come back.

959
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,600
My daughter,

960
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,910
you are so unlucky.

961
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,080
Your husband is robbed by her

962
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,280
and you were murdered by her.

963
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,190
Master Zhao,

964
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,600
please help me.

965
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,430
Calm down.

966
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,120
Stop.

967
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,910
No, no. Stop.

968
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,320
We can talk on the court later.

969
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,840
We can talk on the court later.

970
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,870
You were killed.
