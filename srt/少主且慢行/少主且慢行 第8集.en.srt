[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,900
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,940
Episode 8

4
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,680
I saw his kites in the sky,

5
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,910
so I came here.

6
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,310
I didn't expect they are kept here.

7
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,160
His kites?

8
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,680
Everything here belongs to me.

9
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,720
How come there are his kites?

10
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:52,800
What?

11
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,479
These kites are yours?

12
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:55,950
Yes.

13
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,950
So you drew

14
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,550
the pictures on them?

15
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,680
Yes, I drew them myself.

16
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,160
How could it be possible?

17
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,960
How can you draw the pictures?

18
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:15,960
As the saying goes,

19
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,670
what you think about in the daytime is in your dream at night.

20
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,440
I yearn for you,

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,030
so I can't help doing that.

22
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,190
How could it be possible?

23
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,600
That's impossible.

24
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,630
Why did Zhao Cuo

25
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,110
fly such a kite in the whorehouse that day?

26
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,630
What?

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,240
Zhao Cuo

28
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,630
always likes to damage my reputation.

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
He took my thing to smear me.

30
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,470
He even took it to the whorehouse.

31
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,240
Outrageous!

32
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:45,960
How could it be possible?

33
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,079
That's impossible.

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,079
How could these kites be yours?

35
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,670
All the people in the northern city know that.

36
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,110
So you drew the pictures?

37
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,390
Yes, I drew them myself.

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
I want to ask you a question.

39
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,030
When you were ten years old,

40
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,830
did you meet a very important person?

41
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,030
Why did you ask this question?

42
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,550
When I was ten years old,

43
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,270
I actually met a girl.

44
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,750
We made a promise that

45
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,360
we would be together all our lives.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,520
But...

47
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,470
But what?

48
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,550
But I

49
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,750
may not have connections with her.

50
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,800
I failed to meet her.

51
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,880
Bai Yifei, is everything wrong?

52
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,600
You are the man I'm looking for?

53
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,240
Do you still remember...

54
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,000
No, I promised He Jinxin that

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,110
I wouldn't tell my real identity to others.

56
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,030
Before I figure it out,

57
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,240
I can't make a mistake anymore.

58
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,550
Miss,

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,720
why are you crying?

60
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
Did I say anything wrong?

61
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,190
No.

62
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,800
It's too windy today and the wind blew sand into my eyes.

63
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,360
Well.

64
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,630
I won't disturb you because I've something to do.

65
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,670
Hey.

66
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,720
Disturb?

67
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,800
Not disturbing you

68
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,830
is my tenderness.

69
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,830
Young Master.

70
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,080
Young Master.

71
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,720
What?

72
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,520
Young Lady comes.

73
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,110
You are here.

74
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,110
Yes.

75
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,550
Well.

76
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,510
Let's take a bath.

77
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,270
After that, let's go to sleep.

78
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:31,830
No.

79
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,790
I mean,

80
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,230
let's take a bath and then...

81
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,510
I'm tired.

82
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's begin.

83
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,200
No.

84
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,550
Don't cry.

85
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,640
There's no need to be so touched.

86
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,440
I want to say something.

87
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,830
I want to say something too.

88
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,350
OK.

89
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,600
You say first.

90
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,200
OK.

91
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,670
OK.

92
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
I'll say first.

93
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,320
Since

94
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,160
you shamelessly wanted to marry me,

95
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,950
I'll make your dream come true.

96
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,350
But I'm telling you, don't misunderstand me.

97
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,670
I don't like to owe anyone.

98
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,550
You saved me,

99
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,720
so I should

100
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,640
requite your kindness.

101
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:22,920
But

102
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,640
being my wife, you should obey rules.

103
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,640
From now on,

104
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,790
I can let you follow me,

105
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,110
but you must show due respect for my feelings.

106
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,040
When I ask you to go east, you shouldn't go west.

107
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,159
You can only smile at me in the future.

108
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,950
To other men,

109
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,510
you should be as cold as winter.

110
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,550
Especially to Bai Yifei,

111
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,640
you should treat him like your enemy.

112
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,230
From now on,

113
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,550
mine is yours.

114
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,480
You just need to be wife obediently.

115
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,350
Why are you crying?

116
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:58,880
One more thing.

117
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,640
You can only smirk.

118
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,110
You are not allowed to cry.

119
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,510
Zhao Cuo,

120
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,830
divorce me.

121
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Are you sick?

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Are you out of your mind?

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,270
Didn't you hear what I said just now?

124
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,950
Yes.

125
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,110
But I don't want to

126
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,670
and I can't be your wife anymore.

127
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,230
Why?

128
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,040
Please divorce me.

129
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,070
That kite is not yours

130
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,070
but Mr. Bai's, right?

131
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,600
Right.

132
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,640
What about the grimace totem?

133
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,200
Wait. What time is it now?

134
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,600
Why are you still talking about the stupid kite

135
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,350
and grimace totem?

136
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,110
What?

137
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,950
Because of those two things,

138
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,200
you, you, you are going to marry

139
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,760
Bai Yifei?

140
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,000
You still think you are in the right?

141
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,070
Why did you play tricks on me?

142
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,040
You liar!

143
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,830
If you didn't cheat me,

144
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,920
how could I marry you

145
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,480
without knowing the truth?

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,760
Because of you,

147
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,320
my life is all messed up.

148
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,440
No. Because of you,

149
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,320
my, my life is messed up.

150
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,200
I'm telling you.

151
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,320
I'm the whirlwind in the southern city. What do you think of me?

152
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,880
After sleeping here with me, you want to leave?

153
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,670
Huh!

154
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,760
After sleeping?

155
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,790
Who slept with you?

156
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,920
Don't talk nonsense.

157
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,720
It's just a metaphor.

158
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,270
Idiot, fool, and blockhead!

159
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,160
You are an idiot, fool, and blockhead!

160
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,200
Are you feeling proud when you are talking loud?

161
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,720
Huh!

162
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,230
I declare, from today on,

163
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,950
I will never be bullied by you again.

164
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,270
If you don't divorce me, fine.

165
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,830
I'm running away from home.

166
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,510
What?

167
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,550
In the dead of night,

168
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,760
are you going to meet Bai Yifei?

169
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,390
I'm telling you.

170
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,200
As a married woman,

171
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,350
you are going to meet another man at this point.

172
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,110
I'm telling you. You are

173
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,040
a woman of loose morals.

174
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,920
I'm not going to meet him.

175
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,600
Moreover,

176
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm not your wife anymore.

177
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,950
You have no right to control me.

178
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,159
See you.

179
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,110
Right. OK.

180
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,390
Go then.

181
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,670
Anyway, your dad who is greedy for money

182
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,110
will you send you back.

183
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,230
You are penniless.

184
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,760
you definitely will tramp the streets.

185
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,820
You jinx!

186
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,480
How dare you look down on me?

187
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,110
I'm telling you.

188
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,920
I won't come back to you even if I starve to death.

189
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,110
Bye-bye.

190
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,200
I will never meet you again!

191
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,070
Hey.

192
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,600
Hey.

193
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,000
Hey.

194
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,950
I will never meet you again.

195
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,350
I can't return to Yizhuang.

196
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,040
What if they are waiting to catch me and make me get married?

197
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,640
I can't go to He's Mansion.

198
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
What?

199
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,880
She left?

200
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,400
Yes.

201
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,910
You quarreled last night?

202
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,440
Yes.

203
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,150
You shouldn't.

204
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,320
Didn't you pull up all the roses in the garden

205
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,640
to have a bath with the pedals?

206
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,960
Oh dear.

207
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,200
Can any woman resist

208
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,470
such an extremely romantic scene?

209
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,760
Let her go.

210
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,640
I'm happy.

211
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,080
Are you happy?

212
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,590
Yes.

213
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,080
How happy are you?

214
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,280
Very happy.

215
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,710
Then show me.

216
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,670
Since you are happy,

217
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,910
just let her go.

218
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,320
Even if she tramps the streets,

219
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,440
with no money to go home,

220
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,350
with no money for food,

221
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,230
comes across bad men,

222
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,000
and is cheated,

223
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,200
sold to a brothel,

224
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,880
and beaten to death by the people there,

225
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,520
that's her own choice.

226
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:29,760
Right?

227
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,640
No.

228
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,440
Son,

229
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,910
hurry to find her.

230
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,380
Li Jia!

231
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,670
Roast chicken, rice in lotus leaf, and duck legs.

232
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,520
If I didn't leave home,

233
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,960
I would have pig knuckle in brown sauce, steamed chicken with chili sauce,

234
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,640
pork with preserved vegetable and steamed spareribs with rice flour.

235
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,110
No.

236
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,000
Sanqi, you should be tough.

237
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,640
Don't think about it.

238
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,280
Yes.

239
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,520
Master.

240
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,030
Yes.

241
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,760
Mr. Liu wants to resign.

242
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,080
Which Mr. Liu?

243
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,790
The coroner.

244
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,840
Mr. Liu wants to resign?

245
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,550
Huh?

246
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,080
Why?

247
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,760
I heard

248
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,470
His grandson was just born,

249
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,640
so he wants to resign and return to his hometown.

250
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,840
Oh dear.

251
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,200
My daughter-in-law wants to leave.

252
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,640
Mr. Liu wants to leave too.

253
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,790
Now only those who haven't finished their apprenticeship

254
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,000
and who are clumsy are left.

255
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,960
How will I solve cases?

256
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,520
Hey.

257
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,910
Go out to put up a notice,

258
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,640
saying I want to hire a coroner with high salary.

259
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,670
Why am I here?

260
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,710
Alas.

261
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,400
Why is there nobody

262
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,590
throwing Chinese cabbage at the gate of the government office?

263
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,440
It seems I'm late.

264
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,710
Come. The government office needs to recruit a coroner.

265
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,960
The salary is 50 taels of silver.

266
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,790
Come and take a look.

267
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,790
Young Lady,

268
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,910
you are back.

269
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,520
Please get in.

270
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,200
I, I, I'm not back.

271
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,710
Huh?

272
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
You won't come back?

273
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,140
Then what are you doing here?

274
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,520
Applying for the job.

275
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,880
Huh?

276
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,440
That's not easy.

277
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,760
Such a group of talents gather here.

278
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,080
Your Excellency,

279
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,000
it seems that nobody else will come.

280
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,400
Yes.

281
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,150
Let's begin.

282
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,880
There are four bodies in front of you.

283
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,200
The one who can find the causes

284
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,470
of the dead fastest and most accurately

285
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,660
will be recruited.

286
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,550
Let's begin now.

287
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,150
You first.

288
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,910
This person was perhaps

289
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,150
drowned.

290
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,320
Yes, he was drowned.

291
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,640
Next one.

292
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,790
Waa cha!

293
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,960
Next one.

294
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,710
Hee-hee. Hee-hee.

295
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,910
Next one.

296
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,110
Alas.

297
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,350
Wait.

298
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,400
Me. Me.

299
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:51,910
Jinxin,

300
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,400
you are back.

301
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,020
Oh dear.

302
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,960
Why are you here?

303
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,520
She saw the notice

304
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,320
and specially came here to...

305
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,590
To do what?

306
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,110
To apply for the job.

307
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,670
Are you mad?

308
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,280
Are you mad?

309
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,400
No, I'm not mad.

310
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,350
Through the case about Leimo,

311
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,880
you already knew my strength.

312
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,840
Yes, yes.

313
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,150
I know your strength.

314
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,760
But, but you are a girl.

315
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,150
Look at the job you are applying for.

316
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,520
It's dirty, smelly, and...

317
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,320
If you really want to work,

318
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,710
Occasionally,

319
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,110
you can go with me to investigate into cases.

320
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,280
All professions are equal.

321
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,520
I'm not afraid of hardships.

322
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,200
I just want to prove that I can support myself

323
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,590
and I'm useful.

324
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,640
Moreover,

325
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,030
you didn't say that

326
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,110
a woman cannot be recruited.

327
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,200
Congratulations.

328
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,080
You became the first woman coroner

329
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,840
of the government office of the southern city.

330
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,550
Wow! Great!

331
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,080
Thank you, Father.

332
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,320
No,

333
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,440
thank you, Your Excellency.

334
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:54,840
But, Your Excellency,

335
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,640
I have a small request.

336
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,030
Your Excellency, I'm leaving.

337
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,960
Come here.

338
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,110
Jinxin, what is it?

339
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,350
Your Excellency,

340
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,350
Can a month's salary be advanced to me?

341
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,280
I'm short of money.

342
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,710
Ah, Jinxin,

343
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,710
The government also faces financial problems.

344
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,350
Besides,

345
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,230
I can't open the back door for you, right?

346
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,840
Only ten taels.

347
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,150
Jinxin,

348
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,440
you are my subordinate

349
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,880
as well as my daughter-in-law.

350
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,080
Talking about money hurts feelings.

351
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,350
Seven taels.

352
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,110
Five taels.

353
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,080
Six taels. You can't say less than that.

354
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,400
Five taels, OK? If no, forget it.

355
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,520
Deal.

356
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,520
I'm always poor.

357
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,280
Jinxin?

358
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,150
I've got something to do and I'm leaving.

359
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,960
Let's talk later.

360
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,910
A kite is flying in the sky.

361
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,840
Someone on the ground is chasing it.

362
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,550
Miss He, you

363
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,710
always leave like the wind.

364
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,030
How to be a good official?

365
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,470
Didn't you say

366
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,910
I would starve to death outside?

367
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,150
Don't you look down on me?

368
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,960
Even if you divorce me,

369
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,440
I can support myself.

370
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,640
I absolutely won't live on the streets.

371
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,350
Hurry, sign on the divorce letter.

372
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,080
Let's separate and go different ways.

373
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,470
Yes.

374
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,080
Exactly the same.

375
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,520
I've thought about it.

376
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,760
I'll definitely divorce you

377
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,670
provided that I raise you till you are 50 years old.

378
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,230
By that time, you will be old and ugly.

379
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,710
Hmm.

380
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,880
Will Bai Yifei still love you?

381
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,790
Wait. I haven't finished yet.

382
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,910
By that time,

383
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,320
I'll find a 18-year-old girl

384
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,230
to serve me.

385
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,640
Perfect.

386
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,320
You...

387
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,000
Humph!

388
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,110
Hey.

389
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,790
I won't divorce you. Bite me!

390
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,840
Stupid Zhao Cuo! Bad Zhao Cuo!

391
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,680
Do you think I can't do

392
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,829
anything to deal with you?

393
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,589
Humph!

394
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,040
Humph!

395
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,710
Luckily, I have...

396
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,829
No wonder my mom said

397
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,920
women should have money at any time.

398
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,560
If we have money,

399
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,190
men naturally won't act like a tyrant.

400
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,589
I learned it.

401
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,040
Man,

402
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,640
we've been waiting all night.

403
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,830
Zhao Cuo hasn't come out.

404
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:43,950
Right?

405
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,590
I think

406
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,920
let's just get in

407
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,230
and directly catch him.

408
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,950
What nonsense are you talking about?

409
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,160
Look at the wall.

410
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,190
It's so high.

411
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,830
How can we get in?

412
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:56,920
Shut up!

413
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,070
Talk if you want.

414
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,180
Why did you hit me?

415
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,520
I hit your head

416
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
because I wonder what's in there.

417
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,800
Young Lady.

418
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,400
I've got something to do. Let's talk later.

419
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,950
By the way,

420
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,590
don't call me Young Lady anymore.

421
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,350
I'm free!

422
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,350
Yay! Yay! Yay!

423
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,230
Young Lady.

424
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,470
Young Lady.

425
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,040
Bye-bye.

426
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,000
No way.

427
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,470
She's leaving home again.

428
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,000
Young Master.

429
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,520
Young Master!

430
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,230
Oh dear! Young Master.

431
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,070
Why did I come to the southern city again?

432
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,040
I've known that sadness is always inevitable.

433
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,680
Why am I so devoted?

434
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,280
Since it is destined that we won't be together,

435
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,520
I won't bother her anymore.

436
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,400
Wait.

437
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,950
You are carrying such a heavy sack.

438
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,190
I wonder what's inside.

439
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,520
A pig which was just slaughtered.

440
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,190
We'll sell it in the market in the morning.

441
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,710
Oh.

442
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,070
Since it's hard for you to carry it,

443
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,310
how about I give you a hand?

444
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,710
No, no, no.

445
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,310
We can do this on our own.

446
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,800
I can manage my own thing.

447
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,310
No, thanks.

448
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,710
Oh.

449
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,350
You are congenitally disabled,

450
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,800
but you are tough enough

451
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,000
to fight against fate.

452
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,400
That's really striking to me

453
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,950
and inspired me a lot.

454
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,430
If so,

455
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,400
go as you please.

456
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,400
Then, we're leaving.

457
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,680
You have my best wishes.

458
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:11,710
Where is she?

459
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,040
She went outside, carrying a bag on her back.

460
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,310
I, I don't know where she is.

461
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,710
Didn't you try to stop her?

462
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,310
Young Master, you can't deal with Young Lady.

463
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,160
What can I do?

464
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,470
You...

465
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,310
Hey, Righteous Face,

466
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,760
why are you here again?

467
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,920
I have something to say.

468
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,350
I have nothing to say to you.

469
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,070
Go now!

470
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,350
You are not the one I want to talk to.

471
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,560
I want to talk to Jinxin.

472
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,040
You...

473
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,000
You are really shameless.

474
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,230
My wife is warming the bed for me.

475
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,230
What?

476
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:53,760
Oops.

477
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,560
What?

478
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,070
You are unhappy?

479
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,640
You are angry?

480
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,190
Just be angry.

481
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,520
My wife is good to me every day.

482
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,310
She often

483
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,230
washes clothes,

484
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,920
cooks dishes, and makes soup for me.

485
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,350
And then she warms the quilt for me.

486
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,800
Before going to sleep, she gives me a goodnight kiss.

487
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:07,830
She is so obedient.

488
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,430
Zhao Cuo.

489
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,430
What?

490
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,680
You don't need to

491
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,430
make things difficult for her in all aspects because of me.

492
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,350
She is a good girl.

493
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,830
Well. What are you talking about?

494
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,520
Who do you think you are?

495
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,950
I make things difficult for her because of you?

496
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,640
Young Master, don't argue with him.

497
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,880
Young Lady left home.

498
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,920
Let's go to find her.

499
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,710
She left home?

500
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,070
Jinxin!

501
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,710
Young Lady!

502
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,000
Li Jia.

503
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,520
Yes?

504
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,590
When did Jinxin leave?

505
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,830
Where did you see her at the last time?

506
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,040
She had left before you came.

507
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,590
She went this way.

508
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,920
This way?

509
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,400
Yes.

510
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,280
I came here from this way just now.

511
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,000
Did you see her?

512
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,520
No.

513
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,590
I saw two people

514
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,590
carrying a pig in a sack.

515
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,880
Oh no!

516
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,400
Hurry!

517
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,040
Young Master,

518
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,430
this is the purse of Young Lady.

519
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
Oh no. Young Master,

520
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,470
is the pig Mr. Bai mentioned

521
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,800
just now...

522
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,230
Oh no!

523
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,280
This is her personal item.

524
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,880
Normally she wouldn't lose it.

525
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,470
I'm to blame.

526
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,560
It turns out that these bandits don't want money,

527
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,000
but...

528
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,520
Stop.

529
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,400
Don't scare yourself.

530
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,640
Those two bandits carrying that pig,

531
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,110
no,

532
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,070
Jinxin,

533
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,880
definitely won't be far away.

534
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,640
Li Jia,

535
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,280
dispatch a troop to lock down the city.

536
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:46,800
OK.

537
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,400
Let's continue to chase them.

538
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,640
You caught Zhao Cuo?

539
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,310
Boss.

540
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,950
I didn't catch Zhao Cuo this time,

541
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,520
but

542
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,560
I caught his wife.

543
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,070
Take a look.

544
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,040
Are you the wife of Zhao Cuo?

545
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,680
Yes.

546
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,160
Who are you?

547
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Good.

548
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,280
What are you laughing about?

549
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,520
In his dream.

550
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,710
I'm not his wife.

551
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,190
I

552
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,070
am Zhao Cuo's grandpa.

553
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,110
What drug did you use?

554
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,880
Wake her up!

555
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Grandpa.

556
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,590
What's this smell?

557
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,230
It stinks.

558
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,000
Ah!

559
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,950
Who are you?

560
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,470
What do you want?

561
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:13,950
Shut up!

562
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,680
Be quiet.

563
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,000
I'll ask you.

564
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,640
Answer me honestly.

565
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,430
Don't talk nonsense.

566
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,800
If you talk nonsense, I'll beat you.

567
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,400
Are you the wife of Zhao Cuo

568
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,230
and the young lady of the He family?

569
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,680
You nod and shake your head. Yes or no?

570
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,590
It doesn't matter.

571
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,040
You came out from the Zhao mansion.

572
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,430
And you are wearing an official uniform.

573
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,070
You're on Zhao Cuo's side

574
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,470
Boss,

575
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,640
so you want to catch

576
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,710
Zhao Cuo, that bully.

577
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,430
What a coincidence!

578
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,160
I'm telling you.

579
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,310
I also have a grudge against him.

580
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,710
Go kill him tonight.

581
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,590
I support you.

582
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,160
By the way,

583
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,160
I know how to sneak into the Zhao mansion.

584
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,590
How about this?

585
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,520
Let's sneak into the house tonight

586
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
and kill him together.

587
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,000
How about it?

588
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,560
Originally,

589
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,310
I was not sure.

590
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,710
After you said that...

591
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,280
Are you playing a trick on me?

592
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:33,830
Right?

593
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,680
You are trying to cover Zhao Cuo, right?

594
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,430
We didn't catch Zhao Cuo.

595
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,310
Then you are the substitute.

596
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,880
One life for one life.

597
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,760
If Zhao Cuo wants you to go back,

598
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,160
he must come here to die tomorrow.

599
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,520
Send this to the Zhao mansion.

600
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,280
Ask Zhao Cuo to come here alone.

601
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,070
If he doesn't come,

602
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,280
let's kill his wife.

603
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,040
OK.

604
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,640
No.

605
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,800
Come back! Come back!

606
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,920
I have...

607
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,800
I have nothing to do with Zhao Cuo.

608
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,000
Even if you use me to threaten him,

609
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,800
it will be useless.

610
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,000
Young Master.

611
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,280
There is still no news

612
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,590
about Young Lady.

613
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,830
Alas.

614
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,430
I'm to blame.

615
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,040
If I was careful,

616
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,400
Jinxin wouldn't have been taken away.

617
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,070
Shut up!

618
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,520
Jinx.

619
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,710
She is smart.

620
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,190
She must be playing tricks on them at this moment.

621
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,310
She definitely will be fine.

622
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,310
The commander's tally of the northern city?

623
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,430
To save her is the most important.

624
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,470
Regardless of north and south.

625
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,070
OK.

626
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,070
Just Face, you are gifted with an extraordinary retentive memory.

627
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,950
Draw pictures of the bandits.

628
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,590
Li Jia, take the tally to the northern city.

629
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,400
Let's spread a net from which there is no escape

630
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,640
for the bandits.

631
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,680
OK. I'm leaving.

632
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,820
Watch out.

633
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,430
Her handkerchief.

634
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,710
The southern city's General Mountain. The warehouse in the old temple in the south.

635
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,800
Come here alone, or He Jinxin will be killed.

636
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,110
Well.

637
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,000
What is the letter about?

638
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,430
What are you laughing about?

639
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Jinxin

640
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,280
wrote a letter to me

641
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,760
and gave me her handkerchief.

642
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,920
It says

643
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,190
waving a handkerchief,

644
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,920
without,

645
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,760
without taking away a cloud.

646
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,430
We'll never meet each other again.

647
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,520
She is upset with me.

648
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,680
She is upset?

649
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,640
If she is upset,

650
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,000
why did she disappear suddenly?

651
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,710
She could write a letter.

652
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,000
But why is there an arrow here?

653
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,040
Jinxin is not reckless.

654
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,590
You don't understand.

655
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,110
This is our little hobby.

656
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,590
Well.

657
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,590
Hurry back to catch up with Li Jia

658
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,110
and ask him to withdraw the troops.

659
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,760
When all the soldiers of both the southern city and the northern city are mobilized,

660
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
will it really be something fun?

661
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:38,920
What are you going to do?

662
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,400
I'm going back to sleep.

663
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,590
Go to bed early too.

664
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,590
A little hobby?

665
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,070
Oh no. I fell into the trap.

666
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,400
Giddyap!

667
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,470
Giddyap!

668
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:38,710
Giddyap!

669
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,230
Get up!

670
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:49,880
Get up!

671
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,400
Get up!

672
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,590
Get up!

673
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,470
Get up!

674
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,640
Boss,

675
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,760
I really have nothing to do with Zhao Cuo.

676
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,070
Look. It's been so long.

677
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,160
But he hasn't come yet.

678
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,040
It's enough to prove what I said before is true.

679
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,560
It's no use tying me here.

680
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,280
How about you let me go?

681
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,950
You can leave here alive

682
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,710
only after

683
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,470
Zhao Cuo comes here.

684
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:37,070
Actually, I was a girl with a tough life.

685
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:41,000
What's wrong again?

686
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:54,190
Let go of me!

687
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,800
What's wrong again?

688
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,000
Why are you crying?

689
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,920
Well.

690
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,350
Actually,

691
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,470
I am the wife of Zhao Cuo.

692
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,430
I am not.

693
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,640
I married into the Zhao mansion

694
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,880
instead of He Jinxin.

695
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,350
I'm the daughter of the Tian family

696
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,000
in Yizhuang, Shifang Village and my name is Tian Sanqi.

697
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,800
Miss He has long had someone she loves,

698
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,350
so she is unwilling to marry Zhao Cuo.

699
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,000
So she made a deal with me

700
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,040
and asked me to disguise myself as her to marry into the Zhao mansion.

701
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,520
So she is not the wife of Zhao Cuo. Great.

702
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,590
But after I married Zhao Cuo,

703
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,040
he makes things difficult for me

704
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,640
and treats me worse than the way he treats a servant girl.

705
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,470
A few days ago, he discovered my identity,

706
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,680
so he drove me out of the Zhao mansion.

707
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,160
Look at that package.

708
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,830
I took it with me when I was driven out by him.

709
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,070
Men are all bad guys.

710
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,710
Of course,

711
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,000
you are heroes of the greenwood.

712
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,190
In my view,

713
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,280
you hate evil as your enemy and are no common-looking.

714
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,400
If you don't mind,

715
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,160
I, Tian Sanqi,

716
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,280
am willing to follow you

717
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,190
and become a hero

718
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,470
like you.

719
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,590
Well.

720
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,560
You said you are the daughter of the Tian family in Shifang Village.

721
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,760
Do you have any evidence?

722
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,950
Boss,

723
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,190
you can inquire about it in Shifang Village.

724
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,880
I'm well-known in my village.

725
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,560
Everybody knows me.

726
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,830
I respect you so much.

727
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,070
How could I cheat you?

728
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,560
You, untie the rope for her.

729
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,949
Thank you.

730
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,760
After I go home and visit my parents,

731
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,280
I'll come back to you. See you.

732
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,630
What are you doing?

733
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,120
Where are you going?

734
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,389
Did I allow you to leave?

735
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:35,909
Then why did you untie me?

736
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,630
Although

737
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,190
you are not the wife of Zhao Cuo,

738
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,949
and presumably Zhao Cuo won't come.

739
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,190
you have already

740
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,800
seen our appearances,

741
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,800
so according to the rules,

742
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,360
we can't let you go.

743
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,040
But don't worry.

744
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,429
After killing you,

745
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,630
we'll go and kill

746
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,600
Zhao Cuo

747
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,910
and let him accompany you.

748
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,950
Then you can close your eyes in death.

749
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,670
Kill her.

750
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,430
I...

751
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,560
I can't close my eyes in death.

752
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,120
Why do you hate Zhao Cuo?

753
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,230
Why do you have to kill him?

754
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,430
You don't need to know that.

755
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,910
Understand?

756
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,670
Go on to kill her.

757
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,430
Stop!

758
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,280
You can come to me.

759
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,950
But you are not allowed to bully my woman.

760
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,520
If you dare to bully her again,

761
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,630
I'll let you die without a whole body.
