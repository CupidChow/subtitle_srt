[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:33,300
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,100
Episode Nine

4
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,509
Zhao Cuo, why are you here?

5
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,190
Ah, isn't this Mr. Zhao?

6
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,229
Wait.

7
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,630
You care about this girl so much.

8
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,800
She must be your wife.

9
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,680
You can hurt me, but not my girl.

10
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,400
If you lay a finger on her,

11
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,550
I'll tear you guys apart.

12
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,270
Are you scaring me?

13
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,550
I hear that Mr. Zhao couldn't even fight his way out of a paper bag.

14
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,079
Beat me if you can.

15
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,390
Stop laughing.

16
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,000
Wait! Who's your girl?

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,320
Did I ask you to protect me?

18
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,600
Just go!

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,390
I'm living it up here.

20
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,000
These are my new friends.

21
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,360
Well, well, well.

22
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,750
You stayed out all night

23
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,520
with these jerks,

24
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,800
calling them friends!

25
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,960
Do you know what you will be called by doing this?

26
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,390
You will be called a frivolous

27
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,000
and shameless girl who's lacking in a married woman's virtue!

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,240
What are you talking about?

29
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,800
What do you mean? Huh?

30
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,080
Don't cut in!

31
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,600
Zhao Cuo!

32
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,110
You say I'm lacking in a married woman's virtue?

33
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,030
I beg you to wake up, OK?

34
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,030
We are no longer husband and wife!

35
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,320
Don't be such a jerk!

36
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,030
I haven't signed the certificate of divorce yet,

37
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,880
so you are still my wife.

38
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,630
Show me the certificate of divorce if you can.

39
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,160
Let everyone reason things out, right?

40
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,720
Yes, we need evidence.

41
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,390
Yes!

42
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,000
I announce here

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,720
that I'll divorce you unilaterally!

44
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,360
Who said a divorce has to be brought up by the husband?

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,800
You divorce me unilaterally?

46
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,190
Here, Boss! Judge for yourself!

47
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,110
Has there ever been a time when a woman could divorce her husband?

48
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,470
No?

49
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,630
Attack rebounded! You are still my wife!

50
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,880
Attack rebounded again! Now I'm not!

51
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,960
Attack rebounded again!

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,270
Attack rebounded again! Again! Again!

53
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,880
What the hell? Are you kidding me? Huh?

54
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,240
We are talking about killing you guys!

55
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,270
Can you just react accordingly?

56
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,030
Do you think you are shopping in a wet market?

57
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,320
Where is my sword?

58
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,960
Do you see it?

59
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,600
This is a sword. A real one!

60
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,600
Sir…Sir,

61
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,030
your sword looks so sharp.

62
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,360
Put the sword down.

63
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,160
Let's have a talk.

64
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,030
All right.

65
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,550
Kneel!

66
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,480
No!

67
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,760
I count to three.

68
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,950
You either kneel,

69
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,950
or be a widower.

70
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,550
No, if I show up at this moment,

71
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,160
the gangsters are bound to be angry

72
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,110
and harm Miss Sanqi. Wait a little longer.

73
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:31,880
One.

74
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,830
Zhao Cuo!

75
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,790
I'm on my knees now.

76
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,950
Let her go.

77
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,880
Let her go?

78
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,760
No way.

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,720
It depends on whether you can please us.

80
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,440
Guys, beat him!

81
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,440
Zhao Cuo!

82
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,880
Aren't you a bad ass?

83
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,230
Don't let me laugh at you!

84
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,670
Get up and beat them back!

85
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,790
If I fight back,

86
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,760
I'm afraid they can't take it.

87
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,790
Zhao Cuo, are you all right?

88
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,880
Don't hit him! Don't hit him!

89
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,350
Don't hit him!

90
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,230
Where is your strength? You rubbish!

91
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Zhao Cuo! Stop it!

92
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,510
Let me go! Let me go!

93
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,480
You want to die?

94
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,230
I can do you a favor first.

95
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,320
Stay away!

96
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,350
You are a master of combat.

97
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,600
Why do you pretend not to know martial arts at all?

98
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,600
All right there? Are you hurt?

99
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,230
Do you want me to carry you on my back?

100
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,830
Zhao Cuo, are you OK?

101
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,600
Do your legs hurt? Can you walk?

102
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,480
Ah! It hurts. Ouch!

103
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,950
Oh, my leg is broken.

104
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,159
Hmm, hmm. It hurts so much.

105
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,720
Let's go back home.

106
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,320
How should three people ride on two horses?

107
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,040
Miss Jinxin,

108
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,760
maybe we can ride on the same horse.

109
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,720
Zhao Cuo! Zhao Cuo, are you all right?

110
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,669
Doctor, how's he doing?

111
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,549
Is Zhao Cuo in danger?

112
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,910
His pulse condition is pretty good.

113
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,320
I don't think it's life-threatening.

114
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,080
Hey, Doctor,

115
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,760
why is my son unconscious?

116
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,470
I don't know the reason exactly.

117
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,230
You know what,

118
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,110
I'll give a prescription to have a try.

119
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,640
OK. OK.

120
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,230
Son, please wake up.

121
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,320
Son, if you don't wake up,

122
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
what shall I do?

123
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,520
Son!

124
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,150
You must have suffered a severe head injury,

125
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,550
hence the unconsciousness.

126
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,640
Son, now you must be

127
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,840
struggling between life and death.

128
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,230
Son, you must hang in there.

129
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:44,030
Hey! You! You bold gangsters!

130
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,110
How dare you kidnap people in front of the Taifu Magistrate's place?

131
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,640
I'll just go

132
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,110
and search for the kidnappers.

133
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,200
Ling, Li Jia, let's go!

134
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,440
I'm sorry.

135
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,910
This is all my fault.

136
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,590
I got you into this.

137
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,030
Please wake up.

138
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,280
Deities in heaven,

139
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,760
I beg you.

140
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
As long as you wake him up,

141
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,030
I'll do anything.

142
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,280
You are awake?

143
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,200
Who am I? Where am I?

144
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,230
You are Zhao Cuo, at your home.

145
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,520
Huh?

146
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,000
I was in a very bright place just now.

147
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,880
Then I heard someone said

148
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,670
she would do anything for me,

149
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,350
so I woke up.

150
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,520
The deities must have heard my wish

151
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,640
and sent you back.

152
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,790
Thank goodness.

153
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,230
Hey.

154
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,760
You mean...

155
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,880
You made the wish?

156
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,880
You would do anything for me?

157
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,710
Yeah.

158
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,200
Ah.

159
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,840
My leg! Ah!

160
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,440
I'll go get the doctor!

161
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,910
Come back!

162
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,350
Let me ask you,

163
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,320
if I'm crippled,

164
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,000
will you abandon me?

165
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
I'll devote myself

166
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,200
to taking care of you forever.

167
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
As a wife,

168
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,790
loyalty matters most.

169
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,550
So you're not leaving me?

170
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,550
No, I'll take care of you.

171
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,840
Mr. Bai.

172
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,320
Li Jia, how's your Young Master?

173
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,840
Is he awake?

174
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,840
Yes, he is.

175
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,350
It's just...

176
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,880
Just what?

177
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,350
Oh, it's just he can't walk any longer.

178
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,030
The doctor said he's partially paralyzed.

179
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,590
He can't even get out of the bed.

180
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,640
I'll go to see him.

181
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,150
Huh?

182
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,670
Hey, Mr. Bai! Don't go in!

183
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,150
Our Young Mistress is there!

184
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,150
Hmm.

185
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
Here. Slowly.

186
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,200
Zhao Cuo!

187
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,910
Ah, Bai Yifei!

188
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,440
You came in without knocking on the door?

189
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,960
Forgive my rudeness.

190
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,320
Hearing that you are partially paralyzed,

191
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,550
I became so worried about you that I couldn't control myself.

192
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,590
Thank you for your help yesterday, Mr. Bai.

193
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,550
If you hadn't been there,

194
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,470
Zhao Cuo and I could have died in that cave.

195
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,670
Hmph! Why do you thank him?

196
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,150
You saw it yourself.

197
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,840
I'm Southern city's martial arts master.

198
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,440
Without him in the way, I could beat the hell out of ten men!

199
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,670
Your face

200
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,910
is a mass of bruises right now.

201
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,550
You'd better talk less and rest more.

202
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,080
Bai Yifei,

203
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,110
I think you just come to check whether I'm dead or not.

204
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,590
I'm very good. You can leave now.

205
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,400
What are you talking about?

206
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,110
It's very kind of Mr. Bai to visit you.

207
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,230
He Jinxin,

208
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,960
you are supposed to be on my side!

209
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,150
All right, all right.

210
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,790
Forget it.

211
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,280
Yeah.

212
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,710
Anyway, thank you so much.

213
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,200
Yeah.

214
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,640
Don't mention it.

215
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,200
Whenever you are in trouble,

216
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,350
I will not balk at

217
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,150
running towards the fire.

218
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,280
I will not balk at

219
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,230
running towards the fire!

220
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,110
Just do it!

221
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,550
Mr. Bai,

222
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,280
don't worry about Zhao Cuo.

223
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,470
I'll watch him all the time.

224
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,760
Why don't we let him have a rest?

225
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,280
Yeah.

226
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,000
Then, see you later.

227
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,280
Let me walk you out.

228
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,200
Ouch, my head aches!

229
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,080
Oh, I ache all over.

230
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,350
I'm here.

231
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,200
Hmm.

232
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,230
Where does it hurt?

233
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,030
Here, here.

234
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,470
Here?

235
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

236
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,550
Here?

237
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,350
Yeah, here...

238
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,760
It's swollen here. It's swollen.

239
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,280
Let me see.

240
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,400
It hurts. Ouch!

241
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Bai Yifei, sorry for not walking you out.

242
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,030
Just Face,

243
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,230
are you here to make yourself suffer?

244
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,150
You don't know how happy I am

245
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,590
in the past few days.

246
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,230
Spit it out while I'm in a good mood.

247
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,880
Today, I come here

248
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,960
to declare war on you.

249
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,550
Declare war?

250
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,590
Do you think you are qualified?

251
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,880
Zhao Cuo, don't give me that frivolous face.

252
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,590
I'm fighting for Miss Tian Sanqi this time.

253
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,080
You knew it?

254
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,590
That day, on the General's Hill,

255
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,200
I stood outside the temple

256
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,150
and heard clearly what she said.

257
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,230
You overheard outside the temple?

258
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,150
Are you a decent man?

259
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,910
You pretend to be sick, trying to deceive Miss Sanqi.

260
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,080
And after learning the truth, you don't set her free.

261
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,670
A decent man should never do this.

262
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,150
Oh.

263
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,400
You always show people a righteous face.

264
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,710
But now you are in my place,

265
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,000
trying to steal my girl from me.

266
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,470
Do you have to take everything from me?

267
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,110
You married Miss Sanqi

268
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,400
by an odd coincidence,

269
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,670
so you are not a real couple at all.

270
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,960
Besides, you don't have a physical relationship.

271
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,030
She just married you in another girl's stead.

272
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,230
But I believe

273
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,350
she has her difficulties.

274
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,520
So what?

275
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,000
Are you threatening me?

276
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,550
No. I will keep it a secret.

277
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,670
However,

278
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,280
I want a fair competition with you.

279
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,280
You want a fair competition?

280
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,520
I think you want a piece of me!

281
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,800
Damn you, Zhao Cuo! You lied to me again!

282
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,040
Humph!

283
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:19,710
Sanqi...

284
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,040
I...

285
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,040
Damn! Zhao Cuo, you make fool of me again!

286
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,310
Lower.

287
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,920
Miss Sanqi,

288
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,950
don't get angry.

289
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,430
I have something for you.

290
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,230
You'll love it.

291
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,280
This is "A Collection of Medicinal Herbs and Medication".

292
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,350
You've always wanted to read it.

293
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,470
This book, "A Judicial Commissioner's Record of Curious Cases",

294
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,430
documents some strange and disputed cases in the past.

295
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,040
I think you'll love it.

296
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,190
Wow, amazing!

297
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,950
These books are so hard to find for common people!

298
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,430
I've never had the chance to read them before!

299
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,760
Thank you so much.

300
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,470
This kind of books

301
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,590
are everywhere in my house.

302
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,470
If you don't mind,

303
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,830
just come to my place

304
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,640
and read them as you please.

305
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,110
Are you sure?

306
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,160
Yeah.

307
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,000
Miss Tian Sanqi

308
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,760
is such an extraordinary girl.

309
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,920
No average girl could be so talented

310
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,430
as well as interested in solving cases.

311
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,470
I just wonder

312
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,920
why she took the place of the bride.

313
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,880
She must have suffered a lot.

314
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,430
Mr. Bai

315
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,880
looks increasingly like my immortal brother.

316
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,310
Is he the boy?

317
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,000
Ah, I have no idea at all.

318
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,400
Miss Sanqi,

319
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,640
why are you staring at me?

320
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,430
Is there anything on my face?

321
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:02,950
Huh?

322
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,830
Oh, I was just thinking

323
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,640
you look like an old friend of mine.

324
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,040
By the way, have you been to other places

325
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,350
at the age of ten?

326
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,400
Yeah. When I was ten,

327
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,800
I moved to the northern city with my father.

328
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,800
I'm not a native in the northern city.

329
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,950
Then have you ever been

330
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,230
to a place called Shifang Village?

331
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,070
When travelling around with my father,

332
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,160
I visited many villages.

333
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,070
This Shifang Village...

334
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,160
I have no impression.

335
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,230
You have no impression?

336
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:45,760
Yeah.

337
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,950
Then do you have anything unusual

338
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,680
on your body?

339
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,640
Like here on the waist?

340
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,590
Waist?

341
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,110
Ah!

342
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,160
It hurts!

343
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,280
Huh?

344
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,430
Li Jia?

345
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,470
What are you doing here?

346
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,160
I…I'm here...

347
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,310
What am I doing here?

348
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,470
This is a good question.

349
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,310
Hmm. To be or not to be here,

350
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,230
this is a question worth thinking about.

351
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,400
Hmm. What an insightful question!

352
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,280
Well done, Young Mistress.

353
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,040
I shall go back and think about it.

354
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,230
Hmm. Good question. Good question.

355
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,760
Hey,

356
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,310
I finally found some time to read a book.

357
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,920
Why are you making these noises?

358
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,070
I'm looking for a book. Just read your book

359
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,880
and stop nagging.

360
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,430
What are you looking for?

361
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,230
I am looking for the...

362
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,280
It's called "Strange Flowers" or something.

363
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,310
You are such an uneducated person.

364
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,430
"Encyclopedia of Exotic Flowers and Herbs". Is it what you are looking for?

365
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

366
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,040
Why are you looking for the book?

367
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,880
For your daughter-in-law.

368
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,430
I'd like to see

369
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,470
what kind of book

370
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,880
could draw her to another man's place.

371
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,800
Oh,

372
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,310
this little brat really cares about

373
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,430
his wife.

374
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,160
Great. Great.

375
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,830
I guess I chose a good wife for him.

376
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,040
Tomorrow,

377
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,310
I'm going to visit He's Mansion

378
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,110
to thank her father.

379
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,160
Old man.

380
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,400
Yeah?

381
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,110
I have something to tell you.

382
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,560
If that He Jinxin

383
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,710
is not the true He Jinxin,

384
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,880
will you still treat her like this?

385
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,640
He Jinxin is not the true He Jinxin?

386
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,190
What do you mean?

387
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,110
I mean, it's just...

388
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,560
Hey, just spit it out.

389
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,310
I'm listening.

390
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,190
Don't hang back.

391
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,160
All right, let me tell you.

392
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,230
I mean,

393
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,760
actually, this He Jinxin

394
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,920
is not the true He Jinxin.

395
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,950
Her real name is Tian Sanqi.

396
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
She married me in He Jinxin's stead.

397
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,310
Why are you staring at me like this?

398
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,760
Tell you what,

399
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,070
you'd better give up the idea forever.

400
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,190
I will never marry He Jinxin!

401
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,310
And besides,

402
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,190
I had the wedding with her.

403
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,880
We can't just kick her out of the house.

404
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
I knew it!

405
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,110
How could a girl of a rich family

406
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,800
carry out an autopsy?

407
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,110
Ah, the girl is so special.

408
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,430
You're not going to kick her out of here?

409
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,430
Why would I do that? Huh?

410
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,920
I don't care she's He Jinxin

411
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,310
or Tian Sanqi.

412
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,920
Anyway, she's the daughter-in-law I chose

413
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,520
and that's enough.

414
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:07,920
So that's it?

415
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,110
You can leave if that's it.

416
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,160
I have a book to read.

417
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,640
All right.

418
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,830
Hey.

419
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,830
What if...

420
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,560
You are worrying that if it comes out,

421
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,470
Sanqi would leave,

422
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,190
while you, who's not her real husband,

423
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,160
don't know what to do.

424
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,680
Yes.

425
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,230
Let me tell you. Come here.

426
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,040
Make it a done deal.

427
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,560
What is done cannot be undone.

428
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,880
Good job, old man.

429
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,590
I'll go back to sleep.

430
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,310
Just go.

431
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,110
Good night, Daddy.

432
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,190
Daddy?

433
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,560
Daddy.

434
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,310
Daddy.

435
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,110
Daddy!

436
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,190
Oh.

437
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,040
I'm telling you, Ling,

438
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,430
whatever you do,

439
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,000
just drive Tian Sanqi out of Zhao's Mansion!

440
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,590
Understand?

441
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,520
Otherwise, prepare for your end.

442
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:08,190
Ling, add less salt to the dishes next time,

443
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,110
because it always reminds me of you.

444
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,230
Bad news, Master!

445
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,590
This is not good!

446
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,680
What's the bad news?

447
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,710
Call the Young Master and the Young Mistress for breakfast.

448
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,640
Master, listen to me!

449
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,760
It's really bad.

450
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,760
The guard told me

451
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,160
that Ling...

452
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,830
Ah, what's wrong with Ling?

453
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,190
Did she fall or tumble? Was she bullied?

454
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,400
That's not the case.

455
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,760
He said Ling carried a bag and left.

456
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,230
What?

457
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,950
She said she had left you a letter on the table.

458
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Quandui,

459
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,640
now you know Sanqi's true identity.

460
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,190
Sanqi is a good girl.

461
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,470
I hope Zhao Cuo could treat her well in the future.

462
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,430
And it's time for me to leave.

463
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,040
I neither have the cheek to stay here,

464
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,950
nor go back to He's Mansion.

465
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,110
The only choice is to stay far away from you guys.

466
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,920
Let's just go our separate ways since then.

467
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,760
Yours, Ling.

468
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,800
Please.

469
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,760
Wait, Ling!

470
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:36,680
Ling!

471
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,920
What are you doing?

472
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,000
It's all my fault.

473
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,710
I'm so sorry.

474
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,070
There's nothing to be sorry for,

475
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,680
silly girl!

476
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,110
Without you,

477
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,560
how could Sanqi possibly marry my son?

478
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,230
Without you,

479
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,560
how could I be so happy?

480
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,880
Ah? Are you happy?

481
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,470
I am happy!

482
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,590
I'm really happy!

483
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,190
I feel just like a fish in the water!

484
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:06,680
If you leave...

485
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,070
do you want me to die with thirst, Ling?

486
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,000
But after all, I serve the He family.

487
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,190
I don't care who you serve.

488
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,470
You are my sweetheart

489
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,350
and the mistress of Zhao's Mansion!

490
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:22,950
Quandui!

491
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,680
Ling, my love!

492
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,230
Then what should I do with Sanqi?

493
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,160
I don't care about other woman at this moment.

494
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,590
I only have eyes for you!

495
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,190
Oh, it's not just another woman.

496
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,350
It's Sanqi!

497
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,520
You're talking about Sanqi?

498
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,040
Yeah.

499
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,470
Oh, you know what? Right now,

500
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,040
we can't tell Sanqi

501
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,830
that I know

502
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,160
her true identity.

503
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,310
Otherwise,

504
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,680
she would be more anxious than you to leave Zhao's Mansion.

505
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,190
In addition,

506
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,640
I noticed that

507
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,280
my stupid son Zhao Cuo

508
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,920
has really fallen for Sanqi,

509
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,590
while Sanqi...

510
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,590
I don't think she likes my son.

511
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,640
Huh! If I were her,

512
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,400
I wouldn't like that rascal either!

513
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,160
Oh, if Sanqi leaves,

514
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,280
could my son possibly

515
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,000
find another good girl like her?

516
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,520
What do you say?

517
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Right.

518
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,830
In fact, there's another reason

519
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,350
why I wanted to leave.

520
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,040
What's it?

521
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,280
My mother is old

522
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,160
and I haven't been back home for a long time.

523
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,430
I want to go back and see her.

524
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,760
You and me are like wind and sands.

525
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,430
Wherever you go, I'll go with you.

526
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,110
Let me go home with you.

527
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,710
Quandui!

528
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,160
Let's go!

529
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,680
Young Mistress!

530
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,110
Well, it's not good!

531
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,950
Young Master fell ill again.

532
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,760
Oh, he fell ill?

533
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,110
Let it be. He'll be all right later.

534
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,560
Young Mistress! Young Mistress!

535
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,710
Just go and see him.

536
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,950
Young Master stays in bed.

537
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,710
He's almost paralyzed!

538
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,640
Ah.

539
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,160
No!

540
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,470
Young Mistress!

541
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,070
Please just go! I'm really at wit's end.

542
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,470
Young Master just wants you to be there.

543
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,040
Without you,

544
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,430
he won't take meals or medicine.

545
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,920
I have no choice.

546
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
Please go, Young Mistress.

547
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,800
Ah? Come on!

548
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,950
Whatever. I'll go.

549
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,040
Yeah, that's right.

550
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,160
Drop the act.

551
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,230
I know you are fine.

552
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,400
Tell me, what do you want?

553
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,310
Ah, my forehead is burning.

554
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,560
You have a fever? It's so hot!

555
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,070
Yeah.

556
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,190
Then...

557
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,920
Then you deserve it!

558
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,430
You are such a liar!

559
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,920
Don't go. Stay.

560
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,710
My body is burning.

561
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,590
I won't go. But you must let go of me.

562
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,920
Don't move! If you move again...

563
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,400
My leg hurts! My leg is broken!

564
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,070
Hasn't your leg been healed?

565
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,040
Ah yes. My head aches.

566
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,310
It hurts!

567
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,310
Your body is so hot.

568
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,110
Why are you panting?

569
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,230
Ah!

570
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,400
Why are you holding me?

571
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,110
What did you do to me?

572
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,110
Honey, of course,

573
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,190
we did something a couple should do.

574
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,520
What should a couple do?

575
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:47,760
Guess!

576
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,950
Just tell me!

577
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,760
We...

578
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,470
I don't want to listen! Shut it!

579
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,760
Hey, are you going to listen or not?

580
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,640
You and I are married

581
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,310
and last night...

582
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,710
We have a mutual feeling.

583
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
Nonsense!

584
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,280
If we really did something,

585
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,880
how could I feel nothing?

586
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,350
And I remember clearly

587
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,520
I was in a daze last night.

588
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,560
How about a review?

589
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,280
Let go of me. I'm leaving.

590
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:28,920
He Jinxin!

591
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,160
Now you are my woman from the inside out.

592
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,110
And we have a physical relationship.

593
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,230
Don't you fear that

594
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,000
I may tell Bai Yifei if I feel bad?

595
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,190
Why did Zhao Cuo ask me to the garden

596
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,680
for no reason at all?

597
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
This way, sir.

598
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,600
My love, Mr. Bai is here.

599
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,280
Let's invite him to the pavilion to have some tea.

600
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:15,870
Hmm?

601
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:20,080
Yes, my love.

602
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,190
Let's go!

603
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,870
My love, am I handsome?

604
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,949
Yeah.

605
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,230
Bai!

606
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,760
Puff!

607
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,560
Wow, I taste lemon.

608
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,630
Honey, here, have a chicken leg.

609
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,040
You got too tired last night.

610
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,950
I wonder why Miss Sanqi was tired.

611
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,600
Ah!

612
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,320
Last night...

613
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,320
I carried bricks the whole night!

614
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,150
I was exhausted.

615
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,280
Carrying bricks?

616
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,670
Yeah, it's a physical training.

617
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,950
Oh.

618
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,760
Honey, you...

619
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,230
Honey! Stop talking!

620
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,710
Eat some food.

621
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,600
Honey, you should eat it.

622
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,430
You eat it.

623
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,900
Have more. Eat it. Eat it.

624
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,120
Please eat, ma'am, you were too tired yesterday.

625
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,870
You eat it.

626
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,390
I've got something to do at home.

627
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,040
See you later.

628
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,670
Mr. Bai!

629
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,600
Walk Mr. Bai out. Come here!

630
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
You haven't eaten yet!

631
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:02,950
Mr. Bai...

632
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,040
Honey, here, have a chicken leg.

633
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,520
No!

634
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,950
What are you doing here at this late hour?

635
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,630
You've done well recently

636
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,080
like a good girl.

637
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,470
So I give you a chance to rub my back.

638
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,600
Gosh!

639
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:31,870
Take it!

640
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,470
What are you waiting for? Rub my back!

641
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,320
Isn't it your lifetime desire

642
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,520
to have a bath with me?

643
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,800
Hurry up!

644
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:45,950
All right.

645
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,230
It's a good opportunity to find out

646
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,320
whether he has the birthmark.

647
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:50,600
OK!

648
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,500
Medicine Pot, I'm back!
