Sanqi,

does it hurt?

Yes.

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,550
You're good.

10
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,680
You actually run away from home.

11
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,270
Go back with me.

00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,630
Go.

[By Zhao Quandui]

17
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,440
Honey,

18
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,960
let me tell you a piece of good news.

19
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,000
Cuo

20
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,320
is getting married.

21
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,190
Come here.

22
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,390
I'm sleepy.

23
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,800
Let's talk tomorrow.

24
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,880
It's about your marriage.

25
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,720
I will go to He's Mansion

26
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,520
for marriage proposal tomorrow.

27
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,550
Your marriage

28
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,360
is settled.

29
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,030
I won't marry her.

30
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,030
I don't agree. There's no room for discussion.

31
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,550
Yeah, there's no room for discussion.

32
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,910
I just tell you about it.

33
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,079
You like to propose a marriage so much.

34
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,030
You may marry her.

35
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,880
Nonsense.

36
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,000
Son,

37
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,000
I raised you up

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,079
alone enduring

39
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,390
all kinds of hardships.

40
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,270
I'm afraid you'll suffer wrong,

41
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,270
so I don't even remarry.

42
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,079
It has been so hard for me.

43
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,829
I don't urge you to gain fame

44
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,079
or to be self-reliant.

45
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,800
I just hope

46
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,030
you can get married and have children.

47
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,910
I want you to grow up peacefully

48
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,600
and live a good life.

49
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,750
They are just small requests.

50
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,240
Is it so difficult?

51
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,670
Dad,

52
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,880
I know you are good to me,

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,360
and you don't want me to be motivated,

54
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,960
because you think

55
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,720
I'm good-for-nothing as other people do.

56
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,320
You're just improperly belittling yourself!

57
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,110
So just hang out with your evil associates.

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,510
If you really want them to think highly of you,

59
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,920
you should do something.

60
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,950
Dad, I'm telling you.

61
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,320
I prefer to being called

62
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,600
the son of the evil official

63
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,390
than good-for-nothing.

64
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,920
You!

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,320
You're really pissing me off!

66
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
You can't hit me. You can't hit me.

67
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,640
You're so angry that you have a white mustache.

68
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,110
You!

69
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,159
Come on, dad.

70

[A clear mirror hung on high. Be a clean man. Be a good official.]

71
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,510
What a bold cunning man.

72
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,670
You actually raped a woman.

73
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,000
Master,

74
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,790
that's the case last month.

75
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,440
The case you mentioned

76
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,720
happened last month.

77
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,230
Your Excellency,

78
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,340
please help me.

79
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,660
The egg from my hen

80
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,640
was taken to

81
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,760
her henhouse by her hen.

82
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,270
That is obviously the egg from my hen.

83
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,200
Look at your ugly hen.

84
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,950
Can she lay

85
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,350
such a good-looking egg?

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,950
You're ugly.

87
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,920
Your whole family is ugly.

88
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,950
You're ugly.

89
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,000
Your whole family is ugly.

90
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,760
Well, enough.

91
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,920
Stop fighting!

92
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,950
Let the hens be quiet, too.

93
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,390
It's such a simple thing.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,070
They're just two hens.

95
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,920
Your hen will brood the egg

96
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,110
on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

97
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,640
Your hen will brood the egg

98
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,110
on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

99
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,070
When the chick is born,

100
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,350
check its look carefully.

101
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,720
The hen that looks like

102
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,790
the chick is its mother.

103
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:44,920
That's settled.

104
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,270
How can he handle a case like this?

105
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,880
This is the 39th wrongful conviction in this month.

106
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,550
Zhao Quandui is fatuous and unprincipled as an official.

107
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,270
Well, Bai.

108
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,880
Why are you everywhere?

109
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,440
You're in charge of the northern city,

110
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,510
while I'm in charge of the southern city.

111
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,000
You're just being

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,880
a busybody.

113
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,270
Evil official,

114
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,350
since you took the post of magistrate of the southern city,

115
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,920
you've never solved any case.

116
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,200
I'll impeach you before the Lord,

117
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,230
so as to merge the southern city with the northern city.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,950
Bai.

119
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,480
Bai, don't go.

120
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,230
It's time to eat.

121
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,040
Stay to have lunch.

122
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,760
Bai.

123
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,160
Evil official. Evil official. Evil official.

Step down, evil official.

Step down.

Step down, evil official.

Step down, evil official.

128

Step down, evil official.

129
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,320
Step down.

130
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,000
Step down, evil official.

131
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,440
Master,

132
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,720
don't take this to heart.

133
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,830
Good cabbage.

134
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,160
Pick up all these

135
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,720
cabbages

136
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,200
and take them back to the mansion.

137
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,790
Cook them for lunch.

138
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,790
The dream of marrying into a rich family is destroyed.

139
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,040
The dream of marrying into a rich family is destroyed.

140
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,000
You didn't even meet Zhao Cuo.

141
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,670
Master, master.

142
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,040
Our family is getting rich.

143
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,720
Getting rich?

144
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,640
Zhao Quandui sent a marriage proposal.

145
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,350
His son will marry Jinxin.

146
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,670
Look. Look.

147
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,880
Let me have a look.

148
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,640
But Zhao Cuo doesn't

149
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,760
even meet lady.

150
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,200
So lady's beauty

151
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,270
has long spread through the city.

152
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,790
We'll really get rich.

153
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,440
Prepare a carriage.

154
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,230
I'm going to Zhao's Mansion.

155
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,270
Will I go with you?

156
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:52,920
No, you don't need to.

157
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,510
Go. Go. Go.

158
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,159
Come on. Come on.

159
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:58,670
Enjoy it.

160
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,320
There's no salt.

161
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,880
Someone!

162
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,040
Pull the cook out and kill him.

163
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,880
Don't.

164
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,950
What do you want to do?

165
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,270
Without salt,

166
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,880
this dish

167
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,350
doesn't have a soul.

168
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,160
It's really

169
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,160
unbearable.

170
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,550
Son-in-law,

171
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,520
I support you.

172
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,030
Kill him.

173
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,110
Okay.

174
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,880
Well, well.

175
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,840
Someone.

176
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,909
Take this dish

177
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,110
away. Take it away.

178
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,230
Come on.

179
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,140
Continue to enjoy the food.

180
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,520
Li Jia, come on.

181
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,550
Serve the soup for Mr. He.

182
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,320
Good soup.

183
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,230
Especially, the meat in it is fresh and tender.

184
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,230
It's great that my son-in-law is so honest

185
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,440
in our first meeting.

186
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,880
I'm flattered.

187
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,520
Well, Mr. He.

188
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,760
Son-in-law,

189
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,400
what's wrong with you?

190
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,790
I have venereal disease.

191
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,760
Venereal… venereal disease is good.

192
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,550
Venereal disease is

193
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,670
actually a common disease.

194
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,280
Mr. He, please listen to me.

195
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Dad,

196
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,710
don't keep it from him.

197
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,220
I got venereal disease

198
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,960
in the whorehouse.

199
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,400
I only have a month to live.

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,550
I really don't want to drag your daughter.

201
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,760
A month?

202
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,200
Mr. He,

203
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,640
don't listen to him.

204
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,110
I…

205
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,790
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

206
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,150
As son-in-law is so frank,

207
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,350
let's just settle the marriage.

208
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,640
I'll marry my daughter into your family tomorrow.

209
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,640
See you.

210
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,320
Master,

211
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,280
Mr. Zhao is dying as he has venereal disease.

212
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,230
Why do you still let lady marry him?

213
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,910
It's good he's dying.

214
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,670
You don't understand.

215
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,080
By then, Jinxin

216
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,550
will be the head of the family.

217
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,350
She'll have a lot of money and treasures as she wants.

218
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,590
Young man,

219
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,590
which deceased friend

220
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,320
are you visiting?

221
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,670
Wang Mazi?

222
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,640
You mean you want to

223
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,710
marry my daughter?

224
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,400
Think carefully.

225
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,520
Young man,

226
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,760
why do you

227
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,000
settle on our daughter?

228
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,520
My dad said

229
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,000
your family buries bodies,

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,640
while our family makes coffins.

231
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,520
The combination of our two families

232
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,080
means "die."

233
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,670
You're good.

234
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,960
Let me see

235
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,880
which short-lived guy

236
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,080
wants to marry me.

237
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,440
Oh, my God.

238
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,350
Ghost!

239
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,350
You want to marry me?

240
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,230
No way!

241
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,960
Tian Sanqi,

242
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,470
I told you many times.

243
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,080
You can't sleep in the coffin.

244
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,000
Come out.

245
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,030
Go. Hurry up.

246
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,110
Get down on your knees.

247
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,670
You'll also get down on your knees.

248
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,400
Marriage tree. Marriage tree.

249
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,960
For nine generations, the Tian family has been engaged in funeral.

250
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,200
But in my generation,

251
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
I only have one daughter.

252
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,670
My daughter is bad at

253
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,670
lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy and painting.

254
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,230
She just likes autopsy.

255
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,520
All men in the nearby villages

256
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,350
run away when seeing her.

257
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,320
Tree immortal,

258
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,590
you watched her growing up.

259
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,550
Please bless her

260
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,280
so that she can marry a man.

261
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,640
Sanqi is counting on your blessing.

262
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,200
I will collect feces

263
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,840
from door to door tomorrow.

264
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,640
I will spread the best manure for you.

265
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,840
Bullshit.

266
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,150
Who are you talking to?

267
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,200
Dare you say that I bullshit again?

268
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,350
You were wrong indeed.

269
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,200
You want to collect feces?

270
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,280
Was I wrong?

271
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,710
You spoiled her.

272
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,440
I'm telling you.

273
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,350
You spoiled her.

274
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,200
You spoiled her.

275
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,710
Dare you say that again?

276
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,230
Fine, I spoiled her.

277
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,350
What are you looking at?

278
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,280
Immortal brother,

279
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,350
I'll be waiting right here.

280
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,150
I won't marry another man.

281
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,670
What did you say?

282
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,520
You won't marry?

283
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,030
Listen. You have to marry.

284
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,590
I'll take you to Wang Mazi's house

285
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,550
to propose a marriage tomorrow.

286
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,840
I'm not going.

287
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,110
I'm not going.

288
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,710
I'll wait for the immortal brother

289
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,760
to come back here.

290
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,470
That immortal brother you always mention

291
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,110
has long died.

292
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,350
When you were 10,

293
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,030
he was drowned in the river at the end of our village.

294
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,910
He doesn't have the brother's birthmark.

295
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,350
Brother,

296
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,910
you came here.

297
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,200
You're still alive.

298
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,200
I know you are not dead.

299
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,790
I promise you

300
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,550
I'll be waiting here for you.

301
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,790
I said

302
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,640
that was not him.

303
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,440
He's still alive.

304
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,550
Why don't you believe me?

305
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,350
Fine.

306
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,110
That was

307
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,030
not him.

308
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,790
He's still alive.

309
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,710
Why doesn't he come?

310
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,470
Where's he?

311
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,400
Why doesn't he come to marry you?

312
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,550
I don't know.

313
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,910
But,

314
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,080
he will come back.

315
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,640
Look at you.

316
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,000
You've almost gone crazy

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,280
because of him.

318
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,320
Sweetheart,

319
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,110
don't be

320
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,230
so rigid.

321
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,670
Just let it go.

322
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,550
I can't!

323
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,350
I'll just be waiting under this old locust tree.

324
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,030
Before he comes back,

325
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,880
I'm not going anywhere

326
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,790
and I won't marry anyone.

327
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,080
Fine.

328
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,030
You said that.

329
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,880
You'll just wait here.

330
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,520
Let me see how long you will have to wait.

331
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,470
Look,

332
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,520
you can't send meals to her.

333
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,320
Let her stay hungry.

334
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,110
She can't go back home

335
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,030
before she comes round.

336
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,640
Let's go.

337
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,710
Go.

338
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,470
You…

339
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,910
How dare you pull my ear?

340
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,110
She's spoiled by you.

341
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,230
The old man surnamed Ding

342
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,470
has two sons.

343
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,150
He doesn't eat for three days.

344
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,910
He is so hungry that he's busy cooking.

345
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,520
He bought two green onions

346
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,110
with 0.33 yuan.

347
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,440
He bought a watermelon with 0.77 tael.

348
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,520

I don't have a name,

Where is your home?

I don't know where I come from

357

and where I'm going to.

358

He told me I would go back to

00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,760
Young Lord is the son chosen by God.

521
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,800
He won't joke with you.

522
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,110
Wait.

523
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,280
What's wrong again?

524
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,430
You look familiar.

525
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,830
Are you the man who

526
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,280
acts Justice Bao in the troupe in western city?

527
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Stop acting.

528
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,800
Your beard is falling off.

529
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,470
Help Young Lady get changed.

530
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,160
What are you doing?

531
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,230
Help!

532
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,160
Sanqi, you are so beautiful.

533
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,350
Isn't she hoodoo?

534
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,880
Shut up.

535
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,680
Don't say this.

536
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,280
Look, she's coming out.

537
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,040
She's coming out.

538
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,680
So beautiful.

539
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,680
As I said,

540
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,560
Sanqi has been difficult since childhood.

541
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,040
Yeah.

542
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,350
It turns out

543
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,830
she's the mountain phoenix among the pheasants.

544
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,430
Yeah.

545
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
So beautiful. So beautiful.

546
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,590
Sanqi,

547
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,430
after going to the city,

548
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,280
don't forget to come back to visit me living next door.

549
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,680
Take care. Take care.

550
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,430
Remember to come back.

551
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
If…

552
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,040
I mean if…

553
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:20,920
What if I don't want to

554
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,680
marry Young Lord?

555
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,160
In the world,

556
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,350
all land belongs to the king.

557
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,400
All people in the world

558
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,230
belong to the king.

559
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,920
According to this,

560
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,590
whether you want to marry or not,

561
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,430
you belong to Young Lord

562
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,280
no matter you are alive or dead.

563
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,230
Don't say such things.

564
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,070
It's a big day today.

565
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,430
Don't mention the word dead.

566
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,110
I just asked you about it.

567
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,520
Young Lady,

568
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,800
please get on the sedan.

569
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,310
Daughter. Sanqi.

570
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,160
Dad.

571
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,640
Mom.

572
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,040
I will miss you.

573
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,710
Daughter.

574
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,070
It's time to get on the sedan, Young Lady.

575
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,470
This boy was born with a defect in his coccyx.

576
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,040
The dead boy is not the one to be killed that year.

577
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,310
The assassination eight years ago was wrong.

578
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,520
I'm afraid the dead boy was a substitute.

579
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,160
The target is still alive.

580
00:30:59,400 --> 00:30:59,920
You go back

581
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,110
to report it to our master.

582
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,350
Others stay here

583
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,000
to find out the persons related to the clue.

584
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,680
I found a girl who had contacts with

585
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,350
the person to be killed eight years ago.

586
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,640
It seems she's also looking for him.

587
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,470
Pretty good.

588
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,470
Keep watch on her.

589
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,880
Once there's any new clue,

590
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,710
we should kill him by mistake

591
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,680
rather than let him go.
