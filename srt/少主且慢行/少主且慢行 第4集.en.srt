1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,020
I've Fallen for You

3
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,100
Episode 4

4
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,190
Now they must be looking for me all over the city.

5
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,550
I'd better be careful.

6
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,360
Young Lord's team for escorting bride

7
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,509
ran across mountain thieves.

8
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,120
Young Lady fought bravely

9
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,759
and escaped from the clutches.

10
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,630
But she is missing.

11
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,190
Now the Lord is offering a gold reward of 52 taels,

12
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,160
hoping everyone'll cooperate actively to find her.

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
It's too bad.

14
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
My picture is pasted.

15
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,190
I'm done.

16
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:12,960
Who is she?

17
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
So ugly.

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,600
Right.

19
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,829
This Young Lady is too ugly to look at.

20
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,800
Miss.

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,470
I think you're more like young lady than she is.

22
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,390
What's going on here?

23
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,520
Do people of the Lord's mansion make a mistake?

24
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,030
Whatever.

25
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,110
Go to find Zhao Cuo first.

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,030
Yang Yong.

27
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,960
Do you want to fly higher?

28
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,829
You are a homeless cur.

29
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,550
You're barking here.

30
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,440
What a joke.

31
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,720
This whorehouse is not exclusive to you.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,030
I come whenever I want.

33
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,520
I don't have to inform you beforehand.

34
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,240
Li Jia.

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,750
Cut his hand off.

36
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,960
No problem.

37
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,360
You've eaten croton seed, right?

38
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,270
Fart so much.

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,670
Tell me which one you

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,000
choose, Dice Bowl, Pai Gow or wine game.

41
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,160
Wine game.

42
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,390
Do you agree?

43
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,720
Good.

44
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,110
Though I am ugly,

45
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,880
I have a long life.

46
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,320
I'm handsome,

47
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,829
so I am loved.

48
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,670
It seems

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,390
I must

50
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,670
drink up this wine.

51
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,880
Whoever draws this lot

52
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,470
should pay the bills today.

53
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,160
So today

54
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,910
all our bills are paid by Mr. Yang.

55
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,790
Good. Good.

56
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,510
Good. Good.

57
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,070
What?

58
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,720
You can't afford to play?

59
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,270
Stop playing wine games.

60
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,230
Let's play dice bowl.

61
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,070
But this time

62
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,790
let's bet on something valuable.

63
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,880
I'll decide what to bet on.

64
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,000
Whatever.

65
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,920
I can afford everything.

66
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,830
Good.

67
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,270
Right.

68
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,040
If you lose,

69
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,070
your ancestral house in the south

70
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,790
belongs to me.

71
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,000
Do you agree?

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,390
No, no, no, Young Master.

73
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,320
That's the Master's ancestral house.

74
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,390
If you lose it,

75
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,790
the Master must punish me.

76
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,320
Young Master.

77
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,070
No, don't do it.

78
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,640
Bet with him.

79
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,600
You are

80
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,200
Young Master of great Taifu Magistrate.

81
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,510
Are you afraid of this servant?

82
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,790
Right.

83
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,230
You always win every bet.

84
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,200
You are invincible.

85
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,320
You never fear anything.

86
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,830
Right.

87
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,390
Go ahead.

88
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,660
Go ahead.

89
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,550
Mr. Zhao,

90
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,350
if you're scared,

91
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,270
today's bills

92
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,830
will be paid by me.

93
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,320
But

94
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,880
you have to allow Leimo

95
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,480
to serve my brothers well.

96
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,110
Good.

97
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,550
How dare you?

98
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,790
You want to take her away from me.

99
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,070
I'd kill you.

100
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,040
Good.

101
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,920
Let's bet only once.

102
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,950
If you lose to me,

103
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,159
crawl out of that dog hole.

104
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,350
From now on,

105
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,600
don't step in here.

106
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,790
And...

107
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,760
I'm sick of seeing you.

108
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,830
You...

109
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:47,950
Good.

110
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,070
Let's start.

111
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,760
Good. Good.

112
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,270
For all martial arts in the world,

113
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,040
the faster, the harder to defeat.

114
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,440
And its speed can't be seen by eyes,

115
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,920
but felt by heart.

116
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,880
Close your eyes,

117
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,640
see it with your ears

118
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,390
and feel it by heart.

119
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,510
Two 6-points and one 4-point, more than yours.

120
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,270
Zhao.

121
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,159
You're somewhat a jerk.

122
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,510
Can you tell how much it is by hearing?

123
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,760
It's clear that Mr. Yang is setting a trap.

124
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,720
Zhao Cuo is so stupid to go into his trap.

125
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,440
It seems he' going to lose thoroughly now.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,920
Zhao.

127
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,070
Come on. I must win it.

128
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,760
Let me drink to you first, buddy.

129
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,950
You bet more.

130
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,070
Then I bet less.

131
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,600
Open.

132
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,350
No.

133
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,070
No.

134
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,390
Zhao Cuo.

135
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,000
Come home with me now.

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,480
Wait.

137
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,270
Who are you?

138
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,070
Is she the woman

139
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,350
who molested Mr. Zhao that day?

140
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,510
Zhao.

141
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,230
She is

142
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,510
your newly married wife, right?

143
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,350
Did she force to undress you

144
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,670
and marry you?

145
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,070
Is it true?

146
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,390
Get out of the way.

147
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,640
Why are you coming here?

148
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,110
Don't get me wrong.

149
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,830
Look at her.

150
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,480
So ugly.

151
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,950
Fat-headed, big-eared with a pig belly.

152
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,670
How could she be my wife?

153
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,200
Right?

154
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,760
You dead servant girl.

155
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,950
Go back home for cooking.

156
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,920
Dead servant girl.

157
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,640
Don't get mad.

158
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Don't spoil our fun.

159
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,640
Who is she?

160
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,080
I remember

161
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,710
last time she was also in the whorehouse.

162
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,470
Go away.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,960
A servant girl.

164
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,030
None of your business.

165
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,110
Hurry home.

166
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,110
Go. Go away.

167
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,880
Zhao Cuo.

168
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,400
These people are all bad.

169
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,080
They're all united to hurt you.

170
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,200
Go home with me now.

171
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,000
Shut up.

172
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,520
These people are all my friends.

173
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:00,880
You are wrong.

174
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,080
It's impossible.

175
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,280
You, get out of here now.

176
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,840
Go.

177
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,440
Go.

178
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:08,960
Go.

179
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Go.

180
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,030
Go home.

181
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,910
Go home. Go home.

182
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,320
Friends.

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,670
We are friends from now on.

184
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,550
In the future, I won't

185
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,710
let anyone bully you.

186
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Go away.

187
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,840
Go.

188
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,280
Go.

189
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,790
Go home.

190
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,320
Go home.

191
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,880
Come. Come on.

192
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,320
Open.

193
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,520
Dead Zhao Cuo.

194
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,710
Smelly Zhao Cuo.

195
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,590
I curse that you get something stuck between your teeth due to drinking cold water.

196
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,440
Who cursed me?

197
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,960
Open.

198
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,150
One, three, four, less.

199
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,470
Less.

200
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,670
We win.

201
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,200
How, how could this be?

202
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,550
So what?

203
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,760
You want to refuse to admit it?

204
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,280
Everyone here

205
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,550
is witness.

206
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,840
What are you doing?

207
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,760
Lose and try to beat me?

208
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,840
As the saying goes, a word

209
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,910
spoken is an arrow let fly.

210
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,670
Take your title deed.

211
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,670
Go out.

212
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,280
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

213
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:42,960
Li Jia.

214
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,550
I am thinking...

215
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,230
Young Master, let's forget it.

216
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,400
Let it go with the wind.

217
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,960
Go with the wind.

218
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,200
Wind.

219
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,640
I am thinking...

220
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,710
I am wondering if these days

221
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,640
my gambling skill falls behind.

222
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,470
Shall I go to the casino for improvement for a few days?

223
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,790
This...

224
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,350
This is the tradition of Zhao's Mansion.

225
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,520
I thought you wanted to tell us

226
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,520
to collect ingredients from the people

227
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,230
so as to taste the food of the people.

228
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,550
That's good.

229
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,960
Yes, that's exactly what I meant.

230
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,880
Rewards.

231
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,550
I thought you were saying...

232
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,840
Look at the cabbage, white and green.

233
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,110
Look at the bowl, big and round.

234
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,440
Look at this noodle, long and wide.

235
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,670
Long and wide.

236
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,470
Clear and clean.

237
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,880
It's a metaphor

238
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,640
that you are a clean

239
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,880
and good official.

240
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,000
All right.

241
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,840
Tiger, leopard.

242
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,350
Go out.

243
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,080
How was your day yesterday?

244
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,880
Fine.

245
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,840
I tried something hard all night long.

246
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,030
It's so tiring.

247
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,840
I won't ask for details.

248
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,550
As a young couple,

249
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,840
you both are inseparable.

250
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,790
What are you doing today?

251
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,590
Today Young Master...

252
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,880
Young Lady,

253
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,110
I'll bring you some words from Young Master.

254
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,150
He Jinxin.

255
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,840
About the matter of the ancestral house,

256
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,280
if you tell my dad,

257
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,350
I'd kill you.

258
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,520
Master.

259
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,440
This young couple are quite mysterious.

260
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,280
Why doesn't Young Master come out for meal?

261
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,840
Young Master...

262
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,710
Master, he...

263
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,840
Young Master is

264
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,440
working hard

265
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
on writing

266
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,960
and the success in southern city.

267
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,080
No matter how hard I stopped him,

268
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,880
he said he could work harder.

269
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,910
He is really grown up.

270
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,150
Let's leave him alone.

271
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,350
I reminded you not to gamble.

272
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,640
You lost my ancestral house

273
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,320
lasting for seven generations.

274
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,520
I kill you.

275
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,280
I kill you.

276
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
I kill you.

277
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,910
Master.

278
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,000
Young Master admitted his fault.

279
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,440
You unfilial son.

280
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,590
You make me so mad.

281
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,350
You make me so mad.

282
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,080
Oops! What to do?

283
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,230
I'm mad.

284
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,910
Master.

285
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,280
Come here.

286
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,640
Come and sit down.

287
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,790
I'm mad.

288
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,230
Don't get angry.

289
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,400
I may lose my official position.

290
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,550
See?

291
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,640
He's bringing me a lot of troubles.

292
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,080
Master, now

293
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,030
I don't understand.

294
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,400
You have been the official in southern city for many years.

295
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,880
People live and work in peace.

296
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,110
What do you say so?

297
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,000
You know what?

298
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,790
Master Bai of the southern city

299
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,350
always tries hard to pick on me.

300
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,110
As long as I makes a little mistake,

301
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,080
he takes out his little notebook

302
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,150
and records my mistake in it.

303
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,550
He said he'd impeach me with it someday.

304
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,150
See? How hard it is to be the official.

305
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,640
With enemies like wolves and tigers around me,

306
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,670
it is dangerous everywhere.

307
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,200
If I lose my official position,

308
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,400
what should he do by then?

309
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,880
Zhao Cuo.

310
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,350
Why are you coming to the southern city at midnight?

311
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,030
Why do you always follow me?

312
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,110
You want to go in, right?

313
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,000
Why not go in from the front door?

314
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,280
It has something to do with you.

315
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,000
Leave me alone.

316
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,550
I see.

317
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,520
You want to steal something, right?

318
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,400
No going in.

319
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,000
Let go of me. Let go of me.

320
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,520
Tell me,

321
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,200
are we good friends?

322
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,200
Barely yes.

323
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,790
For the matter of good friends,

324
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,349
Should we try hard to help each other

325
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:05,920
at the lost of our lives

326
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,589
and at all costs?

327
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,680
Today the bad official

328
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,829
humiliated my father.

329
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,680
Humiliating my father

330
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,280
means humiliating me.

331
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,349
Are we good friends?

332
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,280
You can't watch your good friend

333
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,880
being bullied

334
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,560
and humiliated, right?

335
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,310
No, I can't.

336
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:23,950
Good brother.

337
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,520
Good brother.

338
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,000
Squat down.

339
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,920
Squat down.

340
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,680
Wait for me.

341
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,830
I can't get in.

342
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,830
Paperwork Room.

343
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,920
That's right. That's it.

344
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,920
You're here watching.

345
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,040
Where is the little notebook?

346
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,560
So many.

347
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,710
Where can I find it?

348
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,920
How about...

349
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,920
Hey.

350
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,800
Oh, why is it on fire?

351
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,040
Hurry. Just go.

352
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,430
How troublesome. Go.

353
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,590
It's on fire.

354
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,040
Fire fighting.

355
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,190
Come on.

356
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,950
Fire fighting. Fire fighting.

357
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,830
Squat down.

358
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,920
Squat down.

359
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,230
Don't move, unless I ask you to move.

360
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:11,800
OK.

361
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,190
How dare you?

362
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,590
I didn't do it.

363
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,520
Catch her.

364
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,000
How dare you?

365
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,560
Young Master.

366
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,190
She's an assassin,

367
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,880
assassin.

368
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,230
What? Assassin?

369
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,430
There's no assassin here.

370
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,280
Young Master.

371
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,640
This woman is the assassin.

372
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,880
She set that fire just now.

373
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,520
Did you really see her setting on fire?

374
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,000
But, but we found only she's here.

375
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,040
If she didn't set the fire,

376
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,000
who set it?

377
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,070
Who set it?

378
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,470
Did I set it?

379
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,760
Oh, I see.

380
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,560
Young Master

381
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,280
set the fire.

382
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:21,760
Look.

383
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,800
Wow! The fire is burning.

384
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,560
Yes, it is so good.

385
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,920
But she's the...

386
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,920
Go to fight the fire.

387
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,640
Miss,

388
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,830
are you all right?

389
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,560
What a full moon today.

390
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,520
Miss.

391
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,070
You don't watch the moon at home.

392
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,590
Why do you come to my house and set the fire?

393
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,830
I...

394
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,640
You must have done it for fun.

395
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,760
I don't know why you would

396
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,680
burn in my house?

397
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,350
It's not important.

398
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,040
Look.

399
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,560
Anyway, it's all burnt to ashes.

400
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,680
Young Master.

401
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,800
Look at the growing fire.

402
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,310
It's not important.

403
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Look.

404
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,430
The fire is burning up all over the sky.

405
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:19,880
How beautiful it is.

406
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,950
I remember,

407
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,800
whenever I meet you several times,

408
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,350
it is always so enthusiastic and in a hurry.

409
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
Last time,

410
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,280
we saw the fireworks all over the sky.

411
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,920
This time it's a blazing fire.

412
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,310
Let's take this opportunity to know each other.

413
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,070
Let me introduce yourself.

414
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,830
My surname is Bai.

415
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
I don't know...

416
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,160
She leaves again in a hurry.

417
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,880
Stop.

418
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,230
So late at night,

419
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,430
where did you go?

420
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,230
Revenge.

421
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,830
Revenge?

422
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,000
You fought with someone again?

423
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,430
I'll kill you.

424
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,710
I...

425
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,760
Why do you stop?

426
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,760
Why don't you ask me why I fought,

427
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,110
whether I hurt or lost.

428
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,190
I don't want to ask.

429
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,710
You

430
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,470
visit whorehouse, restaurant,

431
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,800
or casino every day.

432
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,000
What you've done

433
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
is known to people

434
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,590
all over the city.

435
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,920
So I don't need to ask them.

436
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,520
I told you again and again

437
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,590
about the first rule of our family

438
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,710
No practicing martial arts.

439
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,000
If you get hurt,

440
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:00,230
I always feel guilty for your mother in heaven.

441
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,110
Are you wrong?

442
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,470
No.

443
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,800
Drag him away.

444
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,920
Slash him 30 times.

445
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,430
How dare you?

446
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,160
Why are you so weak?

447
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,830
Oh damn, Zhao Cuo.

448
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,190
You deserve it.

449
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,160
Don't think of my Young Master like this.

450
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,830
He is not bad.

451
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,520
Then how did he become like this?

452
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,640
He used not to be like this.

453
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,760
I am new comer here.

454
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,760
I just hear that

455
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,160
when Young Master was ten,

456
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,280
he got a serious illness.

457
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,830
And then he was changed completely.

458
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,760
After that,

459
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,040
the Master forbids him to leave the house

460
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,950
and always indulged him.

461
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,310
Ten years old.

462
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,560
Serious illness.

463
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,520
What about his mother?

464
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,920
When Young Master was born,

465
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,070
his mother died.

466
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,040
Leave me alone.

467
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,830
I am responsible for what I have done myself.

468
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,640
Put it down.

469
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,920
The Master is asleep.

470
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,310
Tell my dad,

471
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,760
I'm not afraid even if he adds more buckets.

472
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:20,680
Good.

473
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,160
None of your business.

474
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,470
You take your standing punishment.

475
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,920
I water my tree.

476
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,350
Obviously you are nosy.

477
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,000
Stand up.

478
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,950
She cares about him.

479
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:03,760
Not bad.

480
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,230
Noisy.

481
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,110
Don't move. Don't move.

482
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,070
You have one on your face.

483
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,710
Don't come over.

484
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,560
Don't come over.

485
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,280
Really sweet.

486
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,430
Too sweet.

487
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,040
Perfect match.

488
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Yes.

489
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,880
Really a good match.

490
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,520
I didn't expect Young Lord who is straight

491
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,680
to get along well with Young Lady.

492
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,070
Great.

493
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,160
Hurts.

494
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,280
Let go.

495
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,280
You.

496
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,430
Someone set fire

497
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,230
to the Bai family yesterday.

498
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
What is this?

499
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,430
Who?

500
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,920
It smells so good.

501
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,640
Smell it.

502
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,160
The smell of Steamed Buns with Pork and Scallion.

503
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,950
Hey.

504
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,760
You eat your species in the morning.

505
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,400
You are a pig.

506
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,470
Lord.

507
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,680
Let servants do this trivial.

508
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,230
Don't do this.

509
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,430
Sit down.

510
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,400
Master.

511
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,800
Why are you so polite today?

512
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,110
Just call me Xiaoling.

513
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,110
Why do I call you "nin (respectful you)."

514
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,430
Because you are on my heart.

515
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,800
Heart.

516
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,430
I'm stuffed.

517
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,830
Wait.

518
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,190
Did you forget something?

519
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,520
Wait.

520
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,160
I asked you whether

521
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,160
you forget something

522
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,760
very important.

523
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,470
Think carefully.

524
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,310
These 200 taels

525
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,880
are a little small sum,

526
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,000
but it's enough if I save.

527
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,070
Buddy,

528
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,800
I don't mind if you give me more.

529
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,760
Cut the crap.

530
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,800
I'm referring to my daughter-in-law.

531
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,520
Your wife.

532
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,000
Take her?

533
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,400
No way.

534
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,070
Young Master.

535
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,760
Master said

536
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,710
without his order,

537
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,760
you can't go out.

538
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,560
None of your business.

539
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:07,830
Step aside.

540
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,110
Young Master.

541
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,560
If you dare to break out,

542
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,430
we will hit you.

543
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,230
Hit you dead.

544
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,830
What did you have in the morning?

545
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,680
Courage fuel?

546
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,950
How dare you stop me!

547
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,280
Make way.

548
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,760
Young Master.

549
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,520
Young Master.

550
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,070
Young Master.

551
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,190
Eighteen Arhats Formation.

552
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,590
Let's go.

553
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,190
Jinxin,

554
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,430
don't rush back.

555
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,680
Play for a while.

556
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,070
Okay, thank you, dad.

557
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,070
Bye.

558
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,110
They young couple

559
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,000
are sweet as they just got married.

560
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,110
Sugar-coated haws.

561
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,400
Isn't that Zhao Mansion's new wife?

562
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,920
She looks pretty good.

563
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,430
Agreed.

564
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,710
They are a good match

565
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,160
What, where do we match?

566
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,560
Why do you look at me like this?

567
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,830
Because,

568
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,950
because of you.

569
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,430
What's wrong with me?

570
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,830
Because your dress makes me lose face.

571
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,520
Look at your

572
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,190
flowering

573
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:24,830
and magnificent dress.

574
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,280
Strangers may think my dad is a corrupt official.

575
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,000
I know.

576
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,110
Cheer up.

577
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,110
In addition.

578
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,070
When going out later,

579
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,350
don't say you are my wife.

580
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,950
Why?

581
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,800
Think about it.

582
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,000
People walking in martial arts circle

583
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,160
won't take their wives with them.

584
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,310
You want others to look down on me?

585
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,680
I can't let my husband be looked down on by others.

586
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,040
Correct.

587
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,430
Later outside our mansion,

588
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,470
tell them you are my maid

589
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,040
and called Little Wangba.

590
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,000
Little Wangba?

591
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,400
This name is too casual.

592
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,230
How about

593
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,190
you just call me Sanqi?

594
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,280
Sanqi?

595
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,560
You can say Tianqi (pseudo-ginseng).

596
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,310
Sanqi.

597
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,470
Cloth shop.

598
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,710
Go, go, go.

599
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
Boss.

600
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,350
What kind of fabric do you have here?

601
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,680
All kinds.

602
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,280
You must be picky about cloth.

603
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
I'll get good cloth for you.

604
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,070
No, no, no.

605
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,280
I just want to see

606
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,950
whether you have the cloth

607
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,160
apparently worn by maids.

608
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,560
Miss.

609
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,430
Did you come here to ruin my business?

610
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,710
All my goods are satin here.

611
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,520
How can I have coarse clothes?

612
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:50,950
Li Jia.

613
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,110
Miss Sanqi

614
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,160
is different.

615
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,760
She likes coarse clothes.

616
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,950
Yes or no?

617
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,430
Yes, yes, yes.

618
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,040
I'll get the

619
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,150
worse cloth in the shop.

620
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,360
Please wait.

621
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,320
I still have something to do.

622
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,760
Take your time here.

623
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,949
I've already paid.

624
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:25,600
I will first…

625
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,150
Where are you going?

626
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,120
Your dad said

627
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,360
I have to keep watch on you.

628
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,280
You can't leave

629
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,870
half step within my sight.

630
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,150
Otherwise,

631
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,080
your ass…

632
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,630
How can I leave you?

633
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,560
I'm just going out to see

634
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,670
whether these is something delicious.

635
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,360
I'm afraid you will be hungry.

636
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,870
Right?

637
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,760
Is it, Li Jia?

638
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,469
Correct.

639
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,190
Hurry up.

640
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,280
Young Master.

641
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,040
Do you have face now?

642
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,760
Make way. Make way. Make way.

643
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,630
Women are

644
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,630
trouble sources.

645
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,000
It seems that I will miss

646
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,430
today's performance in Full Moon House.

647
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,040
Young Master.

648
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,600
I have a trick.

649
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,040
You must be able to go.

650
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,670
Hold on.

651
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Are you crazy?

652
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,120
What are you doing?

653
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,520
With her dragging Young Lady,

654
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,600
we can…

655
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,430
What can we do?

656
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,190
I'll take this.

657
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,800
Where is my wallet?

658
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,560
You wild girl.

659
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,870
How dare you steal my wallet!

660
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,600
She stole my wallet.

661
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,320
It's her.

662
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,600
I didn't.

663
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,950
You were standing here.

664
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,710
Who else besides you?

665
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,190
This girl is so stupid.

666
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,280
What if something goes wrong?

667
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,470
Don't worry.

668
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,470
When she can figure out Young Lady's identity,

669
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,670
she will dare not make trouble.

670
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,150
Let's go.

671
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,950
Go.

672
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,870
Let's go.

673
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,000
Miss Leimo has been waiting for you for a long time.

674
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,230
This woman stole my wallet.

675
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,390
Go. Go to yamen with me.

676
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,600
So many people present.

677
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,080
Why do you say it is me?

678
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,760
You actually refused to acknowledge it.

679
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,040
Here are all ladies.

680
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,040
They are friends.

681
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,910
But who are you?

682
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,430
She stole my wallet.

683
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,230
Let me go.

684
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,040
Zhao Cuo.

685
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,950
Zhao Cuo.

686
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:47,390
I'm a maid of Zhao Cuo from Taifu Magistrate .

687
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,150
Although I'm a maid,

688
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,950
I won't do anything sneaky

689
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,670
to disgrace the Zhao family.

690
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,760
Who is sneaky?

691
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,430
Watch your mouth.

692
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,800
Let me teach you a lesson.

693
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,710
Let go of that girl.

694
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,120
Don't worry.

695
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,670
I'm here.

696
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,040
This lady,

697
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,840
did you lose one

698
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,470
golden silk wallet?

699
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,190
What golden silk?

700
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,000
There are silver tickets of 100 taels inside, right?

701
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,950
I found this wallet nearby below.

702
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,000
It just contains the right sum of money.

703
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,280
Exactly 100 taels.

704
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,430
I return it to you now.

705
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,470
Also please prove that

706
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,870
this girl is innocent.

707
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,430
Yes. Yes. Yes.

708
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,560
Miss.

709
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,280
I wrong you.

710
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,470
Sorry. Sorry.

711
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,560
Dismiss. Dismiss.

712
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:36,870
Misunderstanding.

713
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,800
Go, go, go.

714
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,150
Dismiss. Dismiss.

715
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,360
Miss, you must be scared.

716
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,710
Where is your home?

717
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,600
I can send you back.

718
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,710
Just Face,

719
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,360
why are you so dirty?

720
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,910
Do you think you are noble?

721
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,630
Zhao Cuo.

722
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,430
Do you have anything

723
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,390
to do with her?

724
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,840
Why can't I send her back?

725
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,840
Sanqi.

726
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,430
He inquires about

727
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,520
our relationship.

728
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:19,910
Greet me.

729
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,390
Who am I to you?

730
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,230
Young Master.

731
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,150
Come over.

732
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,520
Mr. Bai,

733
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,520
thanks again for your help today.

734
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
Thank you so much.

735
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,560
So you are called Sanqi.

736
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
It's really a good name.

737
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,230
It turns out that you are acquaintances.

738
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Li Jia.

739
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,000
You saw it.

740
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,470
I called her back, but she refused.

741
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,080
Let's go back and tell the truth.

742
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,120
You look back first

743
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,430
to see if she chases us.

744
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:23,800
Young Master.

745
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,430
Both Mr. Bai and Young Lady have gone away.

746
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,190
They left together?

747
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,190
Damn it.

748
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,800
Young Master.

749
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,950
All right.

750
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,430
Go.

751
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,150
Go.

752
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,800
Go.

753
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,040
Damn Zhao Cuo.

754
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,670
He actually left me alone.

755
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,950
Recalling back,

756
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,470
every time, we meet

757
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,670
in an amazing way.

758
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,280
Miss,

759
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,910
you are wonderful.

760
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,080
Sorry.

761
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,040
I always

762
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,390
bother you each time.

763
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,320
No.

764
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,150
These troubles

765
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,390
should be more.

766
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,910
I mean,

767
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,190
it turns out that you are Zhao family's maid.

768
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,190
No offense.

769
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,320
Zhao Cuo

770
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,280
is willful and demanding.

771
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,320
You don't

772
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,840
have to suffer.

773
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,320
You don't understand Zhao Cuo.

774
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,600
Why do you speak ill of him?

775
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,120
I thought you were a good man.

776
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,870
I was rude.

777
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,470
I'm sorry.

778
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,040
I mean

779
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,670
you don't have to do labor.

780
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,230
I can redeem you.

781
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,670
You can follow me

782
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,800
and keep me companion when I study.

783
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,280
What do you think?

784
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:50,910
No need.

785
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,870
Zhao Cuo and I are friends.

786
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,840
The most important thing to being loyal to friends.

787
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,950
I won't leave him.

788
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,040
You are really different.

789
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,710
I'll send you back next.

790
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,910
No, no, no.

791
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,390
I'll send you home first.

792
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,040
All men escort women.

793
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,840
How can a woman escort a man?

794
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,800
I'll take you home.

795
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,430
No.

796
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,870
I can't go back yet.

797
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,520
Why?

798
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,670
Zhao Cuo must be hanging out.

799
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,230
If I return home alone,

800
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,760
Master will question me.

801
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,320
I have to wait for him to go back.

802
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,470
Then when will he go home?

803
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,390
Well,

804
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,470
I know a place.

805
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,080
Tonight,

806
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,230
many celebrities

807
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,190
and rich men will go there.

808
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,190
Zhao Cuo will definitely go there too.

809
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,840
Then you better take me with you.

810
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,470
Be careful. Be careful.

811
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:00,870
This is very expensive.

812
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,560
Yeah.

813
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,280
Watch out. Watch out.

814
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,360
Mr. Yang.

815
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,870
What wind blows you here?

816
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,950
I come for Leimo.

817
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:12,600
Make way.

818
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,710
Leimo is making up.

819
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,000
She can't entertain guests now.

820
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,670
Would you like to rest on the view platform for a while?

821
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,390
Cut the crap.

822
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,430
Miss Leimo.

823
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,670
I am dressing.

824
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,950
Mr. Yang is so anxious to see me.

825
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,840
Is there anything urgent?

826
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,630
Stop pretending.

827
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,040
Aren't you clear

828
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,230
of what I want to do?

829
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,230
Don't do that.

830
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,670
I made an appointment with Zhao Cuo.

831
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,520
He will come soon.

832
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:41,950
It's Zhao Cuo again.

833
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,560
Okay.

834
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,560
Today I will taste

835
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,710
Zhao Cuo's woman

836
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,120
to check the difference from others.

837
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,560
Mr. Zhao.

838
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,430
Miss is inconvenient to meet guests now.

839
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:13,470
Miss asked me to bring a word to you.

840
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,080
She has

841
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,520
prepared a viewing boat

842
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,360
for you to view the scenery.

843
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,040
Young Master.

844
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,120
Miss Leimo

845
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,000
treats you differently.

846
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,360
Well,

847
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,080
go back at the door of the house

848
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:27,870
to clock that fool.

849
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,040
No ah.

850
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,390
If she goes back earlier than us,

851
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,560
my dad would know

852
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,320
we dumped her.

853
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,150
Hurry up.

854
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,430
Mr. Zhao, please.

855
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,870
This is a grand event for the Full Spring Festival.

856
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,600
Full Spring Festival?

857
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:57,950
After the Peach Blossom Festival,

858
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,870
to celebrate love and marriage,

859
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:01,520
people come here specially.

860
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:04,760
They will put paper boats into rivers to thank for realizing wishes.

861
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:08,360
It's specially held in this moat this year.

862
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,120
It's novel.

863
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:11,840
So beautiful.

864
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,520
Look at those lanterns

865
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,950
and the stars in the sky.

866
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:15,560
So nice.

867
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,150
You can write down your wishes on

868
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,600
these wishing lanterns.

869
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,280
After they fly to the sky,

870
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,840
gods in heaven will bless everyone

871
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,520
to realize dreams.

872
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:29,600
Miss Sanqi,

873
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:31,360
do you have any wish?

874
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,670
God.

875
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,950
Bless my brother

876
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,040
could remember me earlier

877
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,870
and come to recognize me.

878
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,800
Make way. Make way.

879
00:45:52,910 --> 00:46:04,360
Leimo. Leimo. Leimo.

880
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:15,390
I live upstream

881
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,760
and you downstream.

882
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,000
From night to night of you I dream.

883
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,120
What is this song?

884
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,470
Isn't it that song

885
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:28,840
sung by Sifu Troupe 3 years ago?

886
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,470
I remember after the fire,

887
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:32,710
this music score is lost.

888
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,000
Why today…

889
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,950
How unlucky!

890
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,040
Go, go, go.

891
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,870
Don't get unlucky.

892
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:38,710
Go, go, go.

893
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,600
Sifu Troupe?

894
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:44,840
Three years ago,

895
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:46,910
Sifu Troupe came to

896
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:47,760
perform in southern city

897
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:50,190
and played this song.

898
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,040
The performance was particularly smooth at the time,

899
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,040
causing a sensation.

900
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:55,800
But unexpectedly,

901
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:58,040
a fire at night

902
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,190
burned all members of the troupe dead.

903
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:01,280
Look!

904
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:01,710
Someone jumped into the river!

905
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:05,470
What happened?

906
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,190
Isn't that Yang Yong?

907
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,080
Yang Yong. Yang Yong.

908
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,080
Yong.

909
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,600
Isn't that Yang Yong?

910
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:21,470
Someone jumped into the river.

911
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:24,950
He couldn't stand up firmly.

912
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,150
He jumped.

913
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,120
Save him! Save him!

914
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,230
Save him now!

915
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:30,950
Too scary.

916
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:31,670
Someone jumped into the river.

917
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:32,280
Save him now!
