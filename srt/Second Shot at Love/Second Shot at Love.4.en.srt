It's rare to see Jang Beom June live in Bochun.

364
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,040
I'm so disappointed.

365
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,710
Y-Yeah, totally…

366
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,130
It'd be magical to hear him sing live.

00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,250
I should've been ready to click for tickets.

379
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,080
I can't believe I forgot.

380
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,240
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,340

383
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,410
How is it? Came out great, right?

384
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,560
Yes, I guess.

385
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,610
Not just anyone gets
to give a county office lecture.

386
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,910
It's impressive.

387
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,410
"He's so handsome. He's Bochun's idol."

388
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,250
The women at the county office
are losing it over you.

389
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,760
They're all going to the lecture to see you.
[Alcoholism, Perhaps It's Your Story]

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,700
Even the female employees who don't drink.

391
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,550
Daebak, it's nearly a fan meet-up.

392
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,910
Doctor?

393
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,030
Doctor?

394
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,270
Yes?

395
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,260
What are you thinking...

396
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,510
Oh, it's nothing. Go ahead and get back to work.

397
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,900
Okay, then.

398
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,180
<i>I'm giving a lecture

399
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,630
<i>Come.</i>

400
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,650
Yeah, right. Like she'd come.

401
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,990
Yes, ma'am.

402
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,140
What?

403
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,720
<i>You want us to go where?</i>

404
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,110
To the county office.

405
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,650
Ui Jun is giving a talk on alcoholism tonight.

406
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,420
He invited all three of you.

407
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,740
He said it's good to start
with a low-pressure lecture.

408
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,650
No thanks. Why would I go there?

409
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,000
What? Why not?

410
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,250
I already told you, Mom.

411
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,160
Don't try to stop me from drinking.

412
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,830
I'm not going. No way.

413
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,540
Not going? Not going?

414
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,120
Says who? Says who?

415
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,690
<i>With love...</i>

My sweet baby girl.

417
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,200
You'd better go while I'm asking nicely, okay?

418
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,770
And you two as well.

419
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:02,190
Keep in mind, already-signed divorce
paperwork is sitting over there.

420
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,000
Understood?

421
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,800
I love you.

422
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,690
I love you.

423
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,470
Hey, what's up with your mom?

424
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,810
I really thought we were getting
smacked this time.

425
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,420
That's not important right now.

426
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,270
A lecture? Out of nowhere?

427
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,100
Seriously, Seo Ui Jun...

428
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,620
"I blacked out after drinking."

429
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,530
"I don't remember anything."

430
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,000
If you love drinking, you've probably

431
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,100
said that at least once.

432
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,840
Losing memory after drinking

433
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,780
is called blacking out.

434
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,800
Blackouts are an early sign of alcohol addiction.

435
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,560
They're your body's way of sending a warning.

436
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,990
<i>He's saying that to me.</i>

437
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,630
<i>I thought he wasn't going to force me.</i>

438
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,610
<i>- But here he is, forcing me.</i>
- Alcohol is...

439
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,930
<i>What did I say exactly?</i>

440
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,970
<i>Did I say something important?</i>

441
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,730
<i>Is he pissed because I don't remember it?</i>

442
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,470
Ui Jun.

443
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,870
Yeah?

444
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,400
Want to sleep with me?

445
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,620
Gosh, no way!

446
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,700
<i>- Under the affect of...</i>
- Could I really be an alcoholic?

447
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,090
<i>Blackouts lead to all kinds
of serious problems.</i>

448
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,740
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

449
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,880
<i>I was drunk, sure,</i>

450
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,950
<i>but there's no way I said such a thing to him.</i>

451
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,470
<i>And even if I did, he would've cut me off again.</i>

452
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,990
So, why did Ui Jun quit drinking anyway?

453
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,090
Don't know. I asked and he just told me off.

454
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,690
Dad, please.

455
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,780
You think I want to be like this?

456
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,170
Weren't you falling asleep?

457
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,560
- Of course, I was.
- Right?

458
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,130
Wow!

459
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,400
- Ui Jun, you were great. Right?
- Yeah.

460
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,190
- Thank you. Was it okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

461
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,270
Doctor, your lecture was amazing!

462
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,690
Doctor, you're so handsome!

463
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,750
- You're the best!
- He's so cool.

464
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,130
You're popular with the ladies.

465
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,280
They're all county office employees.

466
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,360
I think they all came to see my face.

467
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,970
Mr. Handsome, we need a photo.

468
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,990
Mom wants photo proof.

469
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,580
Sorry, I don't really like taking pictures-

470
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,320
Cut the crap and take it.

471
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,420
One, two, three.

472
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,320
Got it. Let's see.

473
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,450
Hey, come here.

474
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,530
Did I say something really bad that day?

475
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,610
- What?
- Isn't that why you're using my mom

476
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,550
to make me come to your lecture,
so I quit drinking?

477
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,500
Geez, you think I would've
called you to the lecture?

478
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,570
I would've called a lawyer instead.

479
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,320
Then, why are you doing this?

480
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,580
I wanted you to listen to my superb lecture,

481
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,260
feel a deep awakening from your gut

482
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,520
that helps you realize

483
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,420
you shouldn't live like this and change your ways.

484
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,930
Forget it.

485
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,230
Unni, Dad, let's go.

486
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,010
No more lectures for me.

487
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,390
- Bye.
- You were great.

488
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,950
Wait up.

489
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,540
You're really going to tell her that?

490
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,600
Yes. I'd better push while she's softened up.

491
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,160
I can't live like this anymore.

492
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,920
Totally agree.

493
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,820
Great timing.

494
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,930
Agreed.

495
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,130
- Okay. Let's do it!
- Deal.

496
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,290
Let's go.

497
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,130
Just a second. Just...

498
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,860
So, did you all pay attention to the lecture?

499
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,230
<i>Of course.</i>

500
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,750
Good work, everyone.

501
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,070
It's a month-long program.

502
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,350
Don't miss it, stick with it, and quit drinking.

503
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,460
Love you all.

504
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,880
Mom.

505
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,370
Do you really love us?

506
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,810
Of course.

507
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,950
Then,

508
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,920
you want us to be happy, right?

509
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,260
And you wouldn't want us

510
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,570
to do things just to please you, right?

511
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,440
Sure. Right.

512
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,690
So, what is it you want to say, everyone?

513
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,670
<i>God changed Mom</i>

514
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,960
<i>and gave us courage.</i>

515
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,280
We're not going to the lecture...

516
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,710
Ma'am.

517
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,610
What?

518
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,730
<i>With love...</i>

519
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,470
<i>With love...</i>

00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,640
<i>- With love...</i>
- Fine.

521
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,750
I guess you might not want to go.

522
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,630
But I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.

523
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,690
Love you all.

524
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,060
<i>Mom's change only made us bolder.</i>

525
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,150
To be completely honest...

526
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,130
I'm humiliated.

527
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,170
It's so degrading to be
treated like a patient by Ui Jun.

528
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,560
Whatever, I'm never going back.

529
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,790
Me neither! No, no, I'm not going. No way!

530
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,240
Listening to the lecture just
made me want to drink more.

531
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,100
To be honest...

532
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,420
With love, with love...

00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,210

535
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,750
Forget it. Bullshit!

536
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,140
I can't. I can't do this anymore.

537
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,710
I'd rather burn in hellfire! Crazy!

538
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,800
<i>And it led to a huge disaster.</i>

539
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,930
Forget love. What you people need is a beating.

540
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:46,760
