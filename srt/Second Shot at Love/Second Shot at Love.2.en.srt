189

and plate the fender.

191
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,010
What you should snap out of is booze.

192
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,370
I can't believe you hurt Ui Jun.

193
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,930
I think the radiator needs work, too.

194
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,830
Your drinking habits are what needs work.

195
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,880
I can't believe you broke Ui Jun's leg.

196
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,990
The bonnet is slightly twisted from the impact.

197
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,300
The relationship between you and the
townspeople is what's twisted!

198
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,690
- What will you do now?
- Stop overreacting.

199
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,080
I didn't break the Bochun Bridge.

200
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,830
Why would my relationship
with townspeople be twisted?

201

Gosh, I didn't mean to sell it.

367
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,000
Geum Ju begged me.

368
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,750
You know this. Geum Ju goes crazy for booze...

369
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,590

<i>No, we don't get it!</i>

378

Why do we have to pay for it?

379
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,180
It's driving me crazy that I can't drink at home.

380
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,590
Now, I can't even drink in town?

381
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,550

00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,270

What kind of a mom are you?

388
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,350
I was just trying to survive. To survive.

389
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,040

390

my heart and body while raising the twins.

391

to raise them alone.

So, stop drinking.

393
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,200

394
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,580

Gwang Ok, listen to me.

401
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,450
He was set on getting me drunk.

402
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,640
To get me to sign.

403
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,200
Is that my fault? Or his?

404
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,580
It was his fault.

405
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,320

00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,910
I'm only sharing it with you.

544
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,280
Come back here when

545
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,700
you're suffering.

546
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,950

[Today's drinking snack: Yeosu rock octopus]

548
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,680
Here.

549
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,890
Where's the rock octopus from?

550
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,140
My older brother who fishes in Yeosu sent some.

551
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,100
Doesn't it look delicious?

552
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,510
That's why I called you up.

553
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,560
We couldn't enjoy this special dish without you.

554
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,490
Try some, and down a glass.

555
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,140
I'm good.

556
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,620
A special dish shines

557
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,920
only when it is paired with liquor.

558
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,010
I cannot drink.

559
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,210

560
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,720
Gosh, seriously.

561
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,580
Take a seat.

562
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,200
Come on, sit.

563
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,360
Why can't you drink?

564
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,560
How would your wife know

565
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,550
if we kept it a secret? Right?

566
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,890
Yes, that's right.

567
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,550
Go ahead.

568
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,180
Bottoms up.

569
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,790
Even if your wife catches me

570
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,970
and I need to fold my business,

571
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,630
I can't give up drinking with you.

572
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,300
Getting together with you guys

573
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,530
for a humble drink in the evening

574
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,870
is the greatest joy of my life. I can't give that up.

575
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,170

576
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,810

Here, here.

579
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,370
- So sweet.
- Sweet, right?

580
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,670
Sweet!

581
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:05,580
Wow, the booze tastes like plain water.

582
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,310
Oh, does it?

583
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,760
Well...

584
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,740
that's because it is plain water!

585
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,510
Gotcha! I gotcha!

586
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,620
I put this here like this...

587
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,230
- Are you crazy?
- We shouldn't have done this.

588
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,480
Why? It's fun.

589
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,200
I can give up drinking with you,

590
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,540
but I can't give up quick loans from your wife.

591
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,940
Why would I give up on my business?

592
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,410
Aigoo, aigoo, what?

593
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,700
Come here, you bastard. You're dead.

594

Catch me before you kill me.

595
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,450
Come here.

596
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,140
Come at me!

597
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,390
Look, you're so slow!

598
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,340
Where are you going?

599
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,340
It's bath time! Get over here!

600

601
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,460
Gotcha! Let's go.

602
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,480
You're going to smell if you don't bathe.

606

What are you doing here instead of sleeping?

607
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,700
Oh...

608
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,440
I can't sleep.

609
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,610

I really want to empty my head...

615
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,730
I completely agree.

616
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:08,540
I feel like quitting drinking
cold turkey is a bad method.

617
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,120
We better find a different way. Right?

618

- You said you were going to break up with me.

905
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:35,610
You knew all along?

906
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,570
<i>Let me set this straight.</i>

907
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:40,280
<i>I broke off this engagement.</i>

908
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,890
<i>I broke up with you.</i>

909
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:46,030
<i>Because you're worse
than booze to me, bastard.</i>

910
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,460
I was hoping to keep my ego intact,

911
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,720
but I guess not.

912
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:58,560
I have nothing to say.

913
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,190
Whatever.

914
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,280
I'm grateful to the gods

915
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,850
that I didn't marry an ass like you.

916
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,830
Hey.

917
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,640
Happy birthday.

918
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,920
Though I wish a son of a bitch
like you were never born.

919
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,400
Hey, Han Geum Ju.

920
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,830
- What are you doing right now?
- Shut up.

921
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,810
I want to kill you,

922
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:33,880
but I'll leave it at this
because I pity your unborn child.

923
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,900
Get your life together.

924
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:39,000
For the sake of your kid.

925

Got it?

926
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:42,920
Hey.

927
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,600
How dare you speak to me that way?

928
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,760
- What?
- Don't you dare cross a line.

929
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,210
You get your life together.

930
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:58,140
Don't get taken advantage of like this.

931
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,590

- You take care of yourself.

936
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,980
Focus on your issues.

937
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,300
Don't stick your nose in my issues.

938
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,100
Yeah?

939
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,160
Well, he's not wrong.

940
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,610
Be honest.

941
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:21,720
You're vying for the Bochun mayor spot, aren't you?

942
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,080
Speak plainly.

943
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,060
If it's not that,

944

why are you visiting patients like you're preparing

945
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:28,370

946

No, I don't want to. I'm tired.

Who is this? I'm not expecting any calls.

955

Oh, I wonder if Geum Ju took
care of urgent business.

956
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,680
Hey.

957
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,830
Yes. What's up?

958
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:09,990
Yeah?

959
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:13,130
Wow! You took care of a big thing!

960
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:16,660
Okay, got it. Good job. Bye.

961
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,420
What did Geum Ju say?

962
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,580
What was the business?

963
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,910
What do you mean, Geum Ju?
That was Young Woong.

964
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:28,680
- What?
- He was debating whether to order

965
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,710
onion crunch, his favorite,
or scallion crunch, my favorite,

966
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:33,540
and he ordered both, so we don't fight.

967
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,470
Such important business.

968
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:45,140
Our friendship is quite crunchy, isn't it?

969
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,420
I don't want to be friends with you guys.

970
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,120
Were you waiting for Geum Ju to call?

971
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,430
I'm just curious.

972
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,320
You said she jetted off.

973
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,860
I'm worried if it's something bad
happened like you said.

974
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,110
You call her if you're so worried.

975
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:15,470
- We're here.
- Thank you.

976
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,610
Huh? Isn't that Geum Ju?

977
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,210
What are you doing here?

978
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:36,870
I'm going to go inside once I sober up.

979
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,390
What are you doing here?

980
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,340

982
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,710
Party?

983
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,440
I was wondering where you were running off to.

984
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,010
It was a party?

985
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,750
You went all the way to Seoul
since you can't drink in Bochun?

986
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:58,150
That's not it.

987
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,860
You're here, too?

988
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,270
Yes, he's here, too.

989
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:09,480
He was so worried about you.

990
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,160
- Why?
- It was all for naught.

991
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,360
All for naught.

992
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,790
Come on. Let's go.

993
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:18,730
I'm sorry.

994

You're misunderstanding.

995
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:29,300
I had an inevitable situation.

996
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,910
What?

997
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:32,840
Inevitable situation?

998
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,600
Hey, whatever that was,

999
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,340
it sounds like it was
a great chance for you to drink.

1002
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,420
Quit drinking.

Become a decent person.

00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,210
Fine.

1006
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:25,050
I want to become a decent person, too,

1007
