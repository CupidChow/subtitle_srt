00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,650
But he looked tired, so I told him to rest.

187
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,140
I said I'd stay by your side.

188
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,960
He must be struggling.

189
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,770
I think...

190
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,470
he just needs some time.

191
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,800
You'll stay by Dr. Seo's side, right?

192
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,570
No matter what happens.

193
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,540
Pardon?

194
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,860
Please help him

195
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,890
hold on to the happiness he finally found.

196
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,320
I'm worried

197
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,740
that he'll push you away again.

198
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,310
What do you mean to push me away again?

199
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:46,190
♫ Amongst strangers ♫

200
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,910
♫ Hiding my loneliness ♫

201
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,910
♫ Under the pouring rain ♫

202
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,650
♫ I hide my wet eyes ♫

203
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,820
I'm worried

204
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,230
that he'll push you away again.

205
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,690
♫ I regret, lonely ♫

206
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:29,850
♫ I can't turn back the time that is long gone ♫

207
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,620
♫ Becomes the shade of life ♫

208
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,260
I'm working late tonight.

209
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,540
Make sure you eat, even if your heart feels heavy.

210
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,500
That's how you stay strong.

211
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,760
One thing's for sure. Only happiness awaits.

212
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,790
Let's be happy.

213
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,700
Can I really?

214
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,850
What if you end up in danger, too?

215
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,030
What's this, Seo Ui Jun? Not even replying...

216
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,090
Where's a porridge place nearby...

217
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,990
Hi, Mom.

218
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,680
I got some porridge for Ms. Baek.

219
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,080
She can't eat regular food for a while.

220
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,660
Okay.

221
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,620
- Ui Jun.
- Are you okay?

222
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,590
What's with you, man?

223
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,790
Hey, Seon Uk. Hey, are you okay?

224
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,270
[Seon Uk]
I'm leaving to get some air.

225
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,410
I asked Master Kim to look
after the taekwondo studio.

226
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,990
Don't worry.

227
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,700
- Auntie.
- Yes, Hwa Yeong.

228
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,320
- You're here.
- You can stay lying down.

229
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,630
I'm okay.

230
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,460
Hwa Yeong, want to go play with Auntie?

231
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,250
Yes, sounds good.

232
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,740
Mom, feel better soon.

233
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,930
Okay.

234
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,070
Let's go, Auntie.

235
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,370
Gosh, so cute. See you later.

236
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,930
My baby.

237
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,840
I heard you're feeling weak and exhausted.

238
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,140
Your father-in-law personally brewed
this 6-year-old red ginseng.

239
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,080
He sent me to feed it to you.

240
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,330
You're so lucky to get treated like this.

241
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,670
No, I don't deserve this kind of treatment.

242
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,810
Look at you, speaking the truth for once.

243
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,530
Gosh, my legs...

244
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,860
What's this? "I'm leaving to get some air"?

245
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,320
Goodness...

246
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,840
Mother...

247
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,270
Yes?

248
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,000
I think...

249
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,680
I'm being punished.

250
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,400
For driving a nail into your heart.

251
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,100
What are you saying now?

252
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,220
Seon Uk likes...

253
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,740
Hyeon Ju.

254
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,120
He left home because I was against it.

255
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,580
What?

256
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,770
I dated Yeong Woong against your wishes.

257
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,400
And now I'm paying for it. Every bit of it.

258
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,780
That's enough.

259
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,050
You're not being punished.

260
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,200
Let me be honest.

261
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,300
I regretted it a lot.

262
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,750
Saying harsh things to you
and opposing your marriage.

263
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,140
What?

264
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,400
Maybe it's because he met his soulmate.

265
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,900
When I see my son living his happiest life,

266
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,700
gosh, I realize I was stubborn for no reason.

267
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,040
If I had accepted you from the start,

268
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,380
I thought we could've been closer, too.

269
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,290
Mother...

270
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,590
But still, I kept snapping whenever I saw you.

271
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,970
If I didn't, it felt like I was
admitting I was wrong.

272
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,280
It hurt my pride, too.

273
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,130
Seon Hwa.

274
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,450
You can't stop it even if you stop them.

275
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,240
You can't split them up even if you tried.

276
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,180
You know better than anyone. Right?

277
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,210
Cheer them on.

278
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,730
Don't live to regret it like me.

279
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,110
Mother...

280
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,430
Aigoo...

281
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,170
Stop crying away all your strength.

282
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,070
Aigoo...

283
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,110
Where is that rascal,

284
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,590
after upsetting his sister this much?

285
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,230
Aigoo...

286
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,990
Hey, slow down, slow down.

287
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,710
I told you, it's my first meal in two days.

288
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,410
So, who told you to lose your bag
when you got to Seoul?

289
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,450
No phone, no wallet...

290
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,150
How can you show up looking homeless?

291
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,380
What do you mean?

292
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,240
I made it here, and that's why
you're buying me food right now.

293
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,890
Geez.

294
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,320
Yes, Detective.

295
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,800
No, he hasn't shown up.

296
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,970
You're still tracking him, right?

297
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,270
What's all that about?

298
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,560
Yes.

299
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,720
I'll come to the station tomorrow.

300
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,290
And...

301
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,390
how is the investigation into
Jeongjik Nursing Home going?

302
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,170
What?

303
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,690
Really?

304
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,350
Ms. Baek is his mom?

305
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,300
So, is Ms. Baek okay?

306
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,400
Yeah, thankfully.

307
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,780
And Ui Jun's dad is still missing?

308
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,680
You think we'd be here if we knew?

309
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,060
Just shut up and eat.

310
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,080
I'm only telling you so you stop acting clueless.

311
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,830
Fine.

312
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,670
I'm not all that thoughtless, you know.

313
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,860
Then, why did you run away
from home in your thirties?

314
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,630
I told you I didn't run away.

315
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:03,060
I told you I came to Seoul to clear my head.

316
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,230
I didn't think I could collect
my thoughts in Bochun.

317
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,420
What do you mean collect your thoughts?

318
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,170
Are you talking about my sister right now?

319
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,300
- You knew?
- I didn't want to know.

320
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,750
Seon Hwa and my sister's
30-year friendship was shattered.

321
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,270
All because of you. What's this?

322
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,100
Yeah.

323
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,920
It's all my fault.

324
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,070
No matter how hard my sister pushed back,

325
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,420
I didn't think she could break my will.

326
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,030
I swore I'd never give up on Hyeon Ju,
even if it killed me.

327
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,180
I swore I'd dedicate

328
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,360
the rest of my life to make Hyeon Ju happy.

329
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,790
But that resolve...

330
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,950
My stubbornness...

331
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,950
didn't bring her happiness.

332
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,210
I didn't know it'd cause her pain
she can never heal from.

333
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,860
So, I decided to let go of my feelings.

334
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,440
But Geum Ju...

335
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,410
I'm not confident.

336
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,950
It's too hard.

337
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,810
I might die of a broken heart.

338
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,040
I'm sorry.

339
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,110
You must be dealing with a lot with Ui Jun.

340
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,810
You should've called if you
were coming to my office.

341
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,110
Yeah, that didn't even cross my mind.

342
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,360
All I thought about was seeing
you as soon as possible.

343
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,030
Why?

344
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,940
I was worried.

345
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,110
I was worried about you.

346
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,980
I was more worried.

347
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,340
That you might cut me off again.

348
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,850
I'm worried

349
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,980
that he'll push you away again.

350
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,200
What do you mean to push me away again?

351
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,540
I heard it was because of him that time, too.

352
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,320
Because he was scared that he'd hurt you.

353
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,120
[I love you, Han Geum Ju]

354
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,070
Get the money ready.

355
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,560
Or else,

356
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,670
I'll go find her.

357
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:57,660
Mind your own business. Tend to your own problems.

358
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,100
Quit meddling in other people's issues.

359
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,120
You did that because you thought I might get hurt.

360
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,540
That's why...

361
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,630
you couldn't even give me this back then,

362
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,160
and just walked away...

363
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,980
After what Ms. Baek told me,

364
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,080
I started worrying...

365
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,930
"What if he pushes me away again?"

366
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,770
You have no idea how much I worried.

367
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,260
That will never happen again.

368
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,130
Now, I'll protect you.

369
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,160
I will protect you.

370
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,450
Forget it.

371
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,160
I'll protect myself.

372
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,790
I'm Han Geum Ju.

373
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,200
You saw me earlier, right?

374
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,370
I almost knocked out

375
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,540
Seon Uk using my street fighter skills.

376
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,720
That's who I am. So, don't worry.

377
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,920
Okay.

378
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,390
And I'll protect you, too.

379
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,830
Huh?

380
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,250
So,

381
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:18,410
don't even think about leaving my side.

382
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,390
No matter what happens.

383
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,840
Got it?

384
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,250
That's reassuring.

385
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,830
You bet.

386
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,720
[Bochun Chicken Soup]

387
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,230
What's this?

388
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,730
I heard Seon Hwa is sick.

389
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,450
She always says their chicken
soup gives her strength.

390
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,770
Instead of this,

391
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,180
what if you gave it to her yourself?

392
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,590
You know I can't.

393
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,020
What if seeing me spikes her blood pressure?

394
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,110
So, don't tell her this is from me.

395
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,870
What are you doing?

396
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,180
Seon Hwa, I told you to rest at home.

397
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,910
It's okay.

398
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,960
Are you feeling okay?

399
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,250
What do you care?

400
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,430
Why did you bring that?

401
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,210
Did you forget we're no longer friends?

402
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,380
What do you mean "we"?

403
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,840
You cut me off, but I didn't.

404
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,610
What?

405
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,720
Once time passes...

406
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,570
and Seon Uk meets a nice woman,

407
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,730
and once you feel better about it,

408
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,370
we can be friends again...

409
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,210
I'll wait until then.

410
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,700
Seon Uk is so worried about you.

411
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,070
He asked me to understand you

412
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,180
and go back to how we were before.

413
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,540
He hates that you might be lonely.

414
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,320
He cares about you a lot.

415
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,380
Because he's so thoughtful,

416
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,730
that's probably why I wavered with Seon Uk.

417
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,390
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

418
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,290
I just couldn't bring myself to say it.

419
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,970
I thought I could take care
of it before you found out.

420
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,390
So, I let go of my feelings,

421
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:46,380
and I thought it was all over...

422
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,290
That jerk...

423
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,030
ran away from home.

424
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,120
What?

425
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,790
Hyeon Ju, come here.

426
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,250
Have a sip. This is quince tea.

427
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,330
Smells amazing.

428
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,970
Thank you.

429
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,690
You used to keep this cup on display
because it's so expensive.

430
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,840
Right?

431
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,620
It's not like I can take it with me when I die.

432
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,270
I don't know why I did that.

433
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,920
Lying in the hospital bed,

434
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,100
thinking I might die,

435
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,790
I started regretting all sorts of things.

436
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,890
Like saving a stupid cup for later,

437
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,940
or eating pork instead of beef
on my birthday last year.

438
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,110
I had so many regrets.

439
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,880
Really?

440
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,800
But amidst everything, there was
one thing I didn't regret.

441
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,420
What was that?

442
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,750
Marrying your father.

443
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,500
Really?

444
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,250
You know, I was the eldest daughter

445
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,910
of a single mom with many younger siblings.

446
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,450
Your dad was the eldest son of a rich family.

447
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,350
He clung to me so hard until his opposing family

448
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,340
finally came around.

449
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,080
But I still refused.

450
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,340
I remember.

451
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,220
But why did you act like that back then?

452
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,650
Because I thought he was too good for me.

453
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,950
I thought I'd ruin his life.

454
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,780
So, how did you end up marrying him?

455
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,700
Weird, right?

456
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,900
The moment he said okay,
that he'd give up, and turned away,

457
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,050
it felt like the sky was falling.

458
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,430
So I mustered up courage,

459
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,870
and turned him around.

460
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:55,310
Gosh, what if I'd just let him go then?

461
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,720
I would've regretted letting
a good man go my whole life.

462
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,400
I probably couldn't even die from the regret.

463
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,670
So, don't make a decision you'll regret later.

464
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,050
Huh?

465
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,700
That jerk...

466
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,640
ran away from home.

467
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,160
What?

468
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,190
He went to Geum Ju.

469
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,560
Geum Ju told me. She was worried I'd worry.

470
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,820
She even knows where he is.

471
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,990
Could you please bring him back?

472
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,850
What?

473
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,740
Please.

474
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,950
You're the only one who can convince Seon Uk.

475
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,340
Please...

476
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:49,460
bring my brother back home. Please?

477
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,230
You said you were swayed by Seon Uk.

478
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,180
Don't give up on that feeling.

479
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,440
I heard everything.

480
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,580
I visited Seon Hwa because I heard she was sick.

481
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,340
Hyeon Ju.

482
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,480
Seon Uk likes you...

483
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,540
and you like him, too. So what's there to hesitate?

484
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,130
Be brave.

485
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,980
Don't end up with regrets.

486
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,910
Honey.

487
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,170
Here, a gift.

488
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,300
What's this?

489
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,180
I made it for you.

490
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,300
At the hospital, you said you wished you had

491
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,680
a small family portrait to carry around with you.

492
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,440
Gosh, thank you.

493
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,040
It's so well made.

494
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,130
Do you like it?

495
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,270
Yes.

496
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,840
Nice!

497
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,810
Gosh, seriously...

498
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,000
Wow, she brought out the fancy cups!

499
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,770
Am I hallucinating now?

500
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,560
Let's just forget.

501
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,920
Forget...

502
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,580
Where are you going?

503
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,200
Let's talk.

504
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,560
Han Geum Ju...

505
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,430
I told her not to say anything.

506
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,230
Why? So, you can hide forever?

507
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,620
No.

508
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,990
I was actually on my way back to Bochun.

509
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,880
After hearing about Ui Jun, I got to thinking.

510
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,500
If someone can endure that kind of nightmare,

511
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,320
then I shouldn't be whining.

512
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,200
I'll do better, so you don't get hurt

513
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,500
and so you can keep your friendship with my sister.

514
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:36,540
I'll try my best for your sake.

515
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,510
Though it'll be hard...

516
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,560
I'm going to try to forget you.

517
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,180
Really?

518
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,330
Then, I shouldn't have come.

519
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,790
I came to say something,

520
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,090
but I guess I don't need to say it anymore.

521
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,300
Say something?

522
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,870
What is it?

523
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,140
Let us date.

524
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,980
What?

525
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,160
Gosh, but pretend you didn't hear it.

526
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,600
Since you decided to forget me, it's too bad.

527
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,280
Seon Hwa told me to give it a shot with you.

528
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,670
Wait, what are you saying...

529
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,630
My sister really said that?

530
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,280
Yeah, but I'll tell her.

531
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,500
That you rejected me.

532
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,730
What? W-What are you talking about?

533
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,220
What? Didn't you say you were going to forget me?

534
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,860
That you were going to try?

535
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,140
I did?

536
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,170
When? W-Wait...

537
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,700
I take it back, spit, spit, spit!

538
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,090
Hurry up and call your sister.

539
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,630
I can't stand to see my precious friend worried.

540
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,020
Okay.

541
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,740
May I borrow your phone?

542
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,000
Hello? Noona, it's me, Seon Uk.

543
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,370
Hang on. I'm heading to Bochun right now.

544
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,550
Thank you.

545
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,600
Really.

546
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,480
Wait.

547
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,030
[Mr. Seon Uk]

548
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,100
Mr. Seon Uk?

549
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,180

♫ Finding peace with time ♫

734
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:10,330
♫ Becomes the shade of life ♫

735
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:13,350
I heard about him.

736
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:16,040
Is Dr. Seo okay?

737
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:21,100
I have no right to ask, but please
take good care of him, Geum Ju.

738
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,100
Geum Ju.

739
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,270
Doctor.

740
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,760
I came to get you.

741
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:56,640
You should go to the funeral.

742
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,850
No.

743
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:02,470
How could I go there shamelessly?

744
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:06,080
I'm the one who made him that way.

745
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,100
I did all that.

746
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,660
No.

747
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,250
That's not true.

748
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,340
Please don't blame yourself.

749
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,190
In the end,

750
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,180
he's the one who chose alcohol.

751
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:57,840
Ui Jun, bring her this way.

752
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,500
Sit next to your son.

753
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,280
Excuse me?

754
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,910
Son? I don't have the right...

755
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,020
You do have the right.

756
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:25,500
You always...

757
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:29,160
stood by my side.

758
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,380
I endured all that hellish time

759
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:36,260
thanks to you.

760
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,880
Thank you...

761
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,790
Mother.

762
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,050
Doctor...

763
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:56,960
Gosh, from now on,

764
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,660
you should call him Ui Jun.

765
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,180
Yes, go on.

766
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,640
Try it.

767
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,360
Give it a go, ma'am.

768
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,800
The first time's the hardest. Go on.

769
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:24,040
Ui Jun...

770
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,470
There we go.

771
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:19,310
[One Year Later]

772
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,460
Wow, look at this.

773
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,430
Why? Am I doing better?

774
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:38,810
No. Not at all.

775
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,930
Your bronchitis got worse.

776
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:42,990
How did that happen?

777
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:46,100
There's only one reason
why you're not getting better.

778
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,880
Smoking.

779
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,910
What are you saying? I don't smoke.

780
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:53,460
I quit!

781
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,720
I really quit!

782
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,890
Seriously, is that how you think of me?

783
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,570
I told you to quit.

784
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:16,350
Whenever I get stressed,
all I can think of is cigarettes.

785
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,320
Do you know how hard it is to quit?

786
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,740
Of course.

787
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,840
For longtime smokers like you, Bong Sik,

788
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,370
nicotine dependence is high, and

789
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:26,330
you have a serious addiction
from how much you smoke.

790
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:28,500
Look over there.

791
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,880
We have a smoking cessation program at our clinic.

792
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,390
Sign up for it, okay?

793
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,140
It'll really help.

794
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,700
Okay. Thank you.

795
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,260
- For sure.
- Yes.

796
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,500
- Take care.
- Yes...

797
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,100
- Make sure you sign up.
- Yes.

798
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:52,330
Ui Jun, are you done seeing patients?

799
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:53,510
Yes.

800
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,600
- Come on, quick!
- Why, why, why?

801
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,930
We're all having dinner at my place, remember?

802
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:00,840
But let's have a little date before that.

803
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:05,230
Okay.

804
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:16,130
What? Why are you smiling to yourself?

805
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,310
Look at this.

806
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,760
Mom sent a selfie.

807
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,060
She's done with her probation period.

808
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,670
I've been encouraging her
to enjoy her club activities.

809
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,840
Really? Let me see.

810
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,480
"The one who gives me burgers"?

811
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,980
Wow, this club actually exists?

812
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,560
Daebak.

813
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,600
It's so nice to see her smile.

814
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,860
So, you're finishing your clinic work
at the end of the month, right?

815
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:50,080
- Yes.
- When will you tell everyone?

816
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,860
I will eventually.

817
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,030
It still doesn't feel real.

818
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:57,050
Leaving the clinic and starting something new…

819
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,090
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

820
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:03,800
I told you. You have a lucky face.

821
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,900
Especially your nostrils.

822
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,000
They flare forward like the freeway!

823
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,160
This is so nice. It's been
a while since we took a walk.

824
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,590
You're right.

825
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,620
What's this?

826
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,160
I told you I'd get you a new one.

827
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,320
Wear this from now on.

828
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,150
A necklace?

829
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,100
But I like my old one!

830
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,300
Oh, wow, it's beautiful.

831
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,640
So shiny!

832
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:48,070
Put it on me.

833
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,670
Okay.

834
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,080
There.

835
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,360
How is it? Pretty?

836
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,950
Gorgeous.

837
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:04,460
Whoa, blinding!

838
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:07,120
My eyes! Too bright!

839
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,590
Oh, come on.

840
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:11,480
What's with the sudden event?

841
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,730
I'm touched.

842
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:15,280
You said so.

843
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,950
Only happiness lies ahead.

844
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,950
I'll make you happy.

845
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,880
More and more.

846
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,530
We're here!

847
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:54,980
You came?

848
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:57,210
Hey, what are you doing?

849
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,600
Can't you see?

850
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,500
You're here as a guest, so I'm setting the table.

851
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:04,190
- Aren't you a guest, too?
- Come on now.

852
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:06,480
I'm already family.

853
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,660
Oh, Ui Jun! You're here!

854
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,060
Hello!

855
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:12,600
Hi!

856
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,650
Woo Ri, Na Rah, sit here!

857
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,550
Mother.

858
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:19,950
Wow!

859
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,400
So beautiful!

860
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,770
Thank you.

861
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:25,180
Ui Jun, you're the best.

862
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,110
Right?

863
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:33,030
Look here. Your favorite flower is on the ground.

864
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:36,370
Ta-da! A Seon Uk flower!

865
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:38,020
You silly goose.

866
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,440
Seon Uk, you make me laugh.

867
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,050
Right? Aren't I the best, Mother?

868
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:43,460
No, I'm the best, right?

869
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,860
Come on.

870
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,260
You're all here.

871
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:47,230
Wait just a moment.

872
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:49,140
Let me grill up some delicious meat for you.

873
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,620
No, Father, let me grill!

874
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,570
No, no, let me!

875
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:54,810
I can do it better...

876
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:57,640
I'm better at grilling meat.

877
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,690
No, I'll grill-

878
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,040
I will grill meat.

879
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,480
Why don't you two do something else?

880
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:12,240
Chop wood with those dainty hands
that only know books?

881
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,440
Leave this kind of thing to me, a family member.

882
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,310
Why don't you go eat, guest?

883
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,250
Oh, right. I'm a guest. Guest for life.

884
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,110
This is my job to do.

885
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,190
A confirmed son-in-law.

886
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,070
Me.

887
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:32,560
I shall own all the love from the in-laws.

888
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,480
Says who?

889
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:37,980
You guys, that's enough. Come eat.

890
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,010
Yes, your future son-in-law is coming!

891
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:42,510
Yes, Mother, I'm coming, too!

892
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,580
Wow, seriously, it's a miracle.

893
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,110
Eating meat at our house without alcohol...

894
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:53,210
Right?

895
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:56,120
We would've emptied bottles
before the meat finished cooking.

896
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,500
Tell me about it.

897
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:01,400
What do you think? Doesn't the meat taste better

898
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,140
without the liquor?

899
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:05,440
- Don't you all totally agree?
- Huh?

900
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,770
Well...

901
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:14,450
Mother, I don't think that was a total agreement.

902
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:15,800
No, no.

903
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,090
- Not exactly…
- Everyone, calm down.

904
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:19,690
We can eat meat sober.

905
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:21,170
How about a song without drinking?

906
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:22,780
Let me kick off the mood.

907
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,270
I, Bong Seon Uk-

908
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:27,110
No, I, Seo Ui Jun, will sing the first song.

909
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,750
Give it back! I said I'd go first!

910
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,880
Seriously...

911
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,930
I've seen that scene before.

912
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:35,890
Right? They're just like Woo Ri and Na Rah.

913
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,850
No way, we're not like that.

914
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:40,450
Yeah! It's not like they're kids.
What are they doing?

915
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:42,160
I know, right?

916
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,430

Our country is lenient about alcohol.

928
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,760
A drink to celebrate.

929
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,040
A drink to soothe loneliness.

930
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,600
A drink to forget pain.

931
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,340
Every emotion becomes a reason to drink,

932
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:02,320
and many people relate to that.

933
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,260
But someone once said

934
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:08,500
alcohol gives you wings but takes away the sky.

935
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,070

devil sends when he's too busy
