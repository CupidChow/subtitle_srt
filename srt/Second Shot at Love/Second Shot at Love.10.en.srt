My babies!

184
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,450
Whoa, look who's here, a princess!
You came over to play?

185
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,650
Yes, what's that?

186
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,010
This?

187
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,810
This is a very delicious pie.

188
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,040
Let's eat it together.

189
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,300
Go wash your hands!

190
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,090
What's the pie for?

191
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,450
You said you were craving it.

192
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,410
I lined up for it at a hot spot in Seoul.

193
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,710
Totally your style. Let's go.

194
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,760
Look at you chow down.

195
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,090
You have some, too, Unni.

196
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,760
- Good, huh?
- Delicious.

197
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,960
I'm done eating. May I go play?

198
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,170
<i>Me, too!</i>

199
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,200
Sure.

200
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,110
Thank Auntie for the pie.

201
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,700
<i>Thank you!</i>

202
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,850
Yes, yes. Go play, princes and princess!

203
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,660
<i>Okay!</i>

204
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,780
How was work?

205
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,210
How was your condition?

206
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,500
Absolutely.

207
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,390
Everyone was shocked that I was totally fine.

208
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,610
They asked if I really had the surgery.

209
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,590
What about you?

210
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,340
Are you okay, Unni?

211
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,800
Me?

212
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,160
Is it okay to end things that way with Seon Uk?

213
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,100
It's been on my mind.

214
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,780
Wondering if you decided that because of me...

215
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,910
I told you that's not the case.

216
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,170
I had already decided to make him give up.

217
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,600
I don't want to cause a stir
and lose an old friend.

218
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,340
But who knows? Seon Hwa might
be cool about it and give her blessing.

219
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,880
I say go for it without overthinking-

220
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,160
I'm going to take over the pension business.

221
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,130
The pension? Out of the blue?

222
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,590
When Mom got sick, it really hit me.

223
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,360
I should've let her rest way sooner.

224
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,900
I've been learning how to redo the website.

225
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,250
At this point,

226
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,880
I plan to make it all about MZ's taste

227
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,060
and work hard on social media promotion.

228
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,900
I want to grow our pension for real.

229
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,020
I don't have time to date, Geum Ju.

230
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,350
So, pretend you don't know anything to Seon Uk.

231
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,690
Don't let things get awkward
between you two because of me.

232
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,140
And don't mention it to Ui Jun, either, okay?

233
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,580
Okay...

234
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,690
You didn't have to come all this way.

235
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,630
I've been wanting to visit for a while,

236
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,830
but they said you needed to
be cautious after the surgery,

237
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,840
so I've been holding back.

238
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,540
When they said we could visit, we rushed over.

239
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,740
It's not much, but here...

240
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,830
- What is it?
- My cousin runs a pottery studio in Icheon.

241
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,340
Wishing you a speedy recovery, Gwang Ok.

242
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,430
Gosh, thank you.

243
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,070
So pretty.

244
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,140
Totally your style.

245
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,620
I'll put it over there.

246
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,360
I brought some food.

247
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,430
I figured you're tired of hospital food.

248
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,250
Goodness, thank you so much.

249
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,440
You must be busy with the car center and the kids.

250
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,480
It's nothing. I hope it suits your taste.

251
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,570
Don't worry about that.

252
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,020
You're the best cook I know.

253
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,680
Good job.

254
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,730
Cooking is the only thing going for her.

255
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,130
Don't say it like that.

256
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,830
Oh, no. At least I have cooking skills, right?

257
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,010
You're so blessed with your daughter-in-law.

258
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,630
Why did you come alone?

259
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,230
Where's your wife?

260
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,850
- Did you two fight again?
- No, nothing like that.

261
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,030
Something troublesome came up.

262
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,240
- Something troublesome?
- Don't worry about it.

263
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,880
Hyungnim, could we talk outside?

264
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,440
Sure.

265
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,100
Sure. I'll be back.

266
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,940
Get some rest.

267
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,490
What's going on? What happened?

268
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,420
Don't even get me started.

269
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,080
We were robbed last night!

270
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,750
Stop right there.

271
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,500
Hey, Master Kim!

272
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,900
Hey!

273
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,560
Let's handle this legally.

274
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,520
We've got witnesses and evidence.

275
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,930
So, throw him in jail right away!

276
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,190
Why are you doing this to me?

277
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,900
I didn't end up stealing anything.

278
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,400
- I just got beat up by Dr. Seo!
- Shut up!

279
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,670
How are you a taekwondo master
when you're a shameless thief?

280
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,260
What are you doing?

281
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,220
Lock him up right now!

282
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,670
Ma'am, what if you forgave him instead?

283
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,250
It's not like you're strangers.

284
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,050
Exactly!

285
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,290
Between us?

286
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,510
What? What are we anyway?

287
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,670
We're just a thief and a victim. That's all.

288
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,760
Come on!

289
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,870
Mom!

290
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,740
Mom?

291
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,210
What?

292
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,330
He's your son?

293
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,870
I don't have a son.

294
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,420
I erased him from the family register long ago.

295
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,480
So, throw him in jail right now!

296
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,000
Mom, wait. Are you really going to be like this?

297
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,110
Please, let it go just this once!

298
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,430
- Let go.
- Just this once.

299
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,700
- Let go.
- Mom...

300
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,480
Let go!

301
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,080
You bastard! You rotten bastard!

302
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,580
You scumbag!

303
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,660
That's why she didn't want to come.

304
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,190
Another child gave up her liver for her mom.

305
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,540
But that bastard would sell
his mom's liver for profit.

306
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,650
Would she want to come here?

307
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,460
She's constantly angry, comparing
herself to Gwang Ok anyway.

308
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,000
She must be really upset.

309
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,630
Seriously, I don't know who he takes after.

310
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,780
Who else? He takes after you.

311
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,780
- What?
- The troublemaker. He's your spitting image.

312
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,890
It's in the blood.

313
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,200
Come on, I came all the way here to show support.

314
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,300
- And this is how you treat me?
- And I appreciate it, I do.

315
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,430
But I'm not going to lie.

316
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,620
All sons take after their fathers.

317
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,500
Oh, no. There's one person
where that's not the case.

318
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,990
- Who?
- Who else? Ui Jun.

319
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,160
He's nothing like the dad who abandoned him.

320
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,240
Even took care of his stepmom,
who's not his blood.

321
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,120
True, true. We owe Ui Jun big for this.

322
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,490
I'm not sure how we'll ever repay him.

323
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,250
But do you think he has no idea what happened

324
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,110
to the dad who abandoned him?

325
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,160
How can I ask about something like that?

326
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,200
I don't want to reopen old wounds.

327
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,380
Why bother finding out more about that loser?

328
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,840
Better to think of him as dead and move on.

329
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,700
[A drunken homeless person
found dead at Masoo Station]

330
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,150
[A report about an unconscious
woman at Masoo Station...]

331
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,360
Yes.

332
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,360
Pardon?

333
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,260
You found someone?

334
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,320
Thank you for making time.

335
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,050
I've been looking for anyone
with news about my father.

336
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,770
The detective told me to meet with you.

337
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,420
I heard you were a medical
volunteer at Cheonggang Prison.

338
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,130
That you cared for my father
throughout his imprisonment.

339
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,420
Oh, yes, I remember.

340
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,140
But unfortunately,

341
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,870
I don't have any news about him.

342
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,190
I haven't seen him since he was released.

343
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,140
Have you heard anything?

344
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,780
About where he went?

345
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,010
Nothing.

346
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,920
Might you know anyone else who might have news?

347
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,930
I'm not sure...

348
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,340
It's been a while since I've been
in touch with people there.

349
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,020
I've been retired and living in the countryside,

350
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,140
and it's been a while since
I stopped volunteering.

351
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,520
I see...

352
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,150
But what is driving you to look for him?

353
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,430
If I were you, I'd never want to see him again.

354
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,210
He needs treatment,

355
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,090
one way or another.

356
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,170
I'm sorry. I wish I could help.

357
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,400
It's okay.

358
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,510
I wonder where he is and what he's doing...

359
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,440
It's pointless.

360
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,270
Why look for him?

361
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,230
He doesn't even know that you're this far gone.

362
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,950
Don't blame anyone.

363
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,170
Even a lifetime won't be
enough to pay for your sins.

364
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,930
<i>Happy birthday!</i>

365
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,870
<i>I wanted to be the first to say it.</i>

366
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,130
[00:00]

367
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,110
[Sunday, January 12]

368
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,750
Today is Ui Jun's birthday?

369
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,000
That's right.

370
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,500
What do you think? How does it look?

371
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,480
Wow, looks killer.

372
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,640
You have zero interest in cooking.

373
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,560
I can't believe you made this.

374
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,320
If these hands can fix any car,

375
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,610
how hard can seaweed soup be?

376
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,520
It was nothing.

377
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,930
Nothing, huh?

378
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,590
I soaked the seaweed at dawn,

379
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,250
cleaned the clams, shrimp, flounder, abalone...

380
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,200
All the healthy seafood, chopped and cleaned.

381
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,600
Made the broth from scratch.

382
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,460
I never knew how good I was at cooking.

383
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,990
Turns out I've got a knack for cooking.

384
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:57,440
Ui Jun's one lucky guy.

385
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,520
No, I'm the lucky one.

386
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,500
You know how devoted he was
while I was in the hospital.

387
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,580
<i>He quietly took care of everything by my side.</i>

388
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,580
It's always like that in the beginning.

389
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,630
<i>He took such good care of me.</i>

390
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
He went through so much because of me.

391
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,460
It's my turn to return the favor.

392
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,900
I want to make his birthday special.

393
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,130
I fully support it.

394
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,490
Dad, you eat some, too.

395
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,760
Let's call Woo Ri and Na Rah for breakfast.

396
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,280
Sure, I'll go get them.

397
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,630
Okay.

398
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,960
Woo Ri! Na Rah! Let's eat!

399
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,740
Ui Jun! I was just about to call you.

400
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,640
What do you think? Tasty, right?

401
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,020
Yeah. You should eat, too.

402
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,480
Okay.

403
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,900
Wow. So delicious.

404
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,020
Daebak.

405
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,600
Putting in all this effort...

406
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,800
must've been so worth it.

407
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,890
The best. Truly the best.

408
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,510
Thanks. I'm glad it suits your taste.

409
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,200
Right.

410
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,600
Seaweed soup should taste like this.

411
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,640
<i>Bleh!</i>

412
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,870
W-What's wrong? Does it taste weird?

413
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,210
Tastes like farts.

414
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,190
No, like poop!

415
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,240
Hey, I worked hard since dawn to make this!

416
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,960
Farts and poop? How can you say that?

417
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,900
Seriously. Don't say that.

418
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,320
It doesn't taste like farts or poop.

419
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,880
It tastes like fart and poop together.

420
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,240
- Dad.
- All right, grandkids.

421
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,470
Let's go get a pastry at the bakery for breakfast.

422
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,430
<i>Yay!</i>

423
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,300
- What is wrong with it...
- Unless you want Ui Jun to dump you,

424
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,550
don't serve him this.

425
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,950
This is no gift.

426
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,830
It's a terror.

427
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,620
There's no way. I followed a golden recipe!

428
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,890
It tastes like farts and poop?

429
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,810
It does taste like that.

430
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,260
It's a total loss.

431
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,710
It's impossible to ruin seaweed soup.

432
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,360
Even a baby could cook it right.

433
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,230
It's that easy.

434
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,510
Okay.

435
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,620
Baeksang Art Award Table Setting?

436
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,120
Whoa, there's a club like this, too?

437
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,070
Yes, to serve someone with artful table settings

438
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,800
brings great joy.

439
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,880
Of course, it can't compare
to a gift from a girlfriend.

440
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,260
Gosh, not at all.

441
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,260
But I did prepare something
pretty impressive, too.

442
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,900
Geum Ju, you don't have
to go all out for my birthday.

443
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,140
Oh, my. I better get up.

444
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,270
Pardon? Why don't you stay and eat with us?

445
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,660
No, no.

446
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,310
I'm not that dense.

447
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,010
I'm leaving.

448
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,840
Let me walk her out.

449
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,300
Okay...

450
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,920
I told you not to do anything
special for my birthday.

451
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,090
You know it's not a celebratory day for me.

452
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,760
You should celebrate it now.

453
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,980
The moment you got Geum Ju,
didn't you decide to become happy?

454
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,760
What?

455
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,540
Stand strong in your decision.

456
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,010
Don't be bound to the past.

457
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,660
At least today, no...

458
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:59,260
from now on, I hope you become happy.

459
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,980
For the sake of Geum Ju, who is by your side.

460
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,440
I'm leaving.

461
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,770
Here.

462
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,800
What's this?

463
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,160
I heard you drank a lot yesterday.

464
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,920
For your hangover before work.

465
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,930
Why cure the hangover,

466
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,900
when I can't cure my rotting insides?

467
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,670
Don't be like that.

468
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,320
He won't be like that his whole life.

469
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,720
I'm sure Gi Beom will get himself together.

470
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,080
I've given up now.

471
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,340
Kids are pointless.

472
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,250
I wish I'd just croak instead
of having to see all this.

473
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,090
Don't say that.

474
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,920
Hey, seeing Hyungnim,

475
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,720
I'm just so grateful for our health.

476
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,810
Grateful, my foot.

477
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,670
I know you're going through a lot.

478
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,400
But just go see her once.

479
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,290
Didn't you say she's getting better?

480
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,490
She's being discharged soon, so why should I go?

481
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,190
Even if it weren't about Gi Beom,

482
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,850
I wouldn't have visited her.

483
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,460
I don't even have time to die.
When would I have gone?

484
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,300
"What if she's not okay?"

485
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,760
You were so worried about her before.
Why are you acting like this now?

486
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,430
Come on, just tell me.

487
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:25,650
Why are you so cold to her?

488
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,110
Enough.

489
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,540
I have a pounding headache.

490
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,560
Did you call me here just to nag?

491
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,410
I won't nag. Got it.

492
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,160
Just eat. Hurry.

493
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,550
Oh, Young Woong's dad.

494
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,910
Wait a second...

495
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,940
We should put in the order.

496
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,550
Yeah.

497
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,620
<i>I head about Gi Beom.</i>

498
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,950
<i>Don't be too upset.</i>

499
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,580
<i>Worry about yourself.</i>

500
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,040
<i>Focus on your health...</i>

501
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,210
[I head about Gi Beom. Don't be too upset.]

502
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,630
No response.

503
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,370
She must be really upset.

504
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,970
Wow. Daebak.

505
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,870
Seon Hwa packed all this?

506
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,090
Apparently.

507
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,300
She even called the hospital

508
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,350
to make sure it suits the diet
for someone post-liver transplant.

509
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,470
Such dedication.

510
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,460
She always packs side dishes for the kids, too.

511
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,310
Gosh, I'm so grateful.

512
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,880
- Yeah. Mom, eat before it gets cold.
- Okay.

513
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,220
Wow, delicious.

514
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:53,070
She got good at it since she'd been
cooking for her little brother as a kid.

515
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,730
That must be it.

516
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,760
She's an exceptional sister.

517
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,390
Seon Uk better treat her well.

518
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,180
<i>Happy birthday!</i>

519
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,980
<i>- Ui Jun, happy birthday!
- Thanks.</i>

520
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,820
So, birthday party tonight?

521
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,200
Hey, hey.

522
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,410
<i>Don't you see they're driving somewhere together?</i>

523
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,300
<i>The best gift we can give today
is to stay out of their way.</i>

524
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,120
Exactly. It's his first birthday
since we started dating.

525
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,670
<i>I planned a full-course event
from start to finish.</i>

526
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,190
<i>So, butt out.</i>

527
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,700
Wow, I'm jealous, Seo Ui Jun.

528
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,440
If you're jealous, hang up.

529
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,210
You're distracting me while I drive.

530
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,590
Yeah, go have a great time, you two.

531
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,240
Bye, thanks!

532
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,300
Those punks. Crashing our mood,
knowing we're together.

533
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,170
Ui Jun is so lucky.

534
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,670
Are you jealous?

535
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,970
Then, go date someone nice.

536
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,220
Not Hyeon Ju.

537
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,940
Why not? She's perfectly nice.

538
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,850
Her mom is recovering quickly.

539
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,520
I'm sure she'll find her footing again soon,

540
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,370
then, our relationship can get back on track.

541
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,610
Wait, didn't you give up?

542
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,810
Give up*? Are you counting cabbages?
(Sounds like 'cabbage')

543
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,140
Wow, how are you joking in this situation?

544
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,870
What?

545
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,430
Even in taekwondo,

546
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,380
you get a one-minute break after one round.

547
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,640
Hyeon Ju and I are just

548
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,510
on break right now.

549
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,510
I'll wait.

550
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,880
Until she opens her heart again.

551
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,170
Optimism is a disease.

552
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,080
You're terminal, you brother-in-law.

553
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,060
Took you long enough to notice, bro-in-law.

554
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,120
Man, I'm seriously jealous of Ui Jun.

555
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,650
What do you think Geum Ju's
full-course experience is?

556
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,220
Wow.

557
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,350
The snow hasn't melted at all here.

558
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,690
It's beautiful.

559
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,060
Yeah...

560
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,730
But why a mountain?

561
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,400
Don't you remember?

562
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,790
I really wanted to bring you here.

563
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:16,600
Once I get discharged,
I'll go to Gi Beom's for ribs.

564
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,120
Just ribs?

565
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,890
Hit up a chicken place for drumsticks

566
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,200
and a pork shack for pork feet.

567
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,680
Eat everything you can!

568
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,750
Of course!

569
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,190
You okay?

570
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,850
How about you? Anything you want to do?

571
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,260
Me?

572
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,210
I want to go somewhere high up
with you and feel the winter wind.

573
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,110
<i>You must've felt trapped and suffocated.</i>

574
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,820
Thank you.

575
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,610
I'm sorry I made you worry with what I said.

576
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,420
I just meant you seemed suffocated.

577
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,010
Really?

578
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,620
Even better.

579
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,200
Just think that you've gifted
this visit to me, too.

580
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,980
Today may be your birthday,

581
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,640
but it feels like mine, too.

582
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,810
What?

583
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,650
I feel like I've been reborn.

584
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,790
After going through something that dark,

585
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,280
this precious time of being alive...

586
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,200
I want to live each moment to the fullest extent.

587
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,140
With you.

588
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,840
<i>Don't be bound to the past.</i>

589
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,610
<i>from now on, I hope you become happy.</i>

590
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,890
<i>For the sake of Geum Ju, who is by your side.</i>

591
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,780
I love it.

592
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,820
Yes, Ui Jun. Where did you go?

593
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,420
<i>Outside the window.</i>

594
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,220
<i>Look down.</i>

595
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,260
[I Heart U]

596
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,190
<i>♫ If I were to list the reasons I like you ♫</i>

597

598
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,110
I love you, too!

603
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,140

609
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,240
Hey. I can do it by myself.

610
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,470
I told you to leave. Why are you still here?

611
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,010
Hand it over.

612
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,000
You said you wanted to clean
everything before she's discharged.

613
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,110
You must be tired from going
to the hospital this morning.

614
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,100
You'll get sick if you do it by yourself.

615
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,200
Girl, you brought so much food to my mom, too.

616
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,710
She was so thankful.

617
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,110
No need to thank me. Of course, I should do that.

618
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,050
She cared for us so deeply

619
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,500
when my brother and I had nowhere to lean on.

620
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,790
Your mom is practically my real mom.

621
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:51,250
So, you and I are basically family.

622
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,600
That's why I can't forget what she said.

623
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,170
I hope my Hyeon Ju meets
someone nice like you did.

624
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,650
Because I'm stuck here like this,

625
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,450
she's so busy working at the pension
and caring for the kids.

626
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,350
Gosh, I feel so bad...

627
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,930
Right.

628
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,100
- Don't you know anyone?
- Pardon?

629
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,440
Yeah, someone in a similar situation,

630
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,450
so that Hyeon Ju doesn't feel bad.

631
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,960
Someone sweet and hard-working.

632
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,330
My mom is still worried about me while sick...

633
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,700
Hand me the rag.

634
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,700
So, you should date, so she doesn't worry.

635
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,830
I have someone in mind.

636
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:39,620
What?

637
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,010
You know the son of the Bochun Gas Station owner?

638
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,050
He got divorced last year and is living alone.

639
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,570
Look.

640
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,150
He's good-looking and tall.

641
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,620
Leave it. It's not the right time.

642
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,000
This is the perfect time!

643
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,510
This is a chance for you to be a good daughter.

644
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:58,020
Help your mom worry less.

645
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,720
A much better way is to

646
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,970
boost the pension revenue.

647
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,170
Great, he has a killer network.

648
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,380
He knows everyone.

649
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,150
He'll boost pension revenue for sure.

650
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,880
Meet him, even if it's just for business.

651
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,190
- Hey...
- Hello?

652
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,430
Hello, I'm Ms. Bong from the car center.

653
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,470
How are you doing?

654
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Yes, I was just wondering.
What are you doing today?

655
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,040
What? What's Hyeon Ju doing?

656
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,360
Can't you tell? She's on a blind date.

657
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,940
With the Bochun Gas Station owner's son.

658
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,740
Looked like Seon Hwa put it together.

659
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,670
Seon Hwa did?

660
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,200
He looks way older than Hyeon Ju.

661
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,410
I'm leaving.

662
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,640
Hey, hey. Bong Seon Uk! Where are you going?

663
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,520
Oh, right.

664
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,830
I meant to drop by the supermarket.

665
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,700
Oh, yeah?

666
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,730
Head in first. I'll go.

667
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,690
Will you?

668
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,500
- Text me what you need.
- Okay.

00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,770

00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,490

But I have something I need to say.

707
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,580
Go home. I've got nothing to say to you.

720

Seon Uk. Bong Seon Uk...

721
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,910
Seon Uk. Bong Seon Uk.

722
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,260

735

745

Why didn't you tell me?

746
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,630

You should've told me.

748
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,210
You should've told me you like him, too.

749

Hey, you think I'm a joke?

750
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,700

you don't care about your friend?

751
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,330
No, it's not that...

752

753

755
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:10,550

756
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:16,020
so I wouldn't lose you, who's family to me.

757
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,900
- Seon Hwa...
- Hyeon Ju.

758
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,220
I said it clearly.

759
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,390
I asked you nicely, Hyeon Ju.

760
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:29,060
Gosh, you stupid bitch.

761
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,100
I'm sorry.

762
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,420

wasn't because of Seon Uk.

763

Happy birthday, Ui Jun!

900
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:22,470
Thanks to you, I was able
to get through the hard times.

901
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:26,280
Because you were there, I could hang on.

902
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,210
I'm so grateful. Happy birthday.

903
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:30,230
Gosh, why am I crying?

904
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:34,460
What's wrong with me?

907
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:51,190
Look at my eyes.

908
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:57,000
Did I give away my tear glands, not my liver?

909
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,950
Why can't I stop crying?

910
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:07,720
Happy birthday, Ui Jun.

With you by my side, I was able to endure

913
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:17,620
and persevere.

914
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,110
I'll always be your strength, too.

01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,860
<i>But just one last request…</i>

929
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,060
<i>There was absolutely no issue.</i>

930
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:09,000
<i>So, Han Geum Ju won't come back again, right?</i>

931
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,790
<i>Of course not. I handled it.</i>

<i>Head Nurse Baek Hye Mi is working with Dr. Seo.</i>

934
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,060
<i>If she thought about Nurse Jeong,</i>

935
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:19,980
<i>she probably couldn't stand to look at Ui Jun.</i>

936
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,870
<i>Are you at Bocheon Terminal right now?</i>

937

<i>The head nurse...</i>

939
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:28,190
<i>Why? Why did you lie to me?</i>

940
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:31,270
