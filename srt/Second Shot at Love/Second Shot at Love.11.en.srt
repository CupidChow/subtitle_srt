just let me out.

as a doctor, not as a son...

64

Then, my father couldn't have come looking for me.

And Nurse Jeong might still be alive.

have to pay for his crime.

But instead, he got a reduced sentence

68

69

from me served as evidence.

job and came to Bochun?

No.

He vanished without a trace after he was released.

82

Since Grandma is buried here in Bochun,

83
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,770

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,250
I don't even have much makeup on right now...

183
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,280
Geum Ju.

184
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,500
Your mom wanted me to bring you this.

185
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,350
Oh, thanks.

186
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,970
Thank you.

187
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,180
Why are you right next to
each other in this big room?

188
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,640
What?

189
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,580
We're not.

190
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,670
Well, we just happened to be standing together.

191
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,520
Oh, you're looking at a photo album! My gosh!

192
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,200
Right, you two took a photo together back then.

193
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,500
- Dad, you want to look with us?
- Yeah, let's.

194
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,810
You've already seen all these photos.
You can go down now.

195
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,170
There's nothing to do downstairs.

196
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,910
You have lots to do. Dishes, for example.

197
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,770
It's fine. Are you two going to
do something once I leave?

198
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,490
What are you talking about?

199
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,860
Wouldn't it be nice to look at the photos together?

200
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,460
Dad, you've seen them all before.

201
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,240
Look at them later.

202
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,120
Gosh, I have nothing to do...

203
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,360
You need to do laundry, Dad! Woodworking, too.

204
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,650
What's with you?

205
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,330
What am I doing?

206
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,910
What is this?

207
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,840
What's wrong with the car?

208
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,920
This is the road CCTV and black
box footage from the accident.

209
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,320
As you can see, the car didn't
stop at the red light,

210
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,920
sped through, then crashed.

211
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,380
The bumper and bonnet were damaged

212
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,080
and the airbags were deployed.

213
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,130
The driver is claiming sudden
unintended acceleration.

214
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,120
He wants to file a damages lawsuit,

215
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,380
so the vehicle was transferred
from Myeongju Center

216
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,280
to headquarters for analysis.

217
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,350
This could affect the company's image.

218
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,200
Manager Han, review thoroughly without error.

219
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,220
Yes, I'll review it thoroughly

220
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,010
and discuss with the analysis and legal teams.

221
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,970
- Anything?
- Not yet.

222
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,030
How about now?

223
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,640
Let me try.

224
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,350
Look. In the Seohae Bridge incident,

225
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,380
all signs pointed to sudden acceleration.

226
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,520
So, I think there might be some kind of error.

227
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,660
Step on it.

228
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,380
Stepping on it now.

229
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,410
Okay.

[Jeongjik Senior Care Center]

231
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,150
[Jeongjik Senior Care Center]

232
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,270
Hey! Hey!

233
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,420
Damn it! Hey!

234
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,860
Let go! No...

235
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,870
Let go of this...

236
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,610
I said let go! Let go...

237
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,040
What do we do?

238
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,530
He goes wild whenever he's conscious.

239
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,400
First, sedate him.

240
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,570
Until he calms down.

241
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,950
Your son...

242
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,080
came by today.

243
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,740
What a shame.

244
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,580
I could've killed you before his very eyes.

245
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,110
If you weren't in this state...

246
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,350
Yes, Detective.

247
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,230
Sorry for my late response.

248
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,240
I met the nurse you mentioned, Oh Myeong Hee.

249
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,850
No, she didn't know anything.

250
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,780
It's okay.

251
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,200
Please continue to do so.

252
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,740
If you find someone who might know
where my father is, let me know.

253
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,210
Yes.

254
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,980
Okay.

255
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,880
A nurse?

256
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,620
Yes.

257
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,650
She took care of my father
while he was incarcerated.

258
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,770
She said she hadn't heard
anything since his release.

259
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,430
Goodness.

260
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,850
You must have been very disappointed.

261
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,270
Yes...

262
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,490
But...

263
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,300
do you really need to keep searching for him?

264
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,440
If he were to come back,
he would've done so by now.

265
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,030
If he could be found, you'd have found him already.

266
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,770
I told you already.

267
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,860
You should let it go now.

268
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,360
And live happily.

269
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,190
Is that...

270
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,430
undeniably the right answer?

271
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,870
What?

272
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,340
That nurse said something similar.

273
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,910
Maybe you know her.

274
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,560
I looked into her background,

275
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,950
and you were college classmates.

276
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,860
Her name is Oh Myeong Hee.

277
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,790
Oh Myeong Hee?

278
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,520
I'm not sure.

279
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,040
Doesn't ring a bell...

280
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:17,150
Back then, I was really shy and introverted.

281
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,810
I mostly kept to myself.

282
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,010
Really?

283
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,640
Yes.

284
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,890
Hard to believe, seeing you now.

285
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,450
Right?

286
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,660
Wait. Come on.

287
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,470
Let's eat together when Seon Uk gets here.

288
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,430
What took you so long? The food's cold now!

289
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,650
I can eat now, right?

290
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,880
Please convince Hyeon Ju for me.

291
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,630
She told Master Kim that Woo Ri
and Na Rah are quitting taekwondo.

292
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,360
Please convince her to stay.

293
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,640
Why are you asking Seon Hwa to convince her?

294
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,820
Because she won't take my calls!

295
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,630
- That's why you-
- Why should I convince her?

296
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,330
They can quit a sport whenever they want.

297
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,470
But they love it, and they're really good.

298
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,240
It'd be a shame if they quit now.

299
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,300
So, will you shut down without them? Will you die?

300
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,300
You need to let it go. Clean and simple. End it!

301
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,710
You hopeless idiot.

302
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,840
Hey, hey, hey, where are you going?
Aren't you eating?

303
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,890
Leave him.

304
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,500
Good riddance. I couldn't stand
the sight of him. Let's just eat.

305
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,580
How long will you pretend not to know?

306
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,060
Until I die.

307
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,730
- What?
- He was too drunk

308
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,080
to remember anything from that day.

309
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,120
If I get involved now,

310
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,930
I'll just end up reigniting it.

311
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,600
Better to let it die out.

312
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,660
Will it die out? It's life or death for him.

313
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,100
I said leave it. It takes two to tango.

314
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,350
I told you. I'm done with Hyeon Ju for good.

315
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,870
She and I are done.

316
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,470
You should act like you don't know anything.

317
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,070
Business trip? On a weekend?

318
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,900
Yeah, it worked out that way.

319
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,340
I'm overseeing an analysis of a car
with an acceleration issue.

320
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,350
The inspection results showed
it wasn't a vehicle defect,

321
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,640
so I'll go and deliver the news in person.

322
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,720
- Is that standard?
- Not necessarily.

323
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,630
But that driver's livelihood depends on it.

324
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,410
If I don't explain it clearly in person,

325
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,470
I don't think he'd readily accept his fault.

326
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,520
I also have to report it to the CEO.

327
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,490
It's a nursing home van.

328
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,650
- A nursing home?
- Yeah.

329
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,410
It's in Myeongju.

330
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,780
Myeongju?

331
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,440
By chance,

332
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,940
is it Jeongjik Nursing Home?

333
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,420
What? You know that place?

334
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,110
Yeah, I went there once.

335
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,100
A sunbae mentioned he saw my father there.

336
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,270
I don't think we've had anyone like him.

337
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,290
I see...

338
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,000
Gosh, if only my lunch with the
clinic director wasn't scheduled,

339
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,320
I would've come with you.

340
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,200
It's okay.

341
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,020
Don't worry about me, and take care of business.

342
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,450
Will do.

343
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,740
Geum Ju, do you want more?

344
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,100
Sure, thank you.

345
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,810
Ui Jun, where's your phone charger?

346
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,240
Hold on, I'll bring it to you.

347
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,610
Where is it? I'll just go get it.

348
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,250
You sure?

349
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,160
It's in the desk drawer over there.

350
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,650
Okay.

351
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,760
[I love you, Han Geum Ju]

352
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,470
Geum Ju, wait...

353
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,590
No, no, not that...

354
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,990
What's this? When did you get it?

355
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,340
A while ago. Back in college.

356
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,980
What? Really?

357
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,060
Then, why do you still have it
without giving it to me?

358
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,470
It's not that I didn't want to. I couldn't.

359
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,870
Why not?

360
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,030
Anyway, this is really old.

361
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,390

Yeah, it's pretty.

So pretty.

372

How come it's so hard to see you?

387

Didn't you miss me?

388
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,540
I came here to see you because I missed you.

Yes.

Why would you miss someone like me?

to cut me off for good.

Why are you acting like this?

I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

397
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,890
To be honest,

398
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,860
I've been avoiding you on purpose.

399
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,700
- What?
- I thought seeing me

400
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,060
would stress you out and slow down your recovery.

401
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,460
So, I stayed away on purpose.

402
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,620
I've been nothing but nasty to you.

403
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,900
All I ever did was say things
that got on your nerves.

404
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,500
So, why do you always say
things that get on my nerves?

405
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,440
I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

406

His friends followed us
all the way to our honeymoon.

410
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,270
He said he'll just be a moment with them,

411
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:10,010
but he came back at sunrise.

Gwang Ok noonim...

416
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,990
I ended up getting married

417
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,820
without ever confessing my feelings for you.

418
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,440
And not long after that,

419
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,800
I overheard his drunk friends saying

420
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,470
you were his first love.

421
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,220

You look like a young lady!

425

I almost didn't recognize you.

- Take care.
- Bye.

427
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,550
He said he couldn't marry you anyway,

428
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,400
so he might as well marry just anyone.

429
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,060
And that "anyone" happened
to be me, his next blind date.

430

Pathetic, right?

431
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:34,350
That one comment stuck with me forever,

00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,240

that bottled up all this time?

If it were me, I'd have flipped out long ago.

tell me instead of suffering alone.

you'll notice the brake lights never turned on.

The analysis shows

581
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,240
the driver was only pressing
the accelerator, not the brake.

00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:11,210
Where are you? We need to talk.

899
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,440
Sorry.

900
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,810
I'm in Seoul for a club meeting right now.

901
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,760
Why?

902
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,360
Why did you lie to me?

903
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,140
What are you hiding?

904
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,610
Could it be...

905
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,900
Is my father here?

906
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,510
Is he?

907
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,520
You bastard.

908
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,050
So, you came crawling back.

909
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,330
Die.

910
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,510
Die, you bastard!

911
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:14,580
- Die!
- Please stop!

912
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:17,250
Why are you doing this to me?

913
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,950
Why must you go this far?

914
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,990
Torturing you...

915
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,580
and killing you...

916
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,080
is the greatest revenge I can take on her.

917
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,600
What are you saying?

918
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,210
Die...

919
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:39,680
Die!

920
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,640
Ms. Baek...

921
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:09,070
You bastard...

922
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,010
Ms. Baek!

923
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:22,960
What do we...

924
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:26,570
Stay with me.

925
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:28,220
Ms. Baek...

926
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,570
Yes...

927
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:44,440
Your son came by today.

928
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,720
What a shame.

929
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,580
I could've killed you before his very eyes.

930
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:58,090
If you weren't in this state...

931
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,810
But that won't ever happen.

932
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:12,870
You'll die here, understand?

933
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,040
There's nothing I won't do.

934
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,490
Nothing I wouldn't do...

935
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,580
for my son, Seo Ui Jun.

936
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,170
Ms. Baek!

937
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:41,030
Ms. Baek!

938
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,330
Ms. Baek!

939
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,410
Ms. Baek!

940
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,810
Please wake up!

941
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,510
Please!

Wow, these are...

943
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:13,410

[Congratulations to the 24th
graduating class of Bochun High School]

945
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:23,790
This one's pretty.

946
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:25,540
They're all 10,000 won.

947
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:29,250
Let's pick one more for Ui Jun.

948
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,940
How about this one for Ui Jun?

949
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,620
- This one?
- This one's pretty, too.

950
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,720
Go pay for it.

951
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,230
Me?

952
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,880
- Sir.
- Yes?

953
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,070
These two, please.

954
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:42,640
It's okay. They've already been paid for.

955
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:45,220
- These?
- Yes.

956
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,520
Who paid?

957
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:50,620
That lady over there in the red coat
already paid for them.

958
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,190
- Really?
- Yes.

959
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:54,620
One, two, three.

960
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:57,800
- Again, again. One, two, three...
- Smile, smile.

961
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:01,040
How is it? Let me see.

962
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,760
Came out nice!

963
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:09,200
Looks good. Right?

964
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,940
Looks good, right?

965
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:15,020
Should we take another one?

966
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,980
Let's stop with the photos and get going.

967
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,800
Let's go eat.

968
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,760
Can I get a vertical photo, too?

If only I could be by your side,

975
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:31,120
I thought you never had
to find out who I really am.

976
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,910
It's all my fault.

977
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:34,630
He must be so nervous.

978
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:37,200
His father, the source of things bad,
still hasn't been found.

979

Where could he possibly be?

980
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:40,960
We need to find him quickly.

981
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,550
Only then will Ui Jun feel at ease.

00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,680
I'm sorry.

00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,080
I was worried you'd be in danger, too.

00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,070
I was worried about you.
