00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,400
and the townspeople are so happy

539
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,170
that the P.E. class opened.

540
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,960
Gosh, what do we do about this?

541
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,870
My popularity exhausts me.

542
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,140
What if I get more popular?

543
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,700
- Ms. Baek.
- Yes?

544
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,390
A moment, please.

545
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,180
Yeah, what's up?

546
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,710
Look. What do you think?

547
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,730
Good as new, right?

548
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,020
Yeah. Sure.

549
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,920
I wish it hadn't crashed in the first place.

550
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,900
Well, that's true.

551
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,540
But can't you at least say thank you?

552
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,110
I spent all day yesterday and today on your car.

553
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,660
You wouldn't have had to,
if you didn't crash it in the first place.

554
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,910
Young Woong told me.

555
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:16,100
You swapped out parts that had
nothing to do with the accident.

556
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,530
- Thanks.
- Nope.

557
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,160
Thank me in a little bit.

558
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,110
The last step of a repair is a test drive.

559
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,340
Try driving.

560
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,880
Try driving and see how it feels.

561
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,040
Hey, just a second.

562
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,470
I'll drive.

563
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,560
I'm out of the cast.

564
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,630
Daebak. Already?

565
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,740
Are you okay? Are you fully healed?

566
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,150
Yes. If in the first place-

567
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,340
If you didn't break your leg, no need to heal.

568
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,540
I know, I know.

569
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,620
So, let me drive, in the first place.

570
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,780
You shouldn't overdo it.

571
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,540
<i>♫ Your eyes ♫</i>

572
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,420
<i>♫ I really like it ♫</i>

573
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,950
<i>♫ That's what I want to do,
but I'm not brave enough ♫</i>

574
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:58,700
Wow, a blast from the past.

575
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,580
<i>♫ I don't know ♫</i>

576
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,730
<i>♫ I like it, I'm going crazy ♫</i>

577
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,540
<i>♫ I don't want to let you go ♫</i>

578
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,820
<i>♫ Toward you ♫</i>

579
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,820
<i>♫ I'm coming step by step ♫</i>

580
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,560
<i>♫ So you have to stick by me ♫</i>

581
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,050
<i>♫ Roly-poly, roly, roly-poly ♫</i>

582
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,670

583
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,670
<i>♫ I'll come toward you ♫</i>

00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,220

585
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,060
<i>♫ Until you only see me ♫</i>

586
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,780
<i>♫ I'll show you who I am ♫</i>

587
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,170
Why did you bring me here?

588
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,760
Sure, that was a test ride,

589
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,060
but I figured I could run an errand.

590
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,760
Let's go.

591
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,600
Why is she so giddy?

592
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,490
Hey, hold this up.

593
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,430
- What are you doing?
- Can't you tell? I'm picking out clothes.

594
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,440
But why are you putting them up against me?

595
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,050
Because it's a gift for you.

596
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,390
A gift for me?

597
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,050
Don't be too burdened by it.

598
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,940
I'm just being nice
while I shop for my own clothes.

599
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,820
I feel bad about your leg and the car.

600
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,630
And I feel guilty that I went to Seoul
and broke my promise.

601
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,200
I can't stand it if I owe something.

602
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,500
- This is my way of making it even.
- Make it even?

603
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,780
You drove yourself because of how cheap you are.

604
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,730
And you're okay spending on this?

605
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,520
I came into some free money.

606
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,220
Free money?

607
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,190
That's why you're so giddy.

608
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,410
What money?

609
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,700
No need to know.

610
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,900
Just take it.

611
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,880
It's okay. I don't need clothes.

612
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,920
- Why?
- I said I don't need it.

613
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,790
Shop for your clothes
and call me when you're done.

614
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,340
I'll be waiting.

615
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,660
Hey! Hey...

616
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,030
<i>The person you are calling is not available...</i>

617
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,860
Where is he? He's not picking up...

618
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,730
All right.

619
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,700
Where were you?

620
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,810
What's all this?

621
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,360
This is for my nephews, Woo Ri and Na Rah.

622
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,080
A flowing dress for my sister.

623
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,470
This is for my dad.

624
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,270
For my mom. Great color for her, right?

625
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:18,390
And this is a toy for Dae Geun.

626
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,270
What do you think? Great selections, right?
Daebak, right?

627
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,230
You're having fun.

628
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,030
Did you win the lottery or something?

629
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,550
Sure, I did.

630
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,860
You should've picked something
while I was up for it.

631
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,050
It's not too late.
Why don't you go pick something out?

632
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,070
It's okay.

633
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,550
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

634
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,810
Sure, it's my treat.

635
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,190
What's wrong?

636
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,470
I must've overexerted myself.

637
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,260
Are you okay?

638
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,850
I'm okay.

639
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:37,490
<i>♫ Do you remember that night? ♫</i>

640
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,280
It's so pretty.

641
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:45,820
<i>♫ Your eyes looking at me ♫</i>

642
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:51,610

00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:00,320

645
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,690
We're here.

646
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,040
Thanks.

647
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,580
Hey...

648
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:14,900
<i>♫ After spending the time without much thought ♫</i>

649
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:20,100
<i>♫ I believed all there is left is you ♫</i>

650
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,860
I can't do this.

651
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,970
I can't be friends with you
because my heart keeps racing.

652
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,300
I...

653
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,490
like you.

654
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:04,200

Hey.

663
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,560
I feel so queasy.

664
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,950
Will you still tell my mom if I have one drink?

665
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,020
Yes, I will.

666
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,920
Gosh, you tattle-tale.

667
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,570
Sure. I get that you quit.

668
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,610
How could you quit drinking?

669
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,430
Hey, answer me seriously.

670
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,550
Why did you quit?

671
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,770
I won't tell a soul.

672
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:26,890
I'm super duper curious, to be honest.

673
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,430
I'm super duper curious
why you're curious about that.

674
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,840
Hey!

675
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,990
I'm buying this expensive dinner.
Don't get me frustrated.

676
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,550
Why did you quit?

677
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,790
So, why are you buying this expensive dinner?

678
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:43,690
Where did the free money come from?

679
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,100
Did you really win the lottery?

680
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,230
- Or did you rob a bank?
- Seriously.

681
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,820
I got lucky and came into free money.

682
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,940
Money that I need to spend away.

683
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,110
So, enjoy the food. Lick your plate.

684
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,860
Cooperate.

685
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,050
So, what money is it?

686
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,580
I need to know in order to cooperate or not.

687
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,420
Gosh, seriously?

688
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I got a refund from the wedding hall I canceled.

689
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,560
- What?
- I thought I'd lose everything.

690
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,890
But what a surprise.

691
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,290
I got everything back.

692
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:26,040
I'm so lucky. Daebak, right?

693
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,150
Is that something to be so excited about?

694
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,510
Of course. The engagement is already shattered.

695
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,020
I was feeling gross about it anyway.

696
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,230
This feels like I was compensated in some way.

697
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,310
I'm going to spend it all

698
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,840
and start anew.

699
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,540
You sound like you're the one who got ditched.

700
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,310
- What?
- What's so exciting about getting that money?

701
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,960
What about the people you hurt?

702
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,950
I'll pay.

703
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:09,330
I'm not co-signing your flex over that cash.

704
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:11,190
Hey, it's not like I hurt you.

705
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,690
I didn't hurt you!

706
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,150
<i>I like you.</i>

707
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,260
Gosh, I don't remember.

708
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,680
I remember throwing down at the pub,

709
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,220
I blacked out after that.

710
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,560
How did I get back to the dorm last night?

711
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,950
What do you mean how?

712
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,490
Your boyfriend brought you home.

713
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,200
Boyfriend?

714
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,800
Ui Jun. Aren't you two an item?

715

He's just a friend.

717

I have no intention of dating him.

718
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,960
Stop with the nonsense.

719
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,340
And yet you take care of him like that?

720
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,000
He doesn't have anyone else
who'd take care of him.

721
