00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,670
<i>The clinic had closed over a year ago.</i>

541
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:25,140
<i>Then, Ui Jun arrived like a king.</i>

542
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,230
<i>The entire town broke out in a festival.</i>

543
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,290
<i>It was a bigger celebration than</i>

544
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,990
<i>if ancestors returned from the afterlife.</i>

545
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,380
<i>Anyway,</i>

546
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,080
<i>Ui Jun is considered Bochun's God.</i>

547
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,810
<i>The savior of the townspeople.</i>

548
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:43,690
Someone came here with major fanfare, and...

549
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,080
What about me? What?

550
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,670
Aigoo...

551
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,140
You think...

552
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,390
Seo Ui Jun heard about my news already?

553
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,080
Why? Are you embarrassed?

554
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,630
Me?

555
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,420
Me? Hilarious.

556
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,720
Why would I be embarrassed?

557
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,260
What happened between you and Ui Jun, by the way?

558
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,110
You used to be super close.

559
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,300
By chance, did he...

560
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,150
- nag you about your drinking, too?
- Gosh!

561
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,150
I don't know. I don't want to talk about him.

562
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,110
I'm leaving.

563
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,420
Geum Ju, Ui Jun is on his way.
Say hi before you leave.

564
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,620
Are you crazy? Why would I?

565
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,180
I also have a lot to do, you know.

566
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:29,200
Why didn't anyone tell me Seo Ui Jun is in Bochun?

567
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,990
<i>It's because you throw a fit</i>

568
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,780
<i>every time anyone brings him up.</i>

569
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,730
Whatever. I bought soybean stew ingredients.

570
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,600
Don't worry. Bye.

[Year 2007]

572
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,470
Hey, transfer student.

573
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,290
What are you doing? Get on.

574
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,180
Can't you tell?

575
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,200
Gosh, let me see.

576
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,430
Leave it. Go your way.

577
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,020
What if I don't?

578
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,700
Hey, you mustn't have heard about me yet.

579
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,470
Here we go.

580
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,350
Why do you carry...

581
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,910
I'm the expert fixer in this town.

582
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,630
When I was little,

583
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,010
there was a genius discovery show,
and I was a young mechanic-

584
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:43,220
- You were on that show?
- Almost.

585
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,320
But I grew up too quickly.

586
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,920
- What?
- Hey, hang on.

587
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,550
This will only take three minutes.

588
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,490
Imagine you're heating up
instant curry and waiting.

589
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,880
You ungrateful bastard.

590
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,380
Why is he here?

591
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,460
Whatever. I'll just not see him.

592
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,050
I'll just make sure we don't run into each other.

593
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,060
Thank you...

594
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,150
Han Geum Ju?

595
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,390
Long time no see. It's good to see you.

596
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,030
Good to see me?

597
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:33,290
I don't think that's the nature of our relationship.

598
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,730
I heard the news about your wedding-

599
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,300
Yeah, I called off my wedding.

600
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,500
Because I didn't like him nagging me
about my drinking. Happy?

601
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,630
What are you talking about?

602
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,330
What? You said you heard the news.

603
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:50,150
I heard the news about your wedding recently.

604
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,270
I was about to congratulate you.

605
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,830
But you broke off your engagement?

606
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,590
Because of liquor?

607
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,000
Yeah.

608
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,170
But the nature of our relationship isn't one where

609
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,610
we make small talk and ask about personal matters.

610
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,260
I didn't ask you anything.

611
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,360
You volunteered the information.

612
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:12,980
Anyway, let's pretend we don't know each other,

613
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,220
even if we bump into each other.

614
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,640
Just like we've been doing,

615
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,220
let's pretend we don't know each other. Okay?

616
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,800
No way in hell I'm eating the soy bean stew...

617
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,740
Don't pick them up.

618
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,900
Leave it. I don't want your help-

619
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,000
I have no intention of helping you, either.

620
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,340
You told me to pretend we don't know each other.

621
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,390
Whatever. Forget it.

622
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,510
I erased you from my life, anyway.

623
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,470
You're out.

624
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,040
Doctor, Patient Kim Young Im is done
with physical therapy.

625
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,520
- I'll take her to the consultation room.
- Okay.

626
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,930
How's your shoulder?

627
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,470
How could she be okay?

628
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,200
I'm sure she's rotting inside.

629
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,960
All she has to boast about is her two daughters.

630
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,290
But the first daughter got divorced

631
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,470
and the second one called off the wedding.

632
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,050
Right? Who knew Geum Ju would turn out like that.

633
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,240
I'm sure she's mortified.

634
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,040
It's wild that she broke it off for a reason

635
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,500
no other than alcohol.

636
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,610
That's why she lied, which is so unlike her.

637
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,260
You happy? You sound giddy.

638
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,400
Now that she must understand what it means

639
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,380
to rot inside because of your children,

640
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,920
I feel like the ribs I ate last month are
finally getting digested.

[Bochun's Treasure!
Bochun's Pride! Hosu Rice Wine!]

642
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,810
This darn, good-for-nothing booze.

643
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,030
Try this, too.

644
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,310
I can't eat anymore.

645
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,610
I'm full.

646
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,150
Really? Then, go brush your teeth.

647
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,050
<i>Okay!</i>

648
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,190
Geum Ju, eat up.

649
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,720
Dad, I'm also done.

650
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,460
Why? Eat more.

651
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,840
Are you feeling anxious?

652
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,350
It's okay. The rumor will dissipate soon.

653
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,000
It's not that...

654
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,580
It's too fatty.

655
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,830
Same here. A glass of beer
would go great with this.

656
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,230
No.

657
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,720
Pork belly pairs best with soju.

658
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,310
Look.

659
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,870
Gosh, Dad.

660
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,920
Pork belly is best with a cold beer.

661
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,600
You're both wrong.

662
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,430
Pork belly is best with a soju and beer mix.

663
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,780
Shake the soju.

664
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,610
Three parts of soju

665
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,160
and seven parts of beer. This is a smooth one.

666
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,300
It's really smooth. Really smooth.

667
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,270
- Geum Ju.
- This is perfect.

668
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:55,090
- Geum Ju?
- So perfect. I thought...

669
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,310
What?

670
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,600
Oh, the tornado.

671
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,480
I forgot about the tornado.

The drinks taste so good.

678

So delicious.

I can't go to sleep. Just can't sleep.

You have scissors here.

685
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,390
Just use the scissors.

686

Why are you using your teeth? Here.

687
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,070
Because I can't tear you apart with my teeth.

688
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,550
This is too much.

689
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,210
Why did you drag me down here?

690
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,620
How dare you yell at me?

691
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,420
Stop grilling me.

692
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,470
I'm human, too. I get hurt, too.

693
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,200
Get hurt?

694
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,460
You do whatever you want
with no regard for anyone else.

695

Get hurt?

696
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,070
Do whatever I want?

00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,960
- Me?
- You don't?

698
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,890
Think about Ju Yeop, whom you hurt.

699
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:41,980
Don't you feel bad? At all?

700
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,810
No. I don't feel bad at all.

701
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,990
Not even a little.

That bitch...

703
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:57,220
Gosh, I raised her wrong.

704
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,480
Feel bad? Bullshit.

705
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,440

before vacation, right?

- Yes.
- Want to get a drink?

00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,320

No, I'll just break up with her today.

720
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,430
- Really?
- Yes, of course.

721
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,250
So, don't cry.

722
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,730
Better not scare the baby in your tummy.

723
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,210
Okay?

724
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,850
Don't cry.

725
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,410
[Ju Yeop]

726
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:00,180
- Why aren't you picking up?
- He's in the way of our drinks.

727
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,680
All right. Persevere. Endure.

728
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,710
<i>Bottoms up!</i>

729
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,210
Alcohol or me. Which do you choose?

730
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,450
Alcohol.

731
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,820
Let's forget about getting married.

732
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,740
Han Geum Ju, what are you talking about?

733
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,570
Let me set this straight.

734
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,120
I broke off this engagement.

735
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,700
I broke up with you.

736
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,300
Because you're...

737
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,350
worse than booze to me, you bastard.

738
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:24,040
Where did you go so early in the morning?

739
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,290
I didn't want to be home.

740
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,660
Glad to hear that. Follow me.

741
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,540
What is this? Where are we going?

742
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,120
Shut your mouth and follow me.

743
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,770
Wait. Mom!

744
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,510
<i>Mom!</i>

745
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,070
Where are we going?

746
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,150
Mom! Mom?

747
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,990
Mom, Mom, Mom...

748
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,290
Do you want to go on a date with me?

749
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,010
Gosh, are we burying something?

750
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,460
I don't want to go.

751
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,890
I'm so tired.

752
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,270
I'm not going.

753
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,730
You won't even tell me where we're going.

754
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,260
Gosh, seriously...

755
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,990
This is perfect weather to get buried alive.

756
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,760
How did she come up with this?

757
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:16,820
She wants me to collect mountain spring water?

758
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:21,620
She sure comes up with all kinds
of methods of torture.

759
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,870
Yes, Monk.

760
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,600
I'd like to contribute a roof tile
in the name of Han Geum Ju.

761
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,350
I will offer 500,000...

762
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,530
No, I'll wire over one million won.

763
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,460
- One million won?
- Nongmin Bank...

764
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,430
- 3319...
- 3319...

765
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:38,610
What are you doing right now?

766
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,880
Can't you tell?

767
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,900
I'm praying to Buddha so that

768
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,470
you can quit drinking once and for all.

769
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,210
Excuse me.

770
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,560
Come here.

771
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,120
Stop it. Why are you doing this?

772
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,330
Why do you think?

773
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:53,140
I'm trying to enlist Buddha's help.

774
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,370
I don't need to quit drinking!

775
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:57,350
You still don't get it, do you?

776
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:58,540
Step aside.

777
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,060
Monk, I will wire the money right away.

778
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,460
Oh, my gosh. Hey!

779
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,550
Hey!

780
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,420
Hey! Hey!

781
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,730
Han Geum Ju, just wait till I catch you!

782
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:13,030
Hey! Stop!

783
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,220
You're done the moment I catch you.

784
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,730
That girl...

785
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,000
Hey!

786
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,230
Stop right there!

787
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,570
The moment I catch you...

788
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,050
Hey!

789
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,930
Hey! Geum Ju!

790
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:38,010
Aigoo!

791
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,610
Geum Ju!

792
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,460
Geum Ju!

793
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,200
I'm telling you, I'm not quitting booze.

794
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,700
I'm not quitting. So, give up.

795
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,790
Hey. Hey!

796
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,320
Seriously...

797
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,060
Are you okay?

798
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,200
Where did you come from?

799
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,490
Seriously...

800
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,290
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.

801
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,920
What do we do with Geum Ju?

802
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,910
After getting in trouble because of her drinking,

803
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,270
she still can't get her act together.

804
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,650
I heard you give talks about alcoholism.

805
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:36,170
Do you know of a good way?

806
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,000
I don't know what happened between you two,

807
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,760
but you used to be best friends.

808
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,340
Think of all the good times you shared.

809
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,500
With alcoholism,

810
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,530
recognizing you have a problem is the first step.

811
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,660
Just give it time.

812
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,720
Given your effort, I'm sure she'll come around.

813
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,300
If you trust and wait,

814
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,570
they say people are bound to change.

815
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,740
Will she really change

816
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,810
if I trust and wait?

817
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,220
Taste this.

818
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:24,260
It's hot! Hot! Hot!

819
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,110
- It's perfectly seasoned.
- Is it good?

820
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,550
Rice wine would go great with this.

821
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:32,120
Right?

822
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,660
What if we down some rice wine
before your mom gets back?

823
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,290
Except if she catches us, we're dead.

824
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,270
You're back.

825
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:42,740
Where's Geum Ju?

826
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,060
I'm sure she'll come sooner or later.

827
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,800
Will she be back in time for the ritual?

828
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,940
Did she run off because she doesn't want
to face the relatives?

829
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,590
Could that be?

830

[Eldest Daughter Hyeon Ju]

831
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:10,330
Mom must be throwing a fit again.

832
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:14,460
I feel like she'll get worse if I go home...

[Seon Uk: What's up? Want to grab food?]

834
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,560
They're not even here yet, and you start cooking?

835
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,090
We'll order more when they arrive.

836
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:31,470
Wait for it to cook fully before eating.

837
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:33,330
You can eat beef raw.

838
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,090
Sir, please calm down.

839
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:37,080
How come you always go mad for meat?

840
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,410
Are you an animal?

841
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:40,320
You're crossing the line here.
I'm your brother-in-law.

842
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,440
Brother-in-law, don't cross the line
with your eating.

843
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,410
- Slow down.
- Shut up.

844
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:47,560
- This is...
- You don't even need to cook this at all.

845
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,640
- You can eat it-
- Beef is expensive-

846
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,630
You made me come when I didn't even want to.

847
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,400
And you two are fighting?

848
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,630
I see. You wanted me to watch your fight?

849
00:47:58,630 --> 00:47:59,880
We weren't fighting. He was just picking on me.

850
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,130
He was just picking on me.

851
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,570
You're the one who picked a fight.

852
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:04,700

- Nope.

853

- I'm not eating with you guys. Bye.
- Fine, fine. We won't.

854
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,110
Sit.

855
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,970
You always leave.

856
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:14,240
You promised we'd have an enjoyable dinner.

857
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,270
Yes.

858
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,750
Ui Jun, Geum Ju is coming, too.
You're fine with that, right?

859
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,210
What?

860
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,730
Sure. I guess.

861
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,420
Does she know I'm here?

862
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,670
Of course not.

863
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:29,580
We staged this surprise reunion,
so you two can make up.

864
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:32,520
Gosh, make up for what? That was so long ago.

865
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,200
What happened to you two?

866
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,470
- Why did you cut ties?
- No need to ask.

867
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,690
I'm sure Geum Ju messed up.

868
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:39,890
It's not that.

869
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:42,540
Great, then. You can extend an olive branch.

870
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,800
Yeah.

871
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,840
Geum Ju is so immature, anyway.

872
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,900
This way, please.

873
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,150
<i>And even in this situation.</i>

874
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,930
<i>I can't believe she called off
her wedding for booze.</i>

00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:58,500
<i>How dare he talk about me behind my back?</i>

876
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,650

when you heard that, right?</i>

00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,840
<i>Sure. Yeah.</i>

00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:09,530
Why did they call him?

00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:22,080
a much better person if we ever met again.

<i>a much better person if we ever met again.</i>

00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:31,260
Sure.

884
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:35,850
I wanted to become a better person, too.

885
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,660

<i>No, I'll just break up with her today.</i>

888

<i>Alcohol or me. Which do you choose?</i>

889
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,010
<i>Alcohol.</i>

890
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:52,870
I couldn't let a jerk like that ditch me.

891
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:55,050
Of course, I should ditch him first.

892
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:58,700
That way, I could at least save face.

893
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,330
You can't put spring water
on an ancestral ritual table

Yes, you can.

- This is not right.
- It is right.

897
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:04,690
Oppa, you speak up.

00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,840
His daughter broke off her engagement for booze.

900
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,250
- What?
- What?

901
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,600
- Broke off her engagement?
- What do you mean over booze?

902
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,400
What do you mean by that?

903
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,240
She called off the wedding
because he nagged her about booze.

904
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,280
Incredible, right?

905
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,740
But...

906
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:26,020
who raised Geum Ju to be so incredible?

907
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,120
The eldest son of the family

908
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,410
who taught them how to drink from a young age.

909
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:32,790
And all of you,

910
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:35,330
who offered endless booze
at gatherings, played a part, too.

911
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:37,380
Am I wrong?

912
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,140
If you feel any morsel of responsibility,

913
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,770
don't mention alcohol again.

914
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,370
I will...

915
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,660
just trust and wait.

916
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,150
My Geum Ju is not a thoughtless kid,

917
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,930
so she'll quit drinking.

918
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,990
She'll never go near alcohol again-

919
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:58,080

Geum Ju.

Why the hell did you show up drunk?

927

We can't even put liquor
on the ceremony table because of you!

How can we leave liquor off

943
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:08,620
of our grandpa's ceremony table?

Look, look.

00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,770
Grandpa is nodding. You saw, right?

946
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:13,300

- Let me pour you a glass.

947

got the ingredients,

made curry at home, and did the dishes, too.
