Yes, I'm fine.

Now and then?

720
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,000
You better get checked out more than Geum Ju.

Come with me to the clinic real quick...

After you mentioned it last time,

724
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,400
I already scheduled a check-up.

725
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,020
Sure, but...

726
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,590
you don't look well...

727
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,310
Just a moment, Ma'am.

728
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,200
Yes, head nurse.

729
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,770
Could I call you right back?

730
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,940
Yes, thank you.

731
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,930
Ma'am!

732
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,840
Mom! Mom...

733
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,100
Geum Ju...

734
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,220
Geum Ju...

735
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,900
What is it? What happened?

736
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,340
She suddenly collapsed.

737
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,380
Bochun Hospital said it was acute hepatitis,

738
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,030
so I brought her here right away.

739
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,440
Hepatitis?

740
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,220
Why? My mom doesn't even drink.

741
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,810
Alcohol isn't the sole cause.

742
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,870
Could be medication, food,

743
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,630
or it could be a viral infection...

744
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,710
There are many potential causes.

745
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,570
You're here, Professor.

746
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,900
Yes, long time no see.

747
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,800
- You're Kim Gwang Ok's family, right?
<i>- Yes.</i>

748
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,250
Can we talk for a moment?

749
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,970
Let's go.

750
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,120
Here is her abdominal CT scan.

751
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,870
As you can see, her liver is enlarged,

752
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,710
and the lymph nodes around it are also swollen.

753
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:04,180
Normal liver enzymes should be below 40.

754
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:08,040
Kim Gwang Ok is in critical condition,
with her levels at over 3,000.

755
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,550
<i>What?</i>

756
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:12,140
Lowering these levels is the priority.

757
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,380
Let's hospitalize her and start treatment.

758
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,540
Given her state, she must've been in a lot of pain.

759
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,790
But it looks like she didn't show any signs.

760
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,840
That's probably why you all didn't notice.

761
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,120
Are you okay?

762
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,910
- Dad, are you okay?
- Take a seat.

763
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,500
Dad...

764
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,840
What is this?

765
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,330
What in the world?

766
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,770
The cab's getting here soon.

767
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,460
This won't do. I'd better stay here, too.

768
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,570
No, leave it to Dad and me.

769
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,920
Go and get your kids from your friend.

770
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,810
I'll explain the situation and ask for a favor.

771
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,140
And ask if they can sleep over tonight.

772
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,050
Don't do that and just go.

773
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,640
Woo Ri and Na Rah don't
sleep well without their mom.

774
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,680
Don't worry, and go.

775
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,260
I'll call you right away if something happens.

776
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,120
It must be tough for you to care for the kids

777
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,240
when you're preoccupied with this.

778
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,290
Having it tough isn't the problem here.

779
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,520
I'm deeply ashamed to face

780
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,540
you and Mom.

781
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,680
I don't deserve to be your sister or her daughter.

797
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,420
Oh, I heard when I called Ui Jun.

798
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,070
I figured you'd be too busy

799
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,620
and thought I could take care of the kids.

800
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,370
Okay. Thanks.

801
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,920

And I didn't know until she got to that point.

810
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:42,770
I didn't know because I was wasting time with you!

811
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,670
Wasting time?

812
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,960
Yes.

813
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,610
I no longer want to be a deadbeat daughter.

814
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,600

Why did Ui Jun leave such a good hospital

<i>Sir, you're too old to be considered as a donor.</i>

907
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,600
<i>The oldest daughter, you were
born with a small liver,</i>

908
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,200
<i>so it'll be tough.</i>

909
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:25,800
<i>The youngest daughter has
the highest chance, so let's test.</i>

910
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,070
What? Geum Ju is being tested
for liver transplant suitability?

911
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:33,840
Yeah.

912
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:38,340
If her mom finds out her daughter
might have surgery for her,

913
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,160
she'd never agree to that.

914
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,840
That's if the transplant is even possible.

915
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,430
Or they'd have to wait for a donor,

916
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:46,810
and that's really challenging.

917
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,180
So, I was thinking...

918
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,520
if Geum Ju is deemed unsuitable, I'll donate mine.

919
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,930
What?

920
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:56,610
That's insane. Only family members can donate.

921
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,120
Will you use this as an excuse
to file for marriage with Hyeon Ju?

922
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,040
You crazy bastard. If your sister finds out,

923
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,510
she'll file your death certificate first.
What the heck...

924
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:10,360
What are you saying? You don't need to be family.

925
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,990
It is a complicated process,

926
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:14,560
but if you prove it's out of goodwill, it's allowed,

927
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,930
even if you're not family. I looked into it.

928
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:18,840

930
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:24,630

931
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,280

932
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,530

953

said my liver levels were fine-

954
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:34,800
Yes, your levels are within
the normal range. It's just that

955
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,830
your liver fat percentage is
outside the transplant range.

956
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,140
It needs to be within nine to 10 percent

957
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,940
to be eligible for transplantation.

958
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,030
