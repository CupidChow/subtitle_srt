1
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,300
My lord,

2
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,940
the Demon Sect's chief has reappeared.

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,180
Should we

4
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,940
report this to Eunuch Deng?

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,140
Keep Liu Guang's presence

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,060
in Poison Valley a secret.

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,980
Especially his connection
to Floral Knight.

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,420
I'm afraid someone might use it

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,260
to confuse the public

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,300
and harm Floral Knight.

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,060
But if we let Liu Guang roam free,

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,620
he'll surely become
a great threat later.

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,580
If Eunuch Deng finds out

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,020
we didn't report it in time,

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,220
he'll definitely hold us accountable.

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
Liu Guang alone can't stir up
much trouble.

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,620
Right now, he's just a father.

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,500
He's not the one we should be
worried about.

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,780
Understood.

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,140
Regarding the situation
at Poison Valley,

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,420
those heroes disobeyed orders,

22
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,540
- should we...
- This isn't just

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,620
about a few individuals anymore.

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,780
It's the entire MAA that's rotten.

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,220
This place

26
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,140
is completely corrupted.

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,820
I'm going to fix it from the roots.

My only wish now

75
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,100
is for you

76
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,060
to call me "Father."

77
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,300
Why should I?

78
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,540
Where were you when others

79
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,380
called me a monster?

80
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,980
Where were you when they said

81
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,020
I had no father?

82
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,420
And now you suddenly show up,

83
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,620
wanting me to call you "Father"?

84
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,420
Why?

85
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,860
Yingdan,

86
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,500
he just explained everything.

87
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,580
I don't accept that.

88
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,780
Yingdan,

89
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,340
just now, your father said

90
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,620
he didn't know

91
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,820
the two of us were still alive.

92
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,780
He didn't abandon us on purpose.

93
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,780
It's been so many years.

94
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,900
Yingdan

95
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,340
just needs to let it out.

96
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,500
Gou Lingfeng,

97
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,260
I didn't expect you

98
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,340
to understand her so well.

99
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,620
Having you protect her

100
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,060
puts me at ease.

101
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,980
Yingdan,

102
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,220
when you're feeling better,

103
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,340
I'd like to draw some of your blood

104
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,220
to study it closely.

105
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,180
I want to create a new antidote

106
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,940
so you won't suffer
the backlash anymore.

107
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,220
Liu Guang,

108
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,140
as the Demonic Sect's leader,

109
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,700
you must return to Huizhou with me.

110
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,300
Deng Yunfeng,

111
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,620
didn't you hear?

112
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,660
They were

113
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,460
falsely accused back then.

114
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,980
You're so naive.

115
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,140
You believe whatever he says?

116
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,580
I deal in evidence.

117
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,660
Lord Deng,

118
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,940
he's my husband.

119
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,940
I know him.

120
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,540
He's made many mistakes,

121
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,100
but he's not an unforgivable villain.

122
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,180
Now that he's returned,

123
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,300
he'll be

124
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,700
a good husband

125
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,740
and a good father to Yingdan.

126
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,420
Yunfeng,

127
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,780
for my sake, I beg you.

128
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,540
Liu Guang,

129
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,740
I hope you'll fulfill your duty
as a father

130
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,020
and develop the antidote soon.

131
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,620
Yingdan is my own daughter.

132
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,260
Also,

133
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,980
Gou Lingfeng, you have to agree

134
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,500
to cooperate with me once we leave.

135
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,820
I already promised Aunt Lan.

136
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,420
I'm staying in Poison Valley

137
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,740
to be with Yingdan.

138
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,060
Lingfeng,

139
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,980
you're a grown man,

140
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,740
don't you have any ambition?

141
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,060
If you've got no drive at all,

142
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,340
how can I feel secure

143
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,860
marrying my daughter off to you?

144
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,460
- Mom!
- Wait,

145
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,940
Aunt Lan, that's not
what you said before!

146
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,900
You said I didn't need to

147
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,420
worry about a career,

148
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,580
that I could just pick flowers
and chill,

149
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,260
and not try to

150
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,540
have my nice cake and eat it too!

151
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,060
- That was...
- Enough.

152
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,180
Master,

153
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,660
maybe read a book or two.

154
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,420
I...

155
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,340
That was before.

156
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,420
Times have changed.

157
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,860
Now,

158
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,500
I think a man with ambition

159
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,540
is very important.

160
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,860
So cooperate nicely

161
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,860
with Lord Deng.

162
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,100
Cooperate with him.

163
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,740
Alright then.

164
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,020
You better keep your word.

165
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,620
(Poison Valley)

166
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,380
Mom,

167
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,140
you really don't need me
to stay with you?

168
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,140
Aunt Lan,

169
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,900
you really aren't coming with us?

170
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,620
I'm not going.

171
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,380
The poison in me has been cured.

172
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,460
Even without the miasma, I'll be fine.

173
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,300
Besides,

174
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,140
I'm used to living here now.

175
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,060
No point in moving around.

176
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,220
Most importantly,

177
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,340
wherever Guang is,

178
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,900
that's where I'll be.

179
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,260
Even though I really want

180
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,140
to stay here and live out
my days with you,

181
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,180
for the sake

182
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,980
of our daughter's poison,

183
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,340
I need to develop the antidote.

184
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,940
Yingdan,

185
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,700
you must be very careful out there.

186
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,380
Lingfeng,

187
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,940
you better not mistreat Yingdan.

188
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,540
Aunt Lan, don't worry.

189
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,500
With me around,

190
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,780
Yingdan won't suffer even a scratch.

191
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,940
And I've brought
the blood-replenishing pills

192
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,060
you gave me.

193
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,340
Her backlash

194
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,900
shouldn't be a problem.

195
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,820
Everyone,

196
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,060
I'll take my leave now.

197
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,060
Until we meet again.

198
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,180
Linglan,

199
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,020
I have to go.

200
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,300
Wait for me at home.

201
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,140
I'll be waiting for you, Guang.

202
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,980
Alright.

203
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,380
Mom, we're heading off too.

204
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,060
Go on, go on.

205
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,260
All of you, go.

206
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,300
Just go!

207
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,860
Take care of yourselves!

208
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,500
I missed you so much, Yingdan.

209
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,340
- I just...
- From now on, you two

210
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,340
can't say Ling'er and I

211
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,220
are clinging and whining.

212
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,100
You two are a lot worse than us.

213
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,020
- Are we?
- Are we?

214
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,860
Yes.

215
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,580
I've got a question.

216
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,140
What should I call Yingdan

217
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,900
since she's my master's wife now?

218
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,980
Whatever.

219
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,300
Figure it out myself.

220
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,460
That's a problem.

221
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,740
Not at all.

222
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,140
(Poison Valley)

223
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,820
Vice Chairman,

224
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,060
what should we do?

225
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,940
The Demonic Sect's leader Liu Guang
has reappeared,

226
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,300
and we just came back like this.

227
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,500
That doesn't sit right.

228
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,420
We took heavy losses in Poison Valley.

229
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,140
What were we supposed to do?

230
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,580
Stay and die?

231
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,100
This is a major issue.

232
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,700
I'll report it to the Chairman

233
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,900
and await his decision.

234
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,820
And you!

235
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,820
You made me so mad.

236
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,220
What kind of people did you find?

237
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,460
They didn't follow a single order!

238
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,940
Most of the MAA's heroes

239
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,100
are on missions.

240
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,300
It wasn't easy

241
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,660
gathering that many.

242
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,140
If you could

243
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,860
offer some compensation,

244
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,740
they'd definitely follow your lead
next time.

245
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,860
Talking to me about money?

246
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,740
What are you thinking?

247
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,300
Enough! Get out!

248
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,100
My Lady.

249
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,580
I asked you to keep an eye
on Gou Lingfeng.

250
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,380
Did something big happen?

251
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,340
Princess, let me tell you,

252
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,860
things are wild

253
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,300
at the MAA.

254
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,900
Those so-called heroes

255
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,780
were like headless flies
charging at Poison Valley.

256
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,020
Deng Yunfeng

257
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,180
tried to stop them
in his godfather's name,

258
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,020
but no one cared.

259
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,910
It didn't work at all.

260
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,860
And then?

261
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,940
Then...

262
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,140
Then I ran.

263
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,220
You ran?

264
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,700
My Lady,

265
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,060
Gou Lingfeng and his crew

266
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,700
probably didn't make it out.

267
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,980
And

268
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,060
Deng Yunfeng won't let this go easily.

269
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,540
It's way too embarrassing.

270
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,340
I didn't expect things

271
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,660
to spiral this badly.

272
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,980
But I told you before,

273
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,540
someone was bound to lose patience.

274
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,500
I just didn't think it'd be him.

275
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,300
He actually rescued

276
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,580
Gou Lingfeng and the others.

277
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,140
Someone actually saved Gou Lingfeng?

278
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,020
Then I left too early.

279
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,340
This

280
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,620
was just sent in by my men.

281
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,020
So I didn't leave too early, My Lady.

282
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,660
If I'd stayed a bit longer,
I'd be dead now.

283
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,220
This is Liu Guang,
the Demonic Sect's leader!

284
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,860
The Demonic Sect's leader

285
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,940
saved Gou Lingfeng?

286
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,820
So Gou Lingfeng really
is with the Demonic Sect?

287
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,180
Liu Guang went there

288
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,060
to rescue the Floral Knight
and her mother.

289
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,100
Then the Floral Knight
is from the Demonic Sect?

290
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,020
Liu Guang

291
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,940
is Floral Knight's father.

292
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,060
Father...

293
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,620
Father?

294
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,860
I need you

295
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,460
to help me fan the flames.

296
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:51,940
My Lady,

297
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,620
the Floral Knight seems innocent.

298
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
Even if...

299
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,900
Even if she's

300
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,220
Liu Guang's daughter,

301
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,940
she's dedicated to the people,

302
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,340
healing the sick.

303
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,020
Don't you think

304
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,100
maybe we shouldn't push her
into the fire?

305
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,260
Let me ask you:

306
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,340
What do you think of the MAA?

307
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,140
A bunch of useless rabble.

308
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,620
And Gou Lingfeng?

309
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,700
Gou Lingfeng

310
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,740
doesn't look like a good guy,

311
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,300
not good-looking,

312
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,980
doesn't speak nicely,

313
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,620
but honestly, he's a decent person.

314
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,340
I don't like him,

315
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,580
but we

316
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,220
don't have to destroy him either.

317
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,620
Gou Lingfeng is talented.

318
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,540
But right now,

319
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,540
he's blinded by the MAA

320
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,700
without realizing it.

321
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,420
The court needs capable people
right now.

322
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,900
What we're doing

323
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,140
is helping him see the truth.

324
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,420
You mean we're helping him?

325
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,260
Exactly.

326
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,100
Now

327
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,020
that makes me feel better.

328
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,900
I'll make sure

329
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,540
he doesn't last long in that MAA.

330
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,020
And once it's done,

331
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,420
you'll be handsomely rewarded.

332
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,140
No need, My Lady.

333
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,380
You can count on me.

334
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,980
I'll disgust him but I won't
lose sleep over it.

335
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,460
This is...

336
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,740
That is

337
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,860
just perfect.

338
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,940
Alright, I'm off now.

339
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,380
(The Demonic Sect Leader Liu Guang
Returns to the Martial World)

340
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,260
The former Demonic Sect leader Liu Guang
returns.

341
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,420
Gou Lingfeng, a hero of the MAA,

342
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,540
was apprenticed
to the Demonic Sect elder Gui Lao,

343
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,100
- I...
- for years,

344
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,540
and mastered demonic techniques.

345
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,980
Gou Lingfeng sheltered the Demonic
Sect's illegal salt smuggler Ye Dahei.

346
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,860
But...

347
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,860
Loyalty Knight broke into prison
to rescue Anicca Knight,

348
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,140
and used demonic power
to defeat All-Around Knight.

349
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,990
What...

350
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,900
He was stopped by Zhuge Heng.

351
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,620
What is all this nonsense?

352
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,140
This must be that Wang Zipeng's writing.

353
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,980
Right.

354
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,300
No outsider could know all this.

355
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,980
Someone must be leaking him information.

356
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,860
Demonic Sect remnants!

357
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,020
- Come out!
- Come out now!

358
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,860
Let's go!

359
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,700
- Come out!
- Come out!

360
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,380
Gou Lingfeng, come out!

361
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,230
Hurry up!

362
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,100
Come out! Come out!

363
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,020
You've got some nerve.

364
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,660
- What are you doing?
- What are you saying?

365
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,100
Why are you charging forward?

366
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,300
Harboring the Demonic Sect member?

367
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,620
- You...
- I...

368
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,460
Everyone,

369
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,620
I'm not with the Demonic Sect.

370
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,740
I am

371
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,580
a Tiger-rank hero of the MAA,

372
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,500
Gou Lingfeng!

373
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,940
Even Liu Guang showed up to save you,

374
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,900
how can you explain that?

375
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,750
- Liu...
- You are...

376
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,600
Who is Liu Guang?

377
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,420
- Yeah.
- He's the former Demonic Sect leader!

378
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,340
Wang Zipeng!

379
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,260
You are twisting the truth!

380
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,100
What's your motive?

381
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,420
The Floral Knight is the daughter
of Liu Guang.

382
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,300
She and they

383
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,490
are all Demonic Sect remnants,

384
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,370
aren't they?

385
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,300
- They are!
- Take them down!

386
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,180
- They're all Demonic Sect remnants!
- All of them!

387
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,220
- Get them!
- Demonic Sect remnants!

388
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,700
Take them down! Take them down!

389
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,420
The Chairman of the MAA,
Radiant Knight, arrives.

390
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,300
What's with all the noise?

391
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,540
Why so quiet now?

392
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,420
Gou Lingfeng

393
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,820
is a hero of the MAA.

394
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,940
You claim he's a Demonic Sect remnant,

395
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,180
do you have proof?

396
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,220
Proof, huh?

397
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,340
If anyone dares to spread rumors again,

398
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,660
I have ways

399
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,740
to shut them up.

400
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,700
Then what about the Floral Knight?

401
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,380
She is the Demonic Sect leader's
daughter.

402
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,420
She didn't know about
her lineage before.

403
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,060
And since joining the MAA, she's

404
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,980
achieved countless merits,

405
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,100
saving the sick and the dying.

406
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,620
Her chivalrous heart

407
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,820
is known to all.

408
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,180
Wang Zipeng.

409
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,540
Told you there's no proof.

410
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,580
Why are you hiding?

411
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,580
Your Publishing House

412
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,340
should stick to the truth.

413
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,300
Yes, Chairman.

414
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,260
Bad news! Floral Knight!

415
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,620
Vice Chairman He has been poisoned!

416
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,580
Chairman, you're here too!

417
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,340
What happened?

418
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,940
Just now, Liu Sanniang
went to your office

419
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,620
and found Vice Chairman He
collapsed on the ground,

420
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,500
foaming at the mouth.

421
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,620
He can't even speak clearly now!

422
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,780
He Changzai's done a lot of bad things.

423
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,100
He had it coming.

424
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,940
Exactly.

425
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,660
Yingdan, he nearly ruined us
in Poison Valley.

426
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,940
We're not helping him.

427
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,420
Floral Knight,

428
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,740
what happened in Poison Valley
was my fault.

429
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,180
Your have great medical skills.

430
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,460
Please, for my sake,

431
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,140
come with me to the MAA

432
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,220
and help save He Changzai.

433
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,780
Please.

434
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,700
Alright.

435
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,540
Changzai!

436
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,700
Changzai!

437
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,500
Floral Knight,

438
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,340
please save him!

439
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,860
Sanniang, don't panic.

440
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,700
Let me take a look.

441
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,860
Why's it him?

442
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,820
Lord He is out of danger.

443
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,220
There's still some remaining poison
in his body.

444
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,220
He needs rest.

445
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,460
Changzai,

446
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,780
how do you feel?

447
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,020
I'm okay.

448
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,860
Thank you, Floral Knight.

449
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,500
Don't mention it.

450
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,180
Sanniang,

451
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,500
take this prescription

452
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
and go get the medicine.

453
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,140
Changzai,

454
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,780
what happened?

455
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,020
Chairman,

456
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,860
someone tried to assassinate you!

457
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,660
What?

458
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,740
I just drank a cup of tea

459
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,780
and suddenly felt weak and limp.

460
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,580
When I tried to channel energy,

461
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,780
I started vomiting blood.

462
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,460
Then someone jumped through the window

463
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,700
and tried to stab me.

464
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,660
I used the last of my strength

465
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,500
to draw my bow and shoot him.

466
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,980
Good thing I've always trained hard

467
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,260
and stayed loyal

468
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,060
and diligent,

469
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,820
- so I didn't...
- Alright, alright.

470
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,380
get to the point.

471
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,700
The point is

472
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,820
the real target

473
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,700
was you, Chairman!

474
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,860
You drank my tea?

475
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,540
That's the real point.

476
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,940
You left in a hurry.

477
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,060
The tea you brew
has always been valuable.

478
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,340
I just didn't want it to go to waste.

479
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,980
But the tea isn't the point.

480
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,740
The point is

481
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,460
they really were trying to kill you.

482
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,300
Chairman,

483
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,100
that masked attacker

484
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,860
was from the Demonic Sect's
Alchemy Division!

485
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,820
The Alchemy Division?

486
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,540
Weren't they all arrested?

487
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,020
The one who captured them was

488
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,140
Deng Yunfeng!

489
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,300
I've long heard that Eunuch Deng

490
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,980
raises Demonic Sect remnants

491
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,100
to work for him.

492
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,460
Looks like it's true.

493
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,780
Deng Yunfeng,

494
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,020
as inspector of the MAA,

495
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,380
released a criminal,

496
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,860
aiding evil.

497
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,500
Chairman,

498
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,300
what should we do next?

499
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,300
This matter hasn't been
fully investigated yet.

500
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,620
You must not speak of it.

501
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,580
The Hero Gathering is about to begin.

502
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,940
I don't want anything going wrong.

503
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,020
I was so naive!

504
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,620
I almost believed

505
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,900
Deng Yunfeng's lies.

506
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,340
Deng Yunfeng is Eunuch Deng's
adopted son.

507
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,580
He probably handed those

508
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,660
Alchemy Division members

509
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,580
straight over to Eunuch Deng.

510
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,620
So everything the Chairman said is true.

511
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,780
Eunuch Deng is manipulating the MAA

512
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,100
and the entire martial world.

513
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,300
He has people impersonate
Demonic Sect members

514
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,660
to loot wealth

515
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,940
and build his own power base.

516
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,420
Good thing the Chairman
showed up in time to help us.

517
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,660
Otherwise, he'd have been
the one poisoned.

518
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,340
- True.
- He has done good all his life,

519
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,260
even Heaven helps him.

520
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,100
Lingfeng,

521
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,580
I still think we should be cautious.

522
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,420
I know

523
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,980
Deng Yunfeng's character.

524
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,660
He's not someone who can't tell right
from wrong.

525
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,700
What if all this is part of

526
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,100
- Wu Guangming's scheme?
- Yingdan,

527
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,700
how can you still...

528
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,780
These people came to attack now,

529
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,340
it's too much of a coincidence.

530
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,260
In this world, there are
no absolute friends,

531
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,820
only interests.

532
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,780
The GFTA is the number one
trade association.

533
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,860
Who wouldn't want to work with Mr. Gou?

534
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,780
Eunuch Deng saved the Sword Alliance

535
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,620
only because it benefitted him.

536
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,500
That makes sense.

537
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,020
Chairman Wu's saved me more than once

538
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,900
and I still doubted him.

539
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,020
I...

540
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,700
- Lingfeng!
- The most

541
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,140
hateful one is Deng Yunfeng.

542
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,540
He talked about reshaping the world
with me!

543
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,300
He just wants to rename it
after himself.

544
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,460
I heard that.

545
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,940
You are talking behind my back again.

546
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,340
Deng Yunfeng?

547
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,700
You've got the nerve to show up?

548
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,700
I came to discuss our cooperation.

549
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,060
What?

550
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,900
You are backing out again?

551
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,340
I must've been blind
to ever work with you.

552
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,540
You're shameless

553
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,490
and unreliable.

554
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,900
Let me ask you, you said you wanted to

555
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,220
rebuild the martial world,

556
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,080
in this "new world" you envision,

557
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,580
does Eunuch Deng still have a place?

558
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,380
Of course.

559
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,220
My godfather raised me,

560
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,620
gave me everything.

561
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,900
Then we have nothing to talk about.

562
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,780
What is wrong with you?

563
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,500
You got brainwashed by that old fox

564
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,460
Wu Guangming again?

565
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,780
Deng Yunfeng!

566
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,180
Watch your tongue!

567
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,020
Chairman Wu has the heart
of a true leader.

568
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,980
Only he

569
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,820
can guide the martial world
in the right direction.

570
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,180
I

571
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,060
can tell right from wrong.

572
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,940
You think you can?

573
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,620
Wu Guangming is a hypocrite!

574
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,940
Only you still believe him,

575
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,500
like a big fool!

576
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,060
The dumbest thing I did

577
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,700
was believing your lies

578
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,580
and agreeing to work with you.

579
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,740
Enough! Quit arguing.

580
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,780
Is it really impossible

581
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,700
for us to build
a brand new martial world

582
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,660
without Eunuch Deng

583
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,860
or Wu Guangming?

584
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,940
- Impossible!
- Impossible!

585
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,940
(Paper Shop)

586
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,140
Wait.

587
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,500
Who are you?

588
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,620
I've never seen you around.

589
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,940
Young man,

590
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,140
who are you?

591
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,420
I...

592
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,060
Uncle Wang.

593
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,100
Chief!

594
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,140
The Chief has returned!

595
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,140
Wang!

596
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,260
Chief!

597
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,540
You're alive!

598
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,140
Where have you been all these years?

599
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,020
Yes, Chief,

600
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,100
you're finally back!

601
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,940
Wang,

602
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,300
have you all been well these years?

603
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,100
We've suffered bitterly.

604
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,460
- Yes.
- The MAA

605
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,220
wants to wipe us out completely.

606
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,140
We barely survive now.

607
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,980
That's right.

608
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,220
Brothers, friends,

609
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,340
I know it's been hard

610
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,460
over the past years.

611
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,260
But now,

612
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,460
our Divine Sect is rising again.

613
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,900
I need your full support.

614
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,700
My lord, a message from Eunuch Deng.

615
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,540
Tell our men to prepare.

616
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,460
We've got a mission.

617
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,940
Yes.

618
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,540
Changzai,

619
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,380
the Hero Gathering is upon us.

620
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,060
Not a single mistake can be allowed.

621
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,780
Gou Lingfeng must win the Hero Token.

622
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,900
Only then can we restrain Eunuch Deng.

623
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,140
But the biggest problem now

624
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,220
is that he can't use demonic powers.

625
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,980
Don't worry about that, Chairman.

626
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,380
The current participants

627
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,060
are all from within the MAA.

628
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,380
I'll make sure everything is handled.

629
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,940
As long as Gou Lingfeng

630
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,900
makes it to the finals,

631
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,140
I'll hand over my position
as Chairman to him.

632
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,820
After ten years in this role,

633
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,380
I'm tired.

634
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,900
The future of the martial world

635
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,620
belongs to the young.

636
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,420
Changzai,

637
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,380
aside from me,

638
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,140
you're the most senior in the MAA.

639
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,780
You have no objections

640
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,660
to this arrangement, do you?

641
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,500
Well,

642
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,020
Chairman,

643
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,140
how could I?

644
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,700
You've dedicated yourself

645
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,100
to the growth of the MAA
all these years.

646
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,180
I will handle everything personally

647
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,540
so you have no need to worry.

648
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,900
(Eliminate Evil and Uphold Justice)

649
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,940
We thank Eunuch Deng for taking time
to join us.

650
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,820
My continued tenure as Chairman
of the MAA

651
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,820
is entirely thanks to the trust

652
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,300
from the court and from you.

653
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,340
Chairman Wu, you're far too modest.

654
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,620
You're not only a martial master,

655
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,340
but also a capable leader.

656
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,420
Under your guidance

657
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,740
all these years,

658
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,340
the MAA has grown ever stronger.

659
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,980
At times,

660
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,860
I even worry,

661
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,180
what would

662
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,420
become of the MAA

663
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,580
if one day we lost you?

664
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,740
What's that supposed to mean?

665
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,140
You flatter me.

666
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,140
As long as the court needs me,

667
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,060
I will devote myself

668
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,340
to the MAA

669
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,740
unto death.

670
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,980
By the way,

671
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,740
He Changzai is the lead coordinator

672
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,860
of this year's Hero Gathering.

673
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,020
Changzai,

674
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,100
present the full schedule

675
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,220
to Eunuch Deng in detail.

676
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,820
Yes, Chairman.

677
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,220
Sir.

678
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,500
Vice Chairman of the MAA, He Changzai,

679
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,540
is guilty of embezzlement

680
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,980
and abuse of power.

681
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,540
The evidence is solid.

682
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,660
I'm placing you under arrest.

683
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,500
- For real?
- How is that possible?

684
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,980
Deng Yunfeng,

685
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,540
Even if Eunuch Deng is here,

686
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,780
you can't slander someone like this
in public!

687
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
Inspector Deng,

688
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,980
you accuse Vice Chairman He
of corruption,

689
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,740
do you have proof?

690
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,700
If you can't substantiate it,

691
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,300
then it's defamation.

692
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,020
Forgive me, Chairman.

693
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,820
But He Changzai is despicable.

694
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,660
He's fooled

695
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,740
not only the public,

696
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,420
but even you, sir.

697
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,140
I've confirmed the following:

698
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,740
He owns six private residences,

699
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,020
eight estates,

700
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,420
a hundred servants,

701
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,860
over a hundred acres of farmland.

702
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,620
- That much?
- What?

703
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,940
- I...
- I wonder

704
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,860
if you have that kind of wealth,
Chairman?

705
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,020
Deng Yunfeng, you...

706
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,060
And these

707
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,820
are account books
from the Juhong Pavilion.

708
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,300
He receives a hefty sum monthly

709
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,780
from them.

710
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,460
Also, silver from the

711
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,860
Zang Family Trade Association.

712
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,900
And this,

713
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,340
a signed IOU from Gou Lingfeng of GFTA.

714
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,060
Vice Chairman He,

715
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,260
how

716
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,980
do you explain these?

717
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,020
Chairman,

718
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,660
I've been framed!

719
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,620
Please judge justly!

720
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,900
This is the MAA's matter!

721
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,260
Why are they interfering?

722
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,980
(Martial)

723
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,100
The MAA has always been just.

724
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,820
We will not let a single wrongdoer
escape,

725
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,660
nor will we wrong a single good man.

726
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,460
Guards!

727
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,660
Take He Changzai to the prison.

728
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,780
Chairman!

729
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,060
After the Hero Gathering,

730
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,100
I will personally see this case

731
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,020
thoroughly investigated.

732
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,100
Wise decision, Chairman!

733
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,220
Changzai!

734
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:27,100
(Eliminate Evil and Uphold Justice)

735
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,300
Chairman Wu is truly fair and upright!

736
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,700
I admire you.

737
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,180
You are the true treasure

738
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,860
of the MAA.

739
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,100
Although He Changzai

740
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,460
has been a longtime subordinate,

741
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,980
but since there are accusations,

742
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,540
the MAA will not tolerate it.

743
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,540
We will get to the bottom of it.

744
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,500
Very well.

745
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,100
An imperial decree!

746
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,740
By the mandate of Heaven,

747
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,220
His Majesty decrees:

748
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,300
The MAA is central to the martial world
of Great Xia.

749
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,780
(Imperial Edict)
To ensure vitality

750
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,900
and growth,

751
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,300
it is hereby ordered:

752
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,780
The presidency of the MAA

753
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,060
may not exceed two consecutive terms.

754
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,060
Thus decreed.

755
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:36,180
Long live His Majesty!

756
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,900
Everyone, rise.

757
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,140
Guangming,

758
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,300
this is all His Majesty's will.

759
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,540
Are they targeting Chairman Wu?

760
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,220
- Exactly!
- It's clearly aimed at him!

761
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,740
You're obviously

762
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,260
targeting Chairman Wu!

763
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,100
Master!

764
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,660
Are all young people

765
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,340
so disrespectful now?

766
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,420
The MAA was founded by Chairman Wu.

767
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,540
We've all seen his dedication

768
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,900
to the MAA.

769
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,140
And from the beginning,

770
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,100
he's been our one and only Chairman.

771
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,260
You dare say this imperial decree

772
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,980
isn't aimed at him?

773
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,980
Then what do you intend to do?

774
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,540
Defy the imperial edict?

775
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,500
And what if I do?

776
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,740
Lingfeng.

777
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,020
Gou Lingfeng.

778
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,620
It's been a while.

779
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,940
Seems I forgot something.

780
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,020
Chairman Wu,

781
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,940
the MAA represents the righteous path

782
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,140
of the martial world,

783
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,980
right?

784
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,380
If you let a demonic art user

785
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,260
- You...
- participate in the Hero Gathering,

786
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,460
what would people say?

787
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,100
Wouldn't the whole martial world

788
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,900
laugh at you for having
no decent talent?

789
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,460
Eunuch Deng, that's unjust.

790
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,380
The matter of demonic techniques

791
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,780
was clarified long ago.

792
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,460
He only learned a few moves

793
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,260
to infiltrate the Demonic Sect as a spy.

794
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,580
So just because he says so, it's true?

795
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,660
To me, he looks

796
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,340
more like a spy the Demonic Cult

797
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,940
planted in the MAA!

798
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,940
You...

799
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,740
Gou Lingfeng possesses demonic powers,

800
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,940
and now he's yelling
in front of everyone,

801
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,420
shaming the court.

802
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,300
I say, disqualify him from...

803
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,260
Bah!

804
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,060
Spitting at authority,

805
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,340
disrespecting the court!

806
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,540
Please calm your anger.

807
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,740
He didn't mean it that way.

808
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,140
Lingfeng!

809
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,460
Apologize now!

810
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,700
- I...
- You learned demonic arts

811
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,660
to protect yourself,

812
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,500
didn't you?

813
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,300
Then making a scene like this

814
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,140
just makes you look guilty.

815
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,820
It proves your crime.

816
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,660
Don't you see?

817
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,760
Come on!

818
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,900
Lingfeng,

819
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,260
apologize!

820
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,140
- Sir,
- Please calm down.

821
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,420
I was wrong.

822
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,300
Yes.

823
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,940
It was rash of me.

824
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,190
I apologize.

825
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,100
Please don't be angry.

826
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,940
Master.

827
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,340
You...

828
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,340
You're cursing me to die!

829
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,220
Wu Guangming!

830
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,500
You're doing this on purpose, right?

831
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,180
No, no!

832
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,100
Get up!

833
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,060
- Stop it now!
- Sir!

834
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,180
No, no, no.

835
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
Please don't be angry!

836
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,100
What's wrong, sir?

837
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,540
Lingfeng,

838
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,740
that's a ritual reserved for the dead!

839
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,300
For the dead?

840
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,140
Sir, I...

841
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,620
No one ever taught me that!

842
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,460
I... I was...

843
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,700
How about this?

844
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,820
You do that to me too.

845
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,860
Balance it out.

846
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,020
- What did you say?
- You bow back to me.

847
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,900
Just do it and

848
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,820
let's call it even.

849
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,140
- Lingfeng!
- Just bow back, alright?

850
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,980
Lingfeng!

851
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,280
Get out now!

852
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,140
Take him away!

853
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,980
OK.

854
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,900
Let's go, Master.

855
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,780
- Don't leave!
- Bow back first!

856
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,660
Come back here!

857
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,060
Eunuch Deng, sir.

858
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,060
You see,

859
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,900
this kid

860
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,260
is pure-hearted and sincere.

861
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,780
Don't you think the MAA

862
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,340
needs someone like that?

863
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,180
A young man who fears

864
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,220
no power and dares to speak the truth?

865
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,180
Think about it.

866
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,620
Isn't that right?

867
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,700
For your sake, Chairman Wu,

868
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,540
I'll reluctantly allow him

869
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,940
to compete in the Hero Gathering.

870
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,620
However,

871
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,740
he is absolutely forbidden

872
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,260
from using any demonic techniques.

873
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,100
Understood.

874
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,700
Otherwise, he'll be disqualified.

875
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,940
(The End of Episode 27)

876
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,340
(Upright and Incorruptible)

877
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,260
My lord.

878
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,100
I feel so regretful.

879
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,900
I actually can't let go of
that venomous woman.

880
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,340
It's all love's fault.

881
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,860
No,

882
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,420
it's my fault.

883
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,860
I just couldn't resist the poison
in her blood.

884
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,020
But

885
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,900
I like this kind of

886
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,100
painful joy, where you pour out

887
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,660
your love like a maniac,

888
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,020
and in return,
you're completely ignored.

889
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,180
Isn't that kind of pathetic?

890
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,180
I can't believe I even dreamed about it.
