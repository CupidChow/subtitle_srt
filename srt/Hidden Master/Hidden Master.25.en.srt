1
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,910
So this is why

2
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,240
you gave up the chance
to be with him forever?

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,390
He holds grand ambitions,

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,280
dreaming of peace for all under heaven.

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,920
He may be a bit lost now,

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,350
but I believe he'll find his way back.

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,830
It's just that

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,760
I'm not strong enough to do that
with him.

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,470
You're being foolish.

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,240
This is just what you think.

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,880
If that boy

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,520
truly loved you,

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,150
how could he just leave you behind?

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,710
If he truly loved you,

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,280
why hasn't he come to meet you here?

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,150
It's good he hasn't come.

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,280
Even if he did, I'd send him away.

64
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,750
Aunt Lan,

65
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,080
you're the prettiest,

66
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,030
the most beautiful of all.

67
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,710
Just let me see Yingdan, please.

68
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,120
I told you,

69
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,520
Yingdan is dead.

70
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,000
Why won't you believe me?

71
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,000
I do believe you.

72
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,150
How could I not believe you?

73
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,240
But even more,

74
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,960
I believe that Yingdan isn't dead.

75
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,590
Aunt Lan,

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,400
the veggies in your garden
are nearly withered.

77
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,190
And there's no strong laborer around
to help.

78
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,560
Let me water them for you, give them

79
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,400
some fertilizer.

80
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,160
So kind, loyal, and respectful.

81
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
He is truly

82
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,430
a good young man.

83
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,630
There aren't many people here,

84
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,070
but their manure is so stinky.

85
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,400
Rang,

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,120
how are they doing?

87
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,600
Mr. Gou has entered the valley.

88
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,560
He's talking with your mother

89
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,920
about holding a ghost marriage.

90
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,630
Ghost marriage?

91
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,510
Yup.

92
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,600
The Valley Master told him you're dead,

93
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,560
- so she wants him to stay
- What?

94
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,600
and fulfill filial duty for you.

95
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,800
He agreed instantly

96
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,830
and even said he'd bring
his dad here too.

97
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,560
Rang,

98
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,160
why is the food still like this?

99
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,480
Don't worry,

100
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,270
the good food's on its way!

101
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,480
Mr. Gou gave us money,

102
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,310
they have gone down the mountain
to buy supplies.

103
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,830
And you know what?

104
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,360
Mr. Gou is really a good guy.

105
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,800
Stop saying that.

106
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,120
And the others?

107
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,870
The other three are still trapped
in the poison formation.

108
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,830
And they've started fighting
among themselves.

109
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,390
Zhuge and Deng Yunfeng are
of course fighting.

110
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,230
Rang,

111
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,480
bring them in.

112
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,950
My mother won't make things hard
for them.

113
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,310
Aunt Lan, come on,

114
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,630
take me to see Yingdan.

115
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,480
It's Yingdan who doesn't want
to see you.

116
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,040
There's nothing I can do.

117
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,830
You know her temper.

118
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,240
Once she's made a decision,

119
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,120
no one can change her mind.

120
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,400
What exactly

121
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,510
did you do to upset her?

122
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,390
Just a small matter.

123
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,600
Aunt Lan,

124
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,270
where are my two friends?

125
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,190
They'll definitely help me.

126
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,800
Two?

127
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,240
Weren't there three?

128
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,560
Them?

129
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,750
They're still stuck
in my poison formation.

130
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,680
My Lady,

131
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,480
I just brought those guys in

132
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,390
when the Valley Master caught me.

133
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,480
Now they're all locked up.

134
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,310
What a bunch of ungrateful traitors!

135
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,440
Didn't you say

136
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,390
you wouldn't go

137
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,310
see that Gou Lingfeng?

138
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,800
Who said I went to see him?

139
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,830
I went to save my friends.

140
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,720
You're not swaying

141
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,870
just because that boy said

142
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,630
he'd stay in the valley

143
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,070
for you, are you?

144
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,120
Let me tell you something,

145
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,950
every man in the world

146
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,510
is cold-hearted and unreliable.

147
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,830
So what if they are?

148
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,040
What's that got to do with me?

149
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,070
You! You...

150
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,000
You're so stubborn!

151
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
I'm telling you,

152
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,070
Gou Lingfeng's actually

153
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,430
not a bad kid.

154
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,720
If there's something between you two,

155
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,310
you should talk it out face to face.

156
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
I think he's

157
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,510
kind of pitiful.

158
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,680
That is none of my business!

159
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,070
You're really gonna drive me mad!

160
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,120
- Come on, let's go!
- What are you doing?

161
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,960
Come with me!

162
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,400
Seven Characters!

163
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,400
Self-draw!

164
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,510
- You lot!
- Yingdan!

165
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,800
- Talk some sense into her.
- Yingdan.

166
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,360
Lingfeng came all this way to find her,

167
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,600
and she shuts the door in his face?

168
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,680
What kind of attitude is that?

169
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,830
Yingdan!

170
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,070
We finally get to see you!

171
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,920
Come, Yingdan,

172
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,120
have a seat, sit down.

173
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,960
What?

174
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,120
Let's play mahjong.

175
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,070
We're short one player.

176
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,120
Come on, sit, sit, sit!

177
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,040
Miss,

178
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,510
where exactly is Yingdan?

179
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,800
Can't say.

180
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,830
The Valley Master told me not to.

181
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,830
But Miss, just look at your clothes,

182
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,240
they're all worn out.

183
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Here, go buy a new set.

184
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,270
Alright then.

185
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,480
Mr. Gou,

186
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,480
the Valley Master locked her
and your three friends

187
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,830
up together.

188
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,800
Mr. Gou!

189
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,160
- Help!
- Save us!

190
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,070
Ling'er, I'm sorry!

191
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,240
Godfather!

192
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,120
I'm scared of the dark!

193
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,320
Please, Mr. Gou, save me!

194
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,720
Mahjong! Again!

195
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,510
Deng Yunfeng,

196
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,390
are you lying to me?

197
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,120
You said you've never played before,

198
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,200
how come you keep winning?

199
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,480
Are you cheating?

200
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,950
You're just bad at it,
don't blame others.

201
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,840
You...

202
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,120
Heng,

203
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,480
we came into Poison Valley together,

204
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,870
and now we're locked up together too.

205
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,440
That counts as going through
thick and thin.

206
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,790
For Ling'er's sake,

207
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,910
I'll let it go.

208
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,120
I was just in sync with Yingdan!

209
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,150
Quick, paste it on him!

210
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,450
- Yingdan!
- You...

211
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,270
Master!

212
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,390
Zhuge! Ling'er!

213
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,910
Are you alright?

214
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,320
You guys...

215
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,840
Yingdan,

216
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,440
are you okay?

217
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,150
We're all fine, Mr. Gou.

218
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,670
Master, I'm not okay!

219
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,030
My face is full of stickers!

220
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,480
Good thing you're here,
your face is big!

221
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,390
Share some stickers with me!

222
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,120
I was worried sick about you all,

223
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,440
and you're in here eating well,
drinking fine,

224
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,440
and playing happily?

225
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,600
Honestly,

226
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,320
don't even get out,

227
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,630
just stay in here!

228
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,120
What's wrong with Mr. Gou?

229
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,030
No one even chased after me!

230
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,630
Why is Mr. Gou angry?

231
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
Master, don't be mad!

232
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,440
Master!

233
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,240
Don't run, don't run!

234
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,910
We can't do strenuous exercise!

235
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,080
Weren't you all pretty strenuous

236
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,840
playing mahjong just now?

237
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,200
What now?

238
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,200
Well, we're almost dead.

239
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,910
Mr. Gou,

240
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,080
our poison's not fully cured yet.

241
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,200
Right.

242
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,320
Their poison's only half cleared.

243
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,750
My mother

244
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,150
only detoxed part of it.

245
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,840
Come with me.

246
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,840
Slow down, slow down!

247
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,910
I feel dizzy.

248
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,590
So dizzy!

249
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,280
What?

250
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
What is this?

251
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,480
Eat this, and

252
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,320
the poison will be gone.

253
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,560
Thank you.

254
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,080
Let me wash it for you.

255
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,120
Wash it before you eat.

256
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,960
It's fine.

257
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,510
Pretty particular, huh?

258
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,440
Eat it.

259
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,910
It tastes pretty good.

260
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,320
That's because I just

261
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,870
fertilized this patch of ground.

262
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,120
They're all out?

263
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,960
Yes, Valley Master,

264
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,480
Mr. Gou personally let them out.

265
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,750
My peaceful days in Poison Valley

266
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,030
are over now.

267
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,440
Look at what you've done!

268
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,000
Why is it

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,240
that the older you get,

270
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,270
the more you help outsiders?

271
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
But

272
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,390
they're all Yingdan's friends.

273
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,080
People's hearts are hidden deep,

274
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,510
friend or foe

275
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,720
isn't something you can tell
just by words.

276
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,390
Maybe we should toss them out

277
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,270
like before.

278
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,390
You're better now, right?

279
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,630
Much better! Much better!

280
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,510
Our strength is just

281
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,480
about fully recovered.

282
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,150
- We're not okay at all!
- That's great.

283
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,320
We almost died on the way here!

284
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,240
Your Poison Valley is way too ruthless!

285
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,150
The poisons here

286
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,600
are meant to defend against enemies.

287
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,550
We're not your enemies!

288
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,390
Yingdan,

289
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,270
this time we really owe you.

290
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,630
If not for you,

291
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,870
we'd probably be dead out there.

292
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,040
Thank you.

293
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,200
No need for thanks.

294
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,550
You helped me before too.

295
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,440
He really helped you?

296
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,790
I thought he was tricking us.

297
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,870
Didn't expect Lord Deng

298
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,200
to actually be a good guy.

299
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,440
Gou Lingfeng sure

300
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,910
made a big scene this time.

301
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,150
When we came,

302
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
people from the MAA were tailing us.

303
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm worried they might

304
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,320
cause trouble for your Zhu Gou Team.

305
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,680
It doesn't matter.

306
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,280
I don't

307
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,120
plan on leaving anyway.

308
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,960
Why not?

309
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,440
No reason.

310
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't plan on going back either.

311
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,120
Aunt Lan already agreed,

312
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,080
I'm marrying into Poison Valley.

313
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,240
I'm staying too.

314
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,360
What are you staying for?

315
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,840
Did Aunt Lan agree to that?

316
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,320
Did I agree?

317
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,910
Wishful thinking.

318
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,670
Master,

319
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,840
you're abandoning me like that?

320
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,320
You're abandoning me too?

321
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,790
To be honest,

322
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,670
there's nothing about you two I'll miss.

323
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,510
All the way here, you were

324
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,440
clinging and whining.

325
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,000
I've long wanted to get away
from you both.

326
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,670
Yingdan, look at him!

327
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,200
None of you stay.

328
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,040
You all leave.

329
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,270
Yingdan,

330
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,550
how are you feeling?

331
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,710
Much better.

332
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,030
The miasma in Poison Valley

333
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,440
- neutralized the poison in me.
- That's great.

334
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,870
As long as you're okay.

335
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,720
Don't worry,

336
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,200
once I marry into Poison Valley, I'll...

337
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,440
What's that got to do with you?

338
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,510
Let's go.

339
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,870
Master.

340
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,120
We've said every nice thing
we could for you.

341
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,550
But Yingdan just won't forgive you.

342
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,150
And now Deng Yunfeng

343
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,960
is hovering around her all attentive.

344
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,200
I think you're

345
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
out of luck.

346
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,790
Then what should I do?

347
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,390
If you want to win Yingdan over,

348
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,080
I do have a plan.

349
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,630
What is it?

350
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,480
Rang said,

351
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,320
Yingdan really loves

352
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,670
those scenes in novels where

353
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,670
the devoted male lead plays
a leaf flute for the heroine,

354
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,550
saying that's what real love looks like.

355
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,350
Yingdan.

356
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,840
Yingdan!

357
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,230
Yingdan!

358
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,680
Stop playing.

359
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,630
Why did you stop faking it?

360
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,840
Why are you here?

361
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,480
It must be Deng Yunfeng

362
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,390
who played tricks behind the scenes!

363
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,670
I'm so mad!

364
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,510
Fine, that one didn't work.

365
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,480
We've got another plan.

366
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
Master,

367
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
here's the next one:

368
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,480
you sneak along the eaves over there,

369
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,790
quiet and sneaky...

370
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,750
Master!

371
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,510
Don't come any closer!

372
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,390
Come on!

373
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,230
This

374
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,390
is a giant bug I worked hard to catch.

375
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,630
In a bit,

376
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,630
Ling'er and I

377
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,600
will toss it

378
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,630
into Yingdan's room.

379
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,630
Imagine a girl

380
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,840
seeing a bug this big,

381
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,910
she's bound to scream.

382
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,030
Then she'll definitely cry out:

383
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,030
"Lingfeng, help me!"

384
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,870
And that's your moment!

385
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,840
I'm scared.

386
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,480
Zhuge,

387
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,720
I'm really scared.

388
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,270
Scared my foot!

389
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,320
Take it.

390
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,470
Today,

391
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,790
you must take this seriously.

392
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,360
You cannot let me down.

393
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,670
You can't let Ling'er down.

394
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,150
And you can't let Yingdan down!

395
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:21,990
You can't

396
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,030
- betray Yingdan's...
- Yingdan!

397
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,840
Yingdan!

398
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,790
Betray my what?

399
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,510
Yingdan.

400
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,080
Are you all done making a scene yet?

401
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,510
Tomorrow, I'm sending you all out.

402
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,550
Yingdan, sit here.

403
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,950
- Yingdan.
- Deng Yunfeng,

404
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,520
you sit there.

405
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,350
Not bad, huh?

406
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,390
Yingdan,

407
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,920
more veggies makes you run fast,

408
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,070
more meat gives you muscles!

409
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
What are you even saying?

410
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,200
Heng, eat this!

411
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,030
- And this!
- Okay, okay!

412
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,900
And this!

413
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,000
Ling'er, you eat too!

414
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,590
Mr. Gou,

415
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,830
you eat this!

416
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,440
And this!

417
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,240
Yingdan,

418
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,310
I gotta say, your food here is amazing.

419
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,480
Mr. Zhuge, you might not know,

420
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,270
these are all from the bride price money

421
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,790
our young master gave

422
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,880
a few days ago.

423
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,640
Even those lamb legs we gave you earlier

424
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,000
were all from the bride price silver.

425
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,350
Before that,

426
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,200
we'd been eating

427
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,640
plain greens for months,

428
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,310
without seeing a scrap of meat.

429
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,150
Stop talking.

430
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,790
Who did you just say?

431
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,480
Our young master.

432
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,320
Young master?

433
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,870
Me.

434
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,670
Me.

435
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,030
What was that money again?

436
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,480
The bride price for marrying
our young lady,

437
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,310
a whole 2,000 taels in banknotes.

438
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,440
It's nice to have money.

439
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,280
Mr. Gou,

440
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,520
you...

441
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,200
What bride price?

442
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
It's not a bride price.

443
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
Just to improve the food
around the valley.

444
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,310
I'm just a live-in son-in-law,

445
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,590
no need for a bride price.

446
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,750
Well, I'll also have someone

447
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,590
bring over my salary from

448
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,790
the past few months tomorrow.

449
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,680
It's not much,

450
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,000
but it should help a bit

451
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
with the food situation.

452
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,840
No, we can't.

453
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,510
When I went out shopping,

454
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,750
I saw some people

455
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,000
heading toward Poison Valley.

456
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,400
We need to be cautious these
next few days.

457
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,000
It must be people sent by

458
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,110
He Changzai.

459
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,200
Mr. Deng's kind intentions

460
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,510
might go to waste.

461
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,270
How could they...

462
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,840
Yingdan, they're

463
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,110
not here for anything good.

464
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,070
We need to prepare in advance.

465
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,830
The entrance to Poison Valley
is well hidden.

466
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,400
They shouldn't have found it.

467
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,270
Now that you mention it,

468
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,720
there were people

469
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,510
from the MAA tailing us
the whole way here.

470
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,270
Could Lord Deng be crying thief
to cover for himself?

471
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,510
You're suspecting me?

472
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,110
I would

473
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,160
never harm Yingdan.

474
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,880
Look at you, being all petty.

475
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,550
And you want Yingdan to forgive you?

476
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,070
You're one to talk.

477
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,310
Deng Yunfeng,

478
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,000
you can't beat me,

479
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,960
so you resort to sneaky tricks.

480
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,790
Yingdan's never going to like you.

481
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,640
- What did you say?
- Enough!

482
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,830
Even eating can't shut your mouths?

483
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,730
Yingdan,

484
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,400
my master just has a nasty mouth,

485
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
but he's actually

486
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,750
a good guy,

487
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,880
way better than this Lord Deng.

488
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
You shut up too.

489
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,430
I'm full.

490
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,040
Yingdan.

491
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,040
Yingdan,

492
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,790
is that you?

493
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,680
It's me.

494
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm asleep!

495
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,750
I'm coming in since you

496
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,680
won't open the door.

497
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,310
In the middle of the night, you...

498
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,800
I'll cut to the chase.

499
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,070
I want to cooperate with you.

500
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,790
Why would I cooperate with you?

501
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,030
For Yingdan.

502
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,270
I'll do everything I can

503
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,920
to stop the MAA from hurting her.

504
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,520
After all,

505
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,720
her identity is quite special.

506
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,720
Lord Deng,

507
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,270
you're truly shameless.

508
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,880
How can you even say something
like that?

509
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,590
It's the only thing I can do for her.

510
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,240
If you don't agree, fine.

511
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,070
But when those people show up
in a few days

512
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,930
and storm the valley,

513
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,000
even if you can escape,

514
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,110
can Yingdan or Ling'er?

515
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,440
Deng Yunfeng,

516
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
what are you trying to do?

517
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,480
I don't want to hurt you.

518
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,920
Gou Lingfeng,

519
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,790
you're with

520
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,350
unmatched martial arts,

521
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,640
obnoxious,

522
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,790
but upright.

523
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,200
If we work together

524
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,750
to seize the Hero Token,

525
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,270
then all the authority

526
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,720
of both the MAA and the Court's PSD

527
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,510
would be ours to command.

528
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,030
I know the MAA is rotten inside.

529
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,350
That's why

530
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,400
we need people like us

531
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,160
to purify...

532
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,510
Can you stop blowing the candle

533
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,640
and just listen to what I'm saying?

534
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,400
To purify that corruption,

535
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,240
and return peace to the MAA

536
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,640
and the martial world.

537
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,400
I've promised Aunt Lan

538
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,270
that I'll stay here.

539
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,510
A few days is fine.

540
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,550
But what about long term?

541
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,070
Do you really think the MAA

542
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,960
will let you and Yingdan go?

543
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,790
Don't you want Yingdan to see you
in a new light?

544
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,830
Don't you want to become

545
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,240
a true hero admired by all?

546
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,480
Let me think about it.

547
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,720
Time's running out.

548
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,040
Aunt Lan?

549
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,870
What?

550
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,160
Starting to waver now?

551
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,830
I said consider, not agree.

552
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,000
Kid,

553
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,200
you can't have your cake and eat it too.

554
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,350
Look at you,

555
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,190
a grown man,

556
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,920
hesitating like this.

557
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,000
Just look around.

558
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,310
Isn't Poison Valley great?

559
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,440
As my live-in son-in-law,

560
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,070
you wouldn't need to
worry about anything.

561
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,000
You could spend your days

562
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,590
with my Yingdan,

563
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,350
have a bunch of kids,

564
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,640
and live

565
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,160
a peaceful life.

566
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,070
Don't tell me you're not tempted.

567
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,910
I...

568
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,200
I am tempted.

569
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
Very tempted.

570
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,790
Aunt Lan,

571
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,750
let me think about it a bit more.

572
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,240
Still thinking?

573
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,640
That young man who just

574
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
left your room

575
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,680
was great.

576
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,790
What was his name, something "Feng"?

577
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,550
Smooth skin, nice face.

578
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,550
I think he and Yingdan would
make a lovely pair.

579
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,880
Maybe I'll go ask him.

580
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,070
Aunt Lan,

581
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,770
have mercy!

582
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,350
Listen,

583
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,640
that guy

584
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,680
is no good!

585
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Do you know

586
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,480
who his godfather is?

587
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,070
Eunuch Deng.

588
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,410
He's Eunuch Deng's godson?

589
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,550
So he's powerful.

590
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,310
He's handsome and has a bright future.

591
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,680
Wow.

592
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,270
I've been underestimating him.

593
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,440
Worse case,

594
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,350
Yingdan could have a godfather too.

595
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,560
Aunt Lan!

596
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,590
I won't let Yingdan

597
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,110
marry another man!

598
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,960
- Rang.
- Mr. Gou.

599
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,550
She isn't in her room.

600
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,720
She's not? Where did she go?

601
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,110
Valley Master said she's free.

602
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,440
All of us here

603
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,000
are supposed to help Master Deng

604
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,310
and her cultivate their relationship.

605
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,270
What?

606
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,680
Actually, I prefer you, Mr. Gou.

607
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,880
I wanted to call you young master.

608
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,400
But Yingdan wouldn't let me.

609
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,160
So where exactly did Yingdan go?

610
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,270
She didn't say.

611
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,270
And we're not allowed to ask.

612
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,960
Fine.

613
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,240
Master! Master, Master!

614
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,640
- Guess what I saw!
- I'm not guessing.

615
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,160
Just guess, you'll be interested!

616
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,640
I'm already not interested.

617
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,480
- Come on, come on!
- Mr. Gou!

618
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,640
We followed Yingdan out this morning

619
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,720
and saw something huge

620
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,790
in the back mountain.

621
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,240
Yingdan went to the back mountain?

622
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,510
Ling'er and I were going to

623
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,960
watch the sunrise,

624
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,310
but then we saw Yingdan

625
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,240
sneaking off to the back mountain.

626
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,880
The scary part is

627
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,680
Deng Yunfeng was following her.

628
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,590
What?

629
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,790
He thought he was the mantis
stalking the cicada,

630
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,640
but we were the birds

631
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,960
watching them both!

632
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,190
Master.

633
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:33,700
(No Entry)

634
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,600
Yingdan.

635
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,000
What are you doing here?

636
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,640
I came to seek forgiveness

637
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,550
from my ancestors.

638
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,240
Yingdan,

639
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,350
did you do something

640
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,790
that would shame them?

641
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,000
Heng! Watch your words.

642
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,720
Please forgive him,

643
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,960
he didn't mean it like that.

644
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,110
Yeah, I didn't mean it that way.

645
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,030
Then Yingdan,

646
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,680
why are you here?

647
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,310
Leaving the valley,

648
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,110
upsetting my mother, and other things,

649
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,680
I owe penance.

650
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,310
- Then, let me do it with you.
- Master.

651
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,150
What are you doing?

652
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,190
Get up.

653
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,880
No.

654
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,110
You're not related to me,

655
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,110
you're not from Poison Valley,

656
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,960
why are you even here?

657
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,800
Get up!

658
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,750
I'm your mother's son-in-law now!

659
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,350
That means I am from Poison Valley!

660
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,590
Ancestors...

661
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,550
Who said you could be my husband?

662
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,480
I never agreed to that!

663
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,400
Yingdan, these are your ancestors.

664
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,510
They'll forgive you

665
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,790
for whatever you did.

666
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,070
So don't beat yourself up.

667
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,680
We're not even on the same path.

668
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,550
Stay out of my business.

669
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,000
Ancestors, please bless us both...

670
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,110
- Yingdan.
- Stop following me.

671
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,750
You mangy dog.

672
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,350
Vice Chairman,

673
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,480
this poisonous miasma is deadly.

674
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,750
Forcing our way in could cost us
our lives.

675
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,870
Right.

676
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,270
Where are Sniffer Knight

677
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,550
and Far-Sight Knight?

678
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,160
They're behind us.

679
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,390
Come over.

680
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,510
We are here, Vice Chairman He!

681
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,790
Come on, make way.

682
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,680
Make way.

683
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,790
Step out of my way.

684
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,030
Here, this way.

685
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,310
Come on, this way!

686
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,320
We are here!

687
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,910
Alright.

688
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,400
Time for you two to redeem yourselves.

689
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,240
Take a sniff.

690
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:28,920
Come on.

691
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Let's do it together.

692
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,640
My eyes are blind,

693
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,510
so I can't hear anything!

694
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,440
I'm deaf,

695
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,480
so I can't see a thing!

696
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,960
Vice Chairman He,

697
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,790
could we settle that
case investigation fee

698
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,920
from last time first?

699
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,640
Are you serious?

700
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,270
What service did you provide?

701
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,270
You asking me for money?

702
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,790
You must be kidding me!

703
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,550
Vice Chairman He,

704
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,750
you want to skip out on the payment?

705
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,720
Yes, I am.

706
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,240
I am skipping out.

707
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,530
What are you gonna do about it?

708
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,920
- Not paying?
- Not paying?

709
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,480
No!

710
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,070
Fine, whatever.

711
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,030
Cut it out! Get in there!

712
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,010
Get in!

713
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,630
Move!

714
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,800
Yingdan!

715
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,080
- Mr. Deng.
- Yingdan!

716
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,630
Mr. Deng!

717
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,310
I read the stars last night,

718
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,720
tomorrow is an auspicious day!

719
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,790
How about you two

720
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,750
just have your wedding night tonight?

721
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,960
- What do you say?
- What?

722
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,160
What "what"?

723
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,150
Aunt Lan,

724
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,240
this isn't Yingdan's idea, is it?

725
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,080
What,

726
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,790
you don't want to?

727
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,480
Yingdan is the only heir

728
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,590
of our Poison Valley bloodline.

729
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,030
She's got looks

730
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,830
and status.

731
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,030
Now you're hesitating?

732
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,680
Aunt Lan,

733
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,200
what about me then?

734
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,720
Weren't you focusing on your career?

735
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,800
Aunt Lan,

736
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,030
does Yingdan know about this?

737
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,720
I'm sincere about her,

738
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,880
but I have to consider her feelings.

739
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,550
You're acting like this
is some real thing.

740
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,590
Aunt Lan,

741
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,510
Yingdan wouldn't agree to this.

742
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,880
Marriage is decided by the parents.

743
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Since when does the bride get a say?

744
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,000
But...

745
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,160
Aunt Lan, I think we should ask for

746
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,680
- Yingdan's opinion.
- Yeah, exactly!

747
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,160
This is her future we're talking about.

748
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,000
Yes.

749
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,070
You little girl,

750
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,030
you against this marriage?

751
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,720
You're quite a pretty one,

752
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,440
don't tell me you've fallen

753
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,680
for Mr. Deng?

754
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,400
- Aunt Lan, I...
- No, no, no!

755
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,750
Aunt Lan, she's mine.

756
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,920
My master may be an idiot sometimes,

757
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,030
but this isn't right.

758
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,800
Aunt Lan,

759
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,720
are you feeling okay?

760
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,070
Mr. Deng,

761
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,920
you are so caring,

762
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,680
you really grow on people.

763
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,310
Now I need to go find
that silly daughter of mine

764
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,680
and have a real talk with her.

765
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,440
She's just so bad at picking men.

766
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,640
- Valley Master.
- Aunt Lan! Aunt Lan!

767
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,740
(The End of Episode 25)

768
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,160
Heng,

769
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,240
the moon looks beautiful tonight.

770
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
No matter how beautiful,

771
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,680
it's still not as pretty as you.

772
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,760
What's wrong?

773
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,350
Deng Yunfeng?

774
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,030
It's already so late.

775
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,640
Yingdan, is that you?

776
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,510
It's me.

777
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,440
I'm asleep!

778
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,790
I'm coming in since you
won't open the door.

779
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,480
In the middle of the night, you...

780
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,750
Isn't that Aunt Lan?

781
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,030
Aunt Lan?

782
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,510
My master's having

783
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,920
quite the busy night.

784
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,550
