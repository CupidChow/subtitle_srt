Not bad.

55
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,960
I bought you all the most famous snacks

56
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
from Huizhou City.

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,120
Here's your food.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,910
This is it?

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,080
Yes.

I want meat! Big fish, big meat!

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,240
You look like big fish to me.

00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,430
- But I'm injured!
- You...

63
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,430
Yingdan is also not well right now.

64
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,680
Yingdan, how's your backlash?

65
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,870
It's already fine.

66
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,470
Right.

67
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,630
Crane Knight sent a letter saying

68
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,470
they're rebuilding the Blade God's
old home.

69
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,840
It'll be the future gathering place
for the Divine Blade Sect.

70
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,150
Those two brothers are inseparable now,

71
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,030
and said they'll manage
the sect together.

72
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,960
Heng and Mr. Gou

73
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,590
are also inseparable now.

74
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,360
Ling'er, don't bring that up.

75
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,000
Ling'er's right!

76
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,680
In this life,

77
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,560
it's rare to meet and

78
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
truly know each other.

79
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,190
Although you two are master
and disciple,

80
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,750
you are more like brothers.

81
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,590
That bond is even rarer.

82
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,840
Well, he's always been sharp-tongued!

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,120
Only because you pissed me off!

84
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,080
You...

85
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,920
Enough.

86
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,310
Everyone's here?

87
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,640
Yingdan.

88
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,920
Gou Lingfeng.

89
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,080
Which great hero did this to you?

90
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,000
Deng Yunfeng,

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,470
why are you everywhere?

92
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,190
Just focus on healing.

93
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,030
I dropped by to check on you all.

94
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,240
I brought you some specialties
from the capital,

95
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,430
Osmanthus pastries.

96
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,240
- I'll take those.
- Any meat?

97
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,190
You look like meat to me.

98
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,760
- I...
- Enough already.

99
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,470
Thanks for the trouble.

100
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,360
- No...
- So lively!

101
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,480
My Lady.

102
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,800
- I brought some food and liquor
- My Lady.

103
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,560
to celebrate Mr. Gou's release
from prison.

104
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,310
Thought I'd help him drive away
bad luck.

105
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,630
I didn't expect everyone to be here.

106
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,070
Yeah, truly bad luck.

107
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,800
Then I'll get to the point.

108
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,430
When I returned to the capital,
I learned

109
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,480
you "Zhu Gou Team" have made

110
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,950
quite a name for yourselves.

111
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,510
My godfather thinks highly of you.

112
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,360
Would you consider joining the court?

113
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,830
Enough, Deng Yunfeng.

114
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,630
Do you have to bring up

115
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,270
a buzzkill topic at a time like this?

116
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,310
It's good to you all.

117
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,310
Mr. Gou,

118
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,750
you were a convict,

119
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,800
then got involved in
the Divine Blade Sect mess.

120
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,480
If not for Eunuch Deng's pardon,

121
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,950
you'd be unable to clear your name.

122
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,560
This is a favor

123
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,000
you should remember.

124
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,040
Deng Yunfeng,

125
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,120
you saved my master this time,

126
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,240
- and we're really grateful to you,
- Yeah.

127
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,680
but the few of us

128
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,190
are used to being free.

129
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,510
We don't want anything to do
with the court.

130
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,960
Alright, alright.

131
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,560
We've all gathered today.

132
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,630
Let's not waste the fine food
and liquor.

133
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,470
Yeah!

134
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,070
Heng, here!

135
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,470
Is it good?

136
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,560
So good.

137
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,560
Yingdan, is it good?

138
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,960
I can help myself.

139
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,720
I've been so busy lately,

140
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,630
I haven't had time to congratulate

141
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,160
Your Ladyship and Lord Deng.

142
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,870
Your Ladyship is clever and bright,

143
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,680
and Lord Deng just took office
as Inspector,

144
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
such a promising future.

145
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,510
You are a perfect match,

146
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,510
truly a blessed union.

147
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,000
What's wrong, Yingdan?

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,240
- Yingdan.
- Yingdan, are you alright?

149
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
No, I'm fine. Just choked a little.

150
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,190
Stop acting tough at this time!

151
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,030
I said I'm fine.

152
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,190
Be careful, Master!

153
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,910
Gou Lingfeng!

154
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,870
Put me down!

155
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,360
(Martial Artists Association)

156
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,160
The clerks responsible for core intel

157
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,510
and mission dispatches in the guild,

158
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,850
were replaced by Deng Yunfeng
with his own people.

159
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,590
Fine.

160
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,920
All these years I've spent so much money

161
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,750
training those people!

162
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,510
Now he's cutting me off at the root.

163
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,670
Alright.

164
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,240
Deng Yunfeng,

165
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,600
you just wait.

166
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,740
(Qingyu Garden)

167
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,160
Lord Deng, time to say goodbye.

168
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,360
You've had enough to drink tonight.

169
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,430
Head back and rest.

170
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,270
My Lady,

171
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,870
you know Zhuge Heng has someone
in his heart.

172
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,430
I don't understand why

173
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,950
you're still so hung up on him.

174
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,000
Do you need a reason to like someone?

175
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,390
You should focus on
your own issues first.

176
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,710
I...

177
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,980
(Qingyu Garden)

178
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,440
Lord Deng,

179
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,150
you're still here?

180
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,190
How's your

181
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,270
backlash?

182
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,600
How do you know about that?

183
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,720
Yingdan.

184
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,560
- Lord Deng.
- I...

185
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,920
It's getting late.

186
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,120
If there's nothing else,

187
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,960
please leave.

188
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
Yingdan, I mean no harm.

189
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,070
Let me show you something
very important.

190
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,240
Do you remember this?

191
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,200
Little Stone.

192
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,550
Your hair looks better tied up.

193
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,600
You're bleeding.

194
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,720
My blood is poisonous!

195
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,080
Get away, Little Stone!

196
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,510
Quick, take this antidote.

197
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,240
I'm sorry, Little Stone. I'm sorry.

198
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,030
You're

199
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,200
Little Stone?

200
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,910
Yes.

201
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,510
Then...

202
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,360
Why?

203
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,320
Why what?

204
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,630
Why did you leave without a word?

205
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,120
The poisonous kid has no friend.

206
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,320
Her friend is gone.

207
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,600
We're not playing with you.

208
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,750
Let's go.

209
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,240
Back then,

210
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,800
you

211
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,240
were my only friend.

212
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,710
Yingdan,

213
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,360
I was adopted by my godfather.

214
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,720
I wanted to say goodbye,

215
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,790
but you didn't come.

216
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,560
All these years,

217
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,080
I've been looking for you,

218
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,960
always.

219
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,160
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,030
But I'm back now.

221
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,920
Yingdan,

222
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,000
I've thought of you all these years.

223
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,510
I never forgot you.

224
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,390
Actually, back at the MAA,
I recognized you.

225
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,550
But I knew you wouldn't forgive me.

226
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,790
So I just watched over you from afar.

227
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,870
But every time I saw you with that
big idiot...

228
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,870
Who are you calling a big idiot?

229
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,240
Gou Lingfeng!

230
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,630
You can't insult him like that.

231
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,920
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,670
Seeing you two

233
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,910
so close every day,

234
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
I was jealous.

235
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,760
Sometimes I wonder

236
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,500
why couldn't that person be me?

237
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,460
Yingdan...

238
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,300
Lord Deng,

239
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,780
it's already very late.

240
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,220
Go home.

241
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,260
Yingdan...

242
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,260
Heng,

243
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,740
while you were gone,

244
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,300
we were all worried sick.

245
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,060
After the incidents

246
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,620
with Swallow Knight and Crane Knight,

247
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,940
I realized

248
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,180
my time with Master

249
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,580
is a rare blessing.

250
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,260
If I miss it,

251
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,140
I might lose it forever.

252
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,180
Heng,

253
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,660
I'm so glad you've come around.

254
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,540
But I've lost

255
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,780
the trail for the Moon Sword Skill,

256
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,860
and the manual was taken by Grandmaster.

257
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,220
Heng,

258
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,540
I'll stay with you no matter what.

259
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,580
Thank you, Ling'er.

260
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,740
Ling'er,

261
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,540
I, Zhuge Heng

262
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,620
swear this under the moon:

263
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,140
When my vengeance is fulfilled,

264
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,940
I will marry you,

265
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,700
and love you for all my life.

266
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,940
Heng...

267
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,900
But right now, I'm just

268
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,020
a man without a home.

269
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,620
All I can offer you

270
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,740
are these empty promises.

271
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,060
Heng,

272
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,300
I have no one.

273
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,060
It's only thanks to you

274
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,900
I have a home now.

275
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,940
I wouldn't want more.

276
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,980
So,

277
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,300
you're saying yes?

278
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,660
Heng,

279
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,580
look! A fish took the bait!

280
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,900
Heng?

281
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,420
Heng?

282
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,580
My Lady,

283
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,180
how do you know the Moon Sword Skill?

284
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,460
I want to help you take revenge.

285
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,180
Please, teach me.

286
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,820
Mr. Zhuge,

287
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,420
come find me

288
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,140
at midnight every night to practice.

289
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,700
But keep it quiet.

290
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,700
I don't want to be talked about.

291
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,540
Alright, My Lady.

292
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,220
I promise I won't tell anyone.

293
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,060
Then let's begin now.

294
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,860
What are you doing?

295
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,140
That toothy grin scared me!

296
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,260
Yingdan, why'd you

297
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,700
fall asleep out here?

298
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,980
You might catch a cold.

299
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,580
You even brought the blanket out.

300
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,580
Come on.

301
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,620
You scared me so bad last night.

302
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,980
I was worried sick.

303
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,620
It's fine now. Don't worry.

304
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,940
Why are your eyes red?

305
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,380
Are you still not better?

306
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,700
I said I'm fine.

307
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,220
So you really are fine.

308
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,660
Gou Lingfeng,

309
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,740
you're the first person who dared
to touch me.

310
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,740
Hurry up and touch me back!

311
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,060
Or you'll lose out. Go on, quick!

312
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,900
Gou Lingfeng!

313
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,940
You...

314
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,780
You've got the strength to hit me.

315
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,300
Now I'm truly relieved.

316
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,900
I really came at the wrong time.

317
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,580
Please, carry on.

318
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,700
I didn't see anything.

319
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,460
Put down those cups!

320
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,940
I told you,

321
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,700
I'm just worried about Yingdan!

322
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,540
There's nothing between us!

323
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,740
Master, the way you look at Yingdan

324
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,260
tells another story.

325
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,300
You talk too much!

326
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,220
Yingdan, your eyes are really red.

327
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,980
Did Deng Yunfeng insult you last night?

328
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,500
Who?

329
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,340
Deng Yunfeng came last night?

330
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,460
I saw him, drunk, came

331
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,180
looking for Yingdan.

332
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,580
Did he make you mad?

333
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,980
I... I'll go and...

334
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,940
-Enough, you two.
- I'll beat him up!

335
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,020
Inspector Deng was attacked!

336
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,740
Everyone, to the MAA now!

337
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,460
That karma hit fast.

338
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,140
Got it.

339
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,620
You hear? Something big happened!

340
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,460
What?

341
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,980
Inspector Deng was assassinated!

342
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,900
No way.

343
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,620
- It's true!
- Yingdan.

344
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,940
- So many people.
- The night patrol saw it.

345
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,260
He barely escaped death,

346
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,820
but he's completely out of it.

347
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,660
Inspector Deng's life's still uncertain.

348
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,420
Guess the heavens do bring justice.

349
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,900
That news is making people so happy.

350
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,700
Seems like you're the happiest one.

351
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,500
He deserves it for disturbing Yingdan
at midnight.

352
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,980
Besides, he always acted
too high and mighty.

353
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,500
I'm definitely not the only one
who couldn't stand him.

354
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,220
And a court officer like him

355
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,740
meddling in our MAA affairs?

356
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,980
He clearly had other motives.

357
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,980
Exactly.

358
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,780
Don't be too harsh.

359
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,740
Deng Yunfeng did help us before.

360
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,100
And think about it,

361
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,620
with his martial skills,

362
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,340
anyone who could hurt him

363
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,940
must be pretty formidable.

364
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,420
With the Hero Gathering coming up,

365
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,260
many things are happening,

366
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,420
trouble's brewing.

367
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,100
Seems like Huizhou's about to get messy.

368
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,100
Perfect.

369
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,420
You startled me!

370
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,580
This is exactly the chance

371
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,260
for me to strike down evil!

372
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,180
(Righteous and Mighty)

373
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,020
Everyone's here?

374
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,780
We've called this assembly

375
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,340
because, as you may have heard,

376
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,060
something serious happened last night.

377
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,780
Our newly appointed
Inspector Deng Yunfeng

378
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,660
was attacked within

379
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,100
the MAA

380
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,180
and seriously wounded.

381
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,900
Quiet, please.

382
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,900
So today,

383
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,460
we're issuing

384
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,460
a public task.

385
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,380
(Mission Notice)
Everyone can join the investigation.

386
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,820
Inspector Deng stated

387
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,340
that anyone who solves the case,

388
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,500
or provides critical clues,

389
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,700
will be promoted one rank,

390
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,100
and earn double points!

391
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,300
Double points?

392
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,780
This is my chance to level up!

393
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Why are you here?

394
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,660
To laugh at me?

395
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,660
Do I look like I'm laughing?

396
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,300
Yingdan,

397
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,610
you came too.

398
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,460
Are you feeling better?

399
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,460
It's okay.

400
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,740
I'll live.

401
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,660
- You...
- Deng Yunfeng.

402
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,700
Look,

403
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,020
we even brought you something!

404
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,620
- No? Forget it.
- No? Forget it.

405
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,980
Yunfeng,

406
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,500
lie back down.

407
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,340
You're not healed yet.

408
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,180
Yingdan,

409
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,660
thank you.

410
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,340
Yingdan,

411
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,820
why are you being so nice to him?

412
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,220
Deng Yunfeng,

413
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,700
I heard that assassin was pretty good?

414
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,380
He beat you like that

415
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,580
with just five moves?

416
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,180
What's wrong with you?

417
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,540
Maybe that assassin wasn't
all that great.

418
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,740
More likely the one who got beat

419
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,780
was just weak.

420
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,420
Yingdan,

421
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,540
that's not true.

422
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,460
Actually, I was relieving myself.

423
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,820
The guy ambushed me!

424
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,740
I didn't even have my pants up!

425
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,580
Otherwise,

426
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,300
how could he have succeeded?

427
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,340
Yunfeng,

428
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,100
this is a healing balm I made.

429
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,210
- Here.
- Okay.

430
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,500
Thanks, Yingdan.

431
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,780
Inspector Deng,

432
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,580
have you got any more leads?

433
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,140
That assassin was extremely skilled.

434
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
You should be careful too.

435
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,220
He could create countless shadow clones,

436
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,100
just like the Demonic Sect's
Phantom Shadow.

437
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,460
The Demonic Sect's getting out of hand!

438
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,940
But don't worry.

439
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,340
Once I'm recovered,

440
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,460
I'll wipe out every last one of them!

441
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,420
- What's wrong with you?
- Enough.

442
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,780
- Stop staring at me!
- Stop playing the hero.

443
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,900
Walls have ears.

444
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,060
You want another beatdown?

445
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,420
Zhuge Heng.

446
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,820
Inspector Deng's clues are important.

447
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,100
Yingdan, let's go.

448
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,220
Yingdan!

449
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,100
I'm not done asking!

450
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,540
Are you eating or not?

451
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,340
Whatever.

452
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,100
What's with that look?

453
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,220
- It's not the Demonic Sect.
- It's not the Demonic Sect.

454
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,660
It wasn't them?

455
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,860
You two seem to know a lot
about the Demonic Sect.

456
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,260
- Yes.
- No.

457
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,900
Speak.

458
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,020
Yingdan,

459
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,300
that Phantom Shadow
Deng Yunfeng mentioned,

460
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,500
I can do it too.

461
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,380
And it's not what he described.

462
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,740
You know it too?

463
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,020
Based on his description,

464
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,340
it actually sounds more like
our Sword Alliance's

465
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,020
Shadow Swordplay.

466
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,780
- Shadow Swordplay?
- Shadow Swordplay?

467
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,620
Sword Alliance?

468
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,900
Let's go check it out.

469
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,060
Yingdan,

470
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,020
I don't think I'm up for it
the next couple days.

471
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,060
Let's wait a bit.

472
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,620
Zhuge,

473
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,820
you've been out all night
these past few days.

474
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,300
Are you up to no good?

475
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,140
Spit it out.

476
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,740
Tsk.

477
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,420
Kids grow up, huh?

478
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,780
Can't control him anymore.

479
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,140
Where are you going, Yingdan?

480
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,340
Why are you calling me like that?

481
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,860
Deng Yunfeng calls you that way,

482
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,220
so I will too. Yingdan!

483
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,460
- Yingdan.
- Enough!

484
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,780
Whatever.

485
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,980
Yingdan, where are you going?

486
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,900
To bring Deng Yunfeng some food.

487
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,420
He's injured

488
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,700
- and needs the nourishment.
- You can't!

489
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,300
He doesn't deserve it.

490
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,700
- He doesn't, but you do?
- I...

491
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,020
We're all part of the MAA.

492
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,620
We should help each other.

493
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,460
Yingdan,

494
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,980
he's not a good guy.

495
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,180
He's not a good guy?

496
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,220
And you are?

497
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,140
You don't even know him.

498
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,300
Do you know that?

499
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,980
I'm not wasting words with you.

500
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,820
I...

501
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,660
Who is it?

502
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,860
Gou Lingfeng.

503
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,020
Vice Chairman He wanted to see you.

504
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,980
There's an urgent mission.

505
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,740
Another mission?

506
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,940
He specifically said

507
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,100
only you can go.

508
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,580
Just me?

509
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,420
Yes.

510
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,540
Alright.

511
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,180
What's wrong, Vice Chairman He?

512
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,740
I wanted to tell you something.

513
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,460
Don't tell me the case
is already solved?

514
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,260
The Sword Saint is dead.

515
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,340
The Sword Saint is dead?

516
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,340
Zhuge's father?

517
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,860
I just got the notice
from the Sword Alliance.

518
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,900
What a pity.

519
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,980
The once-famous Sword Saint

520
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,020
is gone just like that.

521
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,500
You are the closest to Zhuge.

522
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,780
I'll leave the task of informing him
to you.

523
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,020
Inform him?

524
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,300
He's changed his heart that fast?

525
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,900
Careful, don't choke.

526
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,300
It's been long since I've had
a hot meal.

527
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,300
I didn't expect you to be
such a good cook.

528
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,780
Yingdan,

529
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,380
how's your backlash going?

530
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,940
I've already made the antidote.

531
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,260
Don't worry.

532
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,340
Really?

533
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,540
Really?

534
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,020
Relax.

535
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,300
That's great.

536
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,740
Alright,

537
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,460
it's getting late.

538
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,780
Rest early.

539
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,940
I'll head back.

540
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,020
Yingdan,

541
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,860
can you stay with me

542
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,300
just a little longer?

543
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,260
I still need to help you
find the killer.

544
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,660
I can't let them hurt you again.

545
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,780
Take care.

546
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,380
- Yingdan!
- Xiaobai!

547
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,780
Something big just happened!

548
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,140
What is it? Why are you so panicked?

549
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,420
Zhuge's dad is gone.

550
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,300
- No way.
- It's true.

551
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,620
I saw the obituary myself.

552
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,780
Thought it was a new mission,

553
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,860
turns out it was this.

554
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,780
How are we even supposed to tell Zhuge?

555
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,740
Exactly.

556
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,780
He lost his mom when he was young,

557
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,740
he already had it rough.

558
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,020
Now he's lost his dad too,

559
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,620
it's even worse.

560
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,740
Mr. Zhuge, you did it.

561
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,500
What's wrong, Mr. Zhuge?

562
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,020
My Lady,

563
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,860
I'll never forget your immense kindness.

564
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,020
If you ever need help,

565
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,420
just say the word.

566
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,660
I'll do anything for you.

567
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,100
Mr. Zhuge,

568
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,180
don't say that.

569
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,460
You saved my life once.

570
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,580
I can't believe

571
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,700
this day came so fast.

572
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,340
I can finally take my revenge.

573
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,980
Let me drink with you in celebration.

574
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,500
Congrats on your wish coming true.

575
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,420
I'll fill it up for you.

576
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,580
Here.

577
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,420
To you.

578
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,420
Thank you, My Lady.

579
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,020
Mr. Zhuge,

580
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,820
who exactly

581
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,340
is your enemy?

582
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,580
Well,

583
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,340
I'm sorry I can't tell you that.

584
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,980
Please understand.

585
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,460
Mr. Zhuge,

586
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,860
if you want to cry, then cry.

587
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,580
- Yingdan, you tell him.
- No, you.

588
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,220
I really don't know how.

589
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,380
Just tell the truth.

590
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,500
Zhuge.

591
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,860
Zhuge.

592
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,100
You're up early.

593
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,860
Where have you been this time?

594
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,820
You reek of alcohol.

595
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,500
Yeah, disgusting.

596
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,540
Drinking a bit's fine.

597
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,660
Zhuge, you need to understand

598
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,820
that all of us

599
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,660
eventually have to leave this world.

600
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,690
Right.

601
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,860
Leaving doesn't mean disappearing.

602
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,420
So even if someone's gone,
don't be too sad.

603
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,310
Exactly.

604
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,540
You gotta stay positive.

605
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,660
Books say,

606
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,820
even if someone leaves,

607
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,140
their spirit can stay by your side.

608
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,980
Yeah.

609
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,300
Watching over your life,

610
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,780
caring about everything you do.

611
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,260
Master, are you dying?

612
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,860
It's not me.

613
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,580
Zhuge,

614
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,420
if your dad's gone,

615
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,500
you can always find another.

616
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,020
What about mine? Want him?

617
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,940
You outta your mind?

618
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,860
I'm not Deng Yunfeng,

619
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,980
going around collecting fathers.

620
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,580
What is wrong with you people?

621
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,780
If there's nothing else,
I'm going to bed.

622
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,060
Zhuge!

623
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,940
Zhuge Heng!

624
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,460
If none of you will say it,

625
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,460
then I will!

626
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,740
You really let me down.

627
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,260
Ling'er.

628
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,140
Why didn't you tell him?

629
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,940
What's up with everyone this morning?

630
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,540
Yingdan,

631
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,340
what's going on?

632
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Ling'er

633
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,020
found out too.

634
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,380
No way.

635
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,660
He'll have to face it.

636
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,540
Say it directly.

637
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,380
Fine.

638
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,860
- You do it.
- No, you do it.

639
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,260
- You.
- You tell him.

640
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,180
I...

641
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,140
- What should I say?
- I...

642
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,820
What are you two trying to do?

643
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,020
- Zhuge.
- Zhuge Heng.

644
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,380
Where are you going?

645
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,220
To the Sword Alliance.

646
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,260
Zhuge,

647
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,620
the Shadow Swordplay isn't urgent
right now.

648
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,020
- I...
- It's not just about that.

649
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,780
So you already know?

650
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,060
Pretty much confirmed.

651
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,340
My condolences.

652
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,020
The Sword Saint was a hero.

653
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,580
Even in death, he'll be honored by all.

654
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,300
What did you say?

655
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,060
What did I say?

656
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,420
You said my dad's dead?

657
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,980
Wait... you didn't know?

658
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,820
No.

659
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,180
Then what do you know?

660
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,260
The Shadow Swordplay
is our secret technique,

661
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,460
only the Sword Saints can wield it.

662
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,860
When I was little,

663
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,020
my dad tried to teach it to me.

664
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,300
But I never wanted to learn.

665
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,980
So you think

666
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,900
your dad is the assassin?

667
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,060
Not necessarily.

668
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,100
I haven't been back in a long time.

669
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,660
That's why I have to go back this time

670
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,100
to find out the truth.

671
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,700
You're killing me here!

672
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,460
We were racking our brains
trying to figure out

673
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,980
how to tell you your father died.

674
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,620
- We thought you'd be devastated.
- Yeah!

675
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,740
Why are you not sad at all?

676
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,700
That old man

677
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,540
"dies" like every other week.

678
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,580
So the 32nd time, I knew

679
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,700
he wasn't really dead.

680
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,020
Then on the 33rd,

681
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,940
he said he was dueling an immortal

682
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,460
and got killed.

683
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,860
But I knew

684
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,500
no one could kill him,

685
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,940
not even an immortal.

686
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,540
So

687
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,580
I didn't go back.

688
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,540
So

689
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,340
he faked his death to get you
to come home?

690
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,380
Yep. He's not dead.

691
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,500
He faked it,

692
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,700
and dragged us all

693
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,580
into it?

694
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,860
That's just cruel.

695
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,860
So now I suspect this whole thing

696
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,380
is just another trick to lure me back.

697
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,380
But this time, I have to go.

698
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,060
If he actually hurt Deng Yunfeng

699
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,580
just to make me come home,

700
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,980
that's way too far.

701
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,620
Their father-son relationship is

702
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,180
- so twisted.
- So twisted.

703
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,140
Heng,

704
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,420
I'll go with you.

705
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,500
Ling'er, it's dangerous.

706
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,420
You'll be safest here.

707
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,500
We'll be back soon.

708
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,740
(Sword Alliance)

709
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,860
So this is the legendary Sword Alliance?

710
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,420
Looks more like a market to me.

711
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,420
I heard they turned it into shops
long ago.

712
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,620
It was the Sword Saint himself
who pushed for it

713
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,860
against everyone's wishes.

714
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,100
Why does this place look so familiar?

715
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,900
Slap a new sign on it
and it's basically the GFTA.

716
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,820
You think every shop

717
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,140
belongs to your family.

718
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,500
What is that about?

719
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,420
Stay away from me.

720
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,340
I can't let anyone know I'm back.

721
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,660
I need to stay undercover.

722
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,540
Young master, you've returned.

723
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,540
Zhuge,

724
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,260
you might find it hard

725
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,180
to stay hidden.

726
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,060
That disguise is totally useless.

727
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,140
You two go look around.

728
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,780
I'm gonna find my second uncle
and see what's up.

729
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,420
Let's go explore.

730
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,460
Uncle?

731
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,920
Wait, you...

732
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,220
It's me.

733
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,180
Heng!

734
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,340
You scared me!

735
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,300
You're finally back!

736
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,660
(End of the Episode)

737
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,340
Yingdan, you are here.

738
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,500
Why are you here?

739
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,700
Sir, drop the act.

740
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,580
Was I that obvious these last two days?

741
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,700
A bit.

742
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,300
My hairstyle doesn't look bad, right?

743
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,060
It's cool.

744
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,940
But sir, let me just say one thing.

745
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,780
Don't hit me.

746
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,660
Speak.

747
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,460
