What are you looking for, Master?

63
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,200
I lost my manual.

64
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,600
What manual?

65
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,390
The one my master gave me,

66
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,630
the one with ugly drawings.

67
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,080
I can't find it anywhere

68
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,070
no matter how hard I look.

69
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,360
Don't worry, it's definitely somewhere.

70
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,280
It can't be lost.

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,830
Let me tell you something big.

72
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,160
I heard the Jia Mansion was haunted
last night.

73
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,040
One person died from fright,
another went mad.

74
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,600
- Jia Mansion?
- Yes!

75
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,920
Word is, Scholar Jia died
suddenly yesterday,

76
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,950
then came back from the dead.

77
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,870
Who?

78
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,950
Jia Mansion's Scholar Jia.

79
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,510
A ghost! There really was a ghost!

80
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,870
(Memorial)

81
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,140
(Late Father Jia Xiang's Tablet)
A ghost!

82
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,150
A ghost!

83
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,000
There really was a ghost!

84
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,800
There's no such thing as ghosts.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,030
Nonsense.

86
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,480
Did your late father

87
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,000
have any unfulfilled wishes,

88
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,680
or was anything valuable
stolen from him?

89
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,510
Lord Deng,

90
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,560
nothing appears to be missing.

91
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,750
Floral Knight,

92
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,640
do you know, years ago
in the martial world,

93
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,440
there was a Puppet Knight?

94
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,070
He used strange techniques
to control people.

95
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,390
Living ones would lose their minds,

96
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,270
dead ones would follow his command.

97
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,200
You think he is behind this?

98
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,350
Exactly.

99
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,360
I suspect the Puppet Knight

100
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,760
was controlling Scholar Jia,

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,030
committing crimes.

102
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,720
It's highly possible.

103
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,640
Did you say

104
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,150
Puppet Knight?

105
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,800
You know about him?

106
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,150
That's a family shame.

107
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,880
If I'm not mistaken,

108
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,390
the Puppet Knight is my junior, Zhen.

109
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,800
He

110
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,950
was adopted by my father.

111
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,590
Though he was ugly,

112
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,270
my father treated him like his own.

113
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,760
He was cheerful as a child,

114
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,270
always said

115
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,080
he wanted to grow up to be a great hero.

116
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,710
But then something changed.

117
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,590
His personality suddenly flipped.

118
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,230
Go on.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,270
About twenty years ago,

120
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,830
he colluded with the Demonic Sect,

121
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,310
and was hunted by the authorities
and the MAA.

122
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,680
He came back begging my father
for protection,

123
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,000
said he'd been framed.

124
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,190
But when asked who framed him,

125
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,440
he refused to say.

126
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,750
My father had no choice but to
turn him in

127
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,240
to the MAA.

128
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,550
But on the way,

129
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,760
he escaped.

130
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,150
I heard after that,

131
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,470
he truly became a notorious criminal.

132
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,320
Rumor has it

133
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,150
that he can even control corpses

134
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,470
to do his bidding.

135
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,470
So he held a grudge against Scholar Jia.

136
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,830
Is there anything else?

137
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,510
- Gou Lingfeng!
- Scholar Jia!

138
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,680
Why have you suddenly gone?

139
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,760
Get up! You've ruined the entire scene!

140
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,510
Get up, Gou Lingfeng!

141
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,030
Suspect Gou Lingfeng!

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,800
Scholar Jia!

143
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,830
You are ruining the scene!

144
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,640
You were the only one

145
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,630
besides my father

146
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,640
who ever called me "cute."

147
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,910
From now on,

148
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,880
no one will ever call me that again.

149
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,870
Young Master,

150
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,240
you truly are a man of feeling.

151
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,160
Mr. Jia,

152
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,760
you two know each other?

153
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,640
My father and I

154
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,680
have handled the Draft Bank business
for the Gou family.

155
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,040
Back in the day,

156
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,560
Chairman Gou even gave my father

157
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,910
a Thousand-Year Night Pearl.

158
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,450
My father treasured it dearly.

159
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,310
Scholar Jia!

160
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,120
- My father lied to you.
- Young Master.

161
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,710
He told you

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,270
that night pearl was one of a kind.

163
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,320
Truth is, we've got tons at home.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,920
I need to open the coffin.

165
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,070
If this is the Puppet Knight's doing,

166
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,880
there should be signs on the body.

167
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,000
Open the coffin?

168
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,470
Don't you know to respect the dead?

169
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,390
You're interfering with
my investigation!

170
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,240
Jia Yang,

171
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,710
how can we

172
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,320
disturb Scholar Jia like this?

173
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,910
If just anyone comes along
opening coffins,

174
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,400
it could scatter his spirit,

175
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,870
and that could affect your family's

176
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,320
fortune for generations.

177
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,390
Young Master speaks the truth.

178
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,310
Gou Lingfeng,

179
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,350
stop spewing
your superstitious nonsense.

180
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,760
Mr. Jia,

181
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,160
to solve the case,

182
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,870
we must examine the body.

183
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,790
Please understand.

184
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,560
Jia Yang,

185
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,040
if your family's luck

186
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,440
takes a hit,

187
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,280
then our Draft Bank business

188
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,040
might have to rethink our partnership.

189
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,230
- Gou Lingfeng!
- Think carefully now.

190
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,710
You scoundrel!

191
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,950
Lord Deng,

192
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,550
I think

193
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,800
we should not open the coffin tonight.

194
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,990
This whole
"corpse coming back to life" rumor

195
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,830
has been spread out.

196
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,240
No one dares

197
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,400
stay up to keep vigil.

198
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,710
Lord Deng,

199
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,390
you're so bold

200
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,440
and skilled.

201
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,030
Why don't you

202
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,470
stay the night

203
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,140
and keep vigil in my place?

204
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,080
Maybe you'll witness another miracle

205
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,150
and uncover the truth.

206
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,200
That is indeed a fine idea.

207
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,030
But I have pressing matters tonight.

208
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,230
I'm afraid I can't help.

209
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,110
Look at you. So cowardly.

210
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,280
Some "Lord Deng."

211
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,920
So high and mighty.

212
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,230
Why don't you do it then?

213
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,550
I...

214
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,160
Scholar Jia was kind to me.

215
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,400
Of course,

216
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,510
- I should do this.
- Fine.

217
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,200
But I want Floral Knight with me.

218
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Gou Lingfeng!

219
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,750
Are you looking to die?

220
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,710
Say that again.

221
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,350
The mighty Floral Knight

222
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,390
is scared?

223
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,310
You...

224
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,560
Young Master,

225
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,280
you can't say that.

226
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,990
Floral Knight's name is known
far and wide.

227
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,080
I've never heard of

228
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
- her fearing anything.
- Right.

229
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,520
She'll surely be willing to stay

230
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,990
and keep vigil

231
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,680
with you.

232
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,320
Keep vigil, is it?

233
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,080
Gou Lingfeng,

234
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,920
don't regret this.

235
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,790
Floral Knight,

236
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,640
don't be scared.

237
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,120
I'll be with you.

238
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,320
I messed up.

239
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,080
Why is this place so creepy?

240
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,630
Master Jia, Master Jia.

241
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,440
It's me, your cute little Gou!

242
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,630
Please...

243
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,400
Please don't come out.

244
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,750
Ma Yingdan.

245
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,270
Please come quickly.

246
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,400
I can't take this anymore!

247
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,560
Don't come near me!

248
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,870
Don't come closer!

249
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,000
What are you doing?

250
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,520
Yingdan!

251
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,910
Yingdan, you're finally here!

252
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,830
Yingdan,

253
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,520
it's so scary here.

254
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,590
What is all this?

255
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,830
Listen,

256
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,800
I looked into it.

257
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,470
Master Jia was born

258
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,920
in the hour of tiger

259
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,600
in the year of tiger.

260
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,750
His element is earth.

261
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,160
According to the five-element cycle,

262
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,590
to counter someone of the earth element,

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,230
you use wood-based weapons.

264
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,750
Gou Lingfeng,

265
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,630
you are afraid of ghosts?

266
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,680
Then why did you come to keep vigil?

267
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,680
I just spoke without thinking!

268
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,350
I didn't expect it to be so terrifying

269
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,790
Gou Lingfeng.

270
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,280
What are you doing?

271
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,360
Warding off evil.

272
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,350
Warding off evil?

273
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,390
You're really good to me.

274
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,310
Yingdan!

275
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,950
(Looks like this poison didn't work
on him either.)

276
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,430
Yingdan,

277
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,200
why're you carrying a peachwood sword?

278
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,950
None of your business.

279
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,110
You scared of ghosts too?

280
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,080
Don't tell anyone about tonight.

281
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
If you dare say a word,

282
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,240
you...

283
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,600
I won't! I won't!

284
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,630
I won't say a thing!

285
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,160
But that Deng Yunfeng,

286
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,750
as a constable,

287
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,040
and he's still not here?

288
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,750
That's outrageous.

289
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,830
He's outside.

290
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,470
He's here?

291
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,040
My Lord!

292
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,550
You got issues or what?

293
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,320
You scared the life outta me!

294
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,520
Are you scared?

295
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,520
Who's scared?

296
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,240
Why don't you come with me

297
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,120
to take a quick leak.

298
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,960
No.

299
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,200
I gotta stay here and guard.

300
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,630
Listen up, you two.

301
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,990
If anything happens, whistle the signal.

302
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,070
Yes, sir!

303
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,320
Let's go.

304
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,240
Go, go, go!

305
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,640
Yingdan.

306
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,150
Why you sticking so close to me?

307
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,440
- Back off.
- No, Yingdan.

308
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,270
Can't we just set personal grudge

309
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,750
aside for now?

310
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,870
Let me lean on you for a sec.

311
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,000
Seriously,

312
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,270
it's way too scary.

313
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,200
Stay away from me!

314
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,280
You killed the Vice Chairman!

315
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,150
Our grudge can't be set aside.

316
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,070
Move!

317
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,510
But he killed Examiner Wang!

318
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,510
He got what he deserved!

319
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,430
Lies!

320
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,470
In the entire martial world,

321
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,990
everyone was afraid of me.

322
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,470
Only the Vice Chairman ever helped me.

323
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,270
He was like a brother to me!

324
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,750
I could be your brother too!

325
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,550
No,

326
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,470
seriously,

327
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,630
I didn't kill him!

328
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,160
I was just bragging!

329
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,720
You didn't even

330
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,360
get the full story,

331
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
and you came at me so hard!

332
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,960
You're so pretty,

333
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,750
you really shouldn't be like this.

334
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,760
Then tell me,

335
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,200
who killed the Vice Chairman?

336
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,600
It was divine justice!

337
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,950
A tree fell on him!

338
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,510
It had nothing to do with me!

339
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,520
You gotta believe me!

340
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,520
Don't scare me like this again!

341
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,230
We had some connection, right?

342
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,040
Who had a connection with you?

343
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,720
Yingdan.

344
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,000
You startled me! Move!

345
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,920
No.

346
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,540
Yingdan.

347
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,470
Yingdan.

348
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,920
It's so scary.

349
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,400
Aren't you scared I'll poison you?

350
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,830
No.

351
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,950
Ghosts are way scarier than you.

352
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,990
Everyone says you're hard
to get along with,

353
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,590
but I think you're pretty great.

354
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,350
Go check it out.

355
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Me? I can't!

356
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,870
- I...
- What're you afraid of?

357
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,160
Go on!

358
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,120
No!

359
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,680
I'll take you on a mission after this.

360
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,840
At a moonless night,

361
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,630
no one dares scare me!

362
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,160
Watch this!

363
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,990
What a dummy.

364
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,240
Bro, are you sure about this?

365
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,280
I'm scared.

366
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,150
Don't be. Jia Mansion is haunted lately.

367
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,320
And the rumors are going around.

368
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,200
No one dares come near.

369
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,840
You sure there're no ghosts?

370
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,910
You're such a coward.

371
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,750
You nearly peed yourself

372
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,350
in front of that demonic sect member
earlier.

373
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,710
Follow me.

374
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,590
A ghost!

375
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,760
How did Master Jia become so ugly?

376
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,480
Why does that voice sound so familiar?

377
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,960
I saw a ghost!

378
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,200
Changzai,

379
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,160
look.

380
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,870
Tonight's moonlight is so beautiful.

381
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,510
It is.

382
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,830
Changzai,

383
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,110
are you satisfied
with the recent makeover?

384
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,670
I am.

385
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,080
Changzai,

386
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,910
I have always had a question to ask you.

387
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,480
Do you not like the moon?

388
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,670
Ling'er,

389
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,760
when we first met,

390
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,440
you used your painting

391
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,150
to let me feel the presence of the moon.

392
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,030
Then,

393
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,110
can you read anything from this manual?

394
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,780
(Moonlight Sword)

395
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,720
From this manual,

396
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,830
I feel sorrow and anger.

397
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,720
From the earlier drawings,

398
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,960
the artist was clearly joyful

399
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,560
and full of hope.

400
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,150
But something must have happened,

401
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,350
some unexpected change.

402
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,240
They ended up crossing out
all the illustrations.

403
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,800
Changzai,

404
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,000
are you carrying some sorrow?

405
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,280
I've always wanted to learn that move

406
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,080
where you can see the moon
through the sword's glow.

407
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,830
I've only seen others use it.

408
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,760
But I've never been able
to master it.

409
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,960
This manual

410
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,720
is the only clue.

411
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,250
But I just can't understand it.

412
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,480
Only by mastering that move

413
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,560
can I avenge myself.

414
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,960
Changzai,

415
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,000
since the moonlight
is so beautiful tonight,

416
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,630
let me do a little care for you.

417
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,150
All done, Changzai.

418
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,270
Done?

419
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,080
There are even more little braids.

420
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,350
Ling'er,

421
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,720
how many little braids do I have now?

422
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,190
One, two,

423
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,880
three.

424
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,360
Ling'er?

425
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,710
Ling'er?

426
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,670
Ling'er?

427
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,710
Ling'er!

428
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,710
Ling'er!

429
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,300
(He Changzai, Sky Knight)

430
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,710
Lord Deng,

431
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,520
how come you're so free today?

432
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,590
What brings you to me?

433
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,510
I'm here

434
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,270
about the Puppet Knight.

435
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,590
The MAA should have records on him.

436
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,280
The Puppet Knight...

437
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,720
He's been gone for a long time.

438
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,080
Do you remember anything about him?

439
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,960
He left a deep impression

440
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,720
on many in the MAA.

441
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,400
Because of his ugly appearance

442
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,480
and twisted nature,

443
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,000
he held deep envy and hatred

444
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,590
toward many handsome young men.

445
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,030
So the ones he killed

446
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,310
were mostly good-looking men.

447
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,750
And he could manipulate their corpses

448
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,030
to steal and rob.

449
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,510
Truly, he committed

450
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,400
every evil imaginable.

451
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,240
He's a disgrace to the MAA.

452
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,800
Where is he most likely to show up now?

453
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,590
Last I heard,

454
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,590
he was seen somewhere
in the Western Regions.

455
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,030
Thank you.

456
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,080
How is she, Floral Knight?

457
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,630
Her condition is too deeply rooted.

458
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,870
It's already damaged
her internal organs.

459
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,590
Floral Knight,

460
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,630
you're knowledgeable,

461
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,110
please help her.

462
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,150
She's suffered from tuberculosis
since she was young.

463
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,960
Over the years, I've been
seeking renowned doctors.

464
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,240
We managed to keep her alive.

465
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,000
But now, for some reason,

466
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,240
her condition has suddenly worsened.

467
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,950
Sir,

468
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,390
is there a way to cure her completely?

469
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,560
A few years ago, I did obtain a remedy,

470
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,800
but

471
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,760
the herbs needed are extremely rare.

472
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,160
I...

473
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,270
Ling'er?

474
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,070
- Ling'er!
- Ling'er!

475
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,080
How do you feel?

476
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,150
I'm sorry, Father.

477
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,280
I've made you worry again.

478
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,030
Ling'er,

479
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,240
this is the Floral Knight.

480
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,480
She's skilled in medicine.

481
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,830
She'll surely help you.

482
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,800
It's okay.

483
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,560
Don't trouble the Floral Knight anymore.

484
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,040
I understand.

485
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,150
I'm just not quite ready to say goodbye.

486
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,880
You won't have to.

487
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,110
It'll be alright.

488
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,510
Sir,

489
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,320
this is a tonic for nourishing
the blood.

490
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,040
Hopefully,

491
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,720
it can help her hold on a little longer.

492
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,150
Thank you, Floral Knight.

493
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,230
Ling'er,

494
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,520
let's figure something out together,

495
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,430
alright?

496
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,160
As long as there's even
the slightest hope,

497
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,560
I will never give up.

498

(Memorial)

00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,380
(Late Father Jia Xiang's Tablet)

500
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,680
Oh, Ma Yingdan

501
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,240
happens to be away now.

502
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,830
And that Deng Yunfeng,

503
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,320
he's not even guarding the door anymore.

504
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,430
This is so scary.

505
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,080
A ghost!

506
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,280
Though I've just joined the MAA,

507
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,590
I'm already tired of the martial world.

508
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,880
Now, I only wish to retire from it all.

509
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,800
Miss!

510
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,510
- It's you!
- Y-y-you...

511
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,400
Come keep me company!

512
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,550
It's way too scary here.

513
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,870
Why is it you again?!

514
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,430
Again?

515
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,640
Get your hands off me.

516
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,240
Or I'll call for help!

517
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,550
There's no one here.

518
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,400
- Please stay.
- You... You...

519
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,440
- It's so scary.
- Let go of me!

520
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,360
Let me go!

521
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,400
Stop laughing!

522
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,280
You're creepy right now.

523
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:23,220
(Late Father Jia Xiang's Tablet)

524
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,920
It's not working.

525
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,150
What do we do, Floral Knight?

526
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,510
Slap him.

527
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,750
Zhuge.

528
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,670
Master!

529
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,680
It's so scary!

530
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,910
Easy, easy, easy.

531
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,560
What did you say?

532
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,480
That seductive woman showed up again,

533
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,670
and she turned into Master Jia!

534
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,720
It was terrifying!

535
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,670
Zhuge,

536
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,480
so ghosts really exist

537
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,040
in this world.

538
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,870
She turned into Master Jia?

539
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,400
Master, do you think maybe

540
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,800
she's also wearing a mask?

541
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,430
Also?

542
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,150
Why "also"?

543
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,150
What are you hiding from me?

544
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,200
Zhuge,

545
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,190
it was terrifying.

546
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,230
Sir!

547
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,550
- Sir!
- Sir!

548
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,760
- Sir!
- Help me!

549
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,190
I saw a ghost!

550
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,480
What ghost?

551
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,480
What happened?

552
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,590
Someone impersonated Master Jia
and snuck into the Jia Mansion.

553
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,480
We suspect

554
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,670
she was wearing a mask too.

555
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,800
I run a legitimate business.

556
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,960
I only offer makeover

557

and skin care services.

558
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,910
I don't make those

559
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,270
illegal masks.

560
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,080
Sir,

561
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,590
please just tell me

562
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,320
it was a mask,

563
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,720
not a ghost.

564
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,560
It's too scary.

565
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,960
You can speak freely.

566
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,480
The Floral Knight is one of us.

567
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,830
Yes, yes, one of us. One of us!

568
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,080
Yes.

569
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,240
What kind of people

570
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,830
would usually buy the masks?

571
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,310
These masks are made of special material

572
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,350
and are very expensive.

573
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,590
Only officials and nobles
can afford them.

574
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,000
As you know,

575
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,920
they sometimes need to

576
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,480
disguise themselves.

577
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,160
(Seductive Woman)
Yes. It's her!

578
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,010
Her?

579
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,270
Back when she flirted with me,

580
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,760
I already thought something was off.

581
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,560
So that's what she really looks like.

582
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,580
(Seductive Woman
Scholar Jia)

583
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,560
Can't believe someone else

584
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,190
is doing the same thing as my master.

585
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,910
You ungrateful disciple!

586
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,630
She flirted with you?

587
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,350
No, not exactly.

588
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,040
I saw it with my own eyes!

589
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,960
She even ordered a mask of Master Jia.

590
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,390
So the ghost haunting the Jia Mansion
was her!

591
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,680
That woman is seriously disturbed.

592
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,000
She even tricked me out of

593
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,480
my blood-dragon jade

594
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,390
when I impersonated He Changzai earlier.

595
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,560
She really is...

596
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,000
You impersonated Mr. He?

597
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,790
You impersonated...

598
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,910
No.

599
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:19,880
That's not the point,

600
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,800
Yingdan.

601
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,760
Where is this person now?

602
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,790
We never inquire into

603
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,350
our clients' privacy.

604
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,190
Sir, you're so professional.

605
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,030
I need to open the coffin.

606
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,240
There are no signs the body's
been touched.

607
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,320
Are you sure?

608
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,240
(Jia Xiang's Tablet)
It's not touched?

609
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,190
I just touched it.

610
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,110
Why is my father like this?

611
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,430
My deepest apologies.

612
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,040
You see,

613
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,000
the Floral Knight...

614
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,910
Through skin contact,

615
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,390
I can observe the corpse
in greater detail.

616
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,320
My hands are highly poisonous,

617
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,000
so no need to worry about corpse toxins

618
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,280
or infectious disease.

619
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,590
It's just

620
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,150
a bit unfair for Master Jia.

621
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,280
Impossible.

622
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,110
My father had that night pearl
in his mouth.

623
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,830
It's immune to all poison,

624
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,040
and preserves the body from decay.

625
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
This can't be.

626
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,430
It turns out the thief's target

627
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,150
was that night pearl.

628
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,590
What kind of sicko

629
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,760
would even rob the dead?

630
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,110
This thief is no ordinary criminal.

631
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,110
They wear a mask

632
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,480
and act suspiciously.

633
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,190
A mask?

634
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,590
It's just a night pearl.

635
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,240
My family has tons of them.

636
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,960
What's so great about it?

637
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,560
Yeah,

638
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,800
what is so great about it?

639
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,160
My father did tell me once

640
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,310
that a Thousand-Year Night Pearl

641
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,030
could nourish the lungs and kidneys,

642
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,440
improve blood and qi circulation,

643
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,680
prolong life,

644
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,750
even grant immortality.

645
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,870
But judging by this, he was bragging.

646
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,880
Otherwise,

647
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,080
Master Jia wouldn't have died so early.

648
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,640
Did she steal

649
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,910
your blood-dragon jade?

650
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,030
Yeah.

651
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,000
Just thinking about it makes me angry.

652
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,320
Blood-dragon jade...

653
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,070
Yingdan,

654
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,280
what are you thinking?

655
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,870
The blood-dragon jade helps
with blood and qi circulation.

656
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,430
It has miraculous effects
on any physical injury.

657
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,990
I get it now.

658
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,160
I don't.

659
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,240
With that big block of a brain?

660
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,000
- Of course you don't.
- You...

661
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,430
What Yingdan means is

662
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,480
the night pearl
and the blood-dragon jade

663
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,160
are extremely rare medicinal treasures.

664
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,240
They can cure deadly diseases.

665
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,560
Right?

666
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,670
And one more strange thing,

667
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,110
last night, when she saw me,

668
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,200
she said that

669
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,430
why is it you again?

670
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,410
Again?

671
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,960
The last time she saw me,

672
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
I was wearing the He Changzai mask.

673
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,280
She didn't even know who I was.

674
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,390
Someone is lying.

675
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,920
It has to be him.

676
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,480
I'm going to the MAA
to inform He Changzai.

677
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,880
Deng Yunfeng.

678
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,000
Meet me at the Beauty Salon.

679
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,590
It's him.

680
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,300
(The End of Episode 5)

681
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,190
Ling'er, look at my new sword move!

682
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,080
Are you alright?

683
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
You scared me.

684
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,480
I didn't know you could do this!

685
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,590
I have been too weak to train
in martial arts,

686
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,400
but my father taught me
a little lightness skill

687
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,110
for self-defense in the martial world.

688
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,710
Thanks, Dad.

689
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,990
No,

690
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,480
thank you for saving me, Ling'er.

691
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,920
