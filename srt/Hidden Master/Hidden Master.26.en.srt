1
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,270
Ms. Ma.

2
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:22,910
Senior Anicca.

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,400
They really rescued you.

4
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,760
Why didn't you take the antidote?

5
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,830
Senior, you once said

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,440
there's only

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,960
one pill in the world,

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,320
and my mother

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,790
is also poisoned.

10
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,710
So...

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,710
Your mother has been staying

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,600
in Poison Valley.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,640
Her poison is neutralized by the miasma,

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,350
which has eased her symptoms.

15
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,430
Though your condition
has improved briefly,

16
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,240
it won't last much longer.

17
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,310
Senior,

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,390
I've made up my mind.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,150
Please stop persuading me.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,510
Take this.

21
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,590
What's this?

22
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,430
These are the medicines
the patients took.

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,310
If one day, you can't endure it anymore,

24
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,590
just take this.

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,480
It might relieve your pain.

26
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,560
Thank you, Senior.

27
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,190
Senior.

28
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,280
Please don't tell them about this.

Vice Chairman He,

76

they... they seem dead.

Vice Chairman He,

78
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,630
why don't we use fire

79
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,600
to burn the miasma?

80
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,190
Good idea.

81
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,750
You'll be rewarded.

82
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,630
Thank you, Vice Chairman.

83
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Bring torches!

84
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,870
Listen up,

85
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,390
you must capture them alive.

86
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,630
I want them alive!

87
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,470
Aye!

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,950
They left.

89
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,800
They've gone far.

90
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,750
The Martial Artists Association
is just a bunch of villains.

91
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,510
We're finally free.

92
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,430
He Changzai is truly wicked.

93
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,040
From now on,

94
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,190
there'll no longer be

95
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,160
Sniffer Knight

96
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,190
- or Far-Sight Knight.
- Or Far-Sight Knight.

97
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,670
Come on.

98
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,510
Mom.

99
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,350
Yingdan.

100
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,200
What happened to her?

101
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,440
Yingdan,

102
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,510
Valley Master's recoil

103
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,950
has never been this severe before.

104
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,430
Perhaps recent worries

105
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,430
have worn

106
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,040
her out.

107
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,080
Yingdan.

108
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,430
Your love for your mother

109
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,830
is so moving.

110
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,510
But Yingdan,

111
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,240
it must be hard for you.

112
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,870
Yingdan,

113
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,830
was that the antidote

114
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,270
Anicca Knight gave you?

115
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,360
Didn't you take it?

116
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,300
Yingdan,

117
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,300
you gave it to Aunt Lan.

118
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,940
What about you?

119
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,300
What about you?

120
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,580
Will Aunt Lan

121
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,460
be alright?

122
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,180
From now on, she'll be fine.

123
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,820
My Lady,

124
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,500
are you saying

125
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,140
Valley Master will no longer
suffer from the recoil?

126
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,460
Not just that,

127
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,540
you can all touch her.

128
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,020
My Lady,

129
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,660
Valley Master will scold you

130
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,940
when she wakes up.

131
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,980
Just let her scold me,

132
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,060
as long as she can be alive.

133
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,820
Yingdan, let's go.

134
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,740
Gou Lingfeng, what are you doing?

135
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,140
Let's ask Anicca Knight

136
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,900
to make another antidote for you.

137
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,580
No need.

138
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,660
He can't do it.

139
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,500
You haven't tried.

140
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,180
How do you know he can't?

141
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,340
Because it wasn't Anicca Knight
who made the antidote.

142
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,980
He didn't make it?

143
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,540
Then who made it?

144
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,340
Was it Liu Guang?

145
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Liu Guang...

146
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,620
Even if it wasn't Anicca Knight,

147
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,060
he'll definitely find a way

148
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,420
because he's studied it for years.

149
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,700
No other way.

150
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,980
The key ingredient is gone.

151
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,180
What key ingredient?

152
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,580
I'll definitely get it for you,

153
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,860
whatever it takes.

154
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,220
Yingdan, tell me,

155
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,300
what is the ingredient?

156
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,060
What is it?

157
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,900
It's his blood.

158
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,540
- Liu Guang's blood?
- Liu Guang's blood?

159
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,140
What happened to Liu Guang?

160
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,100
- Mom!
- Aunt Lan!

161
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,300
What happened to Liu Guang?

162
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,660
Mom.

163
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,100
What happened to Liu Guang?

164
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,140
How do you know Liu Guang?

165
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,860
Aunt Lan.

166
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,300
Yingdan...

167
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,020
Is she really...

168
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,180
Yes.

169
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,780
Yingdan's father

170
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,940
is Liu Guang,
the leader of the divine sect.

171
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,100
Back then,

172
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,460
I left home to wander the martial world.

173
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,980
Not long after, I met Liu Guang.

174
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,660
We traveled the martial world together

175
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,940
and helped others.

176
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,220
It was a wonderful time.

177
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,620
However,

178
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,020
gradually, he didn't want to

179
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,180
be a lone hero.

180
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,540
He began to have greater ambitions.

181
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,900
So, he joined
the Great Evolution Divine Sect.

182
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,940
Later on,

183
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,140
to break through
the limits of his martial arts,

184
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,620
he decided to combine

185
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,980
poison with his martial arts.

186
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,140
I tested many kinds

187
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,660
of poison just to help him

188
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,020
and eventually turned myself

189
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,940
into a poison body.

190
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,220
But he still wasn't satisfied.

191
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,900
He devoted himself

192
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,980
completely into the divine sect's cause.

193
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,060
I can't believe he abandoned Yingdan

194
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,740
and you for the demonic sect.

195
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,500
He didn't abandon us.

196
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,380
It was me.

197
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,460
I couldn't put up with
his madness anymore,

198
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,340
so I chose to leave.

199
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,780
When Liu Guang was hunted
by the entire martial world,

200
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,180
he didn't know I was pregnant.

201
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,340
He had been killed by the association

202
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,180
before he could even
see Yingdan in person.

203
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,540
I brought Yingdan to Poison Valley

204
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,740
and stayed here

205
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,260
to avoid their hunting.

206
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,420
It seems

207
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,820
Liu Guang was not
completely an evildoer.

208
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,020
Of course not.

209
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,100
He was a good man.

210
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,940
Liu Guang left an antidote for you,

211
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,140
and it cured your poison.

212
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,140
That's why you said he was a good man.

213
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,620
What do you mean?

214
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,740
Earlier...

215
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,060
Deng Yunfeng!

216
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,620
Yingdan gave you the only antidote

217
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,540
Liu Guang left.

218
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,700
Deng Yunfeng!

219
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,340
Antidote?

220
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,540
What antidote?

221
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,860
What antidote?

222
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,140
Back then,

223
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,100
before the Black Summit was sieged,

224
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,100
Liu Guang made an antidote for you.

225
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,740
But

226
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,180
there was only one.

227
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,620
Yingdan!

228
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,020
Aunt Lan!

229
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,780
She just couldn't bear

230
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,460
to watch you suffer from the recoil,

231
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,820
so she gave you the only antidote.

232
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,380
You stupid girl.

233
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,660
Don't you know

234
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,820
the state of your body?

235
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,740
Do you want to die?

236
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,460
This pill...

237
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,180
was meant for you.

238
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
But you're his daughter.

239
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,660
He never knew I existed,

240
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,140
so I don't see him as my father.

241
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,740
Yingdan!

242
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,580
You're his only daughter!

243
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,940
Aunt Lan,

244
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,300
you shouldn't have done that.

245
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,060
Master.

246
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,020
Get lost

247
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,580
right now.

248
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,820
Stop following me!

249
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,020
Otherwise, I'll keep
testing poison on you.

250
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,060
Testing poison? That's great.

251
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,420
What poison for today?

252
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,260
You...

253
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,420
Go away!

254
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,740
Hey...

255
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,540
Yingdan.

256
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,980
Yingdan?

257
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,700
Yingdan?

258
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,140
My Lady, My Lady!

259
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,860
I'm not seeing anyone today!

260
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,210
My Lady, something's wrong!

261
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,820
A group of people from the association

262
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,700
are breaking in.

263
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,300
What?

264
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,740
A bunch of martial artists

265
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,380
are causing a scene outside.

266
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,820
What kind of conflict

267
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,340
have you gotten yourselves into?

268
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,500
We...

269
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,420
We don't know either.

270
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,900
I think

271
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,060
Chairman Wu Guangming thought

272
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,100
we turned to Eunuch Deng,

273
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,460
so he sent them here.

274
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,180
It makes sense.

275
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,540
After all, Deng Yunfeng

276
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,820
often visits my master.

277
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,020
No.

278
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,380
I don't think

279
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,380
He Changzai is after us.

280
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,020
Otherwise, he would've
taken action on the way.

281
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,100
He wouldn't have followed us
all the way to Poison Valley.

282
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,500
Therefore,

283
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,220
I think his real target

284
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,780
must be Yingdan.

285
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,540
(Could it be)

286
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,620
(they've discovered her identity?)

287
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,820
I think the miasma can keep us safe.

288
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,700
We need to think of a plan.

289
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,740
It's so strange.

290
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,100
We clearly

291
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,940
got rid of them earlier.

292
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,790
Yes.

293
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,460
How did they find this place?

294
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,820
Why are you looking at me?

295
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,380
Deng Yunfeng,

296
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,220
it was you, right?

297
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,420
Do you have proof?

298
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,260
Then how could you slander me?

299
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,660
Don't yell at me!

300
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,120
Do you think I'd harm Yingdan?

301
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,900
Besides, why would I capture you?

302
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,380
You're so stupid.

303
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,940
No wonder you couldn't be great heroes.

304
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,390
- Say it again!
- Heng!

305
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,260
- Zhuge!
- Enough!

306
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,130
Heng!

307
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,900
Are you both insane?

308
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,380
Yunfeng wouldn't do that.

309
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,500
Actually,

310
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,140
I agree

311
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,620
with you.

312
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,060
Valley Master, something's wrong!

313
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,900
They set fire

314
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,620
to the miasma forest!

315
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,260
And they've broken in!

316
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,220
Gou Lingfeng,

317
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,500
come out and surrender!

318
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,060
Gou Lingfeng, come out and surrender!

319
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,940
So noisy.

320
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,180
Ma Yingdan, come out and surrender!

321
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,100
Ma Yingdan,

322
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,700
come out and surrender!

323
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,900
Zhu Gou Team,

324
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,260
as you heard,

325
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,500
if you don't surrender now,

326
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,900
we'll set fire to this place

327
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,180
and burn you all!

328
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,420
No matter how powerful you are,

329
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,500
you won't survive!

330
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,420
We've had enough of Zhu Gou Team.

331
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,540
- Mom.
- Get him!

332
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,620
- Get him, get him!
- Get him, get him!

333
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,460
Gou Lingfeng,

334
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,780
leave it to me.

335
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,500
So pretentious.

336
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,740
We can also get out.

337
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,220
So many people.

338
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,260
I'm the chief constable
of the Prison Suppression Division

339
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,020
as well as the inspector
of Martial Artists Association.

340
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,300
The truth is still unclear.

341
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,100
Further investigation is needed.

342
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,780
Please

343
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,740
stop and leave.

344
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,540
We won't leave.

345
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,300
Does he really think
his position is so powerful?

346
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,660
Exactly.

347
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,540
Wake up.

348
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,020
Why should we listen to you?

349
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,860
My direct superior is Monkey Knight.

350
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,140
I only listen to him.

351
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,460
And I only listen to Speed Knight.

352
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,580
Shut up!

353
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,940
My godfather is Eunuch Deng,

354
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,220
the chief steward of the court.

355
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,460
What godfather?

356
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,300
Get him!

357
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,460
Mom!

358
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,260
- My Lady!
- Yingdan!

359
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,100
Yingdan!

360
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,620
Yingdan!

361
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,020
Yingdan! Yingdan!

362
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,500
- Yingdan!
- Yingdan!

363
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,460
Yingdan!

364
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,940
- Yingdan!
- Come on!

365
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,060
Yingdan!

366
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,540
- Yingdan!
- Zhuge!

367
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,380
Let's go!

368
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,700
Come on in.

369
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,660
Hurry!

370
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,580
Everyone, come in.

371
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,540
Put Yingdan on the bed.

372
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,380
Okay.

373
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,100
Come on.

374
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,140
Yingdan...

375
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,540
Aunt Lan.

376
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,940
Isn't this the forbidden area
of Poison Valley?

377
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,300
Why is it a bedroom?

378
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,060
Yingdan's father left this to me.

379
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,540
We call it the forbidden area,

380
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,580
but it's actually
where I reminisce about the past

381
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,940
when I'm down.

382
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,020
The man in this portrait...

383
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,900
Is he Liu Guang?

384
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,580
Yes.

385
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,100
When Yingdan was little,

386
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,420
she broke in once by accident,

387
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,180
and I punished her to kneel all day.

388
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,900
She must've known this long ago.

389
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,900
Lingfeng,

390
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,300
don't blame her.

391
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,380
Yingdan couldn't choose her family.

392
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,220
Aunt Lan,

393
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,340
you know everything?

394
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,700
Yingdan told me

395
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,420
what happened outside
as soon as she returned.

396
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,900
She doesn't want to be with you

397
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,940
because she's worried

398
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,700
she might ruin your future.

399
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,780
Actually, Yingdan cares about you a lot.

400
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,660
Aunt Lan, I only care about her.

401
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,220
How's the injury?

402
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,940
I've bandaged her wound

403
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,660
and fed her the healing medicine.

404
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,020
But she lost a lot of blood.

405
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,140
I don't know

406
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,660
if she can wake up.

407
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,780
Yingdan is blessed.

408
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,980
She survived every time

409
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,340
my master screwed her over.

410
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,820
I'm sure she'll be fine.

411
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,860
Stupid girl,

412
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,060
you are still so young.

413
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,100
I'm already old,

414
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,820
and there was only one pill.

415
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,420
Why would you give it to me?

416
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,640
Yingdan!

417
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,500
- Yingdan!
- Yingdan!

418
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,180
Yingdan!

419
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,900
Yingdan!

420
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,540
- Yingdan!
- Yingdan

421
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,140
must have lost too much blood.

422
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,860
What should we do now?

423
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,620
Her severe injury

424
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,860
might have triggered

425
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,460
the recoil.

426
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,060
Master!

427
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,940
Aunt Lan, she's lost too much blood.

428
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,580
Will my blood help her?

429
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,140
Silly boy,

430
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
this won't

431
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,820
work.

432
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,820
She won't get any better.

433
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,060
Look!

434
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,580
She seems much better!

435
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,580
Yingdan!

436
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,980
Yingdan!

437
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,620
Why didn't I think of this?

438
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,540
My master is immune to Yingdan's poison,

439
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,460
so

440
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,140
his blood must be

441
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,020
the best remedy for the recoil.

442
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,580
Deng Yunfeng, what are you doing?

443
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,740
Let her drink your blood.

444
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,940
Don't hurt him.

445
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,460
Yingdan, you're awake!

446
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,060
Don't hurt him.

447
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,580
Yingdan, Yingdan!

448
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
You're awake!

449
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,660
You idiot.

450
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,340
I'm much better.

451
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,020
As long as you can get better,

452
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,660
I can do anything for you.

453
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,460
It doesn't matter
if there's no antidote.

454
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,660
I'll always be by your side.

455
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,340
I'll always be here,

456
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,420
- as long as you're fine.
- Don't talk nonsense.

457
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,060
Stop saying that.

458
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,340
Don't worry.

459
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,660
It's fine.

460
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,300
We're gonna be alright.

461
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,980
We're gonna be alright.

462
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,460
Okay?

463
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,700
Now we have no choice
but to leave the mountain.

464
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,780
What's so special about

465
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,420
the Martial Artists Association?

466
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,500
Why are you so obsessed with it?

467
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,420
Anyway,

468
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,260
I no longer want to be

469
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,220
a great hero.

470
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,700
The association is rotten to its core.

471
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,340
It shouldn't exist in this world.

472
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,900
As you can see,

473
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,180
those so-called heroes

474
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,900
has been bullying the people

475
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,340
abusing power, and taking bribes.

476
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,140
They're not worthy of the title of hero.

477
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,780
As for me,

478
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,940
maybe I'm in a high position,

479
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,340
but in the vast city of Huizhou,

480
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,460
I can only give orders to

481
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,260
a few constables.

482
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,340
What can I do for the people?

483
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,380
Gou Lingfeng.

484
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,460
I believe you and I

485
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,340
can change the association

486
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,460
and even change the martial world.

487
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,700
I want us to build

488
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,220
a brand new martial world.

489
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,860
A brand new martial world?

490
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,980
In this world,

491
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,940
we only need to be honest with each other

492
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,420
and uphold justice.

493
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,700
We don't need to get involved
in the mess of the court.

494
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,660
Not necessarily true.

495
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,780
The Imperial Court

496
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,220
holds absolute authority.

497
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,380
Only by working closely with the court

498
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,060
can we unleash
the potential of the association.

499
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,300
The organization is in chaos

500
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,220
because the leader is wicked.

501
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,100
That's why I came to Huizhou.

502
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,420
Gou Lingfeng, I want to work with you.

503
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,980
I'll handle

504
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,620
the connection between
the court and the association,

505
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,500
and you will earn the hero token
in the Hero Gathering.

506
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,180
I want to...

507
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,060
change the world.

508
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,300
Change the world?

509
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,340
Deng Yunfeng,

510
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,700
I don't care what you want.

511
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,900
Just don't get me involved.

512
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,660
Gou Lingfeng,

513
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,380
tell me, what are you interested in?

514
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,820
People like you

515
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,740
only think about power and schemes.

516
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,060
You'll never understand.

517
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,060
I grew up wandering the streets.

518
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,820
I begged for food to survive.

519
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,020
I even fought with stray dogs for food.

520
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,140
Until I met her.

521
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,900
Back then,

522
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,100
she was just a thin, little girl.

523
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,860
Yet she fearlessly stood

524
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,300
in front of me to protect me.

525
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,140
I have to make myself stronger!

526
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,060
Because only then

527
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,900
can I protect the woman I love!

528
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,380
So, you've loved her

529
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,620
since childhood, huh?

530
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,820
Gou Lingfeng,

531
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,220
if you stay here and be a coward,

532
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,740
how can you protect her?

533
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,340
No one can change

534
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,340
Yingdan's mind.

535
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,540
If Yingdan likes someone,

536
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,660
I hope he can

537
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,140
be worthy of her love.

538
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,100
Deng Yunfeng,

539
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,740
what are you trying to say?

540
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,180
I love Yingdan!

541
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,180
So, I want her to be happier than me.

542
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,900
If one day,

543
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,220
I can no longer

544
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,180
stay by her side and protect her,

545
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,940
I hope you...

546
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,140
can make her happy.

547
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,380
Of course I will.

548
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,340
Actually, sometimes

549
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,460
I find you quite cool.

550
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,860
Gou Lingfeng.

551
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,260
I need to help me get the hero token

552
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,020
and seize power.

553
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,660
Deng Yunfeng.

554
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,700
This is ridiculous.

555
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,420
I just started to like you,

556
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,060
and you're pissing me off again.

557
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,180
If I do all the work for you,

558
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,740
what will you do?

559
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,660
Don't forget about

560
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,980
the Prison Suppression Division.

561
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,660
Is that a yes?

562
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,420
What's going on?

563
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,500
Calm down, calm down!

564
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,980
Calm down!

565
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,860
Do you want to rebel?

566
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,980
Calm down!

567
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,380
I must capture Ma Yingdan!

568
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,300
Go away!

569
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,180
You've lost too much blood.

570
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,340
You can't use martial arts.

571
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,460
What do you really want?

572
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,300
This is my home!

573
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,500
For demonic remnants,

574
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,820
living is a sin!

575
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,700
That's right.

576
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,780
All demonic remnants

577
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,100
must be eliminated!

578
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,860
We've never

579
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,620
harmed others,

580
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,100
yet you keep calling us

581
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,580
demonic remnants.

582
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,820
You even want to burn my only home!

583
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,660
You're the real criminals!

584
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,900
Don't listen to her nonsense.

585
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,580
Capture them all

586
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,820
for the reward!

587
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,980
Stop!

588
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,780
You ignorant villains,

589
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,300
all you care about
is completing tasks for rewards.

590
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,820
Do you even remember
that you're supposed to be heroes?

591
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,900
Ma Yingdan,

592
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,580
a Tiger-rank hero,

593
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,900
offered free medical treatment
in Huizhou

594
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,940
and saved countless people
in the association.

595
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,940
Is there anyone

596
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,740
who's never

597
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,740
received her treatment?

598
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,660
Now, instead of being grateful,

599
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,580
you broke into her home

600
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,780
and burned this place

601
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,780
just to capture her for rewards.

602
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,740
Do you deserve

603
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,420
to be heroes?

604
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,820
None of you

605
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,260
understand her kindness.

606
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,700
But I do.

607
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,500
You're so shameless.

608
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,020
You're not only scolding us

609
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,940
but showing your affection here.

610
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,980
I haven't got married!

611
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,900
This is outrageous!

612
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,740
Kill him!

613
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,220
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

614
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,180
Catch Ma Yingdan!

615
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,020
Yingdan!

616
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,140
I'll handle it!

617
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,540
I want them alive!

618
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,860
Let's go!

619
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,700
Go!

620
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,580
Go! Catch them alive!

621
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,660
(Guang...)

622
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,500
Mom!

623
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,660
Mom!

624
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,540
It's dangerous! Hide now!

625
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,420
Mom!

626
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,260
Aunt Lan!

627
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,260
Mom!

628
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,180
Mom!

629
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,740
Mom!

630
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,700
Lan'er!

631
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,060
Sorry, I'm late!

632
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,220
Guang!

633
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,380
It's Liu Guang.

634
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,580
Guang!

635
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,020
Back then,

636
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,460
when I heard about Lan'er's death,

637
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,180
I wished I could go with her.

638
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,060
It was the old sect leader

639
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,740
that stopped me.

640
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,140
He told me

641
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,740
there were still many brothers

642
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,020
who needed my protection,

643
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,220
and I shouldn't be so selfish.

644
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,740
Guang,

645
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,020
it's good you didn't do it.

646
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,140
Otherwise, we'd never

647
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,460
see each other again.

648
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,660
Yes.

649
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,540
Thank goodness.

650
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,420
Demonic remnants.

651
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,780
Demonic remnants?

652
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,820
Our divine sect

653
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,980
refused to bow down

654
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,940
to the Martial Artists Association,

655
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,940
so they labeled us as a demonic sect

656
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,020
and killed many of us.

657
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,340
So back then,

658
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,820
the demonic sect's massacre...

659
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,100
Not demonic sect!

660
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,340
It's the divine sect!

661
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,020
So back then,

662
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,660
you were massacred

663
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,620
because you refused to obey

664
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,860
the Martial Artists Association?

665
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,380
My master wasn't lying.

666
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,580
I knew it.

667
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,740
This world

668
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,380
isn't just black or white.

669
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,340
Those people in the association

670
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,900
are nothing but a bunch of villains.

671
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,820
What happened next?

672
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,100
Why haven't you shown up?

673
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,660
Later,

674
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,340
to repay the old farmer

675
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,860
for saving my life,

676
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,940
I stayed in

677
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,540
that mountain village

678
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,620
to care for him until he passed away.

679
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,020
However,

680
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,100
I couldn't forget

681
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,860
what happened.

682
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,260
I couldn't let it go,

683
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,740
and I couldn't sleep.

684
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,340
Then I heard about Yingdan,

685
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,740
and I found out

686
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,060
you were still alive

687
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,060
and had a daughter for me,

688
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,580
so I started asking around.

689
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,180
I followed those heroes

690
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,780
and finally got here.

691
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,980
Guang.

692
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,860
I'm sorry.

693
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,300
I thought

694
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,140
you only cared about

695
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,100
the divine sect,

696
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,900
so I faked my death,

697
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,500
which caused us

698
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,180
to be apart for so long.

699
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,540
I'm sorry.

700
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,540
Don't be.

701
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,820
We're together now.

702
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,620
It's not too late.

703
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,420
However, you must've

704
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,540
suffered a lot.

705
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,700
And...

706
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,900
And Yingdan.

707
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,820
Yingdan...

708
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,380
Yingdan,

709
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,220
this is your father.

710
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,820
Call him Dad.

711
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,020
- Yingdan!
- Yingdan!

712
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,180
It's my fault.

713
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,700
I shouldn't have left you

714
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,980
and your mother.

715
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,180
I couldn't watch you grow up.

716
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,500
My biggest wish now

717
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,900
is to hear you

718
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,860
call me Dad.

719
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,700
Why should I?

720
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,900
(The End of Episode 26)

721
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,260
Guang.

722
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,580
I'm sorry.

723
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,700
I'm so sorry.

724
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,980
I shouldn't have let you

725
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,700
die in despair.

726
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,420
You have no idea

727
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,540
that we have

728
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,100
such an adorable daughter.

729
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,540
She's been away from home for years.

730
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,900
Without Poison Valley's protection.

731
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,500
I don't even know

732
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,580
how much longer
she can endure out there.

733
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,700
I'm heartbroken!

734
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,580
I'm so worried about Yingdan!

735
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,220
Guang,

736
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,220
if you can hear my pray

737
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,620
in heaven,

738
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,660
please protect our daughter

739
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,780
and let her come back safely.

740
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,140
Valley Master!

741
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,060
Valley Master!

742
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,300
Didn't I tell you

743
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,820
not to come up the mountain?

744
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,020
Valley Master,

745
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,380
Ms. Yingdan has returned.

746
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,900
This little brat is finally back!

747
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,940
I must teach her a lesson!
