(Jia Mansion)

2
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,270
Straighten your back.

3
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,430
Young Master.

4
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,590
Take a look at them.
What do you say?

5
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,560
- Why do they all look so fierce?
- Heng, they look terrifying.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,950
Old Jia, our family wasn't like this before.

7
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,280
Young Master, you might not know this.

8
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,960
The martial world is unpredictable now.

9
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,070
Your father...

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,790
President Gou hired a group
of fighters for me.

11
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,790
They are skilled.

12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,360
The key is,

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,190
with them around,

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,360
nobody dares to rob us.

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,480
Exactly.

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,200
How about this?

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,870
Can you try a softer expression?

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,070
Yes.

19
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,990
Show me one.

20
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,830
Alright, alright.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,480
Come on.

22
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,830
Look at me.

23
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,870
You were like...

24
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,120
This is how you look right now.

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,760
A gentle expression.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,880
Have you learned it?

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,790
Yes, we have.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,660
Good.

29
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,600
Show me one. Come on.

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,480
See?

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,000
Isn't that much better?

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,790
Good. Very good.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,480
Young Master, you're a good teacher.

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,720
Now listen carefully.

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,510
Follow the Young Master's teachings.

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,680
Practice it more.

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,590

38
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,510

85
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,700
(Martial Artists Association)

86
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,670
Sir, what are your orders?

87
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,270
I've received word.

88
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,800
Tomorrow at Wulipo,

89
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,080
the demonic sect's succession ceremony
will occur.

90
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,440
What?

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,440
How dare they be so brazen!

92
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,600
We've eliminated
some of their key figures.

93
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,840
This time,

94
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,880
we must remove them all at once.

95
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,400
Deng Yunfeng,

96
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,600
do you remember

97
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,590
the rules of MAA?

98
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,160
During chivalrous justice,

99
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,480
if there are demonic members,

100
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,470
execute them on the spot.

101
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,880
You've just taken office.

102
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,760
If you want to win respect,

103
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,150
you need to gain experience.

104
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,470
So I'm giving this opportunity

105
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,640
to you.

106
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,390
Do you understand my intention?

107
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,030
Yes, I will serve loyally.

108
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,800
I won't let your efforts go to waste.

109
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,720
Good.

110
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,760
Take your forces now,

111
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,590
and head to Wulipo tomorrow.

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,120
Eliminate the members
of the demonic sect.

113
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,030
Restore peace in the martial world.

114
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,350
Understood.

115
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,520
Grandfather,

116
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,760
Grandfather,

117
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,590
Grandfather,

118
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,800
are you all right?

119
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,950
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Here.

120
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,120
- Mr. Gui.
- Mr. Gui.

121
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,750
Alright, alright.

122
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,160
How cheerful you all are!

123
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,510
Grandfather, we all truly missed you.

124
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,510
I even invited my master over.

125
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,030
He misses you too.

126
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,880
He's just not good at expressing it.

127
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,390
You really know
how to handle things.

128
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,760
Are you really here
for the succession ceremony?

129
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,030
Good.

130
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,480
Today, I must treat all of you

131
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,400
to a meal.

132
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,120
Come on, let's have a drink.

133
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,150
Where's my father?

134
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,510
He is at the Juhong Pavilion.

135
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,160
Don't worry.

136
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,390
Your father and I are old friends.

137
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,510
Don't worry about...

138
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,680
You tricked me again!

139
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,630
And why do you insist on making me

140
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,240
become the sect leader?

141
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,720
After you attend the succession ceremony,

142
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,800
and become the leader,

143
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
I'll tell you everything.

144
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,250
You're not tricking me again, right?

145
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,470
Take a good look for yourself.

146
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,120
There are the survivors
of the purge years ago,

147
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,590
and their descendants.

148
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,240
The so-called 'demonic sect' they speak of

149
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,710
is nothing more than
a group of ordinary people,

150
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,880
who simply refuse to bow to them,

151
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,080
who just want a happy life
and peace in the world.

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,200
But that only applies to some of them.

153
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,560
I've seen it with my own eyes

154
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,240
how the demonic sect pillaged,

155
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,640
committing countless atrocities.

156
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,080
Seeing it doesn't mean it's the truth.

157
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,080
Have you ever thought about

158
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,920
it could be lies

159
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,240
fabricated by the MAA to deceive the world.

160
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,510
Enough.

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,920
Mr. Gui,

162
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,750
but they killed an innocent child.

163
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,640
Exactly, and they also killed my wet nurse.

164
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,320
- Yes.
- And this scar on my face.

165
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,950
I witnessed it all myself.

166
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,520
I admit

167
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,910
there are bad people in the divine sect.

168
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,200
But is the MAA spotless?

169
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,910
After all, you've been through,

170
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,630
do you still not understand?

171
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,040
We can't punish everyone

172
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,390
because of the sins of a few.

173
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,720
The brothers and sisters of Wulipo

174
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,390
simply wish to follow their hearts,

175
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,600
seeking a sanctuary in this chaotic world

176
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,950
to live a peaceful life.

177
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,350
Lingfeng,

178
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,720
I only hope you can help them

179
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,350
fulfill this simple wish.

180
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,750
Master, I...

181
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,870
Alright, alright, Master.

182
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,790
Grandfather.

183
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,270
It's rare for us to gather.

184
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,600
Can't we just enjoy a meal together?

185
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,590
Yes, yes.

186
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,680
Indeed.

187
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,750
It's a rare reunion.

188
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,270
Let's raise a toast to Mr. Gui.

189
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,240
Come on, Grandfather.

190
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,830
Cheers.

191
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,750
Well,

192
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,030
there's no need to say more.

193
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,240
Once you assume the role of sect leader,

194
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,150
you'll gradually understand.

195
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,240
Anyway,

196
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,510
your presence here today

197
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,590
already brings me great joy.

198
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,800
Come on, come on.

199
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,040
Gui,

200
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,590
after I finish the succession ceremony,

201
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,950
don't bring up any more

202
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,200
unreasonable demands.

203
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,640
I absolutely won't.

204
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,760
I only have this one wish.

205
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,720
- Come on, cheers.
- Cheers.

206
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,640
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

207
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,000
Come on, eat more.

208
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,920
Alright.

209
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,510
The bright sky has perished.

210
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,240
The long night is coming.

211
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,270
I shall follow my path

212
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,320
to embrace the new beginning.

213
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,920
Leader Gui,

214
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,400
why hasn't the new leader arrived yet?

215
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,120
Yes, it's already so late.

216
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,000
When will he come?

217
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,040
Still not here?

218
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,080
Something's wrong, something's wrong!

219
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,320
The new leader's place is empty.

220
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,470
Everyone has disappeared.

221
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,670
What?

222
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,720
They're gone!

223
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,570
Where did they go?

224
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,430
Where is everyone?

225
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,830
- Are they coming?
- Where?

226
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,150
Eliminate the demonic sect

227
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,510
without mercy!

228
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,430
Understood!

229
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,670
Run! Quickly!

230
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,720
Leader Gui!

231
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,000
As long as you survive,

232
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,630
the divine sect still has hope.

233
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,630
- Go now!
- Leader Gui!

234
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,550
Hurry! Hurry!

235
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,470
Run!

236
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,670
Go quickly!

237
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,440
Move!

238
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,360
Quick, follow me!

239
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,390
If that old man finds out we all ran,

240
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,000
he'll be furious!

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,350
I should've stayed and become sect leader.

242
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,000
They say Wulipo is the demonic sect's base.

243
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,480
But they are just common people.

244
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,440
Indeed.

245
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,360
That's right.

246
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,440
Living a peaceful life
is already hard for them.

247
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,800
Let alone having the energy to harm others.

248
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,590
I think

249
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,350
the one who killed Zhao

250
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,870
might be someone else.

251
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,150
Do you think someone might disguise

252
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,000
as a demonic member to kill Zhao?

253
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,040
- Yes.
- Nonsense.

254
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,710
It's quite possible.

255
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,720
Yunfeng said that the robbery

256
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,470
might not have been done
by the demonic sect.

257
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,950
If it is or isn't,

258
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,800
we'll know once we interrogate them.

259
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,380
(Datong Bank)

260
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,550
Hurry up! Quick!

261
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,470
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

262
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,920
Move faster!

263
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,160
Quickly, quickly!

264
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,870
Come on, faster!

265
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,240
Be careful!

266
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,270
You're so careless!

267
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,870
Why are you working so recklessly?

268
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,040
Quickly! Pick it up, pick it up!

269
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,870
Faster, faster!

270
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,470
Hurry, hurry!

271
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,110
Pick it up quickly!

272
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,790
Boss,

273
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,680
are we really going after
the GFTA's carts?

274
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,320
Are you sure the carts are full of silver?

275
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,440
Absolutely certain.

276
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,030
When they were moving things,

277
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,150
they dropped some.

278
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,560
Silver spilled all over.

279
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,550
Let's do it.

280
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,320
Guys, make sure no one gets killed.

281
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,560
Let's just take the silver.

282
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

283
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,000
Stop right there!

284
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,470
We're merely passing by.

285
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,350
Which noble warriors have we disturbed?

286
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,040
Enough nonsense.

287
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,280
We're from the divine sect.

288
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,870
Hand over all the silver

289
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,080
and we'll spare your lives.

290
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,160
Or none of you will leave alive.

291
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,070
Sir,

292
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,710
I have 100,000 silver taels in this cart.

293
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,160
Giving it all to you isn't impossible.

294
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,470
But...

295
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:47,280
I won't be able to explain to my superior.

296
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,680
How about this instead?

297
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,200
You write me a silver note for 500,000 taels.

298
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,680
I'll clear the accounts when I return.

299
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,720
What do you think?

300
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,680
Ridiculous!

301
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,030
You unscrupulous merchant!

302
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,350
This is daylight robbery.

303
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,150
Guys, chop his head off!

304
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,150
No problem!

305
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,710
Run! Get out of here!

306
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,200
Boss...

307
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,590
They're running really fast.

308
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,900
Should we chase them?

309
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,790
Why chase them?

310
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,990
Grab the silver and go.

311
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,710
- Got it.
- Let's move.

312
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,440
We've hit the jackpot.

313
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,240
We've struck it rich.

314
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,350
Rich, rich at last.

315
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,190
It's ten thousand!

316
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Boss, it's poison.

317
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,360
It's poison...

318
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,990
Stay still, all of you!

319
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,590
What are you doing? No fighting!

320
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,430
Yingdan.

321
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,280
Snake Rank.

322
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,540
(Snake)

323
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,680
Snake-rank heroes
registered under the MAA

324
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,830
impersonated the demonic sect for robbery.

325
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,800
Do you have anything else to say?

326
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Since you already know,

327
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,200
why not let me go?

328
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,670
Can you bear the consequences?

329
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,350
You're quite defiant, aren't you?

330
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,470
Still so stubborn.

331
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,230
I know everything about you.

332
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,990
Will you confess

333
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,470
or must I make you confess?

334
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,590
The outcomes are very different.

335
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,710
Think it through.

336
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,000
Otherwise,

337
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,800
you'll face the consequences.

338
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,310
Calm down, calm down.

339
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,270
I'll talk.

340
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,710
I'll tell you everything.

341
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,280
Speak.

342
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,270
We are heroes from all over.

343
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,440
We've been instructed by our superiors

344
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,480
to disguise as the demonic sect near Huizhou

345
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,400
and commit robberies.

346
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,280
Superiors?

347
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,040
Who exactly are they?

348
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,450
Leaders of the MAA, of course.

349
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,510
We honestly don't know who they are.

350
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,040
We're just following orders.

351
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,960
Why do all of you know demonic arts?

352
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
We've learned those

353
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,590
by the manuals from our superiors.

354
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,540
To avoid revealing
our identities if discovered.

355
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,830
This...

356
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,880
Keep talking.

357
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,280
We usually disguise ourselves to rob

358
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,160
then claim the MAA
caught the demonic culprits

359
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,110
without the stolen goods recovered.

360
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,710
All the recent robberies were our doing.

361
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,640
What about the money?

362
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,720
We just paid a small fee.

363
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,230
The rest was handed over to the MAA.

364
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,720
Quick, take a look.

365
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,790
Is it this person?

366
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,720
Looks a bit like him.

367
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,750
But his face seems bigger than this.

368
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,200
Tell me, why do you look thinner?

369
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,000
It has nothing to do with me!

370
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,680
I gave all my money to the MAA.

371
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,110
I haven't even been eating properly lately.

372
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,400
Did you kill

373
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,680
a young beggar a few days ago?

374
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,870
Oh, that incident?

375
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,200
That gave me quite a scare.

376
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
I did see a little beggar a few days ago.

377
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,870
But he saw my face.

378
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,630
I had no choice but to silence him.

379
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,510
Zhan.

380
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,070
What are you doing? Stop it!

381
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,510
Don't hit me!

382
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,630
Not the face!

383
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,320
It's not my fault!

384
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,390
Help me!

385
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,870
Not the face! Not the face!

386
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,230
I thought the MAA was bad enough.

387
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,110
I didn't expect it to be this evil.

388
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,360
Could there be something hidden behind this?

389
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,270
What hidden truth?

390
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,870
Master, please think clearly.

391
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,080
It's laid out in the open.

392
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,000
I...

393
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,750
They said their leaders arranged it.

394
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,400
Who could that be?

395
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,270
Isn't it Wu Guangming?

396
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,320
Also, they said they were gathered together.

397
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Other than Wu Guangming,

398
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,630
who else could command them?

399
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,110
But Chairman Wu

400
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,990
doesn't seem like that kind of person.

401
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,240
Could this

402
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,320
be another setup by the demonic sect?

403
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,230
"Doesn't seem like"?

404
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,440
Gou Lingfeng,

405
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,320
do you look like a good person?

406
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,510
I...

407
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,430
Zhuge.

408
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,360
Haven't you always been misunderstood

409
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,870
just because of your appearance?

410
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,600
Does that mean you're not good?

411
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,510
Likewise,

412
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,910
is someone who looks good

413
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,470
naturally virtuous?

414
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,870
So what should we do about these people?

415
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,480
- Yingdan.
- What are you doing?

416
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,840
- Let go, let go!
- Wait,

417
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,720
shouldn't such a thing be reported

418
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,240
to the MAA for judgment?

419
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,350
The MAA?

420
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,670
It's their doing.

421
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,680
What will they do?

422
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,550
Tell me, how will the MAA handle this

423
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,120
and Wu Guangming? Step aside!

424
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,440
But we can't take justice
into our own hands.

425
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,160
I must avenge Zhao.

426
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,720
- Let go!
- No!

427
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,580
Calm down.

428
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,550
Master, why are you so stubborn?

429
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,470
I...

430
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,080
I just don't want you all

431
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,080
to become like them.

432
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,560
Release your grip.

433
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,680
Fine, we'll listen to you.

434
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,350
But I want to see

435
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,990
how they handle this.

436
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,990
I'm going to Wulipo to ask my master.

437
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,920
Master!

438
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,110
What's going on here?

439
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,400
What exactly happened?

440
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,470
What's wrong with him?

441
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,960
He won't wake up.

442
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,510
Hu San'er.

443
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,880
- Hu San'er
- Hu San'er.

444
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,830
- Hu San'er, Hu San'er
- What's going on?

445
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,480
What exactly happened here?

446
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,590
Where is my master?

447
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,670
Where's my master?

448
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,800
Who are you?

449
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,200
I am the disciple of Mr. Gui.

450
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm Zhuge.

451
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,080
Where's my master?

452
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,800
- Hu San'er.
- It's you!

453
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,320
You tipped us off.

454
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,310
- That's why we're in this mess.
- Calm down!

455
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,240
- Let go.
- What?

456
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,800
- I...
- Calm down.

457
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,870
We don't know anything.

458
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,950
This...

459
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,960
What happened?

460
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,320
We truly don't know.

461
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,000
Stop pretending to act all innocent.

462
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,110
That day right after you left,

463
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,240
the MAA attacked us.

464
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,670
MAA?

465
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,640
Where's my grandfather?

466
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,630
He shielded us to escape,

467
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,800
facing the MAA alone.

468
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,350
In the end, we only found his hand.

469
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,630
We followed the trail of blood for hours,

470
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,870
but didn't find his body.

471
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,800
Perhaps it was scattered in battle

472
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,790
or devoured by wild beasts.

473
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,750
That's not possible.

474
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,640
We could only build him a symbolic grave.

475
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,160
- No! Impossible!
- Impossible!

476
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,590
- He was so strong!
- No!

477
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,870
How could he be eaten like that?

478
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,590
Tell me,

479
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,350
where is my master buried?

480
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,430
You are unworthy to honor him!

481
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,030
Get lost! Leave now!

482
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,870
Leave!

483
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,510
- All of you, get lost!
- Leave!

484
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,430
Get lost!

485
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,000
Out, you lapdog!

486
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,720
- You traitor!
- Traitor!

487
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,670
Traitor!

488
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,160
A lapdog of the MAA!

489
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't believe it.

490
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,400
Get lost!

491
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,520
My master wouldn't fall so easily.

492
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,400
Go away!

493
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,310
I'll confront Wu Guangming myself!

494
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,790
- Master!
- Leave!

495
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,710
Go!

496
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,820
(Eliminate Evil and Uphold Justice)

497
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,310
Your tea truly lives up to its name.

498
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,670
So, based on what you've said...

499
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,100
(Eliminate Evil and Uphold Justice)

500
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,320
Lingfeng,

501
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,830
what are you doing?

502
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,960
Gou Lingfeng, how dare you!

503
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,590
I've uncovered the truth

504
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,110
behind the demonic sect's robbery.

505
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,720
It was actually committed
by the MAA members.

506
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,350
The evidence is solid.

507
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,790
They even massacred Wulipo,

508
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,720
slaughtering innocent villagers.

509
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,000
Chairman Wu,

510
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,080
what do you have to say?

511
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,520
What nonsense is this?

512
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,200
What are you standing there?

513
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,830
Gou Lingfeng stormed into the MAA

514
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,270
and defied its authority. Seize him!

515
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,190
Yes!

516
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,510
Changzai.

517
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,510
Chairman Wu.

518
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,040
Leave us alone.

519
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,430
Follow me.

520
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,560
Some secrets have been buried for years.

521
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,430
It's time to let you know.

522
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,190
What exactly do you mean?

523
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,840
Lingfeng.

524
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,670
I bear guilt.

525
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,960
As the chairman of the MAA,

526
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
I failed to truly lead the association.

527
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,520
This caused factions

528
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,480
rising everywhere within,

529
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,870
each acting on their own.

530
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,590
This is my first sin.

531
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,720
Knowing that some of us

532
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,510
posed as the demonic sect,

533
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,720
exploiting the common people,

534
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,960
I was powerless to stop them.

535
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,830
This is my second sin.

536
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,830
Years ago, I rushed to GFTA,

537
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,800
intending to rescue them,

538
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,320
but arrived too late.

539
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,590
I failed to save your wet nurse.

540
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,000
This is my third sin.

541
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,560
Lingfeng,

542
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,270
I, Wu Guangming,

543
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,350
owe you an apology.

544
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,720
Do you realize

545
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,240
who truly controls

546
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,910
the MAA now?

547
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,070
Of course, it's you.

548
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,350
You're the chairman.

549
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,430
I am the chairman,

550
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,960
but the one in charge now

551
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,550
is Eunuch Deng.

552
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,880
- Eunuch Deng?
- Wu Guangming!

553
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,830
Wu Guangming!

554
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,350
- I'll end you!
- This is for Zhao!

555
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,640
Stop this.

556
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,960
- Why?
- It's not what it seems.

557
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,510
Listen,

558
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,720
are you both here

559
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,670
to kill me?

560
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,190
And if we are?

561
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,430
Since you're here, don't leave.

562
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,350
Stay and listen for a while.

563
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,240
I know you've misunderstood me due to

564
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,830
the impostor incident.

565
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,590
But I was kept in the dark as well.

566
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,720
Why not take a moment
to think this through?

567
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,870
If these people were truly under my orders,

568
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,310
how could I possibly let you

569
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,110
investigate this matter?

570
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,110
That being said,

571
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,350
they are heroes from various places,

572
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,670
gathering to commit crimes.

573
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,800
Besides you,

574
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,390
who else could command them?

575
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,040
Perhaps,

576
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,960
Eunuch Deng could do so.

577
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,350
Deng Yunfeng was appointed as MAA Inspector

578
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,590
by Eunuch Deng to better

579
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,080
control the MAA.

580
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,190
Moreover, he secretly assigned tasks to us.

581
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,430
Chairman Wu is unaware of that as well.

582
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,640
That's right.

583
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,000
You three

584
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,870
are righteous and honorable heroes.

585
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,590
The MAA needs young heroes like you.

586
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,510
That is why we must

587
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,350
stand united in this fight.

588
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,750
But based only on your words,

589
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,590
how can we trust you?

590
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,870
You don't have to trust me,

591
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,190
but time will reveal the truth.

592
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,720
About the assault on Wulipo,

593
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,400
are you unaware of it either?

594
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,320
Good and evil cannot coexist.

595
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,480
The demonic sect is emerging frequently,

596
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,000
and keeping the world peaceful

597
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,080
has always been the duty of the MAA.

598
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,800
You must not let them deceive you.

599
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,670
- You...
- You...

600
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,720
Guangming.

601
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,240
Guangming.

602
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,510
Father?

603
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,750
"Father"?

604
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,920
"Father"?

605
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,000
Lingfeng, why are you here?

606
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,480
Father, why have you come?

607
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,720
I went to Chenzhou for your uncle

608
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
and I stopped by.

609
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,110
Where were you earlier?

610
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,480
At Wen Academy.

611
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,190
So it's Juhong Pavilion after all.

612
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,680
My master really didn't lie to me.

613
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,600
For socializing.

614
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,710
Just socializing.

615
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,350
Is this really your father?

616
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,110
Guangming!

617
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,750
Gou.

618
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,350
It's been so long!

619
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,480
You finally remembered to visit me.

620
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,350
Look at you, Guangming.

621
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,350
Why is he so noisy?

622
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,400
Long time no see.

623
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,240
You're still as imposing as ever.

624
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,480
They seem quite familiar.

625
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,590
Of course, they are.

626
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,440
What is this?

627
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,590
I brought it to you.

628
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,190
If not for your rescue back then,

629
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,960
the whole Gou

630
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,880
might not exist now.

631
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,080
I've never forgotten

632
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,590
this kindness.

633
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,190
Between us, let's not bring that up.

634
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,720
Besides,

635
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,190
the MAA owes much of its success today

636
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,510
to the GFTA.

637
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,110
You've supported us all along.

638
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,590
By the way,

639
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,110
did you know recently, Zhu Gou Team

640
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,830
is gaining more fame in the martial world?

641
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,390
Truly, a tiger father breeds no weak sons.

642
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,670
Zhu Gou Team.

643
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,040
What?

644
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,510
Zhu Gou Team.

645
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,480
What do you mean by that?

646
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,670
What?

647
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,270
Father.

648
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,590
Father, Zhu Gou Team.

649
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,430
It represents the prestige of our team.

650
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,430
Now it's also called Zhu Gou Ma Team.

651
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,320
What does that mean?

652
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,030
Who came up with that?

653
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,640
Lingfeng, it couldn't have been you

654
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,000
since it's a lousy name.

655
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,270
Right?

656
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,920
Your son is extraordinarily smart.

657
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,590
He's even solved many strange cases.

658
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,350
And he's now a pillar of the MAA.

659
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,350
A future star of the martial world.

660
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,030
How could he be that exceptional?

661
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,830
As long as he doesn't trouble you.

662
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,470
Lingfeng,

663
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,720
why not introduce

664
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,640
these friends of yours?

665
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,960
Father,

666
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,320
they're my dear friends
I met in Huizhou.

667
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,680
This is Zhuge Heng, son of the Sword Saint.

668
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,600
Hello, sir.

669
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,840
Heng.

670
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,270
I met you when you were six years old.

671
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,720
- Really?
- You've grown so much.

672
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,110
My family and your Sword Alliance
go way back.

673
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,600
Take this.

674
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,030
Sir, you're being too polite.

675
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,670
Then don't take it.

676
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,800
Father,

677
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,760
this is

678
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,040
a Tiger-rank hero of the MAA,

679
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Ma Yingdan.

680
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,150
I've relied on her care these days.

681
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,990
Young lady, Ms. Ma.

682
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,320
Take it.

683
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,830
- Sir, I...
- He gave this to you, just take it.

684
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,560
Take it, take it.

685
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,710
Lingfeng,

686
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,750
come here.

687
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,310
You've got a good eye.

688
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,750
What do you mean by "good eye"?

689
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,640
Lingfeng.

690
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,920
Your bride is quite lovely.

691
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,030
Don't let her go.

692
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,030
Let me tell you,

693
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,750
don't be stingy when courting a girl.

694
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,430
The restrictions are lifted now.

695
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,480
Take as much money as you need.

696
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,080
- It's not about the money.
- No?

697
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,320
Ms. Ma.

698
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,880
I'll entrust Lingfeng to you from now on.

699
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,080
Take good care of each other.

700
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,590
His mother passed away early.

701
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,830
His marriage is my decision to make.

702
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,110
Why are we talking about this?

703
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,480
- Lingfeng.
- How did we get here?

704
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,880
Your two friends

705
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,400
are willing to risk life for you.

706
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,590
That truly warms my heart.

707
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,680
But the world is full of dangers.

708
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,550
You're still young,

709
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,790
so you must tread carefully.

710
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,000
Beware of being used.

711
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,190
Acting impulsively
leads to great mistakes.

712
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,640
Guangming and I go way back.

713
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,720
- I can't accept this money.
- It's alright.

714
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,320
The martial world is treacherous.

715
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,800
You can't judge things

716
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,430
only with your eyes.

717
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,590
Your father may be unreliable,

718
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,480
but he spoke the truth.

719
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,430
On such a fortuitous day,

720
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,870
how about we share a drink today?

721
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,510
Forget it, I've been here for days.

722
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,430
Rain check.

723
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,800
Alright.

724
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,950
I'll listen to you.

725
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,870
Another day it is.

726
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,510
Ms. Ma,

727
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,030
(MAA)
take care of yourself.

728
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,110
Spend more time at home with Lingfeng.

729
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,110
Lingfeng.

730
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,350
Your master is exceptional.

731
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,680
He won't be defeated so easily.

732
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,350
Right, Father. I think the same.

733
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,270
Yingdan,

734
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
why is it you again?

735
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,110
Such bad luck.

736
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,350
Yunfeng, why are you here too?

737
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,350
And you are?

738
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,190
I'm his father.

739
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,140
Father.

740
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,510
You know him too?

741
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,430
Chairman Gou,

742
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,080
greetings.

743
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,560
He's Yunfeng.

744
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,790
He always played with you when young.

745
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,580
You were like brothers in one pair of pants.

746
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,590
No, impossible.

747
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,550
Me? I'd rather be naked than share with him.

748
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,110
When I visited your house before,

749
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,480
the kid I played with was this one?

750
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,710
It doesn't make sense.

751
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,750
I remember that kid
being fair and chubby.

752
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,110
He wasn't this unattractive.

753
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,160
Deng Yunfeng!

754
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,480
Heard your words!

755
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,560
What do you mean by "wasn't"?

756
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,630
I've always looked like this!

757
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,890
- You're the unattractive one!
- Don't!

758
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,190
Uncle Gou, look at him!

759
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,000
You two are like brothers.

760
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,480
And now both of you serve the MAA.

761
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,070
From now on, let's face it together.

762
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,480
You're good brothers.

763
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,110
Uncle Gou.

764
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,960
I have urgent matters to handle.

765
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,040
See you another day.

766
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,190
See you, Yingdan.

767
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,400
Are you crazy?

768
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,640
Who said goodbye to you?

769
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,560
Lingfeng.

770
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,430
You should keep an eye on him.

771
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,550
Father, you noticed he's not trustworthy?

772
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,880
I see he's interested in my daughter-in-law.

773
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,800
What?

774
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,350
Lingfeng,

775
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,310
I've stayed in Huizhou for too long.

776
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,310
It's time to leave.

777
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,550
You must know your place.

778
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,580
Do what needs to be done.

779
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,070
Did you drop this, miss?

780
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,990
Miss.

781
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,260
(Martial Artists Association)

782
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,590
Do you believe what Wu Guangming said?

783
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,560
Half-believe it, maybe.

784
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,750
After all, he's my idol.

785
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,680
Besides, if it were truly his doing,

786
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,720
why would he go to such lengths?

787
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,060
Do you think he might know

788
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,310
we're investigating Zhao's case

789
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,510
and turned the situation

790
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,640
to his advantage?

791
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,560
That's unlikely.

792
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,350
None of you know my connection to Zhao,

793
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,000
and the MAA knows even less.

794
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:54,320
Maybe the chairman has his reasons.

795
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,920
People are unpredictable.

796
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,880
I think we shouldn't trust him so easily.

797
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,310
But Deng Yunfeng is truly despicable.

798
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,270
Let's deal with him.

799
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,800
- Let's go.
- Wait.

800
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,960
What if it really was Eunuch Deng's doing?

801
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,590
Yunfeng won't let us investigate.

802
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,590
Could it mean that

803
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,430
even Deng Yunfeng is unaware?

804
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,880
This...

805
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,860
(The End of Episode 19)

806
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,970
(Peace and Harvest)
We're almost there.

807
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,350
Leader, I apologize.

808
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,000
I truly misunderstood you before.

809
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,160
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

810
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,280
It's alright.

811
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,350
There's something you don't know.

812
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,440
All of us here

813
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,630
are registered in the MAA.

814
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,110
- Thank you.
- We relied on the old sect leader.

815
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,480
Come on, move forward in line.

816
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,790
- Since he vanished,
- Thanks.

817
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,030
- we've been struggling to survive.
- Thank you.

818
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,270
He is blessed with luck.

819
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,230
- Here.
- He is alive.

820
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,210
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

821
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,520
Leader, we hope you'll guide us.

822
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,400
Yes, Leader.

823
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,000
Lead us to survive.

824
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,630
Stop calling me "Leader".

825
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,150
It's true I'm Mr. Gui's disciple,

826
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,920
but I lack the resolve

827
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,800
and the capability to be a sect leader.

828
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,550
However, you are his brothers,

829
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,390
which makes you my brothers too.

830
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,880
Now, bring me some paper and ink.

831
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,310
I'll write you a note.

832
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,200
From now on,

833
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,110
each month,

834
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,910
you can receive food from GFTA.

835
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,960
Yes,

836
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,240
I'll write another note for you.

837
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,150
You can receive food
from the Sword Alliance.

838
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,440
Thank you, Leader.

839
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,480
Thank you, Zhuge.

840
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,520
It's nothing.

841
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,310
Farewell, Leader Gou.

842
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,800
Farewell, Mrs. Gou.

843
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,960
- Farewell, Mr. Zhuge.
- Alright, enough.

844
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,590
Farewell, Mrs. Zhuge.

845
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,550
Alright, that's enough.

846
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,310
- Stop with this. Go back.
- Don't bother.

847
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,630
You can go, disperse.

848
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,510
- Bye.
- Time to go.

849
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,200
- We're heading out too.
- Bye.

850
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,870
Let's go, Mrs. Gou.

851
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,640
What "Mrs. Gou"?

852
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,550
Just head back.

853
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,010
- Take care, Leader.
- It's yours.

854
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,270
My father wanted you to have it.

855
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,400
Just keep it.

856
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
Hold onto it.

857
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,000
We're not close enough for this.

858
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,400
What's the point of this?

859
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,200
- Safe travels!
- Travel safely.

860
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,240
- Farewell!
- Be careful!

861
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,200
Take care, Leader.

862
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,830
Safe travels, Leader.

863
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,590
- What's wrong?
- Don't forget to visit.

864
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,270
I'm not sure what's wrong either.

865
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,550
Be careful on the road!

866
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,760
