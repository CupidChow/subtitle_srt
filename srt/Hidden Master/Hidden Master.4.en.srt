Don't bully her!

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,270
Get lost! You think you're a hero?

3
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,110
Poisonous kids are not welcomed!

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,320
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

5
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,430
Don't play with her.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,000
Are you okay?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,160
I'm Ma Yingdan.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,480
What's your name?

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,150
I have no name.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,560
How's that possible?

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,070
How about I call you Little Stone?

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,000
Little Stone?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Okay!

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Little Stone,

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,360
you look good with your hair up.

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,350
You're bleeding.

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,430
My blood is poisonous!

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,840
Step back, Little Stone!

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,240
Take the antidote now!

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry, Little Stone!

Mr. Zhuge, you're here.

72
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,520
You're so busy.

73
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,200
Our vice chairman just died.

74
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,480
Many tasks were delayed.

75
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,790
Let's go.

76
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,430
I have a good task for you.

77
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,560
- Well...
- Miss,

78
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,080
I also want a task.

79
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,240
No task for you.

80
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,160
Why?

81
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,320
Because you will

82
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,590
scare the kids.

83
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,510
I...

84
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,910
Let's go.

85
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,830
Master...

86
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,950
Mr. He.

87
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,160
Why is there no task for me?

88
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,390
Gou,

89
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,110
don't you know why there's

90
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,990
no task for you?

91
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,920
I don't know.

92
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,360
Then I'll tell you politely.

93
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,760
Just tell me.

94
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,800
With your appearance,

95
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,310
how can you get a task?

96
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,910
What if you scare the kids?

97
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,830
Sir,

98
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,230
please be polite.

99
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,480
Use your silhouette more.

100
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,840
Wait...

101
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,360
I need hero points.

102
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,710
Then I'll help others myself.

103
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,630
I'll defeat the demonic...

104
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,680
Wait, wait.

105
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,920
Only by completing our tasks

106
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,390
can you earn hero points.

107
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,590
If you act alone,

108
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
you'll be a criminal.

109
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,240
What? I...

110
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,560
Mr. He...

111
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,600
Hero He...

112
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,520
You...

113
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,750
Please help me.

114
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,480
- Help me!
- I can't help you.

115
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,880
I can't help you.

116
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,310
Wait.

117
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,470
You're from
the Gou Family Trade Association, right?

118
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,480
Then there's a way.

119
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,590
What way?

120
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,870
Look, this is

121
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,720
a big association, right?

122
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,040
It is really hard

123
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,600
to manage it.

124
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,510
All these years...

125
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,190
You want money!

126
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,640
Just be honest.

127
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,910
Young Hero Gou,

128
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,000
thank you for your contribution.

129
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,920
I'll take my leave.

130
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,800
I won't give it back.

131
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,920
Wait.

132
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,910
What's the solution?

133
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,470
Do you remember Hero Yang
from the northwest?

134
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,240
He couldn't do anything.

135
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,270
However, since he changed his looks

136
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,880
with big eyes and heavy eyebrows,

137
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,760
he's become a popular hero.

138
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,310
For a Hero,

139
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,080
appearance is the key.

140
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,710
I'll take my leave.

141
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,000

Why does a hero

145
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,070
need a makeover?

146
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,390
Can't believe it.

147
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,720
What are you doing?

148
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,710
Did you accept the task?

149
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,920
What task?

150
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,240
I don't want to be a hero.

151
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,120
It was just too crowded,

152
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,510

154
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,720

155
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,510
so that I can get tasks.

156
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,200
Makeover?

157
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,590
I will never do that.

Then let's do it.

180
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,270
It's me.

00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,640
- Okay.
- to stay pretty.

191
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,950
What a traitor.

192
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Master,

193
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,440
if you're willing to give up,

194
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,030
you'll have no worries.

195
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,400
Get lost.

196
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,720
Sir.

197
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,920
Heng,

198
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,040
how do you feel?

199
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,710
Mom, it's really comfortable.

200
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,360
Heng, when you grow up,

201
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,950
you'll be so handsome.

202
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,550
Come on.

203
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,360
Mom, it hurts.

204
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,270
I'm sorry.

205
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,120
Good boy,

206
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,280
I'll be gentle.

207
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,240
Sir.

208
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,000
Sir?

209
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,990
Do you like it?

210
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,120
- This...
- Well,

211
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,510
I made this braid for you.

212
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,910
I think it can show

213
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,630
your personal charm.

214
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,790
Sir.

215
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,080
Sir, what are you doing?

216
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,190
Well,

217
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,520
it was very comfortable.

218
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,670
I like it.

219
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,440
Where's my unique beauty?

220
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,440
What about getting popular?

221
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,950
You're deceiving customers.

222
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,320
What's troubling you, Sir?

223
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,230
Are you also here for a makeover?

224
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,630
You're good-looking.

225
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,800
How many times have you done it?

226
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,630
Master, you got me wrong.

227
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,910
I'm the shopkeeper of the salon.

228
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,830
Shopkeeper?

229
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,270
That's great!

230
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,190
Bro!

231
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,800
I want to be handsome!

232
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,560
How can I adjust my face?

233
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,320
Well...

234
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,470
Pardon me,

235
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,950
you'd better give up.

236
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,630
There's nothing I can do.

237
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,520
Why do you all say that?

238
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,470
Can't I become a hero

239
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,870
just because of my face?

240
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,360
Why do you only care about appearance?

241
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,200
What about

242
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,830
my kindness and righteousness?

243
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,160
Do I have to

244
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,040
go home and inherit the family business?

245
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,160
I can't accept it!

246
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,590
Sir,

247
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,480
I just remembered

248
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,630
we have a luxury service.

249
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,870
Luxury service?

250
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,830
What is that?

251
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
In the martial world,

252
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,520
many ordinary people

253
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,750
also want to look better,

254
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,260
so

255
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,520
I prepared this service

256
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,870
for esteemed guests

257
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,280
like you.

258
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,400
What is it?

259
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,160
Mask.

260
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,960
Mask?

261
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,480
It's not luxurious at all.

262
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,990
Not luxurious at all.

263
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,350
Sir, you got me wrong.

264
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,950
It's not what you think.

265
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,200
What?

266
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,630
You...

267
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,270
- This...
- How is it?

268
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,680
What just happened?

269
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,830
Sir,

270
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,800
this is the mask I made.

271
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,920
You can become anyone you want to be.

272
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,710
Can I customize a mask?

273
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,110
Of course.

274
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,120
However,

275
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,320
the materials are rare.

276
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,400
We don't have many masks,

277
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,870
so the price is higher.

278
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,990
Just tell me, how much?

279
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,870
100 taels each.

280
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,830
What?

281
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,790
Sir, it's definitely worth it.

282
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,230
That's so cheap.

283
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,950
I'll take two then.

284
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,400
Master.

285
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,760
Master.

286
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,480
Master.

287
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,390
Look at me.

288
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,310
How is it?

289
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,070
Heng.

290
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,440
I didn't know

291
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,350
you'd be more handsome.

292
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,190
Right?

293
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,830
Ling'er.

294
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,080
This sir

295
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,630
wants our luxury service.

296
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,000
Yes.

297
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,520
Alright, Dad.

298
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,080
- Dad?
- Dad?

299
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,110
Your dad's so young.

300
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,200
Sorry, I was so rude.

301
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,750
No, no, Master.

302
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,920
Just call me Lingfeng.

303
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,710
Heng, let's go.

304
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,990
Wait. Where are we going?

305
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,470
Withdraw money.

306
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,480
Dad,

307
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,150
my name is Zhuge Heng.

308
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,240
(Universal Banknote)
You can

309
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,710
call me Zhuge or Geheng.

310
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,560
Nice to meet you.

311
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,040
Heng,

312
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,870
you're so good to me.

313
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,670
Sir.

314
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,230
- This way.
- Let's go.

315
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,550
Sir, this...

316
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,750
Just take it.

317
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,040
Mr. Gou.

318
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,710
There's one more thing.

319
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,240
Actually, appearance

320
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,360
is not that important.

321
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,200
What matters is what you do.

322
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,270
Right now,

323
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,680
my top priority is

324
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,920
to become handsome.

325
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,150
Hurry up.

326
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,590
I can't wait.

327
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,430
Okay.

328
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,120
What kind of mask do you want?

329
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,680
I want two masks.

330
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,880
Okay.

331
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,550
The first one

332
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,750
is He Changzai.

333
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,560
He's the manager
of Martial Artists Association.

334
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,070
Listen,

335
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,200
he looks creepy and greedy.

336
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,160
And he's always

337
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,710
so arrogant.

338
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,960
That's a good description.

339
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,880
Right?

340
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,000
Does he always wear

341
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,360
dark blue clothes?

342
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,510
That's right.

343
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,630
He claims to be impartial

344
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,000
and calls himself Sky Knight.

345
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's him.

346
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,030
He's so shameless.

347
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,630
What Sky Knight?

348
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,560
Listen,

349
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,560
his blood-dragon jade pendant

350
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,590
is priceless.

351
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,400
He's not righteous at all.

352
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,120
Got it. What about the second one?

353
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,590
The second one...

354
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,680
This second one...

355
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,830
Did you paint all these, Ms. Ling'er?

356
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,750
They look great.

357
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,080
Can you paint one for me?

358
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,470
- Sure.
- I want this one.

359
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,510
Sir, it's done.

360
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,430
It's done?

361
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,230
That's not it.

362
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,440
But it's also nice.

363
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,950
Well, why

364
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,950
is there a moon?

365
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,030
Somehow I saw

366
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,120
the moonlight

367
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,830
in your eyes.

368
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,680
So...

369
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,800
Are you okay, Ms. Ling'er?

370
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,630
Zhuge, let's go,

371
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,760
Master.

372
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,160
Sir.

373
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,240
Your painting.

374
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,440
Thank you.

375
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,550
Your face needs long-term care

376
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,320
to stay perfect.

377
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,630
Please come more often.

378
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,600
Okay.

379
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,800
Thanks, Ms. Ling'er.

380
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,070
Thank you.

381
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,070
Mr. Gou,

382
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,550
always carry a mask with you.

383
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,910
You might need
to hide your real look sometimes.

384
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,790
My master always needs to hide it.

385
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,710
Shut up.

386
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,550
One more thing,

387
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,240
please don't tell anyone else about it

388
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,150
to avoid trouble.

389
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,110
Don't worry.

390
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,310
I understand.

391
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,120
Okay.

392
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,230
- Mr. Deng?
- Floral Knight.

393
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,320
What are you doing here?

394
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,160
I knew you'd come.

395
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,590
I've been keeping an eye
on them for you.

396
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,560
Mr. Deng.

397
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,560
You're always busy.

398
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,560
How do you have time for this?

399
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,670
I'm just a bit curious.

400
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,000
Floral Knight,

401
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,910
you're always decisive.

402
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,080
Why

403
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,880
did you go easy on him?

404
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,150
I didn't go easy on him.

405
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,150
I just want to know

406
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,110
why my poison didn't affect him.

407
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,560
(Gou Lingfeng,)

408
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,190
(how can you be so cruel?)

409
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,030
Master,

410
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,320
how can you be so cruel?

411
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,430
Heng.

412
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,870
You're doing it to yourself.

413
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,110
What are you doing?

414
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,320
I didn't do anything!

415
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,590
Don't talk nonsense.

416
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,630
Or I'll poison you.

417
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,270
Stop yelling!

418
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,080
You scared me.

419
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,720
Master!

420
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,880
- Heng.
- What did she do to you?

421
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,560
I was freaked out.

422
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,270
Vicious woman.

423
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,270
I can't believe she did that

424
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,390
to someone like you.

425
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,040
Master, don't worry.

426
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,280
I'll make her pay for this!

427
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,350
Heng,

428
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,830
why do your words

429
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,000
sound weird?

430
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,350
Are you poisoned?

431
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,670
Let me see!

432
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,430
You...

433
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,760
Stay away from me!

434
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,390
Why are you blushing?

435
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,550
Do you have any other symptoms?

436
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,080
My... My heart is racing.

437
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,520
What kind of poison is this?

438
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,800
I get it now.

439
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,720
You've never touched

440
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,240
a girl before, have you?

441
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,830
Why bring this up?

442
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,830
Help me deal with the poison!

443
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,550
Okay, Master.

444
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,560
Be good.

445
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,430
You'll understand when you grow up.

446
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:16,540
(Martial Artists Association)

447
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,240
You two are so alike.

448
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,030
I didn't change my voice.

449
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,960
Now, does my voice sound similar too?

450
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,070
It's exactly the same, Master.

451
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,350
Mr. Zhuge.

452
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,590
You're a role model.

453
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,350
Let me see.

454
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,270
Where did you get this?

455
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,720
It's easy.

456
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,320
It's all over the Hero Street.

457
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,350
Hero Street?

458
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,030
Yes, Hero Supplies Store.

459
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,240
Yours, too.

460
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Mine?

461
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,880
What?

462
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,110
Let's get to business.

463
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,080
Find Mr. Feidao's...

464
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,240
What's this?

465
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,240
Master, this one suits you.

466
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,680
Guard the door and ward off evil.

467
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,960
Why don't you guard the door?

468
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,560
Mr. He, what are you...

469
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,750
Mr. He is having joint pain.

470
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,150
Yes, yes, joint pain.

471
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,270
Joint pain.

472
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,320
Who are you?

473
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,910
I'm new here.

474
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,190
What do you need?

475
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,960
If nothing else,

476
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,790
please leave and close the door.

477
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,710
Okay.

478
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,190
- From outside!
- From outside!

479
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,480
Hey,

480
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,670
I need to talk to Mr. He
about something urgent.

481
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,920
I also have something urgent.

482
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,190
What urgent matter do you have?

483
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,870
Mind your own business.

484
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,630
Is Mr. He that kind of person?

485
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,630
Is he that kind of person?

486
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:14,560
Isn't he like that?

487
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Is Mr. He that kind of person or not?

488
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,310
- Mr. He...
- Mr. Zhuge.

489
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,640
You should leave,

490
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,760
or Mr. He will get angry.

491
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,590
- Mr. He will get angry.
- Mr. He will get angry.

492
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,590
Then I'll leave you alone.

493
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,910
Close the door.

494
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,680
Mr. He!

495
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,830
Mr. He is really getting angry.

496
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,240
I won't make you angry.

497
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Look at me.

498
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,160
Do I look good?

499
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,430
Not bad.

500
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,540
Mr. He,

501
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,200
I've joined the association,

502
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,110
but I'm tired of worldly matters.

503
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,080
I only want to live

504
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,870
in seclusion in the martial world.

505
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,420
(He Changzai, Sky Knight)

506
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,120
Sorry for the trouble.

507
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,150
So quick?

508
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,640
Blackmailing.

509
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,960
Of course it was quick.

510
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,510
She blackmailed He Changzai

511
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,070
instead of you.

512
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,670
Don't mention it. It was a great loss.

513
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,720
The blood-dragon jade pendants
on the street

514
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,400
are terrible,

515
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,030
so I got a real one from the west,

516
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,720
much better than He Changzai's.

517
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,800
You're doing this to yourself.

518
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,400
Do you want tasks or not?

519
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,720
No, no more tasks.

520
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,400
Besides, Liu Sanniang

521
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,720
is in charge of promotion.

522
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,270
I need to make another mask.

523
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,200
It's too much trouble.

524
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,430
He!

525
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,960
Mr. Zhuge, you're here.

526
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,830
Perfect timing.

527
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,880
I'm here

528
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,150
for you.

529
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
For me?

530
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yes.

531
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,270
Your master

532
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,160
hasn't received any tasks, right?

533
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,630
Ma Yingdan wants him
to deliver meals every day.

534
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,630
You should also know this.

535
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,160
Ma Yingdan?

536
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,320
Deliver meals?

537
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,760
He.

538
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,520
I haven't seen you all day.

539
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,110
Did you tell him or not?

540
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Did you?

541
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,550
I think so.

542
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,680
You know Ma Yingdan's temper.

543
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,190
Better not provoke her!

544
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,520
I won't.

545
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,670
I've been good to you, right?

546
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,520
Please come

547
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,390
and play with me more often.

548
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,600
Master.

549
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,800
Ma Yingdan is still hungry.

550
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,030
What does it have to do with me?

551
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,430
I'm still angry.

552
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,720
Listen,

553
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,510
if I deliver the food today,

554
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,910
I'll forsake my name!

555
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,920
Take a seat.

556
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,680
Yingdan, what poison did you use?

557
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,350
If I poisoned you, you'd be dead.

558
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,240
Then why does my heart race

559
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,350
when I see you?

560
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,310
And my face...

561
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,240
Don't talk nonsense.

562
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,470
Sit down.

563
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,350
You even prepared your meal.

564
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,320
Shame on you.

565
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,510
Gou Lingfeng.

566
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,870
What sect are you from?

567
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,320
Did you learn any special skills?

568
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,830
You're my examiner,

569
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,720
so you know my information.

570
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,110
Well, did you

571
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,320
take any rare herbs?

572
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,190
Rare herbs?

573
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,830
I did.

574
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,830
Stewed chicken with gastrodia.

575
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,080
I loved it when I was young.

576
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,320
What's that about?

577
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,120
I'm seeing things.

578
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,960
Aren't you afraid I'll poison you?

579
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,590
Why would I be afraid?
You're a good person.

580
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,640
(I don't even have money for food.)

581
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,870
(Why should I be scared?)

582
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,270
Please stop staring at me.

583
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,080
I'm embarrassed.

584
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,830
(How's that possible?)

585
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,830
(Not just my poison,)

586
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,630
(other poison doesn't work either.)

587
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,510
Don't you think

588
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,150
I grow on people?

589
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,320
Don't flatter yourself.

590
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,380
(The End of Episode 4)

591
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,190
Yingdan!

592
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,320
Are you really leaving?

593
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,520
Is detoxication that important?

594
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,030
Do you know

595
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,000
what it means

596
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,760
if you leave the mountain?

597
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,120
Mom.

598
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,430
Mom,

599
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,390
I will

600
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,430
often come back and visit you.

601
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,400
Alright.

602
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,390
Alright.

603
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,190
I'm leaving.

604
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,240
Okay, bye.

605
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,390
Silly girl.

606
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,240
Oh no!

607
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,800
