00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,840
Master,

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,160
have you been keeping

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,320
something good from me?

4
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,350
Yes, yes.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,840
Look.

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,160
Master,

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,350
this is amazing.

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,510
You must know that blades are heartless.

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,440
They are meant
to protect yourself and others,

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,790
a weapon to guard those dearest to you.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,430
Listen carefully.

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,280
Unless your dearest is in danger,

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,280
don't draw it easily.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,670
- Master!
- You brat!

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,600

Heng.

66
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,080
Take him down together.

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,680
Gou Lingfeng,

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,470
I've never expected you to be
to hopelessly stubborn.

69
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,960
That's because

70
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,750
I stand for justice.

71
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,000
Nonsense.

72
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,430
I'll ask you one last time.

73
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,080
Will you submit

74
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,430
or not?

75
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,670
I

76
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,190
stand for justice.

77
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,360
Fine.

78
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,720
Then I'll send you and your justice

79
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,120
to hell.

80
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,520
Heng,

81
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,360
use the Moonlight Phantom.

82
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,000
What a surprise.

83
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,270
I never wanted to use this.

84
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,830
But you forced me.

85
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,000
The blood of a naturally toxic body.

86
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,310
This is the blood
of a naturally toxic body.

87
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,120
That's my blood.

88
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,630
Ling'er,

89
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,800
that's my blood.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,430
He told me before

91
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,020
he wanted to use my blood
to make an antidote

92
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,750
so I wouldn't suffer anymore.

93
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,070
Turns out he was lying all along.

94
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,240
Gou Lingfeng!

95
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,080
Yingdan!

96
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll restore your energy.

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,840
Liu Guang.

98
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Lingfeng.

99
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,070
Yingdan.

100
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,910
Lingfeng.

101
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,360
You can't beat him.

102
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,310
He's a monster now.

103
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,720
You can't beat him.

104
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,510
I can't run.

105
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,310
I'm a hero.

106
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,970
The Martial Artists Association

107
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,750
must not fall into his hands.

108
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,390
If he wins,

109
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,400
the entire martial world
will plunge into darkness.

110
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,390
I can't accept that.

111
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,160
I can't give up.

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,510
I haven't lost.

113
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,830
Ye,

114
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,680
being a great hero

115
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,700
is also my ultimate dream,

116
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,720
but I ended up

117
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,510
learning demonic skills.

118
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,480
He's already like this.

119
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,750
What else do you want?

120
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,630
I, Hero Gou,

121
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,720
have made up my mind.

122
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,390
I don't know about the past

123
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,480
or the rules of

124
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,790
the association,

125
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,200
but you've never hurt anyone

126
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,720
for Ling'er,

127
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,910
so I'll save you.

128
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,080
But you have no idea

129
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,670
what you're facing.

130
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,080
What is a hero?

131
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,120
A hero must uphold justice

132
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,840
and help those in need.

133
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,440
You're still

134
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,000
too young.

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,240
Master, then tell me,

136
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,320
what is a hero?

137
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,910
A hero must fear not death

138
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,360
and make sacrifices

139
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
for others.

140
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,150
I want to be the greatest hero

141
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,600
in this world!

142
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,630
Justice comes in all forms.

143
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,010
Martial arts know no good or evil.

144
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,600
Blades don't kill,

145
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,000
but humans do.

146
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,600
I'm destined to be a great hero!

147
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,920
Yingdan.

148
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,750
This is great.

149
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,040
Deng Yunfeng?

150
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,840
Deng Yunfeng.

151
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,200
Come on.

152
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,510
Get up.

153
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,140
(Hero Gathering)

154
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,790
I was born with a demonic face

155
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,960
and trained in demonic skills.

156
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,360
Everyone says

157
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,150
my path as a hero

158
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,840
is a dead end.

159
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,960
But I don't believe that.

160
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,840
I believe that with justice in my heart,

161
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,390
there's always a way forward.

162
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,480
Along the way,

163
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,240
I've met so many people

164
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
and so many things.

165
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,200
Yingdan,

166
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,710
Zhuge,

167
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,870
Ling'er,

168
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,270
Ye,

169
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,840
the Sword Saint,

170
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,630
Crane Knight,

171
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,000
and you.

172
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,790
There's also Radiant Knight,

173
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,600
my lifelong idol.

174
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,030
He's the one I dreamed of becoming.

175
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,150
I envy him.

176
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,440
I admire his brilliance

177
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,080
and his respect among all.

178
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
But I've been

179
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,510
keeping hitting walls.

180
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,200
My master once told me

181
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,390
that justice comes in all forms,

182
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,510
and martial arts know no good or evil.

183
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,480
I don't know

184
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,390
where he heard that from,

185
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,200
but I think

186
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,910
it's truly wise.

187
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,030
Martial arts know no good or evil.

188
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Whether someone knows demonic skills

189
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,750
has nothing to do

190
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,240
with whether they're good or evil.

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,940
What makes someone evil

192
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,080
is their heart.

193
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,390
Maybe now,

194
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,550
I finally understand

195
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,270
what being a true hero means.

196
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,440
You said

197
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,550
there's bound to be injustice
in this world.

198
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,750
That's right.

199
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,030
But that's also the reason

200
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,910
why the world needs heroes.

201
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,120
Those who give
without asking in return are heroes.

202
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,320
Those who save others
from peril are heroes.

203
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,030
Those who sacrifice themselves

204
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,440
are of course heroes.

205
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,790
Since the world

206
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,550
is not fair enough,

207
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,120
there must be someone
to stand up against it.

208
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,550
Anyone standing up

209
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,360
is a hero.

210
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,320
You brat,

211
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,390
you've finally grown up.

212
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,630
Today,

213
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,480
I'll be the one to stand up.

214
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,390
Lingfeng,

215
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,080
you've finally found your heroic heart.

216
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,150
Go, Gou.

217
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,200
We believe in you.

218
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,550
Well said, Master.

219
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,320
I knew I wasn't wrong about you.

220
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,630
Gou Lingfeng,

221
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,600
though I've never really liked you,

222
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,390
what you just said

223
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
touched me.

224
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,750
Mr. Gou,

225
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,480
I knew I wasn't wrong about you.

226
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,510
You are the true hero.

227
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,750
I'm

228
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,870
destined to be a great hero!

229
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,120
(Good kid.)

230
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,440
(He transformed demonic energy
into the righteous one.)

231
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,450
Lingfeng, Heng,

232
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,780
infuse the righteous energy
into the Moonlight Phantom,

233
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,630
and it'll become Nature's Blade.

234
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,120
Nature's Blade!

235
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Please wait.

236
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,510
Mother.

237
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,360
Please stop.

238
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,080
Lingfeng,

239
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,360
I know he's committed terrible crimes,

240
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,620
but he's still

241
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,180
Yingdan's biological father.

242
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,220
If you kill him,

243
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,180
you'll carry that pain forever.

244
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,420
Please spare his life.

245
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,180
Why not

246
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,900
lock him up

247
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,100
until he dies?

248
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,380
Lan'er.

249
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,780
You shouldn't be here.

250
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,980
You really shouldn't.

251
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,420
Liu Guang,

252
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,180
tell me.

253
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,060
Why did you kill my nanny?

254
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,380
Back then at the MAA,

255
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,020
I wasn't the chairman,

256
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,260
but I wanted to be.

257
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,140
The GFTA had wealth and power.

258
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,420
With your support,

259
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,780
I was sure I'd win the position.

260
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,340
So, I staged the whole thing.

261
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,260
I had someone kill your nanny,

262
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,380
and then I saved you.

263
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,780
Liu Guang,

264
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,740
you're beyond saving.

265
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,900
I even looked up to you.

266
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,060
I was such a fool.

267
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,780
I know I've committed many crimes.

268
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,020
I deserve to die.

269
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,180
Kill me.

270
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,060
Guang...

271
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,660
Guang,

272
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,700
don't make things worse.

273
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,300
Lan'er,

274
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,660
was I wrong?

275
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,380
Where was I wrong?

276
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,500
I, Liu Guang,

277
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,540
was cast out by the martial world

278
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,940
and hunted by everyone.

279
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,900
I, Wu Guangming,

280
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,900
killed many

281
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,980
for so-called justice.

282
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,780
But do you even understand?

283
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,420
How could peace exist in this world?

284
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,500
When has there been light

285
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,180
in the martial world?

286
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,340
I won't let you lock me up

287
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,460
until I die.

288
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,420
Can you understand?

289
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,620
Enough talk.

290
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,420
Gou Lingfeng, do it.

291
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,060
Guang...

292
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,060
I'll always stay by your side.

293
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,620
Aunt Lan...

294
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,820
Mother!

295
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,260
Lan'er.

296
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,100
Lan'er...

297
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,060
I was wrong.

298
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,340
I was wrong.

299
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,940
I was wrong

300
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,700
for leaving you.

301
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,700
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

302
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,740
Guang...

303
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,140
I'm so tired.

304
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,500
It's okay.

305
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,500
Now,

306
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,340
we

307
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,660
will never

308
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,060
be apart again.

309
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,060
Mother.

310
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,780
Mother...

311
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,900
Mother.

312
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,460
Mother...

313
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,500
Mother...

314
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,780
(Hero Gathering)

315
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,260
For all these years,

316
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,140
the Emperor has been aware
of the power struggle

317
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,980
between Wu Guangming and Eunuch Deng.

318
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,380
But the fact
that Wu Guangming is the leader

319
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,940
of the demonic sect is a surprise.

320
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,020
It doesn't matter.

321
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,300
What matters is the peace
of the martial world

322
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,780
and the stability of the court.

323
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,540
That is the foundation
of Great Xia's lasting peace.

324
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,860
Gou Lingfeng, accept the decree.

325
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,340
By the Mandate of Heaven,

326
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,820
the Emperor decrees:

327
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,660
Mr. Gou Lingfeng is hereby appointed
as General of Pacification

328
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,940
and shall concurrently serve
as Chief of the Inspection Bureaus,

329
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,380
governing the MAA and both bureaus.

330
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,660
The Emperor hereby commands.

331
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,660
Long live the Emperor.

332
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,900
Guards, listen.

333
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,820
Take the criminal away.

334
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,660
Yes.

335
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:00,660
Prince Chang.

336
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,020
You forged the imperial edict.

337
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,120
I demand to see the Emperor.

338
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,420
Godfather.

339
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,780
Lingfeng.

340
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,100
Lingfeng...

341
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,580
- Father.
- Lingfeng.

342
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,420
Father.

343
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,460
How are you?

344
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,900
How are you, Ms. Ma?

345
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,140
Yingdan is safe.

346
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,180
Greetings, Prince Chang.

347
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,100
Gousheng.

348
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,060
Er'niu.

349
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,220
Gousheng.

350
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,820
Deng Er'niu.

351
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,780
I thought I'd never see you again.

352
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,140
You scared me to death.

353
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,820
Alright, alright.

354
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,020
Listen.

355
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,020
Wu Guangming

356
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,180
is actually Liu Guang.

357
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,340
Alright, alright.

358
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,020
It's all in the past.

359
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,940
Everything is in the past.

360
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,140
They do know each other.

361
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,620
Did you come to save me?

362
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,860
Once you're in there,

363
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,100
eat well,

364
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,840
and take care of yourself.

365
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,740
No, I was framed.

366
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,780
- Believe me.
- Alright.

367
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,020
Okay.

368
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,180
Think of Yunfeng.

369
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,380
Godfather.

370
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,140
Godfather...

371
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,620
Don't cry.

372
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,540
You've grown up.

373
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,780
I'm getting old.

374
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,740
The world ahead belongs to the young.

375
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,100
- Godfather.
- Take him away.

376
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,700
- Yunfeng.
- Reflect on yourself.

377
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,540
Yunfeng,

378
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,060
protect yourself.

379
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,580
- Yunfeng.
- Godfather.

380
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,980
General Gou,

381
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,460
you are a true hero
who cares for the people.

382
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,300
I believe you'll do well

383
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,740
as General of Pacification.

384
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,940
Prince Chang,

385
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,900
please wait.

386
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,100
What's wrong?

387
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,020
I have one more request.

388
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,900
What is it?

389
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,940
I ask the Emperor to rescind his edict

390
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,140
and dissolve the MAA.

391
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,980
What?

392
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,060
Why?

393
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,700
Don't you want to serve the Emperor?

394
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,940
I once believed

395
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,220
the MAA stood for heroic spirit.

396
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,020
But I was wrong.

397
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,260
Heroic spirit

398
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,460
is selfless and fearless.

399
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,460
It shouldn't be managed or restrained.

400
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,380
It's a moral code

401
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,260
we in the martial world uphold.

402
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,340
I know the Emperor

403
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,380
wishes for a flourishing nation,

404
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,860
but such prosperity

405
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,220
shouldn't be a gilded illusion.

406
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,940
The Sword Saint once said

407
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,020
when the people are well-off,

408
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,300
have enough to eat and wear,

409
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,460
live without fear or hunger,

410
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,700
leave doors unlocked,

411
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,780
and return lost items,

412
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,060
the martial world will be at peace.

413
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,820
Now, I finally understand

414
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,020
the meaning

415
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,340
of "Justice comes in all forms"

416
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,380
and "Martial arts know no good or evil".

417
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,060
Being a hero isn't a profession.

418
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,500
With kindness in the heart,

419
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,100
anyone can be a hero.

420
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,420
So, I want the Emperor

421
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,980
to dissolve the MAA

422
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,220
and return the martial world

423
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,060
to true heroes.

424
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,620
So,

425
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,900
you wish to be a true hero, huh?

426
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,100
And I want to be

427
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,420
with someone important to me.

428
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,820
Very well.

429
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,460
I'll report to the Emperor

430
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,060
and put in a few kind words for you.

431
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,580
Thank you, Prince Chang.

432
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,900
Father, wait.

433
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,220
What is it, Linglong?

434
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,340
Since you'll be talking to the Emperor,

435
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,580
why not speak

436
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,420
for Deng Yunfeng too?

437
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,140
I wish to join him

438
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,420
in serving the court.

439
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,660
Very well.

440
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,500
Linglong,

441
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,980
I've truly underestimated you.

442
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,820
If not for you,

443
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,940
this chaos

444
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,460
might never have ended.

445
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,380
Deng Yunfeng,

446
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,780
Linglong has spoken her mind.

447
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,020
What do you think?

448
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,180
Well...

449
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,060
I'll think about it.

450
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,940
How indecisive.

451
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,860
(Grave of Later Mother, Ma Linglan)

452
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,700
I shouldn't have been

453
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,940
so disobedient as a child.

454
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,100
Why did you come to Hero's Gathering?

455
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,820
I'll send you more offerings.

456
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:36,900
Yingdan.

457
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,860
- Yingdan.
- Yingdan.

458
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,100
Gou Lingfeng, what are you doing?

459
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,980
Yingdan,

460
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,460
we agreed before.

461
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,200
Stop acting tough.

462
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,140
Right. Listen to Master.

463
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,040
I can do it, Yingdan.

464
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,060
Gou Lingfeng,

465
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,080
however much blood you shed for me,

466
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,500
it's no use.

467
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,380
It is.

468
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,420
No, it's not.

469
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,300
I can't go on.

470
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,180
You can.

471
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,700
You can.

472
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,700
You can.

473
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,300
Do you remember?

474
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,460
I promised you

475
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,860
I wouldn't act tough anymore.

476
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,660
What's that?

477
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,500
This is the pill from Anicca Knight.

478
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,980
What? Yingdan.

479
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,900
- Yingdan.
- Yingdan.

480
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,940
Yingdan, don't.

481
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,860
Gou Lingfeng.

482
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,340
- Gou Lingfeng.
- Yingdan.

483
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,220
You can't take it.

484
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,460
- Yingdan.
- Yingdan.

485
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,300
Gou Lingfeng.

486
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,740
There will be a way.

487
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,660
Believe me, okay?

488
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,280
As long as I'm here,

489
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,720
I won't let anything happen to you.

490
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,760
Gou Lingfeng.

491
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,300
- Yingdan.
- Yingdan.

492
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,660
- Yingdan.
- Dirty, dirty, dirty.

493
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,660
Anicca Knight.

494
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,500
You...

495
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,100
I almost missed it.

496
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,940
Ms. Ma,

497
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,880
the sect leader sent me a letter

498
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,320
with both your blood and his inside.

499
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,820
He asked me to make another antidote.

500
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,860
I've finished it.

501
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,700
Here, here.

502
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,780
Hurry.

503
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,860
Take it.

504
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,420
As long as there's a sliver of hope,

505
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,660
we must try our best

506
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,700
to keep living.

507
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,980
What if the dawn comes?

508
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,820
Right?

509
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,460
The sect leader may have done wrong,

510
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,660
but you are always in his heart.

511
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,900
Hurry and eat it.

512
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,620
I was too extreme before

513
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,060
making all those pills.

514
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,140
Now, I'll focus all my efforts

515
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,580
on finding cures

516
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,100
for terminal illnesses.

517
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,100
Hurry and eat it.

518
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,340
Take it.

519
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,660
Thank you,

520
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,700
Father.

521
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,500
(Notice)
Mr. Zhuge beat the demonic sect.

522
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,740
Sect leaders only use swords
with the Zhuge brand.

523
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,860
What brand is it?

524
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,840
Mr. Zhuge is so young

525
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,020
and has achieved such a merit.

526
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,340
He's truly a young hero.

527
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,200
Congratulations.

528
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,490
- How nice.
- Yes.

529
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,740
You're here.

530
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,740
What took you so long?

531
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,020
We got held up on the road.

532
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,260
Father, we can start now.

533
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,100
Alright.

534
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,700
Let's begin.

535
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,500
(Sword Alliance Trade Association)

536
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,540
How grand.

537
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,740
Great.

538
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,460
- Great.
- Bravo.

539
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,860
- Congratulations.
- Congrats.

540
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,100
Great. Congrats.

541
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,620
- How grand.
- Congratulations.

542
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,580
Congratulations.

543
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,820
Great.

544
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,660
Congratulations.

545
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,620
Thank you.

546
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,100
- How nice.
- It's so loud.

547
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,380
Thank you.

548
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,600
From now on,
you're the lady of Sword Alliance.

549
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,100
Who says I want to be your lady?

550
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,540
Father.

551
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,700
Look.

552
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,580
Young people make mistakes.

553
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,060
Back then, she had no choice.

554
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,140
That's nothing.

555
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,540
Lingfeng's done way worse.

556
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,380
Father.

557
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,340
Gou Lingfeng's name is known

558
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,100
across the martial world.

559
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,140
Without him,
this alliance would've fallen.

560
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,980
Mr. Zhuge,

561
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,540
Heng did all that.

562
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,020
It had nothing to do with me.

563
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,740
- Time to go.
- Alright.

564
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,940
We still have things to do.

565
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,060
- See you.
- Bye.

566
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,820
How nice to be young.

567
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,920
Buns!

568
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,020
(Pork Bun Shop)
Hot buns!

569
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,980
Ma'am, one bun, please.

570
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,300
Sure. Here you go.

571
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,980
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

572
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,820
Sanniang.

573
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,860
The Floral Knight and Hero Gou
are here for buns.

574
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,620
Master says your buns are his favorite.

575
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,380
Come again. Here, take it.

576
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,100
Thank you, Sanniang.

577
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,420
No need to pay.

578
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,580
Here, take this.

579
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,500
- Take it.
- Goodbye.

580
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,280
- Bye.
- Bye.

581
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,800
- Two buns, please.
- That's Hero Gou.

582
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,020
- Here you go.
- Hero Gou also

583
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,240
- bought buns here.
- Thanks.

584
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,640
Hurry. Let's buy some.

585
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,900
Don't run.

586
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,820
He.

587
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,700
He!

588
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,100
You've got the wrong guy.

589
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,380
I'll never steal your buns again.

590
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,460
Alright.

591
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,420
You said it.

592
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,740
Don't come back tomorrow.

593
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,860
Don't ever come back.

594
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,540
Come and get buns.

595
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,060
Hot buns.

596
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,060
Come and get buns.

597
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,660
Hot buns.

598
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,380
Come on.

599
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,140
Delicious and pretty buns.

600
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,740
- Hurry.
- I'll come back.

601
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,220
Sanniang, I'll come back every day.

602
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,900
When was the last time you bathed?

603
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,880
I'll warm up some water for you.

604
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,340
Let me tell you.

605
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,540
What is it?

606
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,000
I bet Master's been waiting for too long

607
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,120
so he's scolding me.

608
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,820
Deng Yunfeng.

609
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,540
Let's call him.

610
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,340
(Qingyu Garden)
He even has flowers.

611
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,300
Wait.

612
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,340
Let's look at this.

613
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,260
(Qingyu Garden)

614
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,740
Your Highness.

615
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,020
I'm here to thank you for saving my life

616
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,820
at Hero Gathering.

617
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,340
So, you see my good side now?

618
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,780
You...

619
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,740
Have you made up your mind?

620
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,100
I...

621
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,540
I think you're great.

622
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,940
Your Highness.

623
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,380
Let's go.

624
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,580
- It's inappropriate.
- Hurry.

625
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,580
It's inappropriate.

626
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,220
Don't worry. It is appropriate.

627
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,820
- I'm going back.
- It's inappropriate.

628
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,320
- Why not come with me?
- It's fine.

629
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,440
Let's make our betrothal official.

630
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,380
Your Highness.

631
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,020
Well, I think

632
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,340
we should take things slow.

633
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,860
They're talking over there.

634
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,140
Easy, not so hard.

635
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,940
Slowly, slowly.

636
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,000
They're kissing.

637
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,180
You always want to slow down.

638
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,060
Take it slow.

639
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,220
(Qingyu Garden)

640
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,060
Your Highness!

641
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,140
Master.

642
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,660
Master.

643
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,980
You fell asleep again?

644
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,180
- Master.
- Master.

645
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,180
Master.

646
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,220
You brat.

647
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,180
You disappeared all day for a bun.

648
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,220
Are you trying to starve me?

649
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,660
I just dropped

650
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,100
by Zhuge's place on the way.

651
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,380
(Jiang's Bun)
Aren't you concerned

652
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,380
about Heng's big day?

653
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,300
It's just a tablet ceremony.

654
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,540
What's the fuss?

655
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,780
When he gets married,

656
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,540
- I'll join the celebration.
- You...

657
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,580
Master.

658
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,140
Don't get mad at him.

659
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,820
Don't argue with Master.

660
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,040
- Whatever Master says is right.
- Fine.

661
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,100
- Master is always right.
- Ms. Ma is a good girl.

662
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,980
Yingdan,

663
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,380
your poison has been cured.

664
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,660
So, when will you

665
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,380
give me a grandchild?

666
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,220
Master's always right.

667
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,540
- You...
- Master's always right.

668
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,660
Stop it.

669
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,500
Loyalty Knight.

670
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,220
Are you home? Loyalty Knight.

671
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,420
No need to look. Go on.

672
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,380
Be careful.

673
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,900
Go on.

674
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,100
- Go on.
- Yingdan.

675
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,020
Master.

676
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,820
I'll bring you back something tasty.

677
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,980
Osmanthus cakes.

678
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,140
That rascal just wants to be a hero.

679
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,020
I like him more and more.

680
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,540
Me too.

681
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,300
I'll get help.

682
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,780
- It's too high.
- Hold onto the tree.

683
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,220
Don't fall.

684
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,300
Gao.

685
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,620
Don't cry.

686
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,780
Who's going to save me?

687
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,300
Look up. What's that?

688
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,020
A bird?

689
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,220
It's glowing.

690
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,900
Look. It's Hero Gou.

691
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,340
Hero Gou is amazing.

692
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,660
Hero Gou, save her.

693
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,500
Gao's going to be okay.

694
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,460
- Hero Gou is awesome.
- The kid's safe.

695
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,940
- You're okay.
- Hero Gou is so cool.

696
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,500
- So cool.
- Thanks, Hero Gou.

697
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,660
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

698
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,460
Thank you, Hero Gou.

699
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,420
Bye.

700
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,060
(The End of Episode 30)

701
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,500
Yingdan.

702
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,900
Lingfeng,

703
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,580
why did you buy so many rabbits?

704
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,220
Are we opening a rabbit shop?

705
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,380
Do you remember Wang Qing
from Sword Alliance?

706
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,700
I remember

707
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,220
you really loved his rabbits.

708
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,500
So, I told Zhuge to buy them all.

709
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,540
Who said that?

710
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,700
Look, they're so cute.

711
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,540
Look.

712
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,340
Look.

713
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,580
Yingdan.

714
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,500
Tell me.

715
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,500
Which one feels softer,

716
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,580
this rabbit or me?

717
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,180
You.

718
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,660
What happened to the turtles I gave you?

719
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,820
I haven't seen them for days.

720
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,420
Master said he'd take care of them.

721
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,060
He loves them.

722
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,100
My master?

723
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,600
Ms. Ma,

724
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,660
didn't you say your turtles

725
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,900
don't bite?

726
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,060
It bit me.

727
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,940
Stop laughing.

728
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,660
Come and help me.

729
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,940
- Master.
- You tricked me.

730
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,820
- Master.
- My finger...

731
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,660
- It only bites him.
- Help me out here.

732
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,460
It hurts.

733
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,820
