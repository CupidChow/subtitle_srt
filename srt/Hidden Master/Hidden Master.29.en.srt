1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,960
Looks like

2
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,600
I won't survive the night.

3
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,120
Master Gui.

4
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,390
Who's calling me?

5
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,240
Master Gui.

6
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,750
I'll take you home to recover.

7
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,920
It's you again?

8
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,840
What trick are you playing this time?

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,350
Gou Lingfeng is nearly brainwashed
by Wu Guangming.

10
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,470
His path has already started
to go astray.

11
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,030
What exactly are you trying to say?

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,840
Wu Guangming was handpicked

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,470
and promoted by my father.

14
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,640
But recently, my father discovered

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,030
he's become devious.

16
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,390
And Gou Lingfeng

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,880
is clearly just his pawn.

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,070
Do you have

19
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,120
liquor and meat?

20
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,310
You won't be disappointed.

21
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,710
Not only liquor and meat,

22
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,480
but also the imperial elixirs.

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,590
They'll help restore your strength.

24
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,550
Alright.

25
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,790
Girl,

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
come,

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,920
help me up.

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,760
Alright.

29
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,840
Here.

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,680
Come on.

31
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,150

(Hero Gathering)

79
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,240
Gou Lingfeng,

80
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,000
what has Wu Guangming done

81
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,480
to make you so loyal to him?

82
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,560
Do you really trust him that much?

83
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
He really went all out.

84
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,830
He got so many people to act
along with you,

85
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,160
all the rigged matches.

86
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,510
If they're rigged or not,

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,310
you can see for yourself.

88
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,480
So you're really willing

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,070
to become a partner in crime
with that scum?

90
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,270
Deng Yunfeng,

91
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,680
you really are full of slander.

92
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,510
My conscience is clear,

93
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,430
I fear neither heaven nor earth.

94
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,630
Then let's see what kind of trick

95
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,630
you've been using to deceive everyone.

96
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,630
I don't believe

97
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,950
you can fight me without

98
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,830
using demonic powers!

99
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,000
Enough talk.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,840
Come at me.

101
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,750
I'll never let the Hero Token

102
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,000
fall into your hands!

103
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,480
Looks like

104
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,390
Deng Yunfeng has been
hiding his strength.

105
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,830
Oh, not at all.

106
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,070
Just some amateur moves,

107
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,830
hardly worthy of your praise.

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,510
You're too modest.

109
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,070
After all these years,

110
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,950
I'd wager most top martial arts scrolls

111
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,830
from every sect are already
in your possession.

112
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,510
You're no worse yourself.

113
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,830
We're both the same.

114
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,000
Let's just watch the match.

115
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,510
The real excitement is still ahead.

116
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,430
Your Highness,

117
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,440
do you...

118
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,960
Your Highness?

119
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,230
Your Highness?

120
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,870
Bravo! Bravo!

121
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,710
Such skill!

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,840
Brilliant moves!

123
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,880
Deng Yunfeng,

124
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,950
stop just powering up!

125
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,190
Are you gonna fight or not?

126
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,160
At least you fight fair,

127
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,720
no sneak attacks.

128
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,920
I suddenly remembered what Yingdan said.

129
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,480
We could create a new martial world

130
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,160
without Eunuch Deng

131
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,680
or Wu Guangming.

132
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,830
Too late

133
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,600
for that now.

134
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,430
Gou Lingfeng!

135
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,190
Watch my blade!

136
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,360
Uncle Wu, what's happening?

137
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,160
I'm just forcibly

138
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,430
altering the nature
of your martial arts.

139
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,750
But the cost

140
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,480
is your internal energy.

141
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,510
So when the time comes,

142
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,720
end it quickly.

143
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,920
Such strong wind.

144
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,520
Don't move.

145
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,040
It's you.

146
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,750
- Don't move!
- Chairman!

147
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,240
- One step and I kill her!
- Chairman, help me!

148
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,080
Chairman!

149
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,150
Don't move!

150
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,040
Chairman!

151
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,720
Save me! Chairman!

152
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,430
What's going on?

153
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,600
Chairman!

154
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,360
The Alchemy Division?

155
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,520
- Chairman!
- Don't move!

156
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,880
Wu Guangming!

157
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,190
You got our Chief and Vice Chief killed!

158
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,440
We're here today for revenge!

159
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,200
One wrong move,

160
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,750
and Liu Sanniang dies!

161
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,790
Revenge?

162
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,840
- Chairman!
- Just the few of you?

163
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,910
At this point,

164
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,840
we no longer fear death.

165
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,480
We'll die with you today!

166
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,870
Don't move!

167
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,080
- Sanniang!
- Bold demonic scum!

168
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,910
- Are you alright?
- How dare you cause trouble here?

169
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,510
Take them away!

170
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,120
- Move!
- Move!

171
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,800
Go!

172
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,200
Wu Guangming,

173
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,320
what game are you playing now?

174
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,320
Eunuch Deng,

175
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,670
those demonic remnants

176
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,510
had infiltrated Huizhou days ago.

177
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,120
Our MAA has already

178
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,750
captured them all.

179
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,240
As for the one who died he mentioned,

180
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,670
he was struck down by He Changzai.

181
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,870
That man had planned to poison me.

182
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,750
Eunuch Deng,

183
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,670
surely you weren't unaware?

184
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,240
Let me remind you,

185
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,080
the Demonic Sect's Alchemy Division.

186
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,390
So it's true.

187
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,790
The assassination attempt

188
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,150
on the Chairman and Changzai

189
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,670
were ordered by Eunuch Deng?

190
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,510
Silence!

191
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,910
Insolent witch,

192
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,080
spouting nonsense!

193
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,150
Deng Yunfeng,

194
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,510
answer me,

195
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,720
the Demonic Sect members tried to

196
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,630
assassinate Prince Chang and captured
by us,

197
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,630
we handed them over to you.

198
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,360
So why are they here today?

199
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,910
Did you really let them go?

200
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,550
Deng Yunfeng,

201
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,790
you once swore to me that you

202
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,600
wanted to create a "new martial world."

203
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,870
If not for the Chairman opening my eyes,

204
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,150
I might've actually believed your lies.

205
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
It's because of

206
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,840
scum like you that the martial world

207
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,320
is in such chaos!

208
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,790
It's not what you think!

209
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,000
Eunuch Deng has controlled

210
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,960
the MAA for years,

211
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,360
secretly harboring demonic remnants

212
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,550
for his own gain.

213
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,200
Deng Yunfeng,

214
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,600
you, a supposed inspector of the MAA,

215
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,840
have in truth been spying on us
from within.

216
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,960
And now

217
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,200
you've ordered demonic remnants

218
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,630
to assassinate our own members!

219
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,750
Eunuch Deng,

220
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,360
are you trying to rule
the martial world?

221
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,200
Gou Lingfeng,

222
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,670
don't believe his one-sided story!

223
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,600
Wu Guangming,

224
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,630
I really underestimated you.

225
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,750
You've hidden yourself well.

226
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,840
Lingfeng,

227
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,440
didn't you always ask me

228
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,670
who killed your nanny?

229
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,080
Eunuch Deng!

230
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,390
Was it you

231
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,200
who ordered the Demonic Sect
to assassinate

232
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,480
the Gou family back then?

233
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,790
You've grown up.

234
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,910
You say I seized control of the MAA,

235
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,600
abused my power,

236
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,920
I admit it.

237
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,550
You say I recruited demonic remnants

238
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,030
to serve the court,

239
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,160
I admit that too.

240
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,670
You say I sent people

241
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,240
to eliminate dissidents,

242
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,630
I'll even admit to that.

243
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,480
But the one thing

244
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,480
I will not admit

245
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,840
is attacking your family

246
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,030
or killing your nanny.

247
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,120
You've done all this evil

248
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,440
and still expect me to spare you?

249
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I never did that.

250
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,840
Because your father and I

251
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,150
go way back.

252
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,150
Your father's name is Gou Yushu, right?

253
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,080
So what if it is?

254
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,360
Yushu and Lingfeng,

255
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,080
such shallow names.

256
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,150
Gousheng should have

257
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,510
read more books.

258
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,910
Did you know

259
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,720
your father was an orphan?

260
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,120
He had no name,

261
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,480
no family.

262
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,600
The villagers called him "Gousheng."

263
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,600
When he was six,

264
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,320
he wandered into our village.

265
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,080
My family took him in.

266
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,030
That's when he had his name,

267
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,320
Gou Yushu.

268
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,670
And my full name

269
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,270
is Deng Er'niu.

270
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,790
Your father always called me "Aniu."

271
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,270
You made up this ridiculous story

272
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,360
just to make me spare you?

273
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,670
Ridiculous?

274
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,670
Then tell me

275
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,750
how did your family

276
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,670
rise to become the richest?

277
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,150
Why has no one dared to touch you?

278
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,840
It was all because of me!

279
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,480
Eunuch Deng,

280
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,630
you really missed your calling

281
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,960
as a storyteller.

282
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,960
Now that his crimes are clear,

283
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,870
I'm revoking Deng Yunfeng's
qualification.

284
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,030
Wu Guangming,

285
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,030
you're far too impatient.

286
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,510
What you've schemed for all this time

287
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,320
is just power, right?

288
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,000
Let me tell you,

289
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,960
you can't touch me today.

290
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,120
Touch me, and it's defying the Emperor.

291
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
And in the end,

292
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,120
you still won't get what you want.

293
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,630
You'll end up a stray dog.

294
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,270
Then let me show you today

295
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,150
whether or not I can touch you.

296
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,270
Imperial decree!

297
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,080
All receive the decree!

298
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,670
By the Mandate of Heaven,

299
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,030
His Majesty decrees:

300
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,630
(Imperial Edict)
Deng Er'niu of Directorate of Ceremonies

301
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,480
has abused his power,

302
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,910
disrupted court affairs,

303
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,670
conspired with the Demonic Sect,

304
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,320
and betrayed the Emperor's trust.

305
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,600
He is hereby stripped of all titles

306
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,870
and shall await further judgment.

307
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,840
Thus decreed.

308
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,320
Prince Chang,

309
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,000
so you and Wu Guangming

310
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,390
were in this together all along!

311
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,870
I dare you!

312
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,510
That's a forged decree!

313
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,630
Forged decree!

314
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,360
Are you trying to defy the throne?

315
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,600
Lingfeng, don't be reckless.

316
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,320
- Godfather!
- Stand down!

317
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,270
I want to see His Majesty!

318
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,320
That's a forged decree!

319
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,440
Wu Guangming, receive the decree.

320
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,790
By the Mandate of Heaven,

321
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,960
His Majesty decrees:

322
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,320
Wu Guangming, Chairman of the MAA,

323
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,790
has embodied the Emperor's will

324
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,120
and vanquished the Demonic Sect,

325
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,270
which greatly pleases me.

326
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,670
From this day forth,

327
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,360
he is appointed
General of Bandit Suppression,

328
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,360
and will head the newly established

329
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,270
Eastern Inspection Division,

330
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,080
overseeing martial matters
within the Great Xia,

331
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,510
supervising the MAA,

332
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,480
and monitoring government officials.

333
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,320
He is granted the right
to report directly to the throne.

334
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,870
Thus decreed.

335
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,840
Long live His Majesty!

336
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Wu Guangming!

337
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,200
You traitor!

338
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,270
You'll die a miserable death!

339
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,200
Deng Yunfeng,

340
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,240
you and Eunuch Deng

341
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,550
have conspired with the Demonic Sect.

342
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,000
The evidence is clear.

343
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,630
Your qualification is revoked.

344
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,030
Take him away!

345
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,390
Yes!

346
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,240
Gou Lingfeng,

347
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,240
you see now?

348
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,030
The light?

349
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,510
And justice?

350
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,270
The one you admired

351
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,480
is a scheming man
with terrifying ambition.

352
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,870
He played a brilliant game.

353
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,910
And we

354
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,240
were all just pawns.

355
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,720
Gou Lingfeng!

356
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,630
Wake up!

357
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,440
Gou Lingfeng!

358
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,080
Lingfeng,

359
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,640
congratulations.

360
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,790
You've taken the championship

361
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,350
and earned the Hero Token.

362
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,920
Chairman,

363
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
(Hero)
I didn't defeat Deng Yunfeng.

364
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,750
This win feels undeserved.

365
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,030
Success is what matters most.

366
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,960
Here, take it.

367
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,700
(Hero)

368
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,920
I now declare,

369
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,640
from this day forth,

370
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,440
Gou Lingfeng

371
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,110
shall be the next Chairman of the MAA.

372
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,400
He will work closely with me

373
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,830
to safeguard

374
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,350
the peace of Great Xia's martial world.

375
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,030
This moment

376
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,350
belongs to you.

377
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,240
Go ahead.

378
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,350
Fellow martial artists,

379
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,160
I never imagined

380
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,030
that I would one day stand here

381
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,400
as Chairman of the MAA.

382
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,400
Ever since I was a kid, I had a dream,

383
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,510
that was to become a great hero.

384
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,640
But I wasn't good-looking,

385
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,640
and was often mistaken
for a Demonic Sect member.

386
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,200
Even so, I never gave up on that dream.

387
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,680
Because I knew

388
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,550
what truly matters

389
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,200
is the heroism in your heart.

390
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,510
Achieving this dream

391
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,880
would've been impossible

392
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,880
without my companions,

393
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,270
without my master,

394
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,550
and without

395
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,720
Chairman Wu's support

396
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,680
every step

397
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,070
of the way.

398
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,440
Today's success

399
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,510
isn't mine alone.

400
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,550
It belongs to all of us.

401
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,070
Let's work together

402
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,440
to build a peaceful

403
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,720
and brand new martial world.

404
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,640
We mustn't let doubts
and misunderstandings

405
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
cloud our path.

406
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,590
Let righteousness and justice

407
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,200
become our only goal.

408
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,550
Divine Sect! Divine Sect! Divine Sect!

409
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,510
Glory to the Sect Chief!

410
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,830
Why are you all here?

411
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,350
Greetings, Sect Chief.

412
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,000
You're the Chairman now.

413
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,030
Reviving the Divine Sect

414
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,510
is finally within reach.

415
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,400
Why are all of you here?

416
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,830
It was the Sect Chief,

417
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,400
no, former chief Liu Guang, who sent us.

418
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,310
The Hero Gathering of the MAA

419
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,880
is about to begin.

420
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,440
If nothing goes wrong,

421
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,030
Gou Lingfeng will win

422
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,790
and become the new Chairman

423
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,720
of the MAA.

424
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,880
When the time comes,

425
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,270
you guys go in disguise,

426
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,680
blend into the crowd,

427
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,550
and when Gou Lingfeng

428
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,590
ascended to the presidency,

429
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,070
you must fully support him

430
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,590
in becoming the new Sect Chief

431
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,830
and reviving the Divine Sect.

432
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,030
Liu Guang?

433
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
That's impossible.

434
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,270
His prediction was spot-on.

435
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,790
We've been oppressed

436
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,920
by the MAA for so long.

437
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,160
Now, finally,

438
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,680
we can live in peace again.

439
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,550
Revive the Divine Sect!

440
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,310
Revive the Divine Sect!

441
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,440
They're the Demonic Sect!

442
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,270
Gou Lingfeng is their leader!

443
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,870
Chairman,

444
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm not!

445
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,640
The battle between good and evil

446
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,030
has raged for centuries.

447
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,350
But evil

448
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,830
can never triumph over justice.

449
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,110
Gou Lingfeng,

450
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,590
as Chairman of the MAA,

451
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,590
you must eliminate them all.

452
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,400
What's going on here, General Wu?

453
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,730
Lingfeng,

454
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,090
I've watched you come this far.

455
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,070
I know your character
better than anyone.

456
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,830
But these remnants of the Demonic Sect

457
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,550
just called you "Sect Chief"

458
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,750
in front of everyone.

459
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,350
There's no way to justify that.

460
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,750
So you must kill them.

461
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,270
It's the only way

462
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,070
to clear yourself of suspicion.

463
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,830
He's right, Gou Lingfeng!

464
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,310
Hurry up and do it!

465
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,870
Wait,

466
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,720
but we didn't do anything!

467
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,830
Chief Gou,

468
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,400
say something for us!

469
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,560
Chairman,

470
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,680
they really are just ordinary folks.

471
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,440
They haven't done anything wrong.

472
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,200
They're good people.

473
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,110
Chairman,

474
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,510
we went to Wulipo to investigate.

475
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,440
They really are just regular villagers.

476
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,480
They didn't plan any rebellion.

477
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,400
They just wanted a peaceful life.

478
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,350
Floral Knight,

479
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,310
they're standing here shouting about

480
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,550
"reviving the Divine Sect",

481
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,200
do they really seem like
ordinary villagers?

482
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,270
Chairman,

483
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,160
there must be some
misunderstanding here.

484
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,080
Lingfeng,

485
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,510
you've come such a long way,

486
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,510
you know best what it took.

487
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,550
Your heart is righteous,

488
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,160
yet you've constantly been mistaken,

489
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,550
mistreated and scorned.

490
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,480
Don't you feel even a little resentment?

491
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,440
Now's your chance to prove yourself,

492
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,590
and your best chance to offer
a token of loyalty

493
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,240
as the new Chairman of the MAA.

494
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,480
Lingfeng.

495
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,200
Chairman,

496
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,350
these people

497
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,960
can't be killed.

498
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,800
Lingfeng,

499
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,680
these people are notorious

500
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,030
throughout the martial world.

501
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,640
Killing them is justice.

502
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,310
After this,

503
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,880
no more Demonic Sect.

504
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,590
That'll bring peace.

505
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,110
No!

506
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,000
Lingfeng,

507
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,640
if you don't have the heart to do it,

508
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,720
I'll do it for you.

509
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,560
Stop!

510
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,720
They're just innocent civilians!

511
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,270
They are survivors

512
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,270
of that great tragedy years ago.

513
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,790
They've suffered so much

514
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,640
just trying to find a peaceful home.

515
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,550
My master may seem greedy,

516
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,030
but he used all his money

517
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,110
to take care of these people.

518
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,270
They're his family.

519
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,640
They've done nothing wrong.

520
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,720
They only came here

521
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,400
because Liu Guang deceived them.

522
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,110
Why must you kill them

523
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,590
and use their lives

524
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,200
to build my reputation?

525
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,160
Is that fair?

526
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,180
Gou Lingfeng,

527
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,240
don't throw away your future.

528
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,400
The kind of hero I want to be

529
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,960
isn't this kind.

530
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,310
Gou Lingfeng!

531
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,240
If

532
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,000
I have to do these things

533
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,830
just to be Chairman of the MAA,

534
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,590
then I don't want

535
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,860
this Hero Token.

536
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,740
(Hero)

537
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,960
The Divine Sect robe?

538
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,830
Ever since I learned my master

539
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,310
taught me demonic techniques,

540
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,720
I never listened to him again.

541
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,240
But this time,

542
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,200
I've decided to follow him.

543
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,790
Gou Lingfeng,

544
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,110
you've disappointed me deeply.

545
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,680
The bright sky has perished.

546
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,350
The long night is coming.

547
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,680
I shall follow my path

548
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,160
to embrace the new beginning.

549
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,310
I, Gou Lingfeng, hereby

550
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,070
assume the title of Chief
of the Great Evolution.

551
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,510
I ask all members of the sect

552
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,200
to stand united.

553
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,310
We will not kill the innocent.

554
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,640
But we will not

555
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,720
allow ourselves to be trampled.

556
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,830
Great Evolution stands forever.

557
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,920
The sacred flame burns eternal.

558
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,200
May the Sect Chief's glory

559
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,070
shine through the ages.

560
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,270
We pledge ourselves

561
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,270
to our Sect Chief!

562
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,000
Silence, all of you!

563
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,400
I am Wu Guangming,

564
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,790
General of Bandit Suppression

565
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,240
and Officer of the EID!

566
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,110
Guards!

567
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,950
Here!

568
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,350
Kill them all.

569
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,240
Leave no one alive.

570
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,080
No!

571
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,000
Sect Chief!

572
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,080
Hu San'er!

573
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,150
Hu San'er!

574
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,590
Sect Chief...

575
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,070
He... he's a bad man.

576
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,880
You...

577
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,590
You have to protect everyone.

578
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,000
We just want...

579
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,310
We just want to live in peace.

580
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,520
We all

581
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,110
believe in you...

582
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,520
Hu San'er!

583
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,430
Hu San'er!

584
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,110
Master!

585
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,560
Grandpa!

586
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,590
Grandpa, I'm here!

587
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,390
Ling'er!

588
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,320
Ling'er!

589
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,520
Are you okay?

590
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,640
Ling'er, are you alright?

591
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,200
Heng,

592
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,550
I'm sorry.

593
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,160
It's my fault.

594
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,790
I thought

595
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,680
I could protect you all.

596
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,030
Yingdan and Mr. Gou

597
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,510
treated me like family,

598
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,640
but I ended up hurting everyone.

599
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,840
And me?

600
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,560
Ling'er,

601
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,070
what about us?

602
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,960
Was it real or not?

603
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,240
It was real.

604
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,720
All of it was real, Heng.

605
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,070
This whole time,

606
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,680
I was torn.

607
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,240
I thought,

608
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,750
my godfather would never hurt you,

609
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,350
but something felt wrong.

610
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,720
I kept debating

611
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,590
whether to tell you everything,

612
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,040
but

613
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,720
I didn't dare defy his orders.

614
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,350
Godfather?

615
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,680
Wu Guangming is your godfather?

616
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,200
When Father and I first came
to Huizhou City,

617
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,070
it was hard to make a living

618
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,550
just the two of us.

619
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,310
He helped us

620
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,750
open the Beauty Salon

621
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,790
and asked martial artists
to look after our business.

622
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,350
That's how we survived.

623
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,750
He...

624
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,830
he's our benefactor.

625
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
I understand now.

626
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,750
No wonder He Changzai kept urging

627
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,880
my master and me to get our faces done.

628
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,240
I've always been sickly since childhood.

629
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,750
No one wanted to play with me.

630
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,790
I thought

631
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,200
if I was more obedient,

632
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,720
more useful,

633
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,640
then maybe people would accept me.

634
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,440
But after meeting all of you,

635
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,070
you treated me like family.

636
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,640
Especially you, Heng.

637
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,030
Ever since I first saw you,

638
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,590
I liked you.

639
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,480
But now,

640
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,830
I've let everyone down.

641
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,480
Silly girl,

642
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,550
I believe you.

643
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,240
I believe

644
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,560
my master

645
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,880
and Yingdan

646
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,590
would not blame you either.

647
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,790
Really?

648
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,480
Really.

649
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,960
But I hope

650
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,830
you'll believe in me too.

651
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,000
Whatever happens, tell me.

652
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,200
Let's face it together.

653
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,430
Alright?

654
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,160
Silly girl.

655
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,520
Grandpa?

656
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,400
Let's go.

657
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,240
Retreat! Retreat!

658
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,790
Even though I don't like you,

659
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,830
I can't stand watching

660
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,200
that guy slaughter innocent people

661
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,400
on my father's land.

662
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,840
Girl,

663
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,270
you're smart.

664
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,440
If not for you,

665
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,400
my grandson wouldn't have

666
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,550
made it out alive tonight.

667
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,270
It's all because of him.

668
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,280
Wu Guangming!

669
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,270
You tried to silence everyone!

670
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,680
Linglong, stop talking nonsense.

671
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,920
The situation is settled.

672
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,240
You... you better not act rashly.

673
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,110
Father,

674
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,680
your way of dealing with people

675
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,030
doesn't work on Wu Guangming.

676
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,310
Just sit back and watch.

677
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,200
Trust me.

678
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,040
Be good.

679
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,510
Back when

680
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,590
Wang Zipeng and I

681
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,070
were investigating
the Puppet Knight case,

682
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,110
we discovered He Changzai

683
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,790
was acting under Wu Guangming's orders.

684
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,030
That's why he was so desperate

685
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,750
to execute the Puppet Knight
on the spot.

686
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,200
I knew then

687
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,030
your identity was suspicious.

688
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,750
And after digging deeper,

689
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,200
just as I suspected,

690
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,750
behind it all

691
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,640
was Wu Guangming.

692
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,150
No,

693
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,790
the former leader of the Demonic Sect,

694
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,960
Liu Guang!

695
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,080
Liu Guang!

696
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,480
You hypocritical monster!

697
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,330
Self-righteous fraud!

698
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,240
You dared lecture me?

699
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,350
You're finished.

700
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,510
I'm writing ten exposés on you!

701
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,750
You're done for.

702
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,790
Your name will live in infamy forever.

703
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,000
You're finished.

704
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,200
- Godfather!
- Ling'er!

705
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,480
Why would you do this to us?

706
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,000
Godfather!

707
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,070
Why?

708
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,830
Gou Lingfeng,

709
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,270
did you hear that?

710
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,240
She called me "Godfather."

711
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,270
Then why are you doing this to me?

712
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,030
If I hadn't taken you two in,

713
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,790
you and your father would've
starved to death.

714
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,590
I treated you as my daughter,

715
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,270
raised you with care,

716
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,030
fed and clothed you.

717
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,070
And now, you

718
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,240
want to run away?

719
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,270
If you stand in my way,

720
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,070
then you'll have to die.

721
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,750
You jerk!

722
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,000
I really regret

723
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,750
being soft-hearted back then.

724
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,350
I should've had that Puppet Knight
die with you!

725
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,310
You monster!

726
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,160
Ling'er treated you
like her real father,

727
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,960
followed your every word,

728
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,160
and you just used her like a pawn,

729
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,920
then threw her away!

730
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,550
Who in this world isn't a pawn?

731
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,160
I used her

732
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,480
because she was still useful.

733
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,510
But some people

734
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,480
are pawns and don't even know it.

735
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,750
How pathetic is that?

736
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,150
Guards!

737
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,320
- Here!
- Here!

738
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,240
Bring Lord Deng over.

739
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,430
- Yes!
- Yes!

740
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,510
Zhuge,

741
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,000
you should really be thanking me.

742
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,680
If it weren't for me,

743
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,240
how could you two
have ended up together?

744
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,030
Liu Guang,

745
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,030
so it was you!

746
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,070
It was always you.

747
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,110
You wore a mask

748
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,720
for over twenty years.

749
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,000
Do you even remember who you are?

750
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,920
You could even harm your own people!

751
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,640
You're worse than a beast!

752
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,350
Liu Guang,

753
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,270
I know you're not who you used to be,

754
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,550
but I never thought,

755
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,590
you'd hide this deep.

756
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,640
You really saw all of us

757
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,000
as pieces on your chessboard.

758
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,270
These people

759
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,830
once fought and bled at your side,

760
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,830
yet you had no mercy slaughtering them?

761
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,760
Yingdan.

762
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,120
Yingdan.

763
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,200
Liu Guang,

764
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,840
so you always knew?

765
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,800
You knew I was in the MAA

766
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
and that my mother and I existed?

767
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,200
Yingdan,

768
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,070
believe me.

769
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,150
Trust your father.

770
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,110
Once this is all over,

771
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,710
I'll make it up to you
and your mother tenfold.

772
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,710
You're not fit to be my father.

773
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,670
You're not even fit to be
my mother's husband.

774
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,680
Yingdan,

775
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,280
I had no choice.

776
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,840
That night,

777
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,630
our Divine Sect was destroyed.

778
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,510
Do you know what it's like

779
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,710
to watch your closest loved ones,

780
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,190
your dearest friends,

781
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,510
die in front of you?

782
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,760
To protect you and your mother,

783
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,480
I had to change identities
and hide away,

784
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,550
waiting for the right time
to rise again.

785
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,480
You may not understand now,

786
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,110
but one day,

787
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,670
you will.

788
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,070
- Let me go!
- Gou Lingfeng!

789
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,920
A bright future lies ahead for you.

790
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,110
You like Yingdan, right?

791
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,550
I can marry her to you.

792
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,920
From now on,

793
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,150
you and I can rule the martial world
together.

794
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,440
Wouldn't that be grand?

795
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,720
Gou Lingfeng!

796
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,670
You can't agree!

797
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,000
You can't!

798
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,630
If you do, it's over between us!

799
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,510
Gou Lingfeng!

800
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,760
Gou Lingfeng!

801
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,230
If you still stand by my side,

802
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,150
everything

803
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,400
can be forgiven.

804
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,280
Otherwise,

805
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,920
I'll make sure you're doomed eternally.

806
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,230
Mr. Gou!

807
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,440
Don't believe him!

808
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,590
He's been using me to deceive you!

809
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
This mask belonged to Liu Guang.

810
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,630
My father asked me to give you
before he died.

811
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,230
He wanted to tell you the truth.

812
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,920
But I was blinded by Wu Guangming

813
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,550
and hid it away.

814
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,360
I've wandered with Ling'er
for many years.

815
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,030
This time, we may not escape.

816
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,590
Then tell me, back then,

817
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,320
did you collude with the Demonic Sect?

818
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,960
This world isn't as black-and-white

819
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,320
as you think.

820
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,710
What happened back then was complicated.

821
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,710
So did you, or didn't you?

822
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,710
I only helped a wrong person.

823
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,110
Gou Lingfeng, think carefully.

824
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,230
Gou Lingfeng!

825
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,070
You cannot agree!

826
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,000
Be the kind of hero you believe in!

827
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,920
I'll survive, don't worry about me!

828
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,880
- Yingdan!
- Yingdan!!

829
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,720
Yingdan!

830
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,760
You...

831
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,760
I've said it before,

832
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,840
the kind of hero I want to be

833
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,070
isn't this kind.

834
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,430
Ling'er.

835
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,150
Thank you, my lady.

836
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,380
(The End of Episode 29)

837
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:03,990
Who's there?

838
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,070
Old Sect Chief?

839
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,200
Liu Guang.

840
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,800
Why are you still here?

841
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:11,800
Don't even ask.

842
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,880
I got drunk last night

843
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,150
and passed out here!

844
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,000
What...

845
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,550
What's going on out there?

846
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,120
Old Sect Chief,

847
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,360
listen to me.

848
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,280
You stay right here,

849
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,230
don't come out until everything's

850
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,280
quiet out there.

851
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,150
Then what about you?

852
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,880
Don't worry about me.

853
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,800
I'm going down with the ship!

854
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,000
Old Sect Chief,

855
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,710
the revival of the Divine Sect

856
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,550
will be your mission.
