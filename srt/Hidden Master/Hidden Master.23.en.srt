1
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,590
Chairman.

2
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,030
Gou Lingfeng

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,830
is provoking the other side like this,

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,870
yet they haven't made a move at all.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,550
I have a bad feeling about this.

6
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,440
The Hero Gathering is about to start.

7
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,440
We can't afford any disruptions now.

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,960
Let's just stick with inaction.

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,560
What worries me the most
is Gou Lingfeng.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,710
He's too full of himself.

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,150
Keep an eye on him for me.

12
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,280
Make sure no one uses him.

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,520
Yes,

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,390
I'll assign people to shadow him daily.

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,030

We'll handle things

as they come.

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,680
- You two aren't asleep yet?
- Master.

66
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,120
Come, come,

67
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,960
sit.

68
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
You were really impressive today,
Master.

69
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,120
All for the good of the MAA.

70
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,710
For the MAA!

71
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,120
Something's off.

72
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,840
He's acting weird.

73
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,750
Master, where's that heroic aura
of yours?

74
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,280
Why do you seem

75
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,310
so corrupt now?

76
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,680
You ungrateful disciple!

77
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,960
That's blasphemy!

78
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,800
I'm like a lotus, pure despite the mud.

79
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,400
And who exactly are you calling "mud"?

80
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,280
At least you're not too dumb,

81
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,150
you can still understand sarcasm.

82
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,550
Lingfeng,

83
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,430
do you really think what you're doing
is right?

84
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,750
Of course.

85
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,560
I'm just serving the MAA.

86
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,710
Serving the MAA?

87
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,280
Then why are you always targeting
Deng Yunfeng?

88
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,120
Yeah.

89
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,710
He is annoying, sure.

90
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,000
But aren't you

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,520
sticking your nose

92
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,680
way too far into

93
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,120
his constable business?

94
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,520
- I...
- Lingfeng,

95
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,400
don't you realize

96
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,030
you're being used by Wu Guangming?

97
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,400
You've become a pawn

98
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,150
in his power struggle with Eunuch Deng.

99
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,990
I...

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,080
Aren't you two

101
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,950
the most important people to me?

102
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,270
Why are you

103
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,240
suddenly taking Deng Yunfeng's side?

104
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,640
And Yingdan,

105
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,510
how could you say that
about the Chairman?

106
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,630
Chairman Wu is upright and honorable.

107
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,480
He's fighting against Deng for justice,

108
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,630
putting in so much effort.

109
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,190
How can you slander him like that?

110
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,240
- I...
- Master, snap out of it!

111
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,000
You're bewitched!

112
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,750
You've all seen how rough my path
has been

113
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,000
toward becoming a true hero.

114
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,800
Now that I've finally earned
everyone's recognition,

115
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,190
are you really going to throw
cold water on me?

116
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,310
The path of a hero?

117
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,510
Master,

118
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,120
take a good look at yourself.

119
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,360
Are you still on that path?

120
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,630
Why wouldn't I be?

121
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,870
Now I have the right timing,

122
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,830
the right place,

123
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,000
and the support of the people.

124
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,160
Winning the Hero Token,

125
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,070
achieving my dream

126
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,160
is within reach.

127
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,800
Support of the people?

128
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,720
You mean all those people
who just flatter you?

129
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,950
You don't understand.

130
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,470
Zhuge,

131
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,190
what are you doing?

132
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,320
Forget it.

133
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,600
Wait, how can you let it go?

134
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,440
Yingdan,

135
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,560
is this really the same

136
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,600
Gou Lingfeng you once liked?

137
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,870
Stop trying to drive a wedge between us!

138
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,600
Look at yourself, drunk on success.

139
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,430
Drunk on success?

140
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,800
You're just jealous

141
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,270
that the people of Huizhou love me now!

142
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,710
Yes,

143
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,600
I've earned their hearts.

144
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,240
I've made a bit of progress.

145
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,240
But the Chairman values me

146
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,000
because of my sense of justice
and chivalry.

147
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,720
You don't have to feel discouraged.

148
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,800
If you work hard,

149
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,070
one day you can be like me...

150
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,360
If you truly believe what you're doing
is right,

151
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,000
then I'd rather not have you
as my master.

152
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,430
Zhuge!

153
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,270
You brat!

154
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,160
You're only saying this

155
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,070
because the All-Around Knight
didn't agree

156
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,360
to recommend your Sword Alliance!

157
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,240
That All-Around Knight? He's nothing!

158
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,630
If I were the one recommending you,

159
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,360
the result would be way better!

160
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,070
With my martial arts now,

161
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,630
he wouldn't even last one move!

162
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,430
Gou Lingfeng,

163
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,560
do you hear yourself right now?

164
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,240
I'm just speaking the truth!

165
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,630
You're out of your mind!

166
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,470
I...

167
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,120
I'm done talking to you two.

168
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,700
(Guests Flock Like Clouds)

169
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,120
Heng!

170
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,680
Heng!

171
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,070
Heng, stop drinking!

172
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,720
Why have you had so much?

173
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,870
Ling'er, where were you?

174
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,160
I went around to some swordsmiths.

175
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,390
I wanted to see if I could help
the Sword Alliance.

176
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,360
But unfortunately...

177
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,870
Ling'er, you're the best.

178
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,950
Heng, you drank way too much.

179
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,590
Don't worry.

180
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,070
We'll figure something out.

181
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,270
Everything will be okay.

182
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,270
You don't know, Gou Lingfeng,

183
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,240
he's changed so much.

184
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,160
Mr. Gou has been through a lot recently.

185
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,240
We should give him some time.

186
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,190
Nonsense.

187
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,430
He's just chasing pleasure and vanity.

188
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,260
Fine.

189
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,270
So what if he's surrounded

190
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,120
by girls fawning over him every day?

191
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,950
I get it.

192
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,120
When someone suddenly gets
that much attention,

193
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,800
they're bound to lose themselves in it.

194
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
But him?

195
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,680
He pushes others aside,

196
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,270
fakes his image.

197
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,830
This isn't the Gou Lingfeng I know!

198
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,800
He's not you.

199
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,560
We can't control what others think.

200
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,390
But it still hurts.

201
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,120
We "Zhu Gou Team"

202
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,310
might not have

203
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,160
solved any earth-shaking cases,

204
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,510
but we've been through

205
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,950
so much together.

206
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,950
I really saw him as my best friend.

207
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,510
My dad always said,

208
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,950
if I can help people live better lives,

209
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,270
they won't be so bothered

210
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,560
by all the ugliness around them.

211
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,310
Yeah, I get it.

212
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,830
The world's dangerous.
People are unpredictable.

213
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,120
But no matter how many bad people
there are,

214
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,150
we can't let ourselves become
one of them.

215
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,120
We have to hold on to the light
in our hearts.

216
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,440
We can never end up like that fool.

217
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,320
Ling'er, don't worry.

218
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,120
No matter what happens,

219
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,790
I won't change.

220
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,670
I believe you.

221
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,820
(Huizhou City)

222
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,700
Come and see!

223
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,670
(A Shocking Duel Between
Loyalty and All-Around)

224
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,120
They're gonna fight?

225
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,790
No way!

226
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,030
Lingfeng!

227
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,000
- Okay! Okay! Yeah!
- Lingfeng!

228
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,840
Lingfeng!

229
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,910
Look! Look!

230
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,840
Lingfeng!

231
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,960
Lingfeng!

232
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,600
I adore you so much!

233
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,080
How did you pull this off?

234
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,960
Yeah!

235
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
We're all coming to watch you fight!

236
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,600
- We're all cheering for you!
- Okay.

237
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,550
Be happy!

238
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,720
Smile, Lingfeng!

239
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,570
Be happy!

240
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,430
- Go for it!
- You will win!

241
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,670
We believe in you!

242
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Yingdan.

243
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,840
Why haven't you gone to bed?

244
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,080
Where are Zhuge Heng and Ling'er?

245
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,440
They've gone to the Sword Alliance.

246
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,710
Sit down.

247
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,560
Let's talk.

248
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,440
Yes.

249
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,870
It's been a while since we talked.

250
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,630
Yingdan,

251
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,670
you know,

252
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,280
I'm

253
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,390
a recognized hero now.

254
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,600
Everyone admires me.

255
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,080
The Chairman,

256
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,870
Wu Guangming,

257
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,440
Gou Lingfeng.

258
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,510
treats me like his right hand.

259
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,840
He's even given me an important task:

260
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,200
we're going to take down Eunuch Deng!

261
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,320
Yingdan,

262
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,320
I'm really,

263
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,600
really happy.

264
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,510
Gou Lingfeng,

265
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,790
I don't want to hear

266
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,150
any more of your empty talk.

267
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yingdan...

268
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,230
I'm leaving.

269
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,910
I hope once I'm gone,

270
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,440
you'll come to your senses.

271
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,280
Yingdan!

272
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,750
Yingdan,

273
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,480
don't go.

274
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,910
I'll

275
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,270
prove it to you.

276
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,320
Tomorrow,

277
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,390
I'll duel the All-Around Knight.

278
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,390
And I'll win the Hero Token.

279
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,270
I want you

280
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,120
to watch me build

281
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,150
a new martial world.

282
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,910
A new martial world?

283
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,120
With what?

284
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,000
With sycophants

285
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,960
and flatterers?

286
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,560
No,

287
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,720
not at all!

288
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,150
Then I'll give you two choices:

289
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
come with me,

290
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,720
or I go alone.

291
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,630
Yingdan,

292
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,630
I can't leave.

293
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,150
I'm one step away

294
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,390
from success.

295
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,510
I can't give up.

296
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,960
I can't give up.

297
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,270
I won't give up.

298
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,600
Gou Lingfeng.

299
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,480
Do you remember what you once

300
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,960
told me your dream was?

301
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,870
Of course.

302
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,080
My dream to become a great hero.

303
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,150
It's about to come true!

304
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,320
And?

305
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,270
That's it.

306
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,150
I like you.

307
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,960
Gou Lingfeng, you...

308
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,030
I just wanted you to know:

309
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,390
aside from

310
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,630
being a hero,

311
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,600
I've had one other dream.

312
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,910
That is to see you happy.

313
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,510
And if it's possible,

314
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,270
I want to be by your side

315
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,150
every single day.

316
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,270
Gou Lingfeng,

317
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,030
even if you succeed,

318
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,670
you'll never be

319
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,480
the Gou Lingfeng I once loved.

320
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,720
Yingdan.

321
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,110
I'm leaving.

322
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,270
Don't go.

323
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,030
- Let go.
- Yingdan!

324
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,870
Let go.

325
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,080
Let go.

326
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,390
Let go.

327
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,390
Go then.

328
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,510
All of you, just go.

329
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,790
None of you understand me.

330
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,720
None of you.

331
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,800
Leave.

332
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,240
Go on, leave!

333
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,600
Everyone, leave!

334
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,270
I am a hero.

335
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,390
I am a hero.

336
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,120
I am a hero!

337
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,680
Yingdan!

338
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,200
Yingdan!

339
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,320
Yingdan!

340
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,160
Lingfeng!

341
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,990
Get up!

342
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,840
Your body...

343
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,270
Did Gou Lingfeng hurt you?

344
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,390
I saw it.

345
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,150
Gou Lingfeng is challenging
the All-Around Knight.

346
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,390
He's always chasing nonsense.

347
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,750
You don't need to tell me.

348
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,200
From now on, anything about him

349
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,750
has nothing to do with me.

350
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,680
I'm leaving.

351
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,840
You... you're going back

352
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,510
to the Poison Valley?

353
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
Yes, I am.

354
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,720
I'll go with you.

355
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,470
No need.

356
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,350
Yingdan,

357
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,720
since I've come back,

358
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,510
I won't let you face everything
alone again.

359
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,560
Let go.

360
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,750
Not this time.

361
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,680
Let go!

362
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,320
Leave now!

363
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,640
I want to go with you.

364
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,920
- Let go!
- Yingdan.

365
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,720
- Yingdan!
- Little Stone.

366
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,920
Let me go with you.

367
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,350
Let go!

368
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,560
Little Stone!

369
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,920
Little Stone

370
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,200
wants to stay with you.

371
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,950
I'm scared

372
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,590
that I won't be able to find you again.

373
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,480
Remember to take your pills.

374
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,880
Don't follow me.

375
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,390
Yingdan!

376
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,630
Yingdan!

377
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,480
- Yingdan!
- Let go!

378
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,000
Yingdan!

379
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,320
Yingdan!

380
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,160
I am sorry.

381
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,860
(Huizhou Drill Ground)

382
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,620
All-Around Knight! All-Around Knight!

383
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,060
(Loyalty Meets All-Around—
A Great Battle)

384
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,460
(Loyalty Knight vs. All-Around Knight—
A Peak Duel in the Martial World)

385
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,160
Lingfeng, rise!

386
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,830
Loyalty soars to the sky!

387
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,400
Lingfeng, rise!

388
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,680
Loyalty soars to the sky!

389
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,310
All-Around, unbeatable!

390
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,960
Justice forever!

391
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,440
All-Around, unbeatable!

392
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,030
- Lower your voices!
- Justice forever!

393
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,640
All-Around, unbeatable!

394
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,830
Justice forever!

395
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,270
Alright, alright, great!

396
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,160
I am Wang Zipeng

397
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,590
from the Martial World
Storytelling House!

398
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,590
Today is Loyalty Knight vs.
All-Around Knight!

399
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,510
A Tiger-rank challenging a Dragon-rank!

400
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,590
Is it suicide or total domination?

401
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,830
Let's find out!

402
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,550
I declare the match officially begun!

403
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,680
Go, All-Around Knight!

404
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,550
Go, Loyalty Knight!

405
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,270
Alright! The match is on!

406
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:48,200
Loyalty Knight! Loyalty Knight!

407
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,030
Both heroes are unleashing
their full aura!

408
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,350
Don't blink!

409
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,240
This is a moment you don't want to miss!

410
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,200
It's on, it's on!

411
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,400
Two steps back.

412
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,920
Two steps back?

413
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,030
Another two steps.

414
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,030
Another two steps?

415
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,280
Why is that?

416
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,110
All-Around Knight! All-Around Knight!

417
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,900
What are you doing?

418
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,920
Thanks! Thank you!

419
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,680
Thank you!

420
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,520
Wait,

421
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,440
what's going on?

422
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,350
What is happening?

423
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,490
All-Around Knight!

424
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,560
Thank you all!

425
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,350
Thank you so much!

426
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,270
The winner is the All-Around Knight!

427
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,550
They didn't even start!

428
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,510
The fight hasn't even begun!

429
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,350
What is this?

430
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,350
His aura was just too convincing.

431
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,240
All-Around Knight!

432
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,440
I've achieved all this

433
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,920
thanks to everyone here!

434
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,640
- All-Around Knight!
- Without you...

435
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,280
All-Around Knight, the fight is on.

436
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,000
Throw a move already.

437
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,920
Are they fighting or not?

438
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
They're wasting our time!

439
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,800
All-Around Knight!

440
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,030
You're the best!

441
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,960
Go get him!

442
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,640
Go, All-Around Knight!

443
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,890
- It's all for show.
- You've got this!

444
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,730
Of course he'll win!

445
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,590
Both heroes are fully charged up.

446
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,790
Don't blink now!

447
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,790
This flute tune

448
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,510
doesn't carry any inner force.

449
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,200
It's just a pure music solo?

450
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,310
You All-Around Knight loves
smoke and mirrors!

451
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,310
If you can't fight,
then just get off the stage!

452
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,440
He is just pretending to be good.

453
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,920
I really didn't expect this.

454
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,680
You, a Dragon-rank hero,

455
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,400
actually coming to me for help.

456
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,560
Well, it's like this.

457
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,920
These past years,

458
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,070
I've focused on helping the poor

459
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,550
and promoting the spirit of chivalry,

460
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,400
so I'm constantly exhausted.

461
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,510
For this match with Gou Lingfeng,

462
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,920
I'd like to ask for your help.

463
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,680
To be honest,

464
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,240
I've got support

465
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,440
from all over Great Xia, all the states,

466
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,440
counties, even major guilds.

467
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,880
Even if I lose to Gou Lingfeng,

468
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,440
it won't affect me at all.

469
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,200
The thing is

470
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,550
I don't know martial arts.

471
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,720
I can't fight.

472
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,520
What?

473
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,310
You don't know martial arts?

474
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,550
A Dragon-rank hero doesn't know
martial arts?

475
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,350
That's why I want you to help me

476
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,030
in sparing with Gou Lingfeng.

477
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,440
Just show up as my disciple.

478
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,920
So all you

479
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,440
Dragon-rank heroes are like this?

480
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,160
We went through professional training.

481
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,200
Why should I help you?

482
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,240
I can get you the official endorsement

483
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,160
for the sword used
at the Hero Gathering.

484
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,640
Once it's done,

485
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,920
I'll become the spokesperson
for Sword Alliance products.

486
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,640
Think about it,

487
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,270
with my name behind your brand,

488
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,270
even if the prices are sky-high,

489
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,200
they'll still be sold out.

490
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,680
Shameless.

491
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,080
What do you say?

492
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,310
Impressive.

493
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,310
I heard

494
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,790
that Gou Lingfeng's gotten
really annoying.

495
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,440
A lot of people want to teach him
a lesson.

496
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,440
Besides,

497
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,400
this isn't the first time
you've done something

498
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,550
dishonorable or disgraceful.

499
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,520
Fine.

500
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,910
Deal.

501
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,310
Just kidding.

502
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,630
You fight him yourself.

503
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,510
What a joke.

504
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,440
Dragon-rank hero.

505
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,720
Rude.

506
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,350
Uncouth.

507
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,590
All-Around Knight is moving!

508
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,430
He's making a move!

509
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,400
Loyalty Knight's responding!

510
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,660
(Two hours later)

511
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,940
(Huizhou Drill Ground)

512
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,920
Seriously, you two "heroes",

513
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,110
can you at least move a little?

514
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,880
(Wang Zipeng, you are my enemy now!)

515
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,030
Just standing there

516
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,270
ruins your reputation.

517
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,400
(Wang Zipeng, shut up now!)

518
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,720
Even with my eyes closed,

519
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,960
you're still no match for me.

520
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,110
I don't even open them

521
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,680
during this whole match.

522
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,000
Well said.

523
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,830
(Alright.)

524
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,790
(I moved.)

525
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,680
(Don't come over here!)

526
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,510
This way, they can't even
see each other.

527
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,440
Yeah, now it's blind fighting.

528
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,110
(He actually tried to sneak attack me?)

529
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,830
(Good thing I could feel the wind
from his punch!)

530
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,270
- Nice one!
- Yeah!

531
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,920
(Master was right.)

532
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,960
(When I close my eyes,
my senses sharpen.)

533
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,030
(So you closed your eyes
to ambush me, huh?)

534
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,350
I hereby declare today's match over!

535
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,720
Both heroes displayed deep inner force

536
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,440
in an intense psychic showdown!

537
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,550
Let's call it a draw!

538
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,800
Great!

539
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,030
I didn't get it at all,

540
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,240
but it was amazing!

541
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,510
No wonder they're heroes.

542
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,200
We didn't understand a thing.

543
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,310
Yeah, same.

544
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,680
(All-Around Knight really
is a powerful opponent.)

545
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,200
(What?)

546
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,790
(What just happened?)

547
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,350
Loyalty Knight,

548
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,440
well played.

549
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,310
You too.

550
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,310
As members of the MAA,
we shouldn't really

551
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,720
fight among ourselves.

552
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,070
Exactly.

553
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,310
I, Gou...

554
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,960
I mean, Loyalty Knight, agree.

555
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,590
We should all get along.

556
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,720
No more fighting.

557
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,350
All that fighting has no point at all.

558
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
Let's just...

559
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,790
Why are you up here?

560
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,030
Zhuge?

561
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,070
What are you doing?

562
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,070
Mr. Zhuge,

563
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,640
the match is already over.

564
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,070
If you've changed your mind

565
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,550
and want to fight in my place...

566
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,960
Wait, Zhuge...

567
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,270
A fight between them?

568
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,030
They were once master and disciple,

569
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,550
and now they're enemies!

570
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,550
Is this the twist of human nature or...

571
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,680
Oh the human nature!

572
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,680
I declare the real match begins now!

573
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,310
You look sharp, Master Gou.

574
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,750
Let me explain! Okay?

575
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,960
I just want to ask one thing:

576
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,920
Where's Yingdan?

577
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,320
Wait, you...

578
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,320
A real fight! Go, go, go!

579
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,200
This punch

580
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,440
is for Yingdan.

581
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,280
She loved you so much,

582
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,270
and you let her down.

583
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,480
This punch

584
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,680
is for my grandfather.

585
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,960
He nurtured you with care,

586
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,070
but you kept disappointing him.

587
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,680
This punch

588
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,000
is for Ling'er.

589
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,440
Ling'er?

590
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,200
What happened to her?

591
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,270
Wait, that one doesn't count!

592
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,440
This punch

593
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,310
is from me.

594
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,790
- He clearly held back for him.
- All-Around Knight!

595
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,640
All-Around Knight,
can I get your autograph?

596
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,920
Sign for me, please!

597
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,000
All-Around Knight!

598
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I've liked you for so long!

599
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,720
Wu Guangming!

600
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,440
Deng Yunfeng!

601
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,070
Liu Sanniang!

602
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,720
Zhong Kanxie!

603
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,830
Yao Youpeng!

604
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,270
Yao Youpeng? Who's that?

605
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,590
It doesn't matter.

606

611
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,440
Back then, I must've been blind

612
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,640
to have followed Gou Lingfeng.

613
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,680
He's a complete fraud!

614
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,240
A total disappointment.

615
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,480
Yeah, disgusting.

616
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,830
We were all fooled.

617
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,590
All-Around Knight is the real deal.

618
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,480
From now on,

619
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,110
he's the one I'll follow.

620
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,200
He's the true great hero.

621
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,614
No doubt.

622
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,110
Only heroes with real strength like him

623
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,200
can last long in this world.

624
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,400
Right.

625
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,630
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.

626
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,550
So many weird things
are happening lately.

627
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,870
Lingfeng.

628
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,350
Dad.

629
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,030
Where did Yingdan go?

630
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,070
How far along is the baby?

631
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,070
When can I finally hold my grandchild?

632
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,630
Dad!

633
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,070
That's your idea of comforting me?

634
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,680
Just leave me alone.

635
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,160
I'm not done yet.

636
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,200
Let me introduce you to a few girls!

637
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,630
Dad!

638
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,670
Dad.

639
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,280
Gou Lingfeng.

640
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,440
Yingdan!

641
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,760
Lingfeng,

642
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,310
I've always believed in you.

643
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,070
You will become a true hero.

644
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,910
Yingdan,

645
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm sorry.

646
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,200
I shouldn't have treated you like that.

647
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,790
I was wrong.

648
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,590
Yingdan.

649
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,390
Master!

650
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,880
Don't just fight everyday,

651
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,790
you should remember to eat.

652
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,350
- Zhuge?
- Mr. Gou.

653
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,030
Here, dumplings are ready.

654
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,030
- Come on, try it.
- Ling'er.

655
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,560
Master.

656
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,000
Zhuge.

657
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,310
Please don't leave.

658
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,510
Don't leave.

659
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,790
I don't want to be alone.

660
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,720
I was wrong.

661
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,310
I really,

662
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,880
really was wrong.

663
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,400
Don't leave me all by myself.

664
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,590
Please?

665
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,200
I don't want to be alone.

666
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,200
Lingfeng.

667
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,350
Lingfeng.

668
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,960
Lingfeng.

669
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,960
Master?

670
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,310
I was wrong, Master.

671
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:58,790
Master! Master!

672
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,510
- Lingfeng.
- Please, go back...

673
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,520
Master.

674
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,640
Lingfeng,

675
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,160
I didn't die.

676
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,480
Master, I knew you weren't dead!

677
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,960
Why didn't you come find me earlier?

678
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,750
Master.

679
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,030
Easy now!

680
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,640
You're about to choke me to death!

681
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,200
Master!

682
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,720
Why are you alive again?

683
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,080
Chief,

684
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,640
have you forgotten

685
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,960
the blood feud between the MAA and us?

686
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,960
I haven't.

687
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,880
But you once told me:

688
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,400
"endless vengeance is good for nobody."

689
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,480
Endless revenge

690
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,240
only brings more pain and bloodshed.

691
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,640
Restoring the Divine Sect

692
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,160
doesn't mean slaughtering them all.

693
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,350
What I want to revive

694
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,350
is the original Divine Sect we once had.

695
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,720
No survivors from the demonic sect!

696
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,590
- Yes!
- Yes!

697
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,480
Chief!

698
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,590
Look around you

699
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,510
and listen.

700
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,350
This is how the world sees
our Divine Sect.

701
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,880
Are we really going to repeat

702
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,680
the tragedies of the past?

703
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,270
Why?

704
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,680
Why?

705
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,430
Chief,

706
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,510
you're old now.

707
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Let me

708
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,960
take it from here.

709
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,920
Liu Guang.

710
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,190
Chief,

711
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,200
take care.

712
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,000
Liu Guang...

713
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,200
Master,

714
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,830
did you hurt your head too?

715
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,200
You're not acting quite right.

716
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,590
My head's just fine!

717
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,720
How did you survive?

718
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,680
Didn't I tell you?

719
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,240
Your master isn't that easy to kill!

720
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,350
Did you forget?

721
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,590
I know the Tortoise Breath.

722
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,680
The only thing is

723
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,590
it takes a while to recover.

724
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,480
It took me forever just to walk again.

725
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,630
Master,

726
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,880
let me help you heal
with my inner energy.

727
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,720
No no no.

728
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,350
- Hey, hey, go easy!
- Master.

729
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,190
- Easy!
- Sit tight!

730
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,640
Wait wait, last time you...

731
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,350
Gentle! Gentle!

732
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,440
I didn't even use much force!

733
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,280
Master!

What?

738
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,960
Where did she go?

739
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,350
Sorry, no clue yet.

740
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,830
Keep your eyes on Gou Lingfeng.

741
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,750
He will go after Ma Yingdan.

do whatever it takes

744
