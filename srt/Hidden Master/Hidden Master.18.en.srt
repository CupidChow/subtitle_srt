00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,430
Report.

2
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,350
Speak.

3
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,440
Mr. Deng,

4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,080
recently, Huizhou has seen
several demonic sect robberies.

5
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,150
Should we intervene and investigate?

6
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,750
Don't act recklessly for now.

7
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,550
Investigate their background.

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,150
- Go.
- Aye.

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,600
How could they cause such a scene?

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,430
The Hero Gathering is coming.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,430
These troublemakers.

12
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,030
Could it be...

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,000
How dare they defy my godfather's order

14
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,150
and act without permission?

=Episode 18=

61
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,600
Years ago, the Martial Artists
Association united all the major sects

62
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,760
to eradicate the demonic sect.

63
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,470
It was believed
that once they were destroyed,

64
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,040
the martial world would find peace.

65
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,670
However, during the process,
they realized

66
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,480
that it was not the demonic sect
but human hearts

67
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,440
that stirred up the chaos.

68
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,190
Regardless of the demonic sect,

69
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,310
Martial Artists Association,

70
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,960
and other sects in the martial world,

71
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,390
the darkness within human hearts

72
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,480
was the hardest to eradicate.

73
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,280
Wang Qing, tell them

74
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,790
I'm the love of your life!

75
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,870
They're so fierce!

76
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,080
That guy is Wang Qing.

77
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,040
When fighting with the demonic sect,

78
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,790
he lost his right arm.

79
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,320
Normally, as a swordsman,

80
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,040
he'd lead a miserable life.

81
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,960
However, he's running
a small business here

82
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,110
and living a happy life.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,630
Is he really happy?

84
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,790
Can't you tell?

85
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,080
Hold on, Dad.

86
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,160
What did you just say?

87
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,790
He's a swordsman?

88
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,990
Well, he used to be.

89
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,360
Come on, Mr. Gou. Over here.

90
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,560
It's been ages since we met.

91
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,920
I've missed you so much.

92
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,390
Who would've thought

93
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,230
Mr. Gui has such a story?

94
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,030
However, from what I know
about Zhuge Yu,

95
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,190
he wouldn't kill Ms. Shun

96
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,640
for the title of Sword Saint.

97
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,600
Mr. Gui,

98
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,310
your hardships are finally over.

99
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,440
Your family is finally reunited.

100
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,480
Mr. Gui, Chairman Gou,

101
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,400
please enjoy.

102
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,910
Lingfeng's friend?

103
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,070
No, no, no.

104
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,200
You're wrong.

105
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,910
She's Heng's friend.

106
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,750
Well, Mr. Gui, Chairman Gou,

107
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,600
please enjoy.

108
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,950
I'll leave you two alone.

109
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,640
Where's Yingdan?

110
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,640
She's Lingfeng's friend.

111
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,750
Okay, okay.

112
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,900
(Martial Artists Association)

113
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,440
We live for justice!

114
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,590
You three are role models
of the association.

115
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,440
You're all righteous and loyal.

116
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,350
Gou Lingfeng,

117
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,830
in the Puppet Knight's case,

118
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,950
Vice Chairman's case,

119
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,040
Prince Chang's case,

120
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,800
and Ye Dahei's case,

121
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,560
you've all done a good job.

122
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,040
You've really defended

123
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,510
the dignity of the association

124
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,430
and prevented those with ill intentions

125
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,710
from tarnishing our reputation.

126
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,910
Well done.

127
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm doing all this to be

128
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,950
a great hero like you.

129
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,160
Keep going.

130
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,350
Zhuge Heng.

131
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,040
You've done well too.

132
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,470
I heard you decided to carry on
your father's aspiration

133
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,710
and lead the Sword Alliance
in commercial development.

134
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,000
I have high hopes for you.

135
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,390
Chairman, you're wise and generous.

136
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,590
From now on,

137
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,440
you are my idol too.

138
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,670
Floral Knight,

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,470
in Prince Chang's case,

140
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,390
you used your medical skills

141
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,350
to save many heroes and people.

142
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,710
Thank you so much.

143
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,390
This is all my duty.

144
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,630
See?

145
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,480
I've told you

146
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,320
the chairman knows everything.

147
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,880
You are our role models.

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,440
But remember, don't get carried away.

149
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,560
Keep going forward.

150
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes, Chairman!

151
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,640
Thank you, Chairman.

152
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,720
Have some tea.

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,920
Lingfeng,

154
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,080
do you remember what happened
when you were four?

155
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,470
Of course I do.

156
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,000
That year, the demonic sect
invaded my home

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,270
and killed my nanny.

158
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,030
If it weren't for you,

159
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,830
I would've died back then.

160
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,950
You still remember that?

161
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,470
Of course.

162
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,910
I've been keeping an eye on you.

163
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,270
Your father and I are old acquaintances.

164
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,950
The Gou Family Trade Association

165
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,120
has been supporting us

166
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,710
in finance secretly.

167
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,830
So, it's true.

168
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,510
I had some assumptions,

169
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,470
but I didn't expect it to be true.

170
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,950
But Chairman...

171
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,270
Calling me Chairman feels distant.

172
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,510
Your father and I
have been friends for years.

173
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,150
Why don't you call me

174
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,510
Uncle Wu?

175
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,630
Uncle Wu,

176
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,640
why are you telling me all this?

177
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,240
Zhu Gou Team's reputation

178
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,150
is rising in the martial world.

179
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,350
It has brought great honor to us.

180
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,510
I'm truly proud of you.

181
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,560
However, as you know,

182
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,830
the demonic sect has been active lately.

183
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,680
You are born kind

184
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,150
and trust others too easily.

185
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,270
I'm worried that you'd be used
by bad people

186
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,590
and go astray.

187
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,560
From now on, you must be

188
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,640
more careful.

189
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,830
Thanks for your guidance, Uncle Wu.

190
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,240
I will not let you down.

191
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,190
Ling'er,

192
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,270
while I was away,

193
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,470
was everything alright at home?

194
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,030
Nothing happened.

195
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,030
Heng, congratulations.

196
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,150
They look so happy.

197
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,310
Thank you.

198
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,950
Zhuge, congratulations.

199
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,830
You've fulfilled a lifelong wish.

200
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,310
- Come on, Yingdan.
- Come on.

201
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,230
Thank you.

202
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,350
And of course, thank you, Ling'er.

203
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,640
That slap really woke me up.

204
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,560
Heng, don't be too polite.

205
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,830
Zhuge, you don't need to pester me
about learning demonic skills.

206
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,430
Ling'er.

207
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,030
Zhuge has truly changed.

208
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,150
He's no longer the wandering kid
who's always

209
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,280
talking about revenge.

210
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,510
Yes. Heng was really like

211
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,400
a troublesome kid.

212
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,480
Well,

213
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,030
you don't need to learn demonic skills.

214
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,390
Instead, you can teach me sword skills.

215
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,400
I'll call you Master.

216
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,830
Stop kidding.

217
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,280
You're still my master.

218
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,520
I hope you can teach me business.

219
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,590
Business?

220
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,800
Why would you learn that?

221
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,160
My father was right.

222
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,590
Conflicts in the martial world
are pointless.

223
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,950
So, I've decided to quit martial arts

224
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,830
and start doing business.

225
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,710
I'll expand

226
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,030
our business in Huizhou

227
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,280
for my father and the Sword Alliance.

228
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,510
That's great.

229
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,430
Therefore,

230
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,470
my new three biggest wishes are

231
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,000
to strive,

232
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,120
to get rich,

233
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,000
and to build a family.

234
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,880
Ling'er,

235
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,350
maybe I spoke too soon.

236
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,400
I agree.

237
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,080
I understand why you want
to strive and get rich.

238
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,360
But build a family?

239
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,470
Who will be your wife?

240
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,320
Ling'er,

241
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,710
you can't let him get
what he wants easily.

242
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,000
Master, what's the benefit of

243
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,200
giving me a hard time?

244
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,870
Besides, Ling'er

245
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,470
has agreed.

246
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,830
- I can't believe it.
- Heng!

247
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,360
Yingdan,

248
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,400
let's pick a date.

249
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,470
For them.

250
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,150
Gou,

251
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,520
I haven't agreed!

252
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,320
- You haven't?
- You did!

253
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,870
When we sat on the swing,

254
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,360
you said, "Heng, I agree!"

255
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,270
- You forgot it?
- Heng!

256
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,750
How can you back out?

257
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,200
Ling'er hasn't said yes.

258
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,280
You're always bullying her.

259
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,000
Listen, Zhuge,

260
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,150
if you dare to bully her,

261
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,070
I'll...

262
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,360
I wouldn't dare.

263
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,710
I've apologized to her.

264
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,160
But I really love her.

265
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,390
Zhuge Heng really loves her.

266
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,520
After all, he told his father,

267
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,160
"She's a good girl,

268
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,440
but it's too early to have a child."

269
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,520
Master!

270
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,670
Stop!

271
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Heng,

272
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,630
eat more.

273
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,550
Okay.

274
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,310
Master.

275
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,520
You two should also settle it quickly.

276
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,430
We?

277
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,800
What do you mean?

278
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,720
I... I'm going to be a great hero.

279
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,670
I still need to strive for Zhu Gou Team.

280
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,630
Come on, for Zhu Gou Team!

281
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,240
Come on.

282
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,230
For Zhu Gou Team!

283
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,630
- Come on.
- Cheers!

284
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,550
Cheers!

285
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,160
Yingdan, are you okay?

286
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,280
Come on, let me help you.

287
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,160
Be careful.

288
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,200
Come on.

289
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,040
Yingdan, what happened?

290
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,800
What's going on?

291
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,040
The recoil is getting serious.

292
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,080
I'll call Gou.

293
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,950
There's no way to clear the recoil.

294
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,350
Why tell him?

295
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,000
Yingdan,

296
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,840
it's getting worse.

297
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,040
Why can't you tell Gou?

298
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,640
Ling'er.

299
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,040
If you were me,

300
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,080
would you tell Zhuge?

301
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,800
That's right.

302
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,500
(Snake)

303
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,790
Not bad.

304
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,910
Promoted.

305
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,440
Don't break it.

306
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,790
Well, the future leader
of the divine sect

307
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,200
is only a Snake-rank hero
in the association.

308
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,440
What a disgrace!

309
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,120
The Martial Artists Association
fights for justice

310
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,680
and is full of talents.

311
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,680
As a demonic sect member,
you have no right to criticize me.

312
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,000
It's not a demonic sect

313
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
- but the divine sect.
- Enough.

314
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,910
I've told you

315
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,120
the world isn't what you think it is.

316
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,110
Enough!

317
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,320
Well, you're right on time.

318
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,750
The Hero Gathering is coming.

319
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,830
I'll definitely get the hero token.

320
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,320
Anything else?

321
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,950
If nothing else, I'll leave.

322
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,990
I'm already drunk.

323
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,630
Okay, just go.

324
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,990
Do me a small favor.

325
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,480
Four days later, in Wulipo,

326
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,320
there'll be a succession ceremony.

327
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,080
You need to attend it.

328
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,320
The demonic sect has so many activities.

329
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,630
Succession ceremony?

330
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,870
Who's the successor?

331
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,200
Of course, it's you.

332
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,320
Who's the drunk one here?

333
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,870
We're running out of time.

334
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,400
I've decided to let you
take over the sect in advance.

335
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,400
You crazy old man.

336
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,680
I'm not going!

337
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,720
Listen, this isn't a negotiation.

338
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,440
I'd never negotiate with you!

339
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,000
I have your father.

340
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,630
See you in Wulipo.

341
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,440
Old man!

342
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,870
You ran away again!

343
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,400
My dad is innocent!

344
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,000
You...

345
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,590
Mr. Deng,

346
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,200
staying up late is bad for health.

347
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,990
You should rest early.

348
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,240
Your Highness.

349
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,230
It's late at night.

350
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,750
What do you need?

351
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,440
When you were attacked,

352
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,630
I didn't have the chance to visit you.

353
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,080
So, I prepared

354
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,080
some pastries for you.

355
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,950
Please.

356
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,580
(Task List)

357
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,830
I made

358
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,710
these myself.

359
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,110
Thank you, Your Highness.

360
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,320
I also need to thank you

361
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,110
for defending me
in front of my godfather.

362
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,040
We're family.

363
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,470
Don't be so polite.

364
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,750
I noticed you looked upset.

365
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,560
What is troubling you?

366
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,470
I'm a newcomer,

367
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,280
and the heroes

368
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,830
wouldn't accept my tasks.

369
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,990
Mr. He must be behind this.

370
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,720
It seems that several tasks

371
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,470
are related to the demonic sect.

372
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,560
Why don't you ask Zhu Gou Team?

373
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,360
They don't seem
to obey Vice Chairman He.

374
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,470
They won't

375
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,230
obey me either.

376
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,550
From what I know,

377
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,990
Gui Lao, Gou Lingfeng's master

378
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,080
and Zhuge Heng's grandfather,

379
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,950
is a key figure in the demonic sect.

380
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,910
Recently, he's been active in Wulipo.

381
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,440
With this connection,

382
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,630
why wouldn't they listen to you?

383
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,350
Why didn't I think of that?

384
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,870
Thank you, Your Highness.

385
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,350
You're too kind, Mr. Deng.

386
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,200
Then I'll leave you alone.

387
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,280
Your Highness.

388
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,280
Zhuge Heng

389
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,950
rejected you, right?

390
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,950
What did you say?

391
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,950
Actually, today,

392
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,320
I saw you

393
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,630
outside Zhuge Heng's place.

394
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,470
Well, Mr. Deng, I wonder

395
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,630
if you saw Floral Knight.

396
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,310
Mr. Deng,

397
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,750
I'll make it clear today.

398
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,830
A romantic relationship

399
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,710
is not what I want.

400
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,120
So, even if we both

401
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,590
like someone else,

402
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,030
our marriage agreement

403
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,080
will not change.

404
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,630
I hope you keep that in mind.

405
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,950
The situation has been complicated.

406
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,000
I hope you can focus on

407
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,480
our big plan.

408
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,560
Your Highness!

409
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,590
If you don't mind,

410
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,880
we can

411
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,760
- share these pastries.
- No need.

412
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,960
If you don't like

413
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,480
these pastries,

414
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,560
I'll prepare something else next time.

415
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,350
Use one hand.

416
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,880
Yingdan, do you think
my father will be fine?

417
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,110
There's nothing to worry about.

418
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,080
- You're back.
- Don't overthink it.

419
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,720
What's wrong, Master?

420
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,960
You look so upset.

421
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,480
His master captured his father
to force him

422
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,000
to be the leader.

423
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,150
Impressive.

424
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,030
Oh, no.

425
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,870
How could my grandfather do that?

426
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,480
There's nothing he wouldn't do.

427
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,560
He deceived me for over a decade.

428
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,430
Mr. Gui wouldn't do something like that.

429
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,240
How do you know?

430
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,920
Mr. Gui didn't want me to tell you this.

431
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,830
When you were in the Sword Alliance
saving Sword Saint,

432
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,760
Chairman Gou and Mr. Gui came here.

433
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,080
My father came?

434
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,240
They had a great conversation

435
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,720
and seemed very close.

436
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,880
They colluded to set me up.

437
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,240
So, does it mean

438
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,440
we don't need to worry?

439
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,160
Should we keep looking for him?

440
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,070
Or should we capture my grandfather

441
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,480
to torture and interrogate him?

442
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,560
I wish I could.

443
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,030
That old man's got
great lightness skill.

444
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,110
He's always the one finding me.

445
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,110
Where should I find him?

446
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,000
So annoying.

447
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,590
My father and he...

448
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,600
You're all here.

449
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,270
- Yunfeng?
- Yingdan.

450
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,240
Are you feeling well?

451
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,350
No relapses, I hope?

452
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,880
I...

453
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,240
I'm doing fine.

454
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,720
I'm not asking you.

455
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,190
I'm doing fine.

456
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,000
Mr. Deng, what instructions do you have?

457
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,080
Have you considered

458
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,720
the suggestions I gave you?

459
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,470
Yunfeng.

460
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,400
Don't bring it up again.

461
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Yingdan,

462
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,430
why are you still calling him Yunfeng?

463
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,240
Do you really have to be
so hostile to me?

464
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,110
I know there were
some conflicts between us,

465
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,760
but I had no choice.

466
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,350
I had no selfish intentions.

467
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,480
Yes, Master.

468
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,110
Yunfeng saved us
in the Sword Alliance, right?

469
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,670
Yunfeng.

470
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,480
- You're not here
- Yunfeng...

471
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,630
just to catch up, right?

472
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,830
The Hero Gathering is coming,

473
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,760
and the association is ready.

474
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,150
However, lately,

475
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,480
the demonic sect has been

476
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,110
causing trouble on the outskirts.

477
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,830
So, I hope you can help me

478
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,240
tackle these tasks.

479
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,320
Tasks?

480
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,480
Yunfeng.

481
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,350
We have other things to do.

482
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,190
You should ask other heroes.

483
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,180
None of them are as valiant as you,

484
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,030
Zhu Gou Team.

485
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,350
That's true.

486
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,750
Well, could it be

487
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,870
that you can't command the others,
Inspector Deng?

488
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,920
Ling'er.

489
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,440
Are you saying Yunfeng
is a powerless inspector?

490
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,360
Gou Lingfeng!

491
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,720
Don't go too far!

492
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,510
Besides,

493
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,080
stop calling me... Yunfeng.

494
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,510
- Okay, Yunfeng.
- Wulipo, Wulipo...

495
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,480
Master, Master!

496
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,680
All tasks are in Wulipo.

497
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,720
Isn't Wulipo the demonic sect's
stronghold?

498
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,240
Wulipo?

499
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,180
(Task List)

500
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,560
Do me a small favor.

501
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,880
Four days later, in Wulipo,

502
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,630
there'll be a succession ceremony.

503
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,480
You need to attend it.

504
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,630
Are you going or not?

505
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,480
I shouldn't have come.

506
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,040
We'll accept it.

507
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,510
Yes.

508
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,320
This one.

509
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,590
Look at the quality.

510
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,790
My master.

511
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,310
Mentioned Wulipo before.

512
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,720
He's quite a figure in the demonic sect.

513
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,610
This time,

514
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,350
we'll use the task as an excuse

515
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,400
to capture some demonic remnants,

516
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,200
and we'll know where my master is.

517
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,070
No wonder you accept the task.

518
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,350
That's good.
I want to visit my grandfather too.

519
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,110
But we only have four people.

520
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,270
Will it be dangerous?

521
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,590
Being with you

522
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,200
is always dangerous.

523
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,490
- Ridiculous!
- Let's go.

524
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,640
Yingdan,

525
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,110
why did you buy so much food?

526
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,320
Yes. Let me have one.

527
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,350
These are for
Little Zhao and Little Zhan.

528
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,440
- Who?
- Little Zhao and Little Zhan?

529
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,110
Who are they?

530
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,990
How old are they?

531
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,430
- Male or female?
- Don't ask.

532
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,560
Male.

533
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,590
Who are they? Answer me!

534
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,510
No.

535
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,560
Little Zhao.

536
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,680
Why are you crying?

537
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,640
What's wrong, Little Zhan?

538
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,510
Where's Little Zhao?

539
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,480
Little Zhao...

540
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,590
Little Zhao is dead!

541
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,240
The only family I had is gone!

542
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,390
What should I do now?

543
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,400
Big Sister,

544
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,110
I don't know
how to write "Zhao" and "Grave",

545
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,550
(Little X's)
and I can't afford a coffin,

546
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,760
so I could only bury him
with some straws.

547
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,510
Little Zhan, don't cry.

548
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,430
Tell me,

549
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,720
how did Little Zhao die?

550
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,110
He was killed by the demonic sect!

551
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,750
(Little X's)
The other night,

552
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,590
we caught a wild chicken

553
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,480
and roasted it in the forest.

554
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,870
But I suddenly had an upset stomach.

555
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,750
Little Zhao, my stomach hurts.

556
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,080
I'll be right back.

557
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,240
When I came back...

558
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,760
He even saved a chicken leg for me!

559
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,100
(Little Zhao's Grave)

560
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,630
Little Zhan, don't be sad.

561
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,030
Little Zhao,

562
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,000
I will avenge you, I promise.

563
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,440
The demonic sect

564
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,830
is so ruthless!

565
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,920
Little Zhan, Yingdan,

566
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,960
don't worry.

567
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,400
My master asked me to go to Wulipo

568
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,320
to attend the succession ceremony.

569
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,830
We can use this chance
to uncover the truth

570
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,780
(Little Zhao's Grave)
for Little Zhao.

571
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,310
What happened?

572
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,270
We must find them.

573
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,190
That's right.

574
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,150
It's them again.

575
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,230
Stop!

576
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,760
Demonic sect member?

577
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,830
Why are you here, boss?

578
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,000
We're just minions.

579
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,870
Why can't you spare us?

580
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,000
That young man is pretty.

581
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,000
That one too.

582
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,270
Look at me.

583
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,800
Am I pretty?

584
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,910
Don't be rude to our boss's friends.

585
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,640
How did you get

586
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,150
the bruises?

587
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,430
We got beaten by the heroes
from the Martial Artists Association.

588
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,390
Is it that hard

589
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,790
for you to make a living?

590
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,750
Yes, boss.

591
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,040
We're planning to turn over a new leaf
and go home.

592
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,400
Boss.

593
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,240
No wonder you're the boss.

594
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,390
After being beaten,
you still ran so fast.

595
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,440
What?

596
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,400
Boss, we were about

597
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,440
to join you, but you said
you were going home.

598
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,680
Your line of work is so popular now.

599
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,910
You're even recruiting new members.

600
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,270
Boss,

601
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,680
I used to sing at the Newbud Teahouse

602
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,280
beside the storytellers.

603
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,680
Later, they said my rhymes were terrible

604
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,040
and fired me.

605
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,110
I had no choice but to do this.

606
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,560
I think your rhymes are pretty good.

607
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,440
Boss,

608
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,920
I used to be a host
at the Huizhou Drill Ground,

609
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,630
but they said I was too bad at writing

610
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,200
and I couldn't

611
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,590
describe their heroic spirit.

612
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,240
I... I had no choice either.

613
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,640
Boss, look.

614
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,680
We're all decent folks.

615
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,760
We're planning to go home and farm.

616
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,160
Farm, yes, farm.

617
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,110
Go home and farm.

618
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,910
Look at you.

619
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,040
A bunch of villains.

620
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,720
They caught you robbing again, right?

621
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,430
You did this to yourself!

622
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,070
We had no choice, boss.

623
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,270
We didn't succeed once this month.

624
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,120
We're starving.

625
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,390
We can't afford the dues.

626
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,470
Dues?

627
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,280
Does the association charge you dues?

628
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,560
Rascals!

629
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,040
Let's go, Master.

630
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,630
We'll catch them.

631
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,960
- Where are they?
- Over there.

632
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,880
Over there.

633
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,360
Let's go.

634
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,350
Show some respect to the boss
from the demonic sect.

635
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,960
I heard he's a ruthless killer.

636
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,240
How's that possible?

637
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,040
He seems pretty kind.

638
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,430
I agree.

639
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,110
He grows on people.

640
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,400
Boss, I feel like I've seen him

641
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,390
somewhere else before.

642
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,150
It's hard to be a leader.

643
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,800
Don't overthink it. Let's go.

644
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,680
I told you that old man had money.

645
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,600
Stop.

646
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,550
Who are you?

647
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,030
Get lost.

648
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,910
You're blocking my way!

649
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,680
A defender of justice!

650
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,520
You're asking for this. Don't blame us.

651
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,390
Don't hit my face.

652
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,750
You asked for this.

653
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,240
You busybody!

654
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,000
Go to hell!

655
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,390
Why is it him?

656
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,630
Who's this?

657
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,030
A demonic sect member I saved before.

658
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,950
Hu San'er.

659
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,190
Hu San'er?

660
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,920
I'll help him.

661
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,880
- Stop!
- San'er!

662
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,800
San'er!

663
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,790
- Mr. Zhuge!
- Get up.

664
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,110
Mr. Zhuge!

665
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,190
Let's go!

666
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,800
Are you alright?

667
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,350
Mr. Zhuge!

668
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,670
Alright, let's go.

669
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,240
All the members of the Martial Artists
Association are bad people!

670
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,040
They're always bullying us!

671
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,240
Look what they did to me!

672
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,590
Alright, calm down.

673
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,510
It's okay.

674
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,720
Watch your words.

675
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,430
You little demonic sect member,

676
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,390
don't slander all heroes.

677
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,390
Who are you?

678
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,240
It seems like you're one of us.

679
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,110
Who are these two?

680
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,150
This is my master.

681
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,630
This is Yingdan.

682
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,390
This is Ms. Ling'er.

683
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,720
Hello.

684
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,240
Hell no!

685
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,030
All heroes are bad people

686
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,040
except for Mr. Zhuge!

687
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,080
You...

688
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,560
Don't be blinded by a few rascals!

689
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,800
Is that so?

690
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,270
The association has ruled
the martial world for years.

691
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,520
Has the world found peace?

692
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,720
Bandits still roam freely,

693
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,280
and many commoners are homeless.

694
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,000
As you can see,

695
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,350
they even colluded with those villains

696
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,630
to collect protection fees.

697
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,040
Listen,

698
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,560
a true hero

699
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,640
would never demean themselves to join
the Martial Artists Association,

700
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,820
an organization rotten inside!

701
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,910
Okay, fine.

702
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,040
Then tell me,

703
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,320
where can we find a true hero?

704
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,520
I'm a true hero!

705
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,550
Well, well.

706
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,040
That's enough.

707
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,540
Stop bragging.
You're making me confused.

708
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,240
- I...
- Here, San'er.

709
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,520
Take the money

710
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,600
and go home.

711
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,520
Mr. Zhuge,

712
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,240
you're always so kind to me.

713
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,160
The divine sect will never
forget your generosity.

714
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,840
Alright, just go home.

715
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,670
San'er,

716
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,110
let me ask you something.

717
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,280
Do you know where Wulipo is?

718
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,040
Of course.

719
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,750
My home is there.

720
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,800
Well, lead the way!

721
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,710
Let's go.

722
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:51,420
(Peace and Harvest)

723
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,480
- We're here.
- Make way, please.

724
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,400
This...

725
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,430
Don't lose it.

726
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,430
Do you mean

727
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,520
they're all demonic sect members?

728
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,800
Including this bird?

729
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,320
How's that possible?

730
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,830
It's the 5th day of the month.

731
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,910
It's our market day.

732
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,110
On this day, everyone gathers together

733
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,390
to hold a trading fair

734
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,390
and pray for a prosperous life.

735
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,480
These people

736
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,520
look just like ordinary folks.

737
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,800
They're all driven by their livelihoods.

738
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,280
You seem pretty wealthy.

739
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,630
Why not support their businesses?

740
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,880
- It's very cheap.
- He's rich.

741
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,480
We'll have this, Master.

742
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,720
Okay, we'll take that.

743
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,180
(Peace and Harvest)

744
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,310
Please take a look.

745
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,880
- It's sturdy.
- Forget it.

746
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,940
(The End of Episode 18)

747
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,520
Leader,

748
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,150
time spares no one.

749
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,800
You're really old.

750
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,840
Liu Guang,

751
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,320
it's been ages since we met in dreams.

752
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,520
You really haven't changed at all.

753
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,670
Leader,

754
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,910
wake up.

755
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,600
No.

756
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,670
I haven't seen you for a long time.

757
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,150
Stay and chat with me a bit longer.

758
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,670
We're running out of time.

759
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,910
The Martial Artists Association
wants to eliminate us.

760
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,480
Do you have a solution?

761
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,200
Are you really putting all our hopes

762
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,350
on that brat Gou Lingfeng?

763
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,870
Echo From Afar?

764
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,990
Liu Guang.

765
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,640
Liu Guang,

766
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,320
are you still alive?

767
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,560
Where the hell

768
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,390
have you been all these years?

769
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,560
Leader,

770
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,080
it's a long story.

771
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,110
Without a leader, the divine sect

772
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,590
is on the brink of collapse.

773
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,560
We don't have time.

774
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,870
I got it.

775
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,630
I'll make sure
he takes over the sect soon.

776
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,950
Liu Guang!

777
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,990
Liu Guang!

778
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,230
Liu Guang!

779
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,800
Have you left?

780
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,230
Liu Guang!

781
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,630
Liu Guang...

782
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,870
How could you leave like that?
