00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,790
Vice Chief,

2
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,560
our poison is extremely potent.

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,670
Vice Chief,

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,910
our poison is extremely potent.

5
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,580
Good.

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,140
Vice Chief,

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,780
Prince Chang is about to reach Huizhou.

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,740
All our men are in position.

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,980
Tonight

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,740
we can finally avenge

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,980
our Chief.

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,380
Tonight,

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,220
we must succeed.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,500
Failure is not an option.

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,180
All preparations are complete.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,180
Everything is foolproof.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,820
Keep a close eye on Ma Yingdan.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,660
She's a top-notch detox expert.

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,580

owe it to that Deng Yunfeng.

70
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,740
I still don't like him.

71
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,500
Me neither.

72
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,140
Gentlemen,

73
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,700
interested in chatting
with some lovely ladies?

74
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,420
They are skilled in

75
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,420
music, chess,

76
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,740
calligraphy, and painting.

77
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,900
Get lost! We don't need that!

78
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,380
Watch your attitude. Speak nicely!

79
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,300
I...

80
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,300
Yeah.

81
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,660
See? Now that's a proper gentleman.

82
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,660
We've got a new girl here,

83
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,940
super pretty.

84
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,220
I'll go get her for you.

85
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,300
What's wrong with you?

86
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,780
- What are you doing here?
- Come on.

87
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,540
I'm Ying'er

88
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,940
from Liuzhou.

89
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,340
We'll take her.

90
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,740
Stop it!

91
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,540
Back to business.

92
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,540
Well, Yingdan,

93
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,460
did you find anything?

94
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,660
No.

95
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,340
That rouge has a unique scent.

96
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,220
I sniffed every girl here,

97
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,220
but didn't find anything odd.

98
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,180
Yingdan, do you think the poisoner

99
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,020
might not be from Juhong Pavilion?

100
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,740
But Yingdan,

101
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,020
this outfit

102
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,620
really suits you.

103
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,340
Shut up!

104
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,820
Yingdan, what's that smell on you?

105
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,620
What smell?

106
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,940
It's that same rouge scent!

107
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,580
Then who touched you just now?

108
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,820
Only the...

109
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,540
- The lady boss?
- The lady boss?

110
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,260
My dad said the lady boss here
is so beautiful.

111
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,140
But when I looked at her, meh.

112
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,420
Where is your lady boss?

113
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,580
End of the corridor, first room
on the right.

114
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,620
She is...

115
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,540
Wake up!

116
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,980
Where's the one who did this?

117
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,140
Quick! Catch that imposter!

118
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,580
Undo the ropes for her.

119
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,500
Okay.

120
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,620
So you're the real lady boss?

121
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,460
Who else would I be?

122
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,420
The fake lady boss locked me

123
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,420
in the lady boss's own room!

124
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,340
If I'm not the real lady boss,

125
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,620
do you think I'm a random stranger?

126
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,700
In stead of asking questions,

127
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,980
you should go catch that imposter.

128
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,740
Wow, good talker.

129
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,900
Real chatterbox too.

130
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,260
I'm looking for that

131
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,060
super beautiful lady boss.

132
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,260
That's me.

133
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,220
Wanna run?

134
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,300
The Floral Knight's name
wasn't just for show!

135
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,900
You neutralized the poison

136
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,660
in the lady boss's body in no time.

137
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,860
Our Divine Sect's

138
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,380
Alchemy Division needs talents like you.

139
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,420
How about you come with me?

140
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,020
Sure.

141
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,540
The MAA can't even tell right
from wrong.

142
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,420
Since they're heartless,

143
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,900
then I'll be ruthless too.

144
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,660
Brilliant.

145
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,660
Truly beautiful.

146
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,660
Help me out here!

147
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,740
Why are you standing there?

148
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,860
Help me out!

149
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,820
But we shouldn't hit women.

150
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,940
Let me handle it.

151
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,340
- Yingdan!
- Yingdan, are you okay?

152
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,940
I'm Hao Mei from Juhong Pavilion.

153
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,300
Which sect are you from?

154
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,900
It's so hard for you
to catch one person.

155
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,820
Your name's Hao Mei?

156
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,660
What else would it be? Boss Lady?

157
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,740
My surname is Lady?

158
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,980
He's so handsome, does his name
have "Handsome" in it?

159
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:22,980
How'd you know?

160
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,340
My mom wanted to name me

161
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,190
just "Handsome."

162
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,860
So people have to live up
to their names?

163
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,780
Then with all your nonsense,

164
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,020
is your surname "Nonsense"?

165
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,900
Nope, his surname's Gou.

166
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,460
- I...
- His surname's Chou.

167
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,460
Chou.

168
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,460
No! Gou!

169
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,340
Chou.

170
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,740
Master! Master!

171
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,500
Master!

172
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,460
Floral Knight!

173
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,540
Someone poisoned the MAA again.

174
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,260
A lot of our men have collapsed.

175
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,380
Even Mr. He is

176
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,660
barely hanging on.

177
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,620
- He Changzai?
- He Changzai!

178
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,100
Please come with me to save them!

179
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,620
Got it.

180
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,820
Hand to one inside over to Lord Deng

181
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,110
- and let him interrogate him.
- Yes!

182
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,900
Linglong,

183
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,140
I had to use every ounce of persuasion

184
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,420
to get that old fox Eunuch Deng

185
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,940
to agree to your marriage
with Deng Yunfeng.

186
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,460
When we get to Huizhou,

187
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,740
you should spend more time with him

188
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,500
to deepen your relationship.

189
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,100
Eunuch Deng already controls

190
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,980
most of the imperial court.

191
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,980
If Deng Yunfeng ends up on our side,

192
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,740
the world will be ours in no time.

193
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,940
I understand.

194
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,820
I'll do as you say, Father.

195
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,420
Good, good.

196
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,580
How far to Huizhou?

197
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,740
Your Highness, Huizhou is just ahead.

198
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,100
The poison has been neutralized.

199
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,460
They're no longer in danger.

200
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,060
But to fully recover,

201
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,060
they'll still need rest.

202
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,300
If there's nothing else, we'll be going.

203
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,210
Floral Knight!

204
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,580
- Floral Knight, wait!
- You still suspect me?

205
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,780
He Changzai,

206
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,420
you're so ungrateful!

207
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,740
Yingdan just saved all of you!

208
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,940
Careful.

209
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,900
Floral Knight, don't misunderstand.

210
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,500
Prince Chang will be inspecting
our county.

211
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,420
He'll arrive in Huizhou shortly.

212
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,940
Right now, you and Mr. Zhuge are

213
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,100
- the only Tiger-ranked heroes left.
- Yes.

214
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,540
The MAA needs you to protect
Prince Chang.

215
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,740
What's Prince Chang coming for?

216
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,100
And with this much fanfare?

217
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,260
He's the late emperor's younger brother.

218
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,820
The emperor's foundation
is still unstable.

219
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,500
He heavily relies on Prince Chang.

220
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
His safety is of utmost importance.

221
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,580
They can't afford

222
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,700
even the slightest mishap.

223
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,940
No.

224
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,980
What's it to you?

225
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,900
Yeah,

226
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,820
no.

227
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,580
Did you forget how you
treated us before?

228
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,500
Mr. Zhuge,

229
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,540
this isn't something

230
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,980
to take lightly.

231
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,420
Prince Chang's safety
is a serious matter.

232
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,940
Like I care.

233
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,260
Yeah, like you care.

234
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,180
You...

235
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,500
If that's all,

236
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,340
we'll be heading back.

237
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,900
- Floral Knight! Floral Knight!
- He!

238
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm begging you, okay?

239
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,900
Floral Knight, I'm begging you!

240
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,750
What are you doing?

241
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,540
This is really serious.

242
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,220
Prince Chang's situation
can't be delayed.

243
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,140
It's not just about you and me,

244
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,100
if anything happens,

245
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,740
the MAA is finished!

246
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,100
Yes, Floral Knight.

247
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,620
He was wrong before.

248
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,780
I'll punish him for you.

249
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,260
But right now, it concerns
the entire MAA.

250
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,380
I beg you too.

251
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,020
No matter what,

252
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,580
I am a member of the MAA.

253
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,580
Let's leave it at that for now.

254
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,660
You two, get up.

255
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,180
Thank you, Floral Knight!

256
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,700
Thank you, Floral Knight!

257
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,340
Thank you, Mr. Zhuge,
for your understanding!

258
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,420
Mr. Zhuge,

259
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,060
(Tiger)
this is your token.

260
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,020
What about me?

261
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,100
You're just a Chou-ranked hero,

262
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,340
why are you trying to butt in?

263
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,100
I... We're a team!

264
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,340
We must act together!

265
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,540
(Team Member List - Team Name)
Team request:

266
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,340
Zhu Gou Team.

267
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,180
Floral Knight,

268
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,180
Mr. Zhuge, are you sure

269
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,380
you want to form a team
with a Chou-ranked hero?

270
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,180
Yes. Later on,

271
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,500
I'll add Ma Yingdan's name
to the team name too.

272
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,460
Don't add me.

273
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,060
Zhu Gou Team Ma?

274
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,580
Or Zhu Gou Ma Team?

275
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,740
Don't add me!

276
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,260
Alright then.

277
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,700
Mr. Gou,

278
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,980
could you please stop causing trouble?

279
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,620
As long as you can complete
this mission,

280
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,420
the MAA will fully support you.

281
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,140
We thank you.

282
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,860
Take care of your health.

283
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,060
Yingdan,

284
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,660
Zhu Gou Ma Team is not good for you?

285
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,580
Nope.

286
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,260
My heart

287
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,060
keeps pounding.

288
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,140
I just have this feeling

289
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,380
that something bad is going to happen.

290
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,980
(Juhong Pavilion)

291
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,260
Your Highness.

292
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,140
Please be careful.

293
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,260
- Alright, alright.
- Easy!

294
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,260
Welcome, Your Highness!

295
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,500
Welcome, My Lady!

296
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,780
Looks like it's time to notify
the Vice Chief.

297
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,700
Let's go.

298
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,060
Welcome, Your Highness!

299
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,540
Welcome, My Lady!

300
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,580
Lord Deng,

301
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,740
why did Eunuch Deng send you

302
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,620
to this godforsaken place?

303
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,780
He always has his reasons.

304
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,700
So when are you going back
to the imperial city?

305
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,380
After the Hero Gathering ends.

306
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,220
So mysterious.

307
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,780
Greetings, Lord Deng.

308
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,900
My Lady.

309
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,020
Why are you here?

310
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,900
With the demonic sect stirring unrest,

311
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,260
and incidents involving the MAA's

312
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,540
Vice Chairman and the Puppet Knight

313
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,220
are drawing the court's attention.

314
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,860
I've come with my father to investigate.

315
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,740
She insisted on tagging along

316
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,180
during my inspection.

317
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,020
Well,

318
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,020
it's been a while since you two
last met.

319
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,540
By the way,

320
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,580
where are the people

321
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,540
from the MAA?

322
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,020
Here we come.

323
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,700
Welcome, Your Highness!

324
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,740
Welcome, My Lady!

325
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,620
Perfect timing.

326
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,540
Tonight, we'll rely on all of you

327
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,580
to protect His Highness
and the Princess.

328
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,700
It's our duty.

329
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,500
- This way, please.
- Let's go.

330
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,860
Your Highness, please.

331
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,100
My Lady, please.

332
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,380
This chair's really hard.

333
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,020
We're honored by your visit,
Your Highness.

334
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,860
Huizhou can't compare
to the imperial city,

335
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,020
so if anything is lacking

336
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,860
in hospitality,

337
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,580
please forgive me.

338
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,980
No worries.

339
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Everyone,

340
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,180
with the demonic sect

341
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,940
growing more rampant,

342
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,540
the MAA must

343
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,740
closely cooperate

344
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,660
with the imperial court

345
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,900
to resist the demonic sect's invasion

346
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,060
and restore peace to the world.

347
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,660
Wise words, Your Highness.

348
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,700
Very true.

349
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,220
Cheers.

350
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,700
Rest assured, Your Highness.

351
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,940
Since the MAA's founding, our mission

352
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,100
has been to uphold justice
and protect the people.

353
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,500
Maintaining peace in the martial world

354
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,900
and safeguarding the nation

355
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,660
is our duty.

356
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,100
Hearing this

357
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,460
pleases me greatly.

358
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,340
It shows that Wu Guangming

359
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,860
recommended the right person.

360
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,420
Since the position of Vice Chairman
is vacant,

361
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,380
I've come to deliver a message
from Wu Guangming.

362
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,660
He Changzai will become

363
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,620
the new Vice Chairman of the MAA.

364
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

365
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,300
I should thank the Chairman too.

366
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,140
Come on, sit.

367
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,940
This is wine I brought from the palace,

368
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,940
to celebrate He Changzai's promotion.

369
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,660
Thank you, Your Highness!

370
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,020
Thank you, everyone!

371
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,500
Congratulations, Vice Chairman He!

372
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,620
Thank you, thank you!

373
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,220
I'm truly honored.

374
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,260
Good!

375
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,420
Lord Deng,

376
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,340
from here on,

377
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,060
we'll be relying on your guidance.

378
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,860
Let's hope the MAA

379
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,860
and the imperial court

380
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,020
can work hand in hand to protect
this nation.

381
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,420
I'm just a constable.

382
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,660
Everything depends on you, sir.

383
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,940
How modest.

384
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,540
You're too modest, Lord Deng.

385
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,780
Before coming to Huizhou,

386
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,060
I learned much about your achievements

387
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,900
from Eunuch Deng.

388
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,700
From a young age, you've been sharp,

389
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,940
loyal, and capable.

390
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,260
Your future is limitless.

391
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,740
Therefore, I entrust you, Lord Deng,

392
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,820
to build strong ties with the MAA

393
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,580
and fight the demonic sect together

394
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,600
to restore peace to the nation.

395
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,980
Yes, Your Highness.

396
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,660
Lord Deng,

397
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,460
my daughter Linglong has long
admired you.

398
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,860
I've discussed this with Eunuch Deng,

399
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,540
and would like to betroth her to you.

400
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,980
What do you think?

401
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,300
Congratulations, Lord Deng!

402
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,540
Congratulations!

403
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,540
Your Highness,

404
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,140
I truly don't dare aim so high.

405
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,460
Lord Deng,

406
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,860
please sit down.

407
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,780
No need to belittle yourself.

408
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,340
Linglong is thoughtful

409
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,420
and perceptive.

410
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,020
When I learned she had feelings for you,

411
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,700
I felt relieved.

412
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,260
You were raised by Eunuch Deng,

413
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,580
your character and background are clear.

414
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,500
Your praise is too kind.

415
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,340
I'm deeply humbled.

416
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,540
I only fear I may not live up to

417
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,540
Her Ladyship's feelings.

418
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,180
If Lord Deng and I

419
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,060
could walk this life together,

420
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,060
it would be my greatest happiness.

421
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,460
By the way, Yunfeng,

422
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,940
now that the engagement is set,

423
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,100
shouldn't you change how you address me?

424
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,180
Father,

425
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,460
I haven't seen Lord Deng in years.

426
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,500
We need more time to get to know
each other.

427
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,140
Don't scare him off.

428
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,900
Ah, I'm being too eager.

429
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,700
I'll give you two more time
to reconnect.

430
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,700
Your Highness,

431
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,580
if Her Ladyship

432
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,620
is truly engaged to Lord Deng,

433
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,500
that would be a major event
in the martial world.

434
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,340
Yes, yes. Come, drink!

435
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,620
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

436
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,900
What do we do next?

437
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,300
Well...

438
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,740
Drink.

439
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,460
I'll go get more liquor.

440
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,310
- I'll go.
- I'll go.

441
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,860
Sit down.

442
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,540
I, a humble girl,

443
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,980
will go get liquor for you both.

444
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,220
She really loves drinking, huh?

445
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,140
You fool. She's definitely

446
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,860
heading to the kitchen

447
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,060
to snoop around.

448
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,220
So what do you think

449
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,300
Prince Chang came here for?

450
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,780
Forget that for now.

451
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,160
You should be more worried
about yourself.

452
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,980
Me?

453
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,940
I think that whole Vice Chairman thing,

454
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,980
Ma Yingdan

455
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,260
won't let it go that easily.

456
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,700
She's here to protect Prince Chang.

457
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,220
Yet she went to get liquor.

458
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,500
She's probably

459
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,140
coming back and poison you.

460
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,820
No way.

461
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,940
If she wanted to poison me,

462
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,260
I wouldn't still be sitting here.

463
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,740
Could it be my charm worked on her?

464
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,020
You just said the least likely
possibility.

465
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,500
I'm not handsome enough?

466
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,060
Yes, you are.

467
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,980
Anyway, when she

468
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,260
comes back with that liquor,

469
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,700
we better be careful.

470
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,120
Talking bad about me?

471
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,820
I'm not some petty villain.

472
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,860
Yeah, me neither.

473
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,050
Drink!

474
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,700
Drink!

475
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,260
Relax.

476
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,500
I'm not an idiot.

477
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,660
I can tell right from wrong.

478
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,420
I won't let hatred blind me.

479
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,220
Tonight,

480
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,220
I offer you both a toast

481
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,540
as a gesture of goodwill.

482
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
Told you.

483
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,380
Petty man.

484
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,500
Generous woman.

485
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,340
(Juhong Pavilion)

486
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,220
Why aren't any other

487
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,140
MAA heroes around?

488
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:06,060
(Juhong Pavilion)

489
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,540
No! No way!

490
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,620
Protect His Highness!

491
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,580
Everyone, go!

492
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,760
Take down Prince Chang!

493
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,620
- Yes!
- Let's go!

494
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,540
Oh no.

495
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,380
Zhuge!

496
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,060
Yingdan!

497
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,100
My Lady, watch out!

498
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,740
My Lady!

499
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,020
Don't move.

500
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,460
Let go of Yingdan!

501
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,340
- Don't worry about me!
- Don't do anything stupid!

502
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,020
Gou Lingfeng!

503
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,620
Let go of Ma Yingdan!

504
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,220
We'll trade Prince Chang for her!

505
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,020
I'm still here! You seriously
crossed the line!

506
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,540
I need you to keep them in check.

507
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,860
Yeah, right.

508
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,340
Prince Chang,

509
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,540
you think we care about you?

510
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,380
We just want you dead.

511
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,060
I have no grudge against you.

512
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,660
Why do you want me dead?

513
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,500
No grudge?

514
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,860
You must've forgotten

515
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,540
how the court slaughtered
our Divine Sect.

516
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,180
We crawled out of the flames,

517
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,460
waiting in silence,

518
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,180
just for the day

519
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,140
we could seize the true culprit, you.

520
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,580
Surprised, huh?

521
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,860
That day has finally come.

522
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,860
You...

523
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,260
I won't stoop to your level.

524
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,860
Just release that lady hero.

525
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,140
Ma Yingdan is

526
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,460
far more valuable than you.

527
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,500
Chief,

528
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,580
you can rest

529
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,940
in peace now.

530
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,740
Let me go!

531
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,820
Don't struggle.

532
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,780
We're on the same side.

533
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,140
Like hell we are!

534
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,180
Don't you get it yet?

535
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,780
The Vice Chairman was the Chief of
our Divine Sect's Alchemy Division.

536
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,820
Come with me.

537
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,180
Fulfill the mission our Chief
left behind.

538
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,860
Become our living catalyst.

539
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,580
Our target this time

540
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,940
is you

541
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,420
and Prince Chang.

542
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,260
But you are the most important.

543
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,660
M-My hand...

544
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,940
It's poisoned...

545
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,620
I-I'm dying...

546
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,740
At least help me up, will you?

547
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,340
My time's

548
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,540
almost up.

549
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,620
Tell my old man

550
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,660
that his son

551
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,780
never became a great hero,

552
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,460
but he was always a good person.

553
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,820
Also,

554
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,900
I've always wanted to tell you,

555
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,740
I'm like you,

556
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,260
always excluded by others.

557
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,780
But don't

558
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,940
shut yourself off.

559
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,820
Or you'll just

560
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,100
end up lonelier and lonelier.

561
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,660
Anyway,

562
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,100
there's a package under my bed.

563
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,140
That's some gifts I never

564
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,940
got the chance to send home.

565
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,020
Could you send it to my home?

566
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,540
Anyway,

567
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,300
my favorite food is

568
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,900
the beef noodles from southern Huizhou.

569
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,260
But now I won't be

570
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,780
eating them again.

571
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,220
Speaking of beef,

572
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,580
I love dried beef the most.

573
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,660
- Will you stop already?
- Fang's shop makes the best.

574
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,140
And now that I think about it,

575
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,620
why am I still not dead?

576
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,260
Tianshan Snow Pill.

577
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
It suppresses the poison.

578
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,060
Suppresses?

579
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,860
Take one after each meal.

580
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,900
If you stop for more than 24 hours,

581
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,740
you'll die from the toxin.

582
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,540
So from now on,

583
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,220
you're responsible for me.

584
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,500
What did you eat?

585
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,540
This is the pill the Chief made

586
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,980
using Ma Yingdan's blood.

587
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,100
I...

588
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,420
The Vice Chairman spent years studying

589
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,380
and finally discovered

590
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,980
that Ma Yingdan is a
natural-born catalyst.

591
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,740
Just a drop of your blood

592
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,060
makes a pill

593
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,780
this powerful.

594
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,620
Too bad,

595
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,820
we don't have enough of it.

596
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,260
That's why we must take you
with us today.

597
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,300
I never imagined

598
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,100
the Vice Chairman

599
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,820
was really like this.

600
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,900
Your Demonic Sect

601
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,780
is truly depraved.

602
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,740
No wonder everyone despises you.

603
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,820
Zhuge!

604
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,570
Inside! Go!

605
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,220
Quick!

606
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,140
Get inside!

607
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,860
All done, Master.

608
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,060
That was too easy.

609
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,380
Why are you here?

610
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,700
Came with me to raid
the Alchemy Division

611
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,980
and protect Prince Chang.

612
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,980
I'll treat you to hot buns tomorrow.

613
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,820
- Yes!
- Yes!

614
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,740
Come on, move!

615
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,420
It's all over now.

616
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,820
Relax.

617
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,980
My men are amazing.

618
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,940
They all took Floral Knight's antidote

619
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,980
and are recovered.

620
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,100
And those injured

621
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,460
are resting at home.

622
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,620
Master, you okay?

623
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,540
- Move faster!
- Keep them secured!

624
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,140
Move!

625
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,100
Move!

626
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,900
- Faster!
- Look at them now,

627
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,780
they were all so smug just now.

628
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,780
Now look at them.

629
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,980
Floral Knight, please wait!

630
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,460
Gou Lingfeng.

631
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,500
This wasn't done by Zhuge Heng, was it?

632
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,220
Step aside!

633
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,660
He's so scary.

634
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,580
Zhuge, I gotta say,

635
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,340
no matter how strong you are,

636
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,220
you should've left one alive.

637
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,140
Look at this mess now.

638
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,060
Gou Lingfeng, who are you really?

639
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,740
I'm probably just someone

640
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,860
who doesn't get knocked out that easily.

641
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,380
We're giving you a way out, so take it.

642
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,460
Let's go. Don't waste time on him.

643
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,380
Come on, Yingdan.

644
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,780
The alliance between the MAA

645
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,380
and the court is more urgent than ever.

646
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,780
All relevant personnel, follow me
to the county office to discuss.

647
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,060
Deng Yunfeng,

648
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,260
you also come with us.

649
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,180
Yes.

650
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,980
My Lady,

651
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,940
are you alright?

652
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,820
Master, that was amazing!

653
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,100
What's wrong with you?

654
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,860
What's the point?

655
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,660
The MAA won't accept me
using demonic skills.

656
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,020
No one else accepts it either.

657
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,740
But seriously,

658
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,740
what kind of monster is Yingdan?

659
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,340
That guy

660
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,780
took a pill made from her blood

661
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,500
and turned into that.

662
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,100
Yingdan isn't the monster.

663
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,460
The one who ate her blood is.

664
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,820
Yeah, yeah.

665
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,740
Also,

666
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,100
my life's

667
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,100
in her hands now.

668
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,060
Gotta take it step by step.

669
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,100
I don't mind.

670
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,900
People called me a monster
since I was little.

671
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,380
Who am I to care if you're

672
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,660
part of the Demonic Sect or not?

673
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,220
In the MAA,

674
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,500
no one wanted to be near me.

675
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,100
Only the Vice Chairman helped me.

676
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,700
But I didn't expect this.

677
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,420
Hey, we all see you as a friend.

678
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,980
Honestly,

679
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,860
Yingdan, my master,

680
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,020
and Ling'er's dad

681
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,620
are all pitiful people.

682
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,180
Come on.

683
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,620
From now on, we're good friends.

684
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,420
I don't want to do this.

685
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,580
Your hand's black.

686
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,460
Come on.

687
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,380
Come on, come on.

688
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,620
- Deal!
- Deal!

689
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,380
Next

690
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,940
on the agenda

691
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,300
is to get Yingdan's name added

692
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,300
to the "Zhu Gou Team".

693
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,820
Zhu Gou Team?

694
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,140
No way!

695
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,300
Zhu Gou Team...

696
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,380
- Ying-ying-ying!
- Ying-ying-ying!

697
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,580
You are crazy!

698
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,100
- Ying-ying-ying!
- Ying-ying-ying!

699
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,740
You...

700
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,140
Leave now.

701
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,140
What do you want?

702
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,080
Take this and report

703
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,180
to the marked spot in the imperial city.

704
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,540
Someone will take you in.

705
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,660
Thank you for sparing us.

706
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,580
Let's go.

707
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,580
Was it that Gou guy

708
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,090
who killed your Vice Chief?

709
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,980
Yes.

710
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,060
Yes.

711
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,980
Get lost.

712
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,100
