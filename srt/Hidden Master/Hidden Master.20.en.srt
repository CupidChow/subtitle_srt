00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,750
Dad!

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,720
Dad!

3
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,390
My Lord.

4
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,510
What was the cause of death?

5
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,630
No wounds on the body.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,080
It appears he was poisoned.

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,510
But it's unclear for now.

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,430
Well...

9
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,230
My father had been bedridden for months.

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,120
But this morning,

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,560
he suddenly got up and walked.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,000
He insisted on going out

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,560
but was gone for quite a while.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,040
And then he...

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,360
He's the fourth victim.

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,280
The recent deaths share the same

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,520
causes and appearances.

64
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,580
This is the fourth case.

65
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,220
Huizhou City has seen several murders.

66
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,060
The people are gripped with fear.

67
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,180
And His Majesty is deeply troubled.

68
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,020
Prince Chang has ordered us
to investigate it thoroughly.

69
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,660
Chairman,

70
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,820
I have found out

71
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,300
Deng Yunfeng seems
to care about this case

72
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,620
very much.

73
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,100
What do you think

74
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,580
he's up to?

75
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,660
I believe

76
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,340
Eunuch Deng won't miss a single chance

77
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,500
to impress His Majesty.

78
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,020
That cunning fox.

79
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,820
Yu Yan'er, the daughter of Scholar Yu,

80
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,620
is currently in Huizhou.

81
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,300
I heard she was
about to enter the palace

82
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,740
and be titled Imperial Consort.

83
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,500
His Majesty is worried about her safety.

84
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,220
Changzai.

85
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,140
This time,

86
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,900
we must solve the case
before Deng Yunfeng does.

87
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,180
Understood.

88
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,060
Master!

89
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,940
Master, wait for me!

90
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,460
Ridiculous!

91
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,780
She's already in a poor state.

92
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,980
How could she treat patients?

93
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,100
And you.

94
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,980
Why didn't you tell me

95
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,180
her recoil got worse?

96
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,380
I didn't know either!

97
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,220
Yingdan didn't want to tell us.

98
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,180
I had to force Ling'er to tell me.

99
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,860
(Free Clinic)

100
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,980
Your illness...

101
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,740
Doctor, what should I do?

102
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,100
Gou, Heng.

103
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,500
- Use this...
- Yingdan, come here.

104
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,460
What are you doing?

105
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,060
Why didn't you tell me

106
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,500
your recoil worsened?

107
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,980
You need to rest.

108
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,540
Once you recover,

109
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,820
our Zhu Gou Team

110
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,940
still needs to take on tasks

111
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,140
and uphold justice together!

112
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,060
Enough.

113
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,340
I don't want to meddle in this anymore.

114
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,340
True justice

115
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,220
can't be achieved by

116
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,300
completing a few tasks.

117
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,260
What are you talking about?

118
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,860
Are you still the Ma Yingdan
from the association,

119
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,300
who's always arrogant

120
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,980
and giving me a hard time?

121
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,100
Gou,

122
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,700
you can't talk to her like that.

123
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,620
Ling'er.

124
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,140
I still don't like you.

125
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,940
Gou Lingfeng,

126
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,340
for the entire association

127
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,340
and even for Huizhou,

128
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,860
we are too insignificant.

129
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,220
No matter how hard you try

130
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,500
or powerful you are,

131
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,940
you can't change anything.

132
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,620
If you have time,

133
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,940
why not help ordinary people?

134
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,260
But...

135
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,380
My dream of being a great hero
hasn't come true.

136
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,340
Then go chase your dream!

137
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,300
Yes.

138
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,420
If you're not sick,

139
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,420
just go away.

140
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,060
We all need treatments.

141
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,580
- Yes.
- Exactly.

142
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,860
Go away!

143
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,820
(Free Clinic)
Don't worry.

144
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,820
Don't worry.

145
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,220
Everyone will be treated.

146
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,340
Make some space.

147
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,260
Don't hamper my work.

148
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,660
Ma Yingdan!

149
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,780
Are you trying to provoke me?

150
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,340
Yingdan!

151
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,180
You're seriously ill.

152
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,380
How can you treat others?

153
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,540
I'm fine.

154
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,860
It's crowded here.

155
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,100
Come back with me.

156
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,380
Let me take care of you, alright?

157
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,500
Don't you have tasks to do?

158
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,580
Hurry up and go!

159
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,380
Yes, just go!

160
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,900
- Go!
- Just go!

161
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,060
- Go!
- Please be quiet!

162
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,100
- I need treatment!
- Go!

163
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,020
Go!

164
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,180
Gou...

165
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,260
Yingdan!

166
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,620
- Yingdan!
- Yingdan!

167
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,020
Where are you going?

168
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,780
Yingdan, you're awake.

169
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,420
Yingdan, tell me,

170
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,380
how's the recoil?

171
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,340
Much better.

172
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,860
Are you lying to me again?

173
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,940
Are you dying?

174
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,540
Yes.

175
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,860
I am dying.

176
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,980
Are you happy now?

177
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,820
Master.

178
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,660
You're always the worst talker.

179
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,510
I...

180
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,370
Zhuge!

181
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,140
Yingdan.

182
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,900
You didn't mean that, right?

183
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,900
Let me test the poison.

184
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,300
I'll test as much as needed.

185
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,820
I... I can handle it.

186
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,660
It's pointless.

187
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,260
I've tried

188
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,540
everything I could.

189
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,780
Is there really nothing we can do?

190
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,180
My mother once told me

191
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,940
if I stayed in Poison Valley,

192
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,180
I'd be fine.

193
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,900
But...

194
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,340
I just wanted to see the outside world.

195
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,180
You must believe

196
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,820
everything in nature has balance.

197
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,540
There has to be

198
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,460
an antidote for your poison.

199
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,580
We just haven't found it yet.

200
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,900
You have to trust me.

201
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,500
I won't let anything happen to you.

202
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,700
Please trust me.

203
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,820
Nephew,

204
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,500
you look really good

205
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,860
today.

206
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,700
It seems Anicca Knight's medicine

207
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,220
really worked.

208
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,820
Can Anicca Knight

209
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,500
really bring someone back to life?

210
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,100
Why would I lie?

211
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,540
Look at my nephew.

212
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,340
The doctors in the city

213
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,900
all said he was going to die.

214
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,260
But after just two doses
of Anicca Knight's medicine,

215
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,500
look,

216
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,020
he can even work now.

217
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,900
Where does Anicca Knight live?

218
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,260
Well...

219
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,140
Nephew!

220
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,540
Nephew!

221
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,580
Nephew!

222
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,980
Call for help!

223
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,900
Okay.

224
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,060
Nephew!

225
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,740
I'm not disabled.

226
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,700
Let me pour it for you.

227
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,900
Yingdan!

228
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,140
Yingdan.

229
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,100
What's the matter?

230
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,580
There have been a few

231
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,380
mysterious cases in Huizhou.

232
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,980
We suspect it's a new kind of poison.

233
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,020
We need your help.

234
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,860
Don't you have a coroner?

235
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,500
Yingdan won't go.

236
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,060
Get out of here.

237
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,060
Let's go.

238
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,740
Let me help you.

239
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,340
Master, I found it.

240
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,220
What did you find?

241
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,070
A genius doctor.

242
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,920
Anicca Knight.

243
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,780
A genius doctor?

244
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,180
Can he cure Yingdan's illness?

245
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,580
Anicca Knight?

246
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,980
Who is he exactly?

247
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,020
He's quite odd.

248
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,140
His medicine is stronger than others.

249
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,380
Is it really reliable?

250
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,100
I don't trust him.

251
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,060
But we have to check it out first.

252
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,620
But the people in town said

253
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,100
his medicine really worked.

254
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,140
I think he's got real stuff.

255
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,420
Really? Let's go.

256
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,340
Let's go.

257
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:15,380
(Anicca Clinic)

258
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,140
This is Anicca Knight.

259
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,780
Senior,

260
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,860
I'm Gou Lingfeng.

261
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,060
You're not ill, so leave.

262
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,900
Senior, wait...

263
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,380
Senior, I...

264
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,180
Is he really a doctor?

265
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,300
He's got a really bad temper.

266
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,460
I've told you he has serious mania.

267
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,500
Master, how about this?

268
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,380
Try again.

269
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,380
Just get to the point.

270
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,300
Alright.

271
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,340
Senior.

272
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,620
I've told you that you're not sick.

273
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,020
Are you questioning my judgment?

274
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,140
Get out!

275
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,220
It's not an illness.

276
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,460
It's poison.

277
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,500
But you're not poisoned either.

278
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,400
- Get out!
- Wait...

279
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,940
Senior!

280
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,940
Brat,

281
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,180
you set me up!

282
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,820
I was so eager to save Yingdan.

283
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,540
No wonder he's called Anicca Knight.

284
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,500
He's so unpredictable!

285
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,820
This isn't over!

286
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,580
Senior.

287
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,660
It's not me.

288
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,020
It's my friend.

289
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,380
So, you're a psycho.

290
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,940
Incurable madness!

291
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,860
- What?
- Senior,

292
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,740
we have a friend

293
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,940
from the Poison Valley,

294
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,820
who's born poisonous.

295
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,060
The poison is starting to recoil,

296
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,300
and it's extremely painful,

297
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,820
like insects gnawing at the bones!

298
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,020
No medicine works anymore!

299
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,980
Anicca Knight, please help us!

300
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,900
What did you say?

301
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,540
Born poisonous?

302
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,700
Where is the person?

303
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,020
Take me there!

304
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,940
Senior, can you cure her?

305
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,860
Stop wasting time!

306
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,980
Yingdan,

307
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,700
just give it a try.

308
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,660
Just once, alright?

309
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,540
Yes, we're not lying.

310
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,460
Really.

311
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,580
Anicca Knight

312
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,340
is indeed strange,

313
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,500
but he's really capable.

314
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,420
That's right.

315
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,140
Enough.

316
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,980
I know you want to help me.

317
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,060
But...

318
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,260
I've tried everything I could.

319
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,780
It's no use.

320
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,740
If I have time,

321
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,700
I'd rather solve more cases.

322
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,580
Forget it.

323
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,420
Wait...

324
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,300
What should we do?

325
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,740
Where did this turtle come from?

326
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,660
Do you like it?

327
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,300
You...

328
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,380
Didn't I promise

329
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,540
to give you

330
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,220
an animal immune to poison?

331
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,940
- You...
- Look.

332
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,260
You can pet it like this.

333
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,620
It's totally fine.

334
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,060
Give it a try.

335
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,300
Come on.

336
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,180
Touch it.

337
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,540
See?

338
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,980
It's fine, right?

339
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,500
Yingdan.

340
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,420
Look,

341
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,580
when it senses danger,

342
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,180
it retreats into its shell,

343
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,100
trying to find a way to survive.

344
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,020
Humans are no different.

345
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,020
But my situation

346
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,660
is different.

347
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,820
How different?

348
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,700
Yingdan,

349
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,060
you have no idea

350
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,060
how much you mean to me.

351
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,380
Though

352
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,580
I'm foolish

353
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,980
and clumsy,

354
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,220
I've known all along

355
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,060
that I like you.

356
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,060
Gou Lingfeng,

357
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,900
you...

358
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,460
Don't feel pressured.

359
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,060
You don't need to respond.

360
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,020
I just want you to know

361
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,540
that besides

362
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,820
being a great hero,

363
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,900
I have another dream.

364
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,060
I hope that everything
goes well for you.

365
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,620
If it's possible,

366
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,140
I want to

367
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,420
spend the rest of my life

368
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,340
with you.

369
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,860
Where is Anicca Knight?

370
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,620
Will you see him?

371
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,500
That's great.

372
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,620
Se-Senior?

373
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,420
How... How is she?

374
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,380
What's all that about?

375
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,580
Just tell us!

376
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,100
Master, you...

377
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,380
Don't cry! Just tell us!

378
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,660
I knew it.

379
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,060
I'm hopeless.

380
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,900
Yingdan, you...

381
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,740
What?

382
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,820
Why don't you speak?

383
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,140
Why are you crying?

384
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,180
Master! Master!

385
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,860
I can't believe it!

386
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

387
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,420
I'm sorry.

388
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,140
Anicca Knight must be a quack.

389
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,460
Yes, he's a fraud.

390
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,740
A nasty fraud!

391
00:15:59,050 --> 00:15:59,900
Why would he cry?

392
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,020
Enough.

393
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,900
Thank you.

394
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,940
Are you serious?

395
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,260
Let's have a drink.

396
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,660
Come on.

397
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:16,860
Yingdan.

398
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,340
Stop saying this.

399
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,300
Actually, we...

400
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,020
couldn't help you at all.

401
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,860
- Yes.
- So, you know, huh?

402
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,460
Actually,

403
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,140
I'm quite satisfied.

404
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,380
When I was a child,

405
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,940
all the kids around

406
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,620
were afraid of me.

407
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,940
No one dared to approach me.

408
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,020
So I decided to leave

409
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,820
and see the world beyond Poison Valley.

410
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,940
I like my life now.

411
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,340
I've seen the world outside,

412
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,300
and I've made many friends.

413
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,300
Deng Yunfeng,

414
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,580
Little Zhan, Little Zhao,

415
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,420
and everyone in the association

416
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,140
have been so kind to me.

417
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,300
I'm very content.

418
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,140
Even if I were to die now,

419
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,780
I'd die without regret.

420
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,780
Yingdan,

421
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,220
how can you say that?

422
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,860
I'm here.

423
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,420
I won't let anything happen to you.

424
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,380
Besides,

425
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,860
why did you mention Deng Yunfeng?

426
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,700
Yingdan, don't worry.

427
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,620
We'll surely find the antidote for you.

428
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,540
Yes.

429
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,180
Yes, Yingdan.

430
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,500
They all said my illness was incurable,

431
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,940
but I'm fine now.

432
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,500
Don't worry, Yingdan.

433
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,020
I'm sure you'll be alright.

434
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,660
I've heard

435
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,980
there's a famous genius doctor
in Yongzhou.

436
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,180
Let's see the doctor tomorrow.

437
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
No need.

438
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,740
It's enough.

439
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,980
Ma Yingdan!

440
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,500
You need to behave.

441
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,700
Let's go tomorrow.

442
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,620
No!

443
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,980
It's no use.

444
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,260
I'll work.

445
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,220
Okay, let's drink.

446
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,900
Come on.

447
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,620
I need to rest now.

448
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,180
Are you okay?

449
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,820
- Yingdan, are you okay?
- Are you okay?

450
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,220
Are you okay?

451
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,460
(Free Clinic)

452
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,100
You...

453
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,500
What are you doing?

454
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,980
Protecting you.

455
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,260
You're our priority now.

456
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,900
You're in danger.

457
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,980
So, Zhuge and I

458
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,660
will take turns to stay with you.

459
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,500
Wherever you go,

460
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,380
we'll follow.

461
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,580
We won't leave you alone.

462
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,700
That's not necessary.

463
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,340
I've seen too many incurable patients.

464
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,660
It doesn't matter if I'm one of them.

465
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,860
- Delete!
- Delete!

466
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,940
You'll live a long life.

467
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,940
Yes, Yingdan,

468
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,900
you'll be blessed

469
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,180
by the endless sea

470
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,500
and live as long as the pine tree.

471
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,700
- Yes.
- Stop talking.

472
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,900
There have been several cases.

473
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,180
I heard another person died.

474
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,100
What's going on?

475
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,440
- No idea.
- Let's check it out.

476
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,060
It's terrifying.

477
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,710
Make way, please.

478
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,580
We're from

479
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,500
the association.

480
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,820
What brings you here?

481
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,100
Could it be...

482
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,540
Deng Yunfeng sent you here?

483
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,460
Nonsense.

484
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,420
We're just passing by.

485
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,980
We're not here to investigate.

486
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,860
Well, since you're here,

487
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,260
Floral Knight, please check it out.

488
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,580
What are you doing?

489
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,140
Didn't you say you've seen
so many dead people?

490
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,260
I don't want you to see another one.

491
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,300
It's him.

492
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,220
Stop saying that. It's terrifying.

493
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,140
You know him?

494
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,980
We met him at Anicca Clinic yesterday.

495
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
The patient?

496
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,420
Yes.

497
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,820
But...

498
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,980
But why does he look like this?

499
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,060
He seems happy.

500
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,180
What made him so happy?

501
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,700
Indeed.

502
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,100
It's weird.

503
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,740
We've seen several similar cases.

504
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,180
Yes, they're all...

505
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,900
It's dangerous outside.

506
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,500
It's a hallucinogenic drug

507
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,820
that causes paralysis

508
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,260
and makes people
die in happy hallucinations.

509
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,620
Floral Knight, do you know

510
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,180
what kind of drug this is?

511
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,100
I'm not sure about it.

512
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,580
I only know

513
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,300
the person must be an expert.

514
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,100
Creating hallucinations isn't hard.

515
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,780
But it's hard to make people

516
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,740
only feel happiness.

517
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,660
Everyone's here.

518
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,620
Gou Lingfeng.

519
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,100
Do you want to help him again?

520
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,700
We're really passing by.

521
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,220
We won't take sides.

522
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,700
Let's go.

523
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,580
Let's go.

524
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,780
Vice Chairman He,

525
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,980
have you found any clues?

526
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,500
(Tomorrow afternoon at Anicca Clinic,
I'll cure the lady. Anicca Clinic)

527
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,380
(Radiant Knight, Wu Guangming)
We live for justice!

528
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,700
(Uphold Justice, Selfless Sacrifice)
We live for justice!

529
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,900
The Hero Gathering is coming,

530
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,860
yet Huizhou has seen
many mysterious deaths.

531
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,740
Many citizens have been killed.

532
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,860
You've investigated it for a long time
but found nothing.

533
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,020
This is a disgrace to our association!

534
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,060
Now the case

535
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,460
has drawn His Majesty's attention.

536
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,700
It must be solved immediately.

537
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:08,820
Aye.

538
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,860
You have three days.

539
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,580
If you can't solve it,

540
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,660
everyone must be punished

541
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,780
according to the rules,

542
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,460
including me!

543
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,540
Aye!

544
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,060
Mr. Deng, please calm down.

545
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,500
Sorry,

546
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,140
I'm late.

547
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,140
Why are you late?

548
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,300
Well,

549
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,900
I prepared a surprise for you.

550
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,980
Vice Chairman He, you're so busy.

551
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,840
I'm flattered.

552
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,180
They must be the surprise.

553
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,140
That's true.

554
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,180
Well, the recent

555
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,140
murder cases

556
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,260
have

557
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,300
many connections

558
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,420
and a huge impact,

559
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,780
so I borrowed two experts

560
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,940
to assist us.

561
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,100
Please introduce

562
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,970
the so-called experts.

563
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,900
Yes, come on.

564
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,300
Let me introduce them.

565
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,780
This is the renowned Far-Sight Knight.

566
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,140
Nothing escapes his keen gaze.

567
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,700
He can spot birds miles away.

568
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,060
Hello, Mr. Deng.

569
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,180
We live for justice!

570
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,500
Over here.

571
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,580
A true genius.

572
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,780
I may not fully understand,

573
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,660
but I am deeply impressed.

574
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,580
What about this one?

575
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,580
Well,

576
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,940
he's Sniffer Knight.

577
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,900
Come on, Sniffer Knight,

578
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,060
introduce yourself.

579
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,620
They say my sense of smell is unmatched.

580
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,700
But I just can't take the credit.

581
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,980
After all, no one dares to claim

582
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,620
to be the greatest.

583
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,860
Speak less, smell more.

584
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,380
What's going on?

585
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,580
What a surprise.

586
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,780
Mr. Deng.

587
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,420
What was He Changzai doing?

588
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,500
Trying to provoke you?

589
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,100
The association is not so powerful.

590
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,140
Judging by those two losers,

591
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,140
we'll definitely win.

592
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,060
Be quiet.

593
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,660
We can't be careless.

594
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,420
We must seek help

595
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,220
and solve the case before they do.

596
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,460
Mr. Deng.

597
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,780
Why at this point?

598
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,860
Mr. Deng,

599
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,500
what's troubling you?

600
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,820
My godfather ordered me to

601
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,580
escort Yu Yan'er, the daughter of the

602
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,740
Grand Scholar, to the capital.

603
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,740
She will marry His Majesty

604
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,340
and be titled Imperial Consort.

605
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,460
Yu Yan'er?

606
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,780
She's famous in Huizhou.

607
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,060
Since born, she's been raised

608
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,740
as the future consort for His Majesty.

609
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,060
Many people envy her.

610
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,740
However,

611
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,140
it's said
she fell seriously ill a while ago.

612
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,060
I wonder if she has recovered.

613
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,980
What?

614
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,060
She was ill?

615
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,140
Has she recovered?

616
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,260
It's just a rumor.

617
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,500
I don't know if it's true.

618
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,180
No matter what,

619
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,860
we must solve this case

620
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,980
before Mr. He does.

621
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,780
Look,

622
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,300
go to the Yu Mansion tomorrow

623
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,820
and tell them to be prepared.

624
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,060
Once the case is solved,

625
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,380
we'll leave for

626
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,700
the Imperial City immediately.

627
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,180
Aye.

628
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,500
Enjoy your meal, My Lady.

629
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,340
I heard Ms. Yu

630
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,940
fell seriously ill.

631
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,660
Indeed.

632
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,460
She fell ill earlier this year.

633
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,020
Her body was covered in sores,

634
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,740
and her limbs felt weak.

635
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,780
We consulted renowned doctors,

636
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,380
but they couldn't cure her.

637
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,980
Fortunately, she's recovered.

638
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,220
Thanks to Doctor Anicca's

639
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,540
medicine,

640
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,100
she recovered quickly.

641
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,620
Doctor Anicca?

642
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,460
Are you sterilizing here?

643
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,140
You're too slow.

644
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,900
Mr. He,

645
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,060
these corpses

646
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,940
have the same medicine's scent.

647
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,340
They must've been to the same place.

648
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,220
What place?

649
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,860
Mr. He.

650
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,220
Give me some time,

651
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,820
and I'll definitely find it.

652
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,140
Follow the scent and find it.

653
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,060
Let's go.

654
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,500
Wait for me, Mr. He!

655
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,900
You can't just ask around

656
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,060
blindly like this.

657
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,180
We're not aimless.

658
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,860
A few days ago,
I visited the Fabric Shop.

659
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,140
The owner's nephew had cancer

660
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,340
and was dying.

661
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,660
Then he took Anicca Knight's pill

662
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,300
and became full of energy.

663
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,780
I saw him carrying

664
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,100
a pile of cloth like this

665
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,900
and working tirelessly in that shop.

666
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,500
He was almost running.

667
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,500
Well, Anicca Knight is so capable.

668
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,220
Why didn't he treat Yingdan?

669
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,220
Heng,

670
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,740
what did you just say?

671
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,580
I said Anicca Knight is so capable.

672
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,460
Why didn't he treat Yingdan?

673
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,020
The owner's nephew

674
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,340
died a few days ago.

675
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,500
What?

676
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,140
I remember you told me

677
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,540
that man with red marks on his face

678
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,020
also went to Anicca Clinic.

679
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,660
Ling'er.

680
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,660
I need to go to the association.

681
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,060
We've found the killer.

682
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,860
Ling'er, thank you.

683
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,820
Senior.

684
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,980
You're really here.

685
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,940
Stop.

686
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
Senior, why do you cry
when you see me?

687
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,860
No...

688
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,020
I just didn't expect it.

689
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,220
Didn't expect it?

690
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,980
So,

691
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,540
can you really save me?

692
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,300
Miss,

693
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,940
you don't have much time left, right?

694
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,100
(Martial Artists Association)

695
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,300
I'll do my best to find
renowned doctors in the Imperial City

696
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,660
to save Floral Knight.

697
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,260
Lingfeng.

698
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,780
Don't give up.

699
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,780
Thank you, Uncle Wu.

700
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,300
I'm really

701
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,500
worried about her.

702
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,380
Chairman!

703
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,020
- Zhuge?
- Master, why are you here?

704
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,340
I went to Yongzhou
to look for renowned doctors

705
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,460
to save Yingdan,

706
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,980
but they said they couldn't help us.

707
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,860
So, I'm here to ask for
the chairman's help.

708
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,100
Why are you here?

709
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,220
President, I've found the killer.

710
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,380
- Found it?
- Who is it?

711
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,300
Anicca Knight.

712
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,620
Anicca Knight?

713
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,700
Yes, Anicca Knight.

714
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,020
All the victims

715
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,740
visited his clinic before they died.

716
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,100
Gou Lingfeng, Zhuge Heng, listen.

717
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,300
Capture the criminal.

718
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,220
We can't let anyone

719
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,220
in Huizhou get harmed again.

720
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,140
- Aye!
- Aye!

721
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,340
I've asked about it.

722
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,940
Anicca Clinic is right ahead.

723
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,340
Keep up.

724
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,860
Go, go!

725
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,020
Anicca Clinic
Follow me, follow me!

726
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,060
- Your face looks oily.
- This way!

727
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,060
Spleen-stomach deficiency.

728
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,460
You've been constipated lately, right?

729
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,060
Stop!

730
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Your philtrum is short,

731
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,500
and you sweat a lot.

732
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,700
You have weak kidneys.

733
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,660
Anicca Knight!

734
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,860
I've learned from the victims' family

735
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,380
that all of them

736
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,100
took your medicine before their deaths.

737
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,220
They got better for a while

738
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,540
but then suddenly died!

739
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,900
I'm arresting you

740
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,580
for murder.

741
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,820
Deng Yunfeng, listen,

742
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,460
- I caught him first!
- I caught him first!

743
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,620
- I have evidence.
- Show me!

744
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,540
Show him!

745
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,060
I have it now.

746
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,500
Shameless!

747
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,860
I learned it from you.

748
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,740
- Stop, both of you!
- Get off him!

749
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,700
Did Yingdan come here?

750
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,540
Gou Lingfeng!

751
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,140
- Stay out of this!
- I will.

752
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,860
I just want to know if Yingdan came!

753
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,340
What are you doing?

754
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,460
Listen to me!

755
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,500
Be quiet!

756
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,740
Look at you.

757
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,020
You're both big figures.

758
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,260
How could you argue like this?

759
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,140
You're about to break my arms!

760
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,140
Don't argue, just fight.

761
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,540
I'll go with the winner!

762
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,340
Stop!

763
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,020
Wait, wait!

764
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,220
It hurts! Get off me!

765
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,140
He.

766
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,260
Why don't we arrest him

767
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,260
and write the report together?

768
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,120
We'll share the credit.

769
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:50,980
Deal.

770
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,180
Gou Lingfeng!

771
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,380
I don't care what they want.

772
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,700
I just want to know if Yingdan came.

773
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,580
Ms. Ma did come here.

774
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,420
Then where is she now?

775
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,460
Enough, stop talking!

776
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,620
- She left!
- Go!

777
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,540
He Changzai...

778
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,980
Where is she now?

779
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,260
(The End of Episode 20)

780
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,740
Liu Guang.

781
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,940
Did you really throw away the pills?

782
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,660
We worked so hard

783
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,420
to make these pills.

784
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,980
How could you throw them away?

785
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,580
What if we need them?

786
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,740
We won't!

787
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,740
Why?

788
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,220
Lan'er is gone.

789
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,540
We'll never use them again.

790
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,900
