Master.

4
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,480
I've mastered this martial art.

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,240
- Really?
- What's next?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,910
I'll teach you the Demonic...

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,360
No, no, Vajra Blade Art.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,000

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,110

(He Changzai, Sky Knight)

59
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,560
He.

60
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,950
What brings you here?

61
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,600
Hand it over.

62
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,390
Be careful not to go overboard.

63
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,200
What's wrong?

64
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,390
I'm telling you, He,

65
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,240
at your age,

66
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,600
why even stir things up with Deng Yunfeng?

67
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,440
The price of official salt is soaring,

68
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,840
and private salt is impossible to get.

69
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,280
Last time,

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,440
you only gave me this tiny bit.

71
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,310
I just went to buy salt,

72
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,390
and nearly got caught by them.

73
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,910
What's that supposed to mean?

74
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,110
This trade is tied to both sides.

75
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,150
They used to turn a blind eye,

76
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,480
but now it's different.

77
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,430
We can't make a living anymore.

78
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,070
Alright, alright, Dexterous Knight.

79
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,920
I...

80
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,800
I'm just trying to lure Ye Dahei out.

81
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,960
Wait for Ye Dahei to come out?

82
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,880
I would've perished in boredom by then.

83
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,080
Fine, fine, take a little less.

84
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,160
Hurry up and close the case.

85
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,430
Restore the price of salt.

86
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,560
If you keep dragging this on,

87
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,200
the people will rise against you.

88
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,110
Be quicker.

89
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,240
Fine, I will.

90
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,160
I will.

91
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,910
She wears white robes every night,

92
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,200
roaming around this place.

93
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,830
So mysterious and eerie.

94
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,590
It's truly frightening.

95
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,510
We can't leave things like this.

96
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,710
What should we do next?

97
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,560
I think

98
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,040
we can disguise ourselves,

99
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,950
and lure the molester out.

100
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,640
Well,

101
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,830
I've tried that before.

102
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,750
It doesn't work.

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,120
Yingdan,

104
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,800
let's just say,

105
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,160
your presence

106
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,680
is overflowing with power

107
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,880
just by standing here.

108
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,800
You might as well have 'Heroine'

109
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,870
written all over you.

110
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,560
Tell me, which reckless molester

111
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,910
would dare to mess with you?

112
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,590
Honestly, based on my analysis,

113
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,710
the women targeted by the culprit

114
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,350
are delicate and timid.

115
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,880
Qing'er fits that description too.

116
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,350
So I suspect

117
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,680
the molester himself

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,030
might be a frail and weak person.

119
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,240
Me? Playing weak?

120
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,350
That's not me.

121
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,040
Don't look at me like that.

122
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,590
I can't play that role either.

123
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,160
Heng, Yingdan.

124
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,800
- Ling'er.
- Ling'er.

125
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,720
Why are you here?

126
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,950
Over the past few days,

127
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,430
you've helped me a lot.

128
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,310
I want to contribute something as well.

129
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,870
I made a mask
based on Qing'er's description.

130
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,510
Heng, put this on.

131
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,750
Test it out later.

132
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,150
See if Qing'er is lying.

133
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,440
Ling'er, this is a good idea.

134
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,550
Qing'er.

135
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,160
Qing'er.

136
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,080
Qing'er.

137
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,160
Qing...

138
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,800
Is it really you?

139
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,350
You're finally back.

140
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,350
I've waited so long for you.

141
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,480
Yingdan, help!

142
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,400
Stop it!

143
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,920
Qing'er!

144
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,840
Qing'er.

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,150
So it really is you.

146
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,440
Why did you lie?

147
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,710
Why did you do this?

148
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,320
Whose face is this?

149
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,030
I don't know his name.

150
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,950
I'm also searching for him.

151
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,710
I'll tell you everything.

152
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,320
It happened five years ago.

153
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,720
Cousin, what are you doing?

154
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,880
(Yixiang Garden)
Let go!

155
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,710
- Let me go!
- Stop talking!

156
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,430
You disgraceful scoundrel!

157
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,480
Take her inside.

158
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,880
- Let go!
- Stop it!

159
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,680
Who's there?

160
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,950
Let go of that girl.

161
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,470
Who are you?

162
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,240
None of your business.

163
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,160
Get him!

164
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,880
Are you alright, miss?

165
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,080
Thank you, sir, for saving me.

166
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,350
I've admired Mr. Yang since I was a child.

167
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,710
You're just like him, the One-Armed Hero.

168
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,800
Back then, he and I

169
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,910
didn't exchange names or addresses.

170
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,590
We only agreed to meet here in five years.

171
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,950
But the five years are up,

172
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,200
and he hasn't shown up.

173
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,470
I searched Huizhou for one-armed men.

174
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,150
None of them were him.

175
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,600
So I faked the One-Armed Hero,

176
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,200
committing these harassment cases,

177
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
in hopes of
drawing the MAA's attention,

178
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,640
and having them help me find him.

179
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,390
So that's the truth.

180
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,240
Qing'er, did you know

181
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
if you keep doing this,

182
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,560
your life will be ruined?

183
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,510
Qing'er, you're being too naive.

184
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,200
Qing'er risked everything,

185
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,030
just to find someone.

186
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,880
Such unwavering devotion.

187
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,510
What should we do?

188
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,640
Are we really going to

189
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,200
capture Qing'er?

190
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,830
If we do that,

191
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,240
the two lovers will never meet again.

192
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,080
Master, why have you returned?

193
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,270
Zhuge,

194
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,190
Ling'er,

195
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,160
Yingdan.

196
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,510
I need your help.

197
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,830
Exploiting the people

198
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,080
and indulging in privilege.

199
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,950
That's nothing short of robbery.

200
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,200
Real demonic sect members

201
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,710
demonstrate their greatness

202
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,200
through philanthropy and public services.

203
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,640
Let's go, Master.

204
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,760
We'll reclaim the private salt deal.

205
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,080
Can you act serious for once?

206
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,510
Am I not serious enough?

207
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,990
Gou Lingfeng.

208
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,430
Are you going to help Ye Dahei?

209
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,350
I...

210
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,870
What about the MAA?

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,320
I'm helping the people,

212
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,400
not the demonic sect.

213
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,200
Ye Dahei is already in a miserable state.

214
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,350
He... he's not as bad
as He Changzai claims.

215
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,760
Master.

216
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
I am willing to go.

217
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,840
But Ye Dahei is dealing in illegal salt.

218
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,960
What you're doing is...

219
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,880
She is right.

220
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,200
What you're doing

221
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,200
is playing with fire.

222
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,630
Ye Dahei?

223
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,920
How is his portrait here?

224
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,040
Ye Dahei?

225
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,200
The molester is Ye Dahei.

226
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,080
What?

227
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,470
The molester?

228
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,350
I'm busy. What's your problem?

229
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,750
Do you still remember Qing'er?

230
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,520
Qing'er?

231
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,000
Who's Qing'er?

232
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,910
Five years ago,

233
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,920
you saved a girl in the betrothal.

234
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,550
You refuse to take that path

235
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,800
not because you're scared, right?

236
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,510
Do you even know,

237
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,750
in order to meet you,

238
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,590
she's now posing as a molester
to commit crimes?

239
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,800
Even today,

240
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,280
she's still waiting for you.

241
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,200
But you don't dare show yourself up.

242
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,520
Qing'er?

243
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,920
Her name is Qing'er, huh?

244
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,350
That's such a lovely name.

245
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,270
Let's go.

246
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,710
I'll take you to see her.

247
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,630
No, no, no.

248
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,630
I'm not going.

249
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,550
I'm not.

250
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,950
Fine.

251
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,160
Then I'll go back and tell her

252
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,710
that the current Ye Dahei

253
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,720
is a notorious villain from the demonic sect.

254
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,600
You...

255
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,230
He's also nothing but an emotional fraud.

256
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,590
You wouldn't dare!

257
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,870
She's risking prison

258
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,440
just to see you.

259
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,230
Yet you're hiding here,
too afraid to face her.

260
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,590
I...

261
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,080
It's not that I don't want to see her.

262
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,750
It's just that I made her a promise.

263
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,750
I told her when I returned,

264
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,160
I would be a hero, famed and accomplished.

265
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,440
I can't let her see me like this.

266
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,920
What do you mean by "like this"?

267
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,710
I didn't become a hero.

268
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,590
Instead, I joined the demonic sect.

269
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,190
And the key point is

270
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,590
I somehow grew back my hand.

271
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,800
What's the deal with your hand?

272
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,920
Five years ago,

273
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,160
I had a habit.

274
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,520
When it turned cold,

275
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,590
I'd tuck my hand inside for warmth.

276
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,440
That day, as I hid my hand,

277
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,990
I happened to see someone bullying a girl.

278
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,400
So I stepped in to help.

279
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,800
That was the first time

280
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,920
someone ever admired me like that.

281
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,800
Thank you, sir, for saving me.

282
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,440
Oh, you mean this?

283
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,680
I've admired Mr. Yang since I was a child.

284
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,920
You're just like him, the One-Armed Hero.

285
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,070
You...

286
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,560
must have endured many hardships, right?

287
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,800
It wasn't too bad.

288
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,830
After all,

289
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,800
my dream since childhood
was to become a hero.

290
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,230
Although, during a great battle,

291
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,040
my arm was severed by the demonic sect.

292
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,800
But I never gave up on my dream.

293
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,240
Everything

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,990
was just about starting over again.

295
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,040
You're truly strong.

296
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,710
Can you tell me your name?

297
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,160
Just call me the One-Armed Hero.

298
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,080
One-Armed Hero.

299
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,990
Will you come to see me?

300
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,280
I...

301
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,880
I will.

302
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,040
Then I'll wait for you.

303
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,360
Alright.

304
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,920
But please...

305
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,110
give me five years.

306
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,430
After five years,

307
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,160
I will come back for you.

308
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,800
What's wrong with that?

309
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,830
Are all demonic sect members evil?

310
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,320
Take my master as an example.

311
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,400
Well, he is a bad person.

312
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,230
But what about me?

313
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,350
You?

314
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,990
Then why are you still single?

315
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,990
Does that even matter?

316
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,910
What matters is

317
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,790
you love her,

318
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,160
and she loves you.

319
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
That's enough.

320
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,230
Why worry about anything else?

321
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,040
When you completely lose her,

322
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,830
it'll be too late to regret.

323
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,550
But...

324
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,160
she admires the One-Armed Hero.

325
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,080
And I'm not the One-Armed Hero.

326
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,440
I... I... You...

327
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,390
You want to
be the One-Armed Hero, huh?

328
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,920
Come on, let me help you.

329
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,870
Gou, listen to me,

330
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,790
I...

331
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,040
What I mean is

332
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,200
her ideal hero is the One-Armed Hero.

333
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,350
But I'm not him.

334
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,250
How can I...

335
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,040
Why is the One-Armed Hero admired?

336
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,390
Because he sacrificed his arm

337
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,590
to protect the one he loved.

338
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,350
That's where his charm lies,

339
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,280
not in having one arm.

340
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,710
What you need to learn now is

341
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,040
how to devote yourself to your beloved,

342
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,440
instead of

343
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,920
hiding here and hesitating.

344
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,070
Gou.

345
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,040
Thank you so much.

346
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,110
What you said makes perfect sense.

347
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,710
I understand now.

348
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,960
You're so capable,

349
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,110
but why are you still single?

350
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,720
That's not important.

351
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,640
Come on.

352
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,710
I'll help you become the One-Armed Hero.

353
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,680
Again?

354
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,830
Gou!

355
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,620
(Huizhou Warehouse)

356
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,550
Hurry up, hurry up!

357
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,710
Place the items properly!

358
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,880
Move faster!

359
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,800
Stay focused!

360
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,350
Quickly!

361
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,510
Heroes, thank you all

362
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,590
for helping me.

363
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,630
Hurry, hurry!

364
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,230
On behalf of the people, I thank you all.

365
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,320
From now on,

366
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,720
my life belongs to all of you.

367
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,840
- Don't be so cheesy.
- Hurry up, didn't you hear?

368
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,230
What's our next move?

369
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,200
In a moment,

370
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,230
I'll take two people in
through the window.

371
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,300
You split up through the front door.

372
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,150
- Got it.
- Remember,

373
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,710
it must be done before 1 AM.

374
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

375
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,550
Yingdan?

376
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,440
Wait...

377
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,360
You...

378
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,550
Quickly!

379
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,510
Stop right there.

380
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,430
What are you doing here?

381
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,560
Where are your men?

382
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,470
Mr. Deng has rewards.

383
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,670
Gather everyone now.

384
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,920
Rewards?

385
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,550
Fine, forget it.

386
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,120
Wait.

387
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,200
Guys!

388
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,230
Come, gather up!

389
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,180
Mr. Deng has rewards.

390
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,670
Is this the whole crew?

391
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:41,760
You!

392
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,830
Move, move, move.

393
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,590
Did it work?

394
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,920
Really?

395
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,120
You're impressive.

396
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,230
Truly impressive.

397
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,670
She is indeed a heroine.

398
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,920
Respect.

399
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,030
This is nothing.

400
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,230
She has more tricks up her sleeve.

401
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,670
Impressive.

402
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,590
Three fools,

403
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,240
follow me.

404
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,750
- You three, move!
- Move!

405
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,710
Alright, let's go.

406
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,470
Gou,

407
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,830
Zhuge,

408
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,590
and Ms. Ma,

409
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,800
I truly owe you my gratitude.

410
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,350
You three embody Martial heroes.

411
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,920
Even stealing salt,

412
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,680
you do it with such ease.

413
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,080
Wait, wait, wait.

414
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,350
Who are you hinting at?

415
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,470
Today's events,

416
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,350
I will remember deeply.

417
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,920
If there's a chance in the future,

418
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,710
I will repay you a hundredfold.

419
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,520
We people of the martial world

420
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,040
value loyalty above all.

421
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,990
Everyone, I have no way

422
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,590
to repay your kindness.

423
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,470
Truly, I feel deeply ashamed.

424
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,230
Therefore,

425
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,160
at this moment and in this setting,

426
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,790
I shall compose a poem

427
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,840
- to express my gratitude.
- What?

428
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,830
- Trust me.
- Why?

429
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,720
On a moonless night,
the fisherman's lamp glimmers.

430
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,480
A lone light pierces the dark.

431
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,670
With a bag of salt in hand,

432
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,910
I thank you all for your assistance.

433
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,590
Never mind, I have another one.

434
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,240
- Salt in hand...
- Ye!

435
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,590
That's enough.

436
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,320
You're back!

437
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,040
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

438
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,510
How wonderful.

439
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,280
How have you been?

440
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,270
I...

441
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,510
I'm sorry.

442
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,350
I failed to rise to glory.

443
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,110
I broke my promise.

444
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,040
I've heard everything from them.

445
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,750
You found your way back

446
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,800
to the right path.

447
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,240
To me, you're already a hero.

448
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,200
See? I told you.

449
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,070
If she likes you,

450
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,720
whatever you do is right.

451
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,910
Have a seat.

452
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,000
Let me take a good look at you.

453
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,590
- We should go.
- Alright.

454
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,440
Let's go.

455
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,480
Can you see clearly now?

456
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,640
I... Yes,

457
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,560
I can see clearly.

458
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,430
- Move closer!
- Hurry up!

459
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,480
Move closer.

460
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,990
What's going on?

461
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,830
Sir, we were drugged unconscious.

462
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,830
When we woke up,

463
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,910
the salt was gone.

464
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,590
What use are you to me?

465
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,800
Please pardon us, sir.

466
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,720
It must be that Ye Dahei.

467
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,830
Search the entire city.

468
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,240
If he can't be found,

469
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,590
you will all be punished

470
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,670
according to the law.

471
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,590
Didn't you hear me?

472
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,100
Yes, sir!

473
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,040
Xiaobai.

474
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,470
Yingdan.

475
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,350
Where's Zhuge Heng?

476
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,560
I don't know.

477
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,900
Probably looking for Ling'er.

478
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,390
Ye and Qing'er are still cozying up.

479
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,080
Watching the moon on the roof.

480
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,640
How lovely.

481
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,280
I even asked Ye

482
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,240
and he said they fell in love at first sight.

483
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,240
Did he?

484
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,690
And you even believe him?

485
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,390
Qing'er waited for him for five years.

486
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,390
Not a single trace of him appeared.

487
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,590
Her devotion was completely wasted.

488
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,040
Well... maybe,

489
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,280
he had his own reasons.

490
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,550
I asked him,

491
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,110
"What does 'love at first sight' mean?"

492
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,390
He explained to me

493
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,870
that your face turns red,

494
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,640
your heart starts racing,

495
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,160
and your palms get sweaty.

496
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,110
Sometimes, you even dream about her.

497
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,590
So, Yingdan,

498
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,000
I suspect

499
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,760
I'm not poisoned by you.

500
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,610
I think I'm in...

501
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,000
What do you even know?

502
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,870
The poisons from Poison Valley

503
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,280
are unfathomable.

504
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,920
Yingdan.

505
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,870
Why is your face turning red?

506
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,240
And your heart is racing.

507
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,560
Well...

508
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,590
Don't tell me you've fallen for me
at first sight.

509
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,670
Ridiculous.

510
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,150
What's wrong, Yingdan?

511
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,000
Are you okay?

512
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,150
Here, drink some water.

513
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,800
What's going on?

514
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,430
How...

515
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,760
You're awake, Yingdan.

516
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,110
What are you doing?

517
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,870
No, I mean, you...

518
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:04,750
- You...
- You...

519
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,270
- You...
- You just fainted.

520
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,720
I helped you up for a moment

521
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,910
and gave you some water.

522
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,120
Thank you.

523
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,960
Glad you're okay.

524
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,390
The water you fed me just now...

525
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,240
It's the water I just drank.

526
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,430
What?

527
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,550
That's disgusting.

528
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,470
I...

529
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,590
(The backlash seems to have eased.)

530
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,560
(How could this happen?)

531
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,870
How have you been these years?

532
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,680
Ever since you left,

533
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,760
I stayed in Huizhou under a new name.

534
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,760
I even opened a steamed bun shop

535
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,760
just to wait for your return.

536
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,800
You must've endured so much.

537
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,600
Qing'er,

538
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,670
what are you looking at?

539
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,480
The moon.

540
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,480
The last time I saw you

541
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,110
the moon is still round.

542
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,720
I can hardly remember.

543
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,630
But I remember it clearly.

544
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,280
Over the years,

545
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,720
I've been counting the moons.

546
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,840
Counting moons?

547
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,830
How many times it was full,

548
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,040
how many times it was crescent.

549
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,630
How many nights have passed,

550
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,080
and the years have gone by.

551
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,560
Qing'er,

552
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,870
"Joy and sorrow intertwine in life.

553
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,000
The moon waxes and wanes."

554
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,480
Today, we meet again.

555
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,110
I'm truly overwhelmed.

556
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,920
Dahei,

557
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,150
what a beautiful poem!

558
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,950
You're the only one

559
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,870
who understands me.

560
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,480
Search thoroughly.

561
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

562
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,560
Go ahead.

563
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,720
Mr. Deng, the princess's letter.

564
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,030
Someone!

565
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,640
At your service.

566
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,920
Ask all the heroes to head to

567
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,200
Zhuge Heng's residence now.

568
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,120
Understood.

569
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,400
Mr. Deng.

570
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,190
Vice Chairman He.

571
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,680
Your intel is quite impressive.

572
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,720
The same goes for you.

573
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,720
I told you
Gou Lingfeng couldn't be trusted.

574
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,520
Mr. Deng, what's your plan for today?

575
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,110
Let's get the list first.

576
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,400
Let's go.

577
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,240
Boss, what's happening?

578
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,200
The streets are full of heroes and officials.

579
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,160
No time to explain.

580
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,000
Qing'er, get in the carriage, hurry!

581
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,280
Where are we heading now?

582
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,560
Didn't we already decide?

583
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,480
To Hexi to see the ocean.

584
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,870
Do we have to rush this much?

585
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,440
I haven't said goodbye to them.

586
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,520
They're all good people.

587
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,280
We can't drag them into this.

588
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,120
Hurry, let's go!

589
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,120
Hyah!

590
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,230
Hyah!

591
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,430
Why did Ye leave like that?

592
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,080
He hasn't given me the list yet.

593
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,640
Let's go.

594
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,560
Hyah!

595
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,310
Hyah!

596
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,480
Follow them, quickly!

597
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,080
Hyah!

598
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,840
Hyah!

599
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,120
Hyah!

600
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,670
Qing'er, get off the carriage.

601
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,070
Zhuge.

602
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,990
Let me handle it.

603
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,270
Ye.

604
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,670
So you just leave like this?

605
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,830
With her by your side,

606
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,030
branded as a member of the demonic sect,

607
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,590
and hunted by the MAA?

608
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,110
Don't be naive, Gou.

609
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,240
Even if I surrender and hand over the list,

610
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,830
the MAA and authorities won't spare me.

611
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,800
You're good people.

612
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,510
Don't get dragged into this mess.

613
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,560
That's impossible.

614
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,590
He Changzai already promised me.

615
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,350
You're too naive.

616
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,350
I don't want to be at their mercy.

617
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,960
The world isn't as simple as you think.

618
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,190
Gou Lingfeng, act!

619
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,790
Strike me. Go on.

620
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,430
- Coming!
- Over here.

621
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,290
What are you doing?

622
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,230
What are you up to?

623
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,080
- What's going on?
- Gou Lingfeng!

624
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,640
What are you trying to do?

625
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,560
The demonic sect...

626
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,480
- I'll fight back!
- I'll kill you!

627
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,640
Ye.

628
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,320
Now,

629
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,480
- farewell!
- I promise you.

630
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,350
Impressive swordsmanship.

631
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,510
Cut the crap!

632
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,480
Hand over the list!

633
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,720
Dream on!

634
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,870
Where's the list?

635
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,440
This...

636
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,560
How is Deng Yunfeng so strong?

637
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,190
He's a killing machine
trained by Eunuch Deng.

638
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,240
Few in the MAA can rival him.

639
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,270
I'll give it to you.

640
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,590
No wonder you're the master of twin blades.

641
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,910
Qing'er, let's go!

642
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,960
Hyah! Hyah!

643
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,880
Chase them!

644
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,190
Hyah!

645
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
Hyah!

646
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,360
Hyah!

647
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,160
Hyah!

648
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,280
Got him. Let's go!

649
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,350
Qing'er. Qing'er.

650
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,150
Go! Capture Ye Dahei, the demon!

651
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,640
He.

652
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,630
Caught red-handed.

653
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,390
Where's the list?

654
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,000
Stop wasting time.

655
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,830
Do what you will.

656
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,430
Guards.

657
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,440
Take him away.

658
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,360
Wait.

659
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,840
Deng Yunfeng.

660
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,760
He's from the demonic sect.

661
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,720
This should be handled by the MAA.

662
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,640
Vice Chairman He,

663
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,430
is this really the time to discuss this?

664
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,950
Let's go.

665
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,350
Qing'er!

666
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,270
Qing'er!

667
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,320
Qing'er!

668
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,870
Deng Yunfeng, what are you doing?

669
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,560
- Qing'er!
- Qing'er!

670
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,560
Qing'er!

671
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,960
- Qing'er!
- Dahei...

672
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,190
Qing'er!

673
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,360
Why?

674
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,760
It was me who wronged you.

675
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,480
Don't apologize.

676
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,150
I've been lying to you all along.

677
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm from the demonic sect.

678
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,870
For five years,

679
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,350
I couldn't gather the courage
to return to you.

680
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,600
Qing'er!

681
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,880
Did you know?

682
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,480
Actually,

683
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,760
there's no ocean in Hexi.

684
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,590
It's just a desert.

685
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,280
I'm sorry.

686
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,800
You fool.

687
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,760
I lied to you too.

688
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,390
I'm actually from Hexi.

689
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,350
But none of that matters.

690
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,110
I love you for who you are.

691
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,960
Do you understand?

692
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,710
I understand.

693
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,840
I understand.

694
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,110
I understand.

695
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,840
Qing'er.

696
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,320
Qing'er!

697
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,960
Yingdan, save Qing'er quickly!

698
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,120
I...

699
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,350
Qing'er, hold on!

700
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,840
Ye.

701
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,920
Ye!

702
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,350
Stop!

703
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,960
Hand over the list

704
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,870
and you can go.

705
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,480
In your dreams.

706
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,590
Don't push me.

707
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,560
Mr. Deng,

708
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,960
do it.

709
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,870
He's already like this.

710
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,350
What more do you want?

711
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,240
Gou,

712
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,240
you're a member
of the MAA.

713
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,590
Have you forgotten the first rule

714
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,450
of the MAA?

715
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,870
How do we deal with the demonic sect?

716
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,000
Eliminate them on sight.

717
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,790
But… I can't.

718
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,110
You promised me,

719
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,760
if he hands over the list,

720
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,350
we'd spare his life.

721
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,110
Maybe even let him join the MAA.

722
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,160
That's right, you haven't got the list yet.

723
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,630
Why rush to kill him?

724
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,760
Mr. Zhuge,

725
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,000
if he's dead,

726
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,440
we'll easily get the list.

727
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,480
Gou Lingfeng!

728
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,920
I warned you before

729
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,760
not to trust these people!

730
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,160
Mr. He,

731
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,720
are you truly going back on your word?

732
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,830
Gou.

733
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,830
Eradicating him is non-negotiable.

734
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,000
Let's talk about it later.

735
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,240
I'll deal with him first.

736
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,720
Qing'er has woken up!

737
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,280
Purgatory Flame.

738
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,830
A demonic skill, huh?

739
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,240
And you claim you're not one of them.

740
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,960
Private salt trading

741
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,390
shouldn't carry the death penalty.

742
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,000
Why must you insist on killing him?

743
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,630
Just because of his identity?

744
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,630
You didn't interrogate him

745
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,870
or ask a single question,

746
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,000
and tried to sentence him on the spot.

747
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,830
How is this justice?

748
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,280
Hmm, that does sound fair.

749
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,350
You must be in league with them.

750
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,480
Naturally, you'd defend each other.

751
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,190
The demonic sect commits evil deeds.

752
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,350
We'll capture

753
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,150
anyone from the demonic sect!

754
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,240
Alright, based on what you said,

755
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,150
no room for negotiation, right?

756
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,400
Attack!

757
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,350
Truly worthy of being my master.

758
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,870
I underestimated him.

759
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,920
Ye!

760
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,600
Ye!

761
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,240
Take Qing'er and leave first.

762
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,950
Gou.

763
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,720
I once asked the old sect leader

764
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,640
if he truly entrusted the duty of

765
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,000
upholding the divine sect to you.

766
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,870
He told me,

767
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,240
you were the kindest young man he'd ever met.

768
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,790
That old man

769
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,870
always knew how to deceive me.

770
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,630
I no longer have the strength to protect it.

771
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,480
I'm entrusting it to you.

772
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,350
This is where we part ways.

773
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,430
Hyah!

774
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,750
Hyah!

775
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:25,990
Go.

776
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,590
Do you know?

777
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,110
All these years,

778
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,320
I've counted...

779
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,710
Sixty-five full moons in total.

780
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,750
I know.

781
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,360
I also know

782
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,550
among the steamed buns you make,

783
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,000
the pork and chive ones are the best.

784
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,880
Have you tried them?

785
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,480
I have, of course.

786
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,320
I've tried all of them.

787
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,510
Qing'er,

788
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,520
I'm really back.

789
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,620
(The End of Episode 11)

790
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,670
Little Beggar, Madman.

791
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,630
Little Beggar.

792
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,790
- Little Beggar
- Madman.

793
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:13,990
Stop!

794
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,920
What's your name?

795
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,320
My name is Little Stone,

796
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,230
but everyone calls me Madman.

797
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,750
Come with me.

798
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,200
From now on,

799
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,590
your surname will be Deng.
