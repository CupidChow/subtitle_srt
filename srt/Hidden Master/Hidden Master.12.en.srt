1
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,880
Alright.

2
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,670
As for the stories,

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,510
I've understood them all.

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,240
Look,

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,630
you've told me stories

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,040
about Confucius, Mencius,

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,000
Laozi, Zhuangzi,

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,200
Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,270
and even

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,470
the story of Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,230
So,

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,190
what's your point?

13
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,470
Master, I've shared so many

14
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,920
stories of masters and disciples.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,670
Can't you feel anything at all?

16
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,590
I do.

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,000
I think

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,030
the story of Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü
is moving.

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,430
If you don't mind,

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,040
I'm also willing to cut an arm off.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,120
Get lost!

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,110
Well, you're so powerful!

23
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,390
Why won't you teach me martial arts?

24
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,920
It's not that I don't want to.

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,430
What I learned were all demonic skills.

26
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,680
But that's exactly what I want to learn!

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,510
Only by learning demonic skills
can I get my revenge.

28
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,430
I must get...

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,200
Do you understand how painful it is

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,350
to carry hatred deep in your heart?

31
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,560
Then do you understand

32
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,870
how painful it is
to learn demonic skills

33
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,920
by accident and to be hated

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,720
by others for no reason?

35
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,430
It's so painful.

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,510
You don't understand me.

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,600
Goodbye.

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,080

85
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,600
Master,

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,830
why are you still
in the mood for a meal?

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,710
Our plan is far too dangerous.

88
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,880
You don't understand.

89
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,120
They'll never expect

90
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,440
that we'd return home.

91
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,590
Deng Yunfeng and He Changzai

92
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,110
surely won't let you get away.

93
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,440
You're talking nonsense.

94
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,480
I don't care.

95
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,200
Ye Dahei and Qing'er's love
is so touching.

96
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,870
I must help them!

97
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,560
But your demonic skills are exposed.

98
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,720
All they want is the list, right?

99
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,040
I'll just give them the list.

100
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,960
No!

101
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,040
Master, if you really
give them the list,

102
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,680
you'll be completely useless to them.

103
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,240
They could kill you at any moment.

104
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,270
Exactly.

105
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,910
So... what do you think we should do?

106
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,760
This list is very important.

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,270
It must be handled carefully.

108
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,630
Yingdan,

109
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,830
what's your opinion?

110
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,310
It's about the demonic sect,
the association, and the court.

111
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,750
Gou Lingfeng definitely

112
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,080
won't give it to the demonic sect.

113
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
So,

114
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,270
it's between the association
and the court.

115
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,270
We're all in the association.

116
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,550
It's obvious.

117
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,360
No way.

118
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,640
I'm still upset about it.

119
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,990
Vice President,

120
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,510
Puppet Knight,

121
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,390
and Ye Dahei.

122
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,470
So much has happened.

123
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,560
Haven't you seen through

124
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,150
the truth colors of the association?

125
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,390
I think Yingdan has a point.

126
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,760
He Changzai is just a vice chairman.

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,830
Since the list is so important,

128
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,190
Chairman Wu Guangming
surely won't ignore it.

129
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,120
Yes, he won't.

130
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,030
I've always felt he doesn't

131
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,000
seem like a good person.

132
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,240
Hey, he's my idol!

133
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,640
Master.

134
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,560
Why don't you keep this list

135
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,510
and be the sect leader?

136
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,630
I'll join you and fight against

137
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,000
the association with you.

138
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,390
You deserve a slap!

139
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,190
- Great!
- Who?

140
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,680
- Master.
- Who has such insight?

141
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,880
Master.

142
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,520
Grandmaster?

143
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,880
My master.

144
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,310
Grandmaster.

145
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,270
Nice to meet you.

146
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,880
Great minds think alike.

147
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
Didn't I tell you to stay away

148
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,030
from that Sword Alliance boy?

149
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,910
Grandmaster, teach me demonic skills.

150
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,240
I want to be the strongest disciple
of the demonic sect.

151
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,830
You really stole my secret manual!

152
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,750
You even lied to me!

153
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,750
- Grandmaster.
- Shameless.

154
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,440
The Moonlight Swordplay or something,

155
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,190
I really can't understand it.

156
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,510
Grandmaster, please enlighten me.

157
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,400
Old man,

158
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,680
are you crazy?

159
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,510
I'll tell you one last time.

160
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,440
Ask him to get out of here!

161
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,120
The Sword Alliance and I
are sworn enemies!

162
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,270
Sword Alliance? How did they offend you?

163
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,190
Nonsense!

164
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,800
You insolent brat!

165
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
How dare you deceive me?

166
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,680
- I...
- Listen,

167
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,200
the secret manual can't be given to him!

168
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,230
What?

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,590
What's wrong with him?

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,360
I've never seen him

171
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,720
so angry before.

172
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,870
It's so strange.

173
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,680
Just because of a secret manual?

174
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,030
The ruthless demonic sect member
turns out to be a love-struck fool.

175
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,390
Ye Dahei tragically died for love.

176
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,080
Is the Martial Artists Association
really righteous?

177
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,750
Smuggle salt for the people,

178
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,000
wait for love for five years.

179
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,200
The legendary life of Ye Dahei.

180
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,920
It turns out the famous Wang Zipeng

181
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,270
is also making up stories.

182
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,240
Well, I don't have the inside scoop.

183
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,750
Who would've thought that

184
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,030
Ye Dahei could survive?

185
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,120
If you'd come to me earlier,

186
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,070
the news about Ye Dahei

187
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,560
wouldn't have been written like this.

188
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,750
Your Highness, you're right.

189
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,510
I'll ask for your advice next time.

190
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,270
But I can't believe Gou Lingfeng

191
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,880
managed to save his life.

192
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Are there some hidden secrets?

193
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
It doesn't matter
if Gou Lingfeng has secrets or not.

194
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,030
What matters is

195
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,760
that this isn't over.

196
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,510
The great show has yet to begin.

197
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,950
Will there be a great show?

198
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,310
Wait at Zhuge Heng's place,

199
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,440
and you'll know.

200
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,920
Got it.

201
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,710
Mr. Wang.

202
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,480
I asked you to find out

203
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,750
Zhuge Heng's interests.

204
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,950
Any news on that?

205
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,400
Your Highness, I've investigated it.

206
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,870
Zhuge Heng

207
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,670
only wants to learn a demonic skill

208
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,240
called the Moon Sword Skill

209
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,710
to get revenge.

210
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,240
He's been calling Gou Lingfeng Master.

211
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,320
I think it's connected to this.

212
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,160
Moon Sword Skill?

213
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,280
Do you have any clues?

214
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,950
I do.

215
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,230
Listen...

216
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,200
Did you stay up all night?

217
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,870
Still thinking about it?

218
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,710
Okay, have some breakfast first.

219
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,750
- Morning.
- Let's eat breakfast.

220
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,670
- Okay.
- Okay.

221
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,120
I arrived first, okay?

222
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,350
Deng Yunfeng, I got here first.

223
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,030
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?

224
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,510
Is the door just for show?

225
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,750
Can't you at least knock?

226
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,000
Gou Lingfeng.

227
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,590
You must hand over the list
to the association.

228
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,750
After all, you're still a member
of the association.

229
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,830
What if I refuse?

230
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,480
Lingfeng,

231
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,150
give us the list,

232
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,520
and we'll forgive you for everything.

233
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,120
Gou Lingfeng.

234
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,000
This is very important.

235
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,350
It's not just about the association.

236
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,830
Give me the list.

237
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,590
I will deliver it to the Imperial City.

238
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,950
Deng Yunfeng, you...

239
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,590
What's all the fuss about in the morning?

240
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,310
Your Highness.

241
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,750
- Princess Linglong.
- Why is she here?

242
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,230
Sorry for disturbing you.

243
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,630
Gou Lingfeng still doesn't want
to hand over the list.

244
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,120
They're all my friends.

245
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,320
You've gone

246
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
too far, haven't you?

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,920
Your Highness,
this list is very important.

248
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,350
You don't understand.

249
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,950
Mr. Gou,

250
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,800
my father mentioned this list before.

251
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,080
Many people are involved.

252
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,830
You must be careful.

253
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,320
Your Highness,

254
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,670
should we hand over the list?

255
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,590
Who should we give it to?

256
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,280
I only know it's very important.

257
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,920
As for who,

258
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,800
it's up to Mr. Gou.

259
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,080
However,

260
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,320
if you trust me, Mr. Gou,

261
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,110
I can keep it for you.

262
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,400
They wouldn't dare to harm me.

263
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,040
Lingfeng,

264
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,200
we're both heroes of the association.

265
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
You must believe in the association.

266
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,990
Burning salt in public was your idea,
He Changzai.

267
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,230
I was manipulated by you as well.

268
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,720
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

269
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,150
Show no mercy to evildoers.

270
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,110
Isn't that the advice you

271
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,830
once gave me?

272
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,360
Gou Lingfeng,

273
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,470
if you refuse to hand over the list,

274
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,550
well...

275
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,400
Deng Yunfeng!

276
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,990
Deng Yunfeng, what are you doing?

277
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,520
All heroes!

278
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,110
Protect Gou Lingfeng!

279
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,750
What's going on?

280
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,270
Ye Dahei's matter

281
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,400
is an internal affair
of the association.

282
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,160
We should be the ones
to handle the list.

283
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,520
Deng Yunfeng,

284
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,630
I advise you to think carefully

285
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,080
before acting.

286
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,750
He Changzai,

287
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,440
you didn't keep your word.

288
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,800
Justice shouldn't be
upheld through violence.

289
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Mr. Gou,

290
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,670
do you want to give it to

291
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,990
someone so impulsive?

292
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,200
Your Highness, you're right.

293
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,920
Gou Lingfeng,

294
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,800
I know you have doubts about me.

295
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,830
I also know you don't trust me.

296
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,720
However, I came here

297
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,040
under the orders
of Chairman Wu Guangming.

298
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,910
If you entrust me with the list,

299
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,720
I will present it
to the chairman immediately.

300
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,200
He'll be the one to make the decision.

301
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,950
Chairman Wu Guangming?

302
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,400
Your Highness.

303
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,390
Indeed.

304
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,990
I'm just a vice chairman.

305
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,240
All matters

306
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,600
should be approved by the chairman.

307
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Master,

308
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,590
think carefully.

309
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,360
Gou Lingfeng.

310
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,680
Vice Chairman He is right.

311
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,640
This is

312
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,160
the best choice right now.

313
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,840
Floral Knight, you're so smart.

314
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,760
Yingdan...

315
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,790
Master!

316
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,070
Let's go!

317
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,360
I've given you the list.

318
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,040
Don't forget about the Snake Rank.

319
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,440
Look at Gou Lingfeng.

320
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,480
First, he killed the vice chairman.

321
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,200
Then he secretly released Puppet Knight.

322
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,800
After that, he protected Prince Chang.

323
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,120
And he even rescued Ye Dahei,

324
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,630
a member of the demonic sect.

325
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,480
Which sect does he really work for?

326
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,550
- What's your sect?
- Which one?

327
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,430
- Shut up.
- Who are you?

328
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,380
- Guards.
- Get out!

329
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,220
- Kick him out!
- Wait...

330
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,090
- Out!
- Which one?

331
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,950
- Who are you?
- Tell me.

332
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,830
- Gou...
- You're crazy.

333
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,510
- Go!
- Leave!

334
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,230
- Which sect?
- Get out!

335
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,920
Lingfeng,

336
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,270
although you got the list

337
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,440
and completed the mission,

338
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,920
you secretly released Ye Dahei

339
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,230
and violated our rules.

340
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,320
You will be imprisoned temporarily

341
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,680
and await the chairman's decision.

342
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,080
Do you have a problem?

343
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,920
Master.

344
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,830
It's okay.

345
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,160
It's okay, Yingdan.

346
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,350
I don't have a problem.

347
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,470
Sorry for this.

348
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,760
Guards!

349
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,070
- Take him away.
- Master!

350
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,600
Master! Master!

351
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,950
Your Highness, sorry for this.

352
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,750
Yingdan, what should we do?

353
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,630
Floral Knight,

354
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,750
why are you here again?

355
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,230
This is the third time.

356
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,630
Vice Chairman He,

357
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,470
I found some new information.

358
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,750
Many heroes in the association

359
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,230
once used demonic skills.

360
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,720
Why can't you give Gou Lingfeng

361
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,750
a chance?

362
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,800
Gou Lingfeng
is a master of demonic skills.

363
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,080
Besides, I'm just locking him up

364
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,360
instead of killing him.

365
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,950
I've already had mercy.

366
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,230
Vice Chairman He,

367
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,120
you're clearly abusing your power!

368
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,470
Floral Knight,

369
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,110
watch your language.

370
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,630
Let's talk about Gou Lingfeng.

371
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,120
He harmed our members

372
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,990
and released Ye Dahei,
a demonic sect member.

373
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,630
This alone is a serious crime.

374
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,040
Let me tell you one last time.

375
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,630
Don't bother me until the chairman

376
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,200
gives us an order.

377
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,470
Get out!

378
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,280
What are you doing?

379
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,470
Floral Knight wants to poison me!

380
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,540
(Tianluo Prison)

381
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,920
Master?

382
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,750
What are you doing?

383
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,110
How can you kowtow to me?

384
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,110
It really hurts!

385
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,590
What are you up to?

386
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,830
What could I possibly be up to?

387
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,950
I'm trying to get you out of here!

388
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,200
You're the leader
of the Great Evolution Divine Sect.

389
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,480
How can you stay in this prison
waiting to be executed?

390
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,750
I'm not leaving.

391
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,670
If I wanted to leave,
I would've been out already.

392
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,630
Old man.

393
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,910
You want to trick me into leaving.

394
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,840
Then I'd become
a real demonic sect member.

395
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,870
I knew you were a bad person.

396
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,680
You're up to no good.

397
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,280
Respect your master.

398
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,630
You screwed me over like that.

399
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,150
Aren't you ashamed?

400
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,440
How dare you bring that up?

401
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,270
Once Ye Dahei left,

402
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,270
you handed over the list.

403
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,320
Do you have any idea

404
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,080
how much we've lost?

405
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,320
But that was my duty!

406
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,990
Your duty is
to revitalize the divine sect!

407
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,030
You're deceiving me!

408
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,030
You want to lure me
into the demonic sect.

409
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,520
Deceiving you?

410
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,480
Think about it.

411
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,440
Since you joined the association,

412
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,080
what have you gained?

413
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,480
Since you came,
Mr. He has been targeting you.

414
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,030
And those pretentious heroes

415
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,350
have looked down on you.

416
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,520
Have they ever treated you as a hero?

417
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,680
Every single one of them wants

418
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,000
to catch you and bring you to justice

419
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,430
to make a name.

420
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,960
I was the one

421
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,080
who taught you martial arts,

422
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,510
guided you,

423
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,680
and helped you fulfill

424
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,150
your dream.

425
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,070
But you knew

426
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,640
I wanted to become a true hero.

427
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,760
Why did you teach me demonic skills?

428
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,630
You ungrateful idiot!

429
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,600
Fine,

430
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,240
let me tell you something else.

431
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,720
Don't you know who killed Liao Jiale?

432
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,110
You killed him.

433
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,960
You got the list.

434
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,110
Liao Jiale knew this would happen.

435
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,680
He didn't want to stir up chaos,

436
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,590
so he entrusted the list to Ye Dahei.

437
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Can't you use your brain

438
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,000
and think carefully

439
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,320
about what happened?

440
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,910
Don't you see who's behind it all?

441
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,910
No matter what you say,

442
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,760
I won't believe you anymore.

443
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,960
Fine.

444
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,670
Also, what was wrong with you that day?

445
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,800
You nearly killed Zhuge!

446
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,960
What was wrong with me?

447
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,160
I asked you to stay away from him!

448
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,960
How did he offend you?

449
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,680
It's just a worthless
secret manual, okay?

450
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,080
A worthless secret manual?

451
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,720
Sword Alliance and I are sworn enemies!

452
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,750
I'll kill every one of them!

453
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,720
I'm...

454
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,280
I'm so pissed off!

455
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,430
You're hopeless!

456
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,270
I'm leaving!

457
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,590
I just don't understand

458
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,670
what my master is thinking.

459
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,280
And my grandmaster too.

460
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,030
I just want to learn one move.

461
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,560
Why is it so difficult?

462
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,430
Heng,

463
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,830
why are you so obsessed with

464
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,030
that sword skill?

465
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,280
I want revenge!

466
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,150
It's a blood feud.

467
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,080
My enemy is so strong.

468
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,960
Only that move can defeat him.

469
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,000
But why has my hope

470
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,760
shattered again and again?

471
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,080
Why has my effort
gone to waste every time?

472
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,240
Heng,

473
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,280
can you tell me about your past?

474
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,910
I'm sorry, Ling'er,

475
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,720
I can't talk about it right now.

476
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,190
Ling'er,

477
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,080
I really hope that one day,

478
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,390
I can break free from that dead end.

479
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,510
But now, I really don't know

480
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,430
what to do.

481
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,080
Heng,

482
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,000
everyone has their own struggles.

483
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,190
When my father passed away,

484
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,720
I also didn't know

485
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,630
how to deal with everything.

486
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,680
You helped me through it.

487
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,150
It's my turn now.

488
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,830
Don't worry,

489
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,640
I'll stay by your side

490
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,080
and help you fulfill your dream.

491
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,760
Thank you, Ling'er.

492
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,550
Heng, don't worry,

493
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,630
I'll always be here.

494
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,960
(Oh no!)

495
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,870
(The medicine is losing its effect.)

496
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,670
What's wrong, Yingdan?

497
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,240
Here, have some water.

498
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,030
Could it be...

499
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,990
No.

500
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,030
I can't let it happen.

501
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,950
Yingdan!

502
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,110
Yingdan, what's wrong?

503
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,560
Are you alright?

504
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,960
Let me help you up.

505
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,880
I'm fine.

506
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,000
Ling'er, let's get inside.

507
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,920
Let me help you up.

508
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,200
I'm alright.

509
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,120
Be careful.

510
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,240
I just slipped.

511
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,200
- Get some rest.
- Let's go.

512
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,120
Get inside.

513
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,860
(Martial Artists Association)

514
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,230
Mr. Deng.

515
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,280
What brings you here?

516
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,040
I'm here for the list.

517
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,110
What list?

518
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,000
No need to play dumb with me.

519
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,960
Of course, it's the list
you stole from me.

520
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,080
Oh, you're referring to that list.

521
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,400
We've sealed it as part of

522
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,790
the case file

523
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,040
and submitted it to the chairman.

524
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,960
Besides, it involves the demonic sect,

525
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,480
so it's an internal affair
of the association.

526
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,160
Mr. Deng, it's not your concern.

527
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,000
Salt smuggling infringes on
the court's interests.

528
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
I have the authority
to view the evidence.

529
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,960
Absolutely.

530
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,110
Unfortunately, we sent it out

531
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,270
yesterday.

532
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,720
Mr. Deng, perhaps

533
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,590
you should ask Chairman Wu.

534
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,280
You're doing this on purpose.

535
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,960
Mr. Deng, what do you mean?

536
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,960
I'm simply

537
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,320
fulfilling my duties

538
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,190
Deng Yunfeng.

539
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,800
I'm so impressed.

540
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,510
You've been dealing

541
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,790
with them for such a long time.

542
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,670
Don't you know
what kind of people they are?

543
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,710
Now that

544
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,910
He Changzai has taken advantage
of the situation,

545
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,480
how are you supposed to

546
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,080
explain it to Eunuch Deng?

547
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,360
Your Highness,

548
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,150
I will head to the Imperial City

549
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
to see my godfather.

550
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,950
Deng Yunfeng.

551
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,430
Our marriage was meant to

552
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
secure our mutual benefits

553
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,720
instead of letting you act rashly.

554
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,910
I hope you can think twice
before taking action.

555
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,310
Crane Knight! Crane Knight! Crane Knight!

556
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,280
Crane Knight! Crane Knight!

557
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,400
Do you know?

558
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,040
Crane Knight is the Blade God's son.

559
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,590
He's exceptional

560
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,960
in the Martial Artists Association.

561
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,880
Yes. He has a high prestige

562
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,750
among the heroes.

563
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,720
Crane Knight!

564
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,830
Listen,

565
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,310
he insisted on keeping

566
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,960
a low profile when entering the city.

567
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,190
Really? Crane Knight is quite modest.

568
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,910
Crane Knight! Crane Knight! Crane Knight!

569
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,550
Hold on.

570
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,000
You are...

571
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,590
Crane Knight!

572
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,480
It's been so long!

573
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,040
Come on in, please.

574
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,640
Here, have some tea.

575
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,150
Don't be so polite!

576
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,350
It's been many years,

577
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,870
and you're still so...

578
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,590
brave and strong.

579
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,510
But I heard

580
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,960
that Swallow Knight

581
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,000
has been causing you trouble lately.

582
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,390
It's driving me crazy.

583
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,790
Once you're famous,

584
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,240
all sorts of troublemakers
come after you.

585
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,240
Especially my senior,

586
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,480
he's been pestering me
for over 20 years.

587
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,520
I can't stand it anymore!

588
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,840
However,

589
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,830
with your martial skills,

590
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,000
Swallow Knight...

591
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,720
Well, of course.

592
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,790
By the way,

593
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,750
do you have anything interesting

594
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,790
about Huizhou to share with me?

595
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,160
I do.

596
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,590
I was just about to tell you.

597
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,790
Recently,

598
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,520
there's a young man named Gou Lingfeng.

599
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,560
He's the heir
of the Gou Family Trade Association.

600
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,390
He's got great...

601
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,350
great martial skills.

602
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,310
I'm not lying.

603
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,670
But as for his appearance,

604
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,110
it's hard to describe.

605
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,910
I've met the chairman
of the Gou Family Trade Association...

606
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,870
Where is he now?

607
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,870
He can help me with my trouble.

608
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,150
Help you?

609
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,280
Crane Knight.

610
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,190
Don't you know me well enough?

611
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,720
Gou Lingfeng,

612
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,720
Crane Knight wants to see you.

613
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,960
Crane Knight?

614
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,350
Crane Knight is here?

615
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Crane Knight?

616
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,280
Where are you?

617
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,590
Crane Knight, Crane Knight?

618
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,000
Sir,

619
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,560
have you seen Crane Knight?

620
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,480
I'm Crane Knight.

621
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,480
Crane Knight?

622
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,630
Where are you?

623
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,550
Come on, stop hiding.

624
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,000
I saw you over there.

625
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,600
Crane Knight?

626
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,320
Gou.

627
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,560
Look at me carefully.

628
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,000
Are you really... Crane Knight?

629
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,720
What happened to you?

630
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,230
Get off me?

631
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,720
Haven't you heard that saying?

632
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,910
Time is like a butcher.

633
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,720
Well, you haven't changed at all.

634
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Time has not only slaughtered animals

635
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,110
but also raised a animal.

636
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,830
I… I'm different now.

637
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,670
(Chou)
I'm now a hero of the association.

638
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,350
But I heard you injured your allies,

639
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,630
released a criminal,

640
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,510
and even joined the demonic sect.

641
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,350
I was framed!

642
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,430
Listen,

643
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,320
here's what happened...

644
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,200
That's the whole story.

645
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,910
Now you understand, right?

646
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,760
You're still a demonic sect member,
aren't you?

647
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,000
Are you even listening to me?

648
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,480
Here's what happened.

649
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,350
Well, I...

650
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,270
Okay, I got it.

651
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,150
I've figured it out.

652
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,150
Given your circumstances,

653
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,590
at least 10 years in prison,

654
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,590
or maybe a life sentence.

655
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,280
If you're unlucky,

656
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,480
you'll be executed tomorrow.

657
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,590
You still don't get it.

658
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,880
I'm wronged.

659
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,830
Here's what happened.

660
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,350
- Listen...
- No, no.

661
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,600
I know

662
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
you don't want to die.

663
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,590
There's a way out.

664
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,240
Then tell me now.

665
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,680
Escape.

666
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,440
Escape?

667
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,870
Hey, be quiet!

668
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,190
You'll get us killed!

669
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,240
What kind of idea is that?

670
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,000
I came here willingly.

671
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,790
I just want

672
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,390
a fair and just trial.

673
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,550
Well, I'm also referring to

674
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,880
a fair and just trial.

675
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,910
I'm not leaving.

676
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,720
If I leave, I'll be a real criminal.

677
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,000
I'll wait right here.

678
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,720
Why don't you understand?

679
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,830
Then stay here.

680
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,750
No one can save you.

681
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,720
You're leaving?

682
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
Come on, talk with me.

683
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,630
You're really leaving, you...

684
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,110
Let's talk, Crane Knight.

685
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,430
So?

686
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,150
If you defeat Swallow Knight

687
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,560
as my disciple,

688
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,000
I'll handle everything for you.

689
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,800
You've ruined me!

690
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,040
I could've cleared my name.

691
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,630
Now I can't even return to prison.

692
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,960
I'm a famous hero.

693
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,350
I have plenty of

694
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,920
connections and resources.

695
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,070
As long as it's within the association,

696
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,400
I can handle everything.

697
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,630
Why do you have to ask me?

698
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,680
This is something dishonorable,

699
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,000
so I need someone dishonorable.

700
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,960
Without a doubt, you're the best choice.

701
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,190
Who's dishonorable?

702
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,600
Sir,

703
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,960
you're the dishonorable one here, okay?

704
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,120
Well,

705
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,240
it's also because you're very powerful.

706
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,840
That's true.

707
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
Sir,

708
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,270
you have to promise me

709
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,430
you'll talk to

710
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,350
the chairman after this is over.

711
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,560
So, is that a yes?

712
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,720
Do I have a choice?

713
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,840
My bro.

714
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,430
Is this

715
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,000
Crane Knight?

716
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,750
So different from the portrait

717
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,350
in the association.

718
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,520
Crane Knight is my past.

719
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,440
My name is Chen Zheya.

720
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,800
Everyone calls me Boss Chen.

721
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,920
I have a nationwide chain store

722
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,510
named Penglai Pavilion.

723
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,350
I sell small items about

724
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,480
the association.

725
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,080
I'm sure you've all heard of it.

726
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,240
I thought someone like you

727
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,110
would either retreat to study martial arts

728
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,150
or uphold justice in the martial world.

729
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,920
However,

730
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,000
the well-known Crane Knight

731
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
is just another vain mortal.

732
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,120
So naive.

733
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,960
I now have wealth beyond measure.

734
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,400
Isn't that better than being a hero?

735
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,350
I knew it.

736
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,400
The association

737
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,640
is gilded exterior,

738
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,800
shabby and ruined on the inside.

739
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,240
I'm still sitting here.

740
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
It's enough.

741
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,510
Although Crane Knight

742
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,030
has become a bit vulgar,

743
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,720
he was the one
who rescued me from the prison.

744
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,510
Just

745
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,400
rescued you like that?

746
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,070
I promised to help him

747
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,750
deal with Swallow Knight's trouble.

748
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,520
That's why I got out.

749
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:44,640
Anyway,

750
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,440
we're glad you came back safely.

751
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,350
Yes.

752
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,640
Don't worry, Master.

753
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,790
At worst, I'll take you along
when I wander.

754
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,520
Who wants to wander with you?

755
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,910
If you help me solve this,

756
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,520
I'll talk to

757
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
Chairman Wu in person.

758
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,560
Speaking of which,

759
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,200
what is the feud

760
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,640
between you and Swallow Knight?

761
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,960
Why does he refuse to let it go?

762
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,800
It all began ten years ago.

763
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,880
Senior,

764
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,800
let's focus on recent events.

765
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,960
Well, 20 years ago,

766
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,320
my father took on a disciple,

767
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,560
and it was Swallow.

768
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,960
My father nurtured him wholeheartedly

769
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,390
and taught him everything.

770
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,240
However, no one expected

771
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,790
that he'd be so greedy

772
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,240
and betray the Divine Blade Sect.

773
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,150
That night,

774
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,640
I fought against him
on the top of the Purple-Gold Tower.

775
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,790
Wait, shouldn't it be
the top of the Forbidden City?

776
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,710
Yes.

777
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,580
The Purple-Gold Tower

778
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,280
sounds cooler, doesn't it?

779
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,030
Crane,

780
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,080
I suggest you hand over the Rockblade.

781
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,960
You're no match for me.

782
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,590
Cut the chatter.

783
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,520
Swallow, you're a monster.

784
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,720
You killed my father!

785
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,760
This is outrageous!

786
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,920
I didn't.

787
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,240
How dare you deny it?

788
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,800
Today, I'll uphold justice
on behalf of heaven.

789
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,760
Prepare to die!

790
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,320
Go to hell!

791
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,550
- And then?
- Then,

792
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,560
Swallow started
making threats everywhere,

793
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,800
claiming he'd kill me

794
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,080
and take the Rockblade.

795
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,670
As you all know,

796
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,590
the Rockblade

797
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,270
is the heirloom
of the Divine Blade Sect.

798
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,670
Whoever owns the blade

799
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,560
can command
all the blade masters in the world.

800
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,030
Then why don't you spar with him?

801
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,950
That's right.

802
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,510
I...

803
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,670
I wanted to do it myself,

804
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,150
but...

805
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,010
I've been having a toothache.

806
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,850
A toothache?

807
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,670
Well, it's not a serious disease,

808
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,000
but it hurts like hell.

809
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,800
Plus, my overall appearance

810
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,360
has been affected by the toothache.

811
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,430
Besides...

812
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,480
Do I really need to explain this?

813
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,590
You already agreed to help me.

814
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,990
I...

815
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,510
Senior,

816
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,280
you should show us the blade.

817
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,360
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

818
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,150
The blade...

819
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't know where it is.

820
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,590
The Rockblade is the token
of the Blade God.

821
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,360
How could you not know?

822
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,400
You're just like Swallow.

823
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,880
You think I've kept it

824
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,880
to myself.

825
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,560
If I had the blade,

826
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,880
I'd hang it in my shop

827
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,360
to show off!

828
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,790
My business will definitely thrive!

829
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,670
Speaking of which,

830
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,560
I really don't know
what my father was thinking.

831
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,630
Since Swallow Knight only wants

832
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,040
the Rockblade,

833
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,750
what don't you fake one?

834
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,880
What?

835
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,670
Zhuge, what kind of idea is that?

836
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,750
Crane Knight is a well-known hero.

837
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,230
How could he fake a blade?

838
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,400
Brilliant idea!

839
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,550
What?

840
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,000
Why didn't I think of that?

841
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,750
Goodbye, everyone!

842
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,150
Fake blade.

843
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,940
(The End of Episode 12)

844
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,360
Heng.

845
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,110
I can't stand my master anymore.

846
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,710
He jumped three feet high
when seeing a cockroach

847
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,320
and crashed onto me. He was so heavy!

848
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,590
He nearly killed me.

849
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,110
Heng.

850
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,560
Did you get hurt?

851
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,840
I...

852
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,720
