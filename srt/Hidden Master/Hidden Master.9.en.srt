What are you doing?

00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,160
I just refined some Corpse Poison.

51
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,440
Brought it for you to try.

52
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,920
What's this? So gross.

53
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,630
As expected.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,550
Corpse Poison is ineffective too.

55
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,190
It's the middle of the night.

56
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,470
Can you please go out?

57
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,790
So disgusting.

What now?

59
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,070
It's warm.

60
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,230
Are you out of your mind?

61
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,480
Only the dead are cold.

62
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,880
I'm cold but I'm alive.

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,110
Gou Lingfeng, are you crazy?

64
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,750
It really is cold.

65
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,670
Yingdan,

66
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,000
hugging you must be refreshing in summer.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,920
Gou Lingfeng!

68
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,110
You're such a rouge!

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,080
It's truly cold.

70
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,390
Xiaobai,

71
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,390
I wonder how you'd feel to touch.

72
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,390
Yingdan.

73
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,310
Mother.

74
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,160
Have you really thought it through?

75
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,400
The world outside

76
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,240
isn't as wonderful as you think.

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,320
The martial world is a dangerous place.

78
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Mother,

79
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,360
I can't stay poisoned forever,

80
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,800
and hide in the valley my whole life.

81
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,440
I want to see the world.

82
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,000
Yingdan.

83
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,440
I keep you here for your own good.

84
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,590
You have a natural poison body.

85
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,680
The poison mist in the Poison Valley

86
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,830
can neutralize the toxins in you.

87
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,390
Once you leave the mist's protection,

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,430
the toxins in your body

89
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,120
will affect you.

90
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,040
Mother,

91
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,710
I've made up my mind.

92
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,830
If you're determined,

93
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,070
take this medicine.

94
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,470
You must carry it with you.

95
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,760
It can replace the poison mist,

96
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,800
neutralizing your body's toxins.

97
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,680
But you must remember

98
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,080
to take it on time.

99
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,160
However, I can't guarantee,

100
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,630
over a long period,

101
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,240
it'll still be effective for you.

102
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,040
Got it.

103
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,080
Alright, I'm off.

104
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,720
Yingdan,

105
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,360
if you're tired of staying outside,

106
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,830
make sure you return quickly.

107
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,800
Understood.

108
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,080
Leaving now.

109
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,750
Who's there?

110
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,670
Coming, coming.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,920
It's yours.

112
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:37,140
(Ghost)

113
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,510
Who is it?

114
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,440
What's this?

115
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,340
(Ghost)

116
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,760
- Master.
- Leave it to me.

117
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,800
No peeking.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,950
Why not?

119
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,150
Behave, I'll teach you later.

120
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,230
Alright.

121
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,660
(Ghost)

122
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,940
(To Little Gou)

123
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,480
My dear Little Gou,

124
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
it's been a while.

125
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,240
I really miss you.

126
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,680
Do you miss me?

127
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,270
Didn't we just meet yesterday?

128
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,440
I can't possibly miss you.

129
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,120
You pretend to be cold,
but you actually miss me.

130
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,120
It's alright,

131
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,710
I won't mind.

132
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,070
By now, you know,

133
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,510
your skills are unacceptable to the world.

134
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,000
Interested in joining the divine sect?

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,510
No, I won't.

136
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,040
This is the sect leader's robe.

137
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,560
You must keep it safe.

138
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,190
Wear it for the Succession Ceremony.

139
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,480
Try it on to see if it fits.

140
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,950
Seems you can't

141
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,040
alter it anyway.

142
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,350
Just make do with it.

143
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,180
(Qingyu Garden)

144
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,040
Heng,

145
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,120
I don't know Linglong.

146
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,870
Is it okay for me to come?

147
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,470
It's fine, don't overthink it.

148
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,680
Princess Linglong just moved in.

149
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,750
We've helped so much,

150
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,870
and we're neighbors.

151
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,240
Let's have a meal to celebrate.

152
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,310
There's nothing wrong.

153
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,480
Exactly, why worry?

154
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,800
Good food is all that matters.

155
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,200
Besides, Linglong's nice.

156
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,200
Always thinking of food!

157
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,720
Your Highness,

158
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,480
I've settled in.

159
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,830
Mr. Gou,

160
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,720
Floral Knight,

161
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,920
(Qingyu Garden)
Mr. Zhuge, thanks for helping me.

162
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,320
I feel indebted.

163
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,240
So I thought of
treating you to a meal as thanks.

164
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,470
May I know who this young lady is?

165
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,960
Heng,

166
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,120
I should return now.

167
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,390
This is Ms. Ling'er.

168
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,630
We live together.

169
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,800
Oh, Ms. Ling'er.

170
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,000
We're all neighbors here.

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,560
It's fate that we meet.

172
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,600
If there's any lack of hospitality,

173
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,710
please don't take it to heart, Ms. Ling'er.

174
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,280
You're too kind, Your Highness.

175
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,340
(Qingyu Garden)

176
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,120
Please, friends, take a seat inside.

177
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,560
I'll go greet Mr. Deng.

178
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,720
This Deng Yunfeng,

179
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,840
why is he everywhere?

180
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,870
What's his purpose here?

181
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,630
I heard Prince Chang

182
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,200
betrothed Princess Linglong to him.

183
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,200
Delicious.

184
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Truly delicious.

185
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,520
That's all you can think of.

186
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,840
Thank you, Mr. Zhuge,

187
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,040
for saving us at Juhong Pavilion.

188
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,230
It was nothing, really.

189
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,160
Heng,

190
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,200
you can't drink alcohol.

191
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,200
Yes, you're right.

192
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,600
Ms. Ling'er,

193
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,910
this pastry is tasty.

194
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,920
You should try it.

195
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,030
Which pastry?

196
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,950
This one?

197
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,320
It is quite good.

198
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

199
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,440
When will you two marry?

200
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,830
Since you all know about our engagement,

201
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,120
why hasn't Mr. Deng

202
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,590
discuss our engagement with me yet?

203
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,920
Is he waiting for me to make a move?

204
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,080
Your Highness, I...

205
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,080
Prince Chang has indeed mentioned it,

206
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,030
but I...

207
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,080
I greatly admire Mr. Deng.

208
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,870
I wonder what Mr. Deng

209
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,870
thinks of me?

210
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,710
Your Highness.

211
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,920
Thank you for your hospitality.

212
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,150
I have urgent matters

213
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,520
at the Martial Artists Association.

214
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,750
We'll take our leave.

215
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,630
Yes, we have things to do.

216
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,670
Have we?

217
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,590
Yes.

218
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,990
We do have things to handle.

219
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,270
Your Highness,

220
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,680
no need to see us out.

221
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,720
We'll head off first.

222
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,320
You two catch up.

223
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,990
I just remembered

224
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,080
I have matters at the magistrate's office.

225
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,000
I must take my leave.

226
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,070
Sit down.

227
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,400
Linglong,

228
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,630
what are you planning?

229
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,440
Now everyone knows.

230
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,230
What's wrong with that?

231
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,550
Our engagement

232
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,230
was planned by my father and your godfather.

233
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,950
I believe

234
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,950
you understand their intentions.

235
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,320
The martial world is unpredictable now.

236
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,840
Martial Artists Association,

237
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,790
Sword Alliance,

238
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,950
and Divine Blade Sect

239
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
seem to serve my father,

240
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,710
or pledge loyalty to your godfather.

241
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,710
Actually, internal conflicts are abound,

242
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,470
hidden tensions are rising,

243
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,440
plus the Demonic Sect resurfaces.

244
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,120
The emperor is still young,

245
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,230
making the regime unstable.

246
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,990
If you and I could join forces,

247
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,470
we'd strengthen the Imperial Court's power,

248
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,150
and in the future,

249
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,350
we'd stand firm amidst the storms

250
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,920
of the marital world.

251
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,120
I understand,

252
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,560
but all this

253
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,320
is too sudden.

254
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,200
I feel if...

255
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,320
we're together,

256
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,280
we should know each other well.

257
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,470
You're overthinking it.

258
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,360
Since we came together

259
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,520
for mutual benefit,

260
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,110
I think

261
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,630
before we're truly married,

262
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,950
let's not interfere with each other.

263
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,760
What do you mean?

264
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,710
For example,

265
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,080
you fancy Ma Yingdan,

266
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,470
and I won't meddle in it for now.

267
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,950
A true daughter of Prince Chang.

268
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,280
In this aspect,

269
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,680
we're really in sync.

270
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,430
Eat.

271
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,080
Go ahead, it's safe.

272
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,120
Yingdan,

273
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,320
I understand your concern
about detoxification,

274
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,560
but can you

275
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,600
avoid checking me
during meals, baths, or sleep?

276
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,920
I'm haunted by it.

277
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,910
Even during baths?

278
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,990
Did you two...

279
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,320
Just eat.

280
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,230
Testing for poison can wait.

281
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,590
It takes time to prepare.

282
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,480
Yingdan, I'm immune now.

283
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,710
Testing on me is pointless.

284
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
Different poisons react differently.

285
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,360
I need your reactions

286
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,870
to study various antidotes.

287
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,160
That's a bit harsh, isn't it?

288
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,430
But...

289
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,280
You show no symptoms

290
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,680
from any poison.

291
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
- Yingdan.
- It's hard.

292
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,080
May I say something?

293
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,350
This tastes amazing!

294
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,590
Yingdan, your noodles are delicious.

295
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,560
All you do is eat.

296
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,150
Not one mission completed
since you became a member!

297
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,550
Food, food, food!

298
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,950
What's wrong, Master?

299
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,080
I aspire to be a hero.

300
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,350
Who's stopping you?

301
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,600
If you don't come with me,

302
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,230
I can't get any tasks.

303
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,440
And I'm out of money.

304
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,400
Yeah, and you lost your mask.

305
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,440
And that troublesome Wang Zipeng

306
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,270
said heroes below Snake Rank

307
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,080
aren't worth his time.

308
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,030
I've told you before

309
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,080
it's a waste of time.

310
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,470
I don't care.

311
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,440
Today, you all must

312
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,830
come with me on a task.

313
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,990
Fine, I'm in.

314
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,350
Alright, Master.

315
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,680
Let's eat first.

316
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,950
The noodles will get soggy.

317
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,880
Be good.

318
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,230
One more thing,

319
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,920
are you sure I'm immune to all poisons?

320
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,200
Did you give me another poison?

321
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,030
Lately, I've been dreaming of you.

322
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,950
You...

323
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,280
Just eat your meal.

324
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,720
And you too.

325
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,400
Yingdan, don't be upset.

326
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,510
Floral Knight,

327
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,080
Philanthropist Liao Jiale has died.

328
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,840
Why is he so happy?

329
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,960
"Overjoyed"?
[*Homophone]

330
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,320
I'll poison you to shut you up.

331
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,320
It's Liao Jiale, the philanthropist.

332
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
He's gone.

333
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,510
You mean the one

334
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,200
who always donated funds, Mr. Liao?

335
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,430
Yes.

336
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,710
He was a good man.

337
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,560
Is the cause of death known?

338
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,670
No signs of a struggle at the scene.

339
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,080
The body showed no anomalies.

340
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,920
It seems to be natural causes.

341
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,710
The body carries information,

342
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,630
but it can also deceive us.

343
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,550
Mrs. Liao mentioned

344
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,630
that Mr. Liao had heart issues.

345
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,120
Have a check.

346
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,310
Yes.

347
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,870
- Murder.
- Murder.

348
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,200
- Definitely murder.
- Definitely murder.

349
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,600
- Well done, Heng.
- Well done, Master.

350
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,950
What are you doing?

351
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,710
Playing detective games?

352
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,200
You constables, early in the morning,

353
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,800
already upset Mr. Deng.

354
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,800
Why are you three here?

355
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,030
Weren't you supposed to tidy up

356
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,680
Princess Linglong's room?

357
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,800
It's already done.

358
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,870
So quickly?

359
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,720
Indeed.

360
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,350
Mr. Deng already

361
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,430
had time alone with the princess.

362
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,830
Don't spill the beans.

363
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,600
Mr. Deng,

364
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,080
Mr. Liao's death is serious.

365
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,280
Mr. Deng, would you

366
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,080
be able to uncover the truth?

367
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,430
Upon initial observations,

368
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,910
it's a natural death.

369
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,040
Don't talk nonsense.

370
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,320
Are you truly a constable?

371
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,080
Mr. Liao did so much good.

372
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,040
He should've lived a long life.

373
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,110
How could he die so early?

374
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,030
Indeed.

375
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,760
I deduce

376
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,200
there must be a reason,

377
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,720
and it wasn't a natural death.

378
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,750
Superstitious detective?

379
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,870
Oh, come on.

380
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,350
Mr. Liao's case

381
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,110
will be handled entirely by the authority.

382
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,430
Guards!

383
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,110
Escort these people out.

384
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,630
Why?

385
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,510
Mr. Deng,

386
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
the truth hasn't been revealed yet.

387
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,320
Isn't it too soon

388
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
to call it an authority matter?

389
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,830
He's right!

390
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There is more

391
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,960
to this case.

392
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,830
Lingfeng's perspective

393
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,960
makes some sense.

394
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,150
Mr. Deng,

395
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,760
perhaps reconsider it?

396
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,480
Vice Chairman He,

397
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,520
I mean no offense.

398
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,590
Your association and my office

399
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,280
have collaborated before.

400
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,560
How about this?

401
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,560
Keep this under wraps

402
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,590
and plan carefully.

403
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,830
Mr. Deng, that's wise.

404
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,720
Did you just let it go?

405
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,920
Alright, let's go.

406
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,150
No more show.

407
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,000
Something's off.

408
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,910
Why's He Changzai so involved?

409
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,110
- Weird.
- Indeed.

410
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,310
Aren't they usually

411
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,000
so courteous to each other?

412
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,000
Mind your words.

413
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:32,340
(Baicao Hall)

414
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,000
Come out.

415
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,960
- Kneel.
- Move.

416
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,400
- What are you doing?
- Kneel.

417
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,630
- Hurry.
- Let go.

418
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,270
Be quiet, move.

419
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,030
- Honey.
- Move.

420
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,040
Honey!

421
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,190
Honey!

422
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,040
Didn't expect you to come
at this late hour.

423
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,630
What brings you here, Mr. Deng?

424
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,150
Mr. Liao just passed away.

425
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,280
There's refined salt circulating.

426
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,150
The quality is outstanding.

427
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,750
How is this related to his death?

428
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,760
Vice Chairman He, let's be frank,

429
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,440
we both know his business.

430
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,910
You and I are aware

431
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,800
that the key is the list he had.

432
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,830
Controlling Huizhou's illegal salt trade

433
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,720
means controlling Huizhou's economy.

434
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,280
That's why you're so involved, Mr. Deng.

435
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,390
The list Mr. Liao had

436
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,960
details every trade channel

437
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,830
of the illegal salt trade.

438
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,720
Even prominent figures were involved,

439
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,590
including members of your association.

440
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,480
After Mr. Liao's death,

441
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,670
the list has been lost.

442
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,680
I suppose you don't want this list

443
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,280
to be made public, right?

444
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,630
So the priority now

445
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,720
is to find that list.

446
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,590
And who gets

447
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,750
the illegal deal?

448
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,960
That's for the higher-ups to decide.

449
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,510
Mr. Deng, any leads on the list?

450
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,760
If I did, would I need you?

451
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,630
He,

452
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,390
we should cooperate.

453
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,270
Creating refined salt like this

454
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,040
is no ordinary feat.

455
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,830
Mr. Deng, have you heard of

456
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,760
Ye Dahei?

457
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,080
The demonic sect's Red Twin Blade,
Ye Dahei.

458
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,070
Is he in Huizhou?

459
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,480
Days before Mr. Liao's death,
there were reports

460
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,830
that the traces of Ye Dahei

461
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,830
were found around Huizhou.

462
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,320
Hold on.

463
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,560
I suspect he has the list.

464
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,670
Therefore,

465
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,590
let's not act rashly.

466
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,320
We must avoid alerting him.

467
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,910
You mean,

468
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,280
if we are to cooperate,

469
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,160
we must put on a show.

470
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,280
Force him to reveal himself.

471
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,720
Ye Dahei is suspicious by nature.

472
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,310
He won't appear easily.

473
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,790
So we must choose someone

474
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,160
to go undercover near him.

475
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,270
Once we get the list,

476
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,390
we will then

477
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,110
capture them all.

478
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,560
An undercover?

479
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,280
I do have a candidate.

480
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,030
(Martial Artists Association)
We plead for you to rid the evil.

481
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,150
Catch the molester!

482
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,440
Catch the molester!

483
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,390
Prove our innocence!

484
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,280
Prove our innocence!

485
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,480
Prove our innocence!

486
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
What's wrong, sir?

487
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,070
You don't know?

488
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,200
Something big happened.

489
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,120
What happened?

490
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,270
Several major crimes occurred.

491
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,400
- Major crimes.
- Major crimes.

492
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,430
Are you a victim?

493
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,480
Me?

494
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,800
Psychopath.

495
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,720
Oh, the victim is a psychopath.

496
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,750
Prove our innocence!

497
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,670
Let's go check it out.

498
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,320
Prove our innocence!

499
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,910
Miss,

500
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,320
are you here to report a case too?

501
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,510
What's your name?

502
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,400
How old are you?

503
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,430
Mo Qing'er.

504
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,760
I'm twenty-one.

505
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,200
When did you see the molester?

506
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,310
Around midnight last night.

507
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,190
I heard a noise at the window.

508
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,720
It was someone in black.

509
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,480
I shouted out loud.

510
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,560
Then he ran away.

511
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,000
Did you see his face?

512
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,190
Not very clearly.

513
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,880
But he had a creepy smile.

514
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,350
And he... he also...

515
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,880
How outrageous!

516
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,430
Which shameless scoundrel

517
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,790
would dare to harass

518
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,870
a young and pretty girl?

519
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,110
Call Gou Lingfeng, Zhuge Heng,

520
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,240
and Ma Yingdan over.

521
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,320
Yes.

522
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,320
Miss,

523
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,600
don't be afraid.

524
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,480
These three

525
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,320
are all good people.

526
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,720
Many important cases

527
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,870
were solved by them,

528
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,510
especially by Mr. Zhuge.

529
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,920
He is young and capable,

530
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,480
handsome and charming.

531
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,400
- Seriously?
- He'll help you.

532
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,350
Will you, Mr. Zhuge?

533
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,350
That molester...

534
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,000
did this to me.

535
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,920
Sanniang,

536
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,590
it's really you.

537
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,990
Silence!

538
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,720
Don't worry, miss.

539
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,590
We'll get to the bottom of it.

540
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,690
Please keep it quiet for now

541
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,150
after you find the culprit.

542
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,590
Don't worry about that.

543
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,350
We'll keep it confidential.

544
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,030
Miss, can you describe his appearance?

545
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,110
We can sketch him out.

546
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,030
Yes.

547
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,280
I'll give it a try.

548
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,830
Any distinct features?

549
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,270
Oh,

550
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,750
he had only one arm.

551
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,670
A single arm.

552
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,590
Just one arm.

553
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,520
Yes, just one arm.

554
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,830
The molestation is frequent.

555
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,910
Today's case marks the ninth one.

556
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,430
There must be more.

557
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,370
Some people are unwilling to report it.

558
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,070
But aren't these magistrate's matters?

559
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,800
Why involve the Martial Artists Association?

560
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,670
According to the victim,

561
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,520
he has only one arm.

562
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,830
We suspect

563
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,960
he is the One-Armed Hero.

564
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,800
- One-Armed Hero.
- Really?

565
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,440
- Really?
- Miss,

566
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,520
do you know the One-Armed Hero?

567
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,400
I've heard of him,

568
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,320
but never met him.

569
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,150
I can help you investigate.

570
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,870
Miss, please help catch him.

571
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,490
Rest assured.

572
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,720
We will assist you.

573
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,560
This case,

574
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,800
we will take it.

575
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,750
Shall we take it?

576
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,800
Shall we take it?

577
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,770
We will.

578
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,960
Thank you, heroes.

579
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,640
Please let me know if there are any clues.

580
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,680
I live in the Bun Shop, Chaoyang Street.

581
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,600
I'll head off now.

582
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,240
Be safe, miss.

583
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,280
Mr. Zhuge, you're taking the case.

584
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,830
That's great news.

585
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,480
With you handling the case,

586
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,400
I'm at ease.

587
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,240
What about Vice Chairman He?

588
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,070
Vice Chairman He?

589
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,560
He is quite unreasonable.

590
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,110
Don't worry, I won't tell him.

591
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,430
One-Armed Hero...

592
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,590
Ouch! It's too hot.

593
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
The molester...

594
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,030
Once I caught him,

595
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,920
I'd splash tea on his face.

596
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,840
Master,

597
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,040
now you know the taste of hate.

598
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,160
When will you teach me to be strong?

599
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,400
I want to seek revenge and wander.

600
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,320
No way.

601
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,670
Yingdan,

602
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,800
I've been meaning to ask you.

603
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,110
Do you have a compulsion?

604
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,170
Yingdan,

605
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,390
who have you compelled now?

606
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,640
Let's talk business.

607
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,200
What does "molester" mean?

608
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,240
It means sneaking into

609
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,750
someone's room quietly,

610
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,400
then uncovering their clothes,

611
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,920
feeling around,

612
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,430
and doing indecent acts.

613
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,620
Isn't that

614
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,720
what you did to me?

615
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,520
You're the "molester"!

616
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,670
Got it.

617
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,750
All noted down.

618
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,080
Everything's complete now.

619
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,320
Why are you everywhere?

620
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,280
I...

621
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,310
Floral Knight harassed Gou Lingfeng at night.

622
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,920
- Why note this down?
- I have OCD.

623
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,880
I'm detail-oriented.

624
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,000
I have OCD too.

625
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,920
Wang Zipeng,

626
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,950
what did you write?

627
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,550
No need to scare me.

628
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,000
I fear nothing for the truth.

629
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,890
- Listen.
- Really.

630
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,070
- I'll poison you.
- Yingdan.

631
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,590
- Wait.
- Don't remove your gloves.

632
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,110
The restroom is...

633
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,140
- There.
- Wang Zipeng.

634
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,000
Nature calls.

635
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,790
- Wang Zipeng, Wang Zipeng!
- Yingdan.

636
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,880
What did you write?

637
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,110
- Calm down.
- Nature calls.

638
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,000
- You're dead.
- Yingdan.

639
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,900
- Stop!
- Yingdan.

640
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,590
Short legs move quickly.

641
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,000
Everyone.

642
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,030
Vice Chairman requests

643
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,150
a private discussion.

644
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,310
Finally, you're here.

645
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,310
Gou, hurry up.

646
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,280
Make some space.

647
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,640
Quickly.

648
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,720
Stand in the middle.

649
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,310
Listen to me, follow my lead.

650
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,830
Three, two, one,

651
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,750
turn around.

652
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,160
Smile.

653
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,190
Show your move.

654
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,190
Master.

655
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,280
You three, leave now.

656
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,680
I knew you were capable.

657
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,510
Have you changed
since becoming vice chairman?

658
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,200
I meant you're more talented.

659
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
What move was that?

660
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,440
Sparks flew everywhere,

661
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,590
just like demonic sect skills.

662
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,590
Demonic sect member?

663
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,840
Takes one to know one!

664
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,590
Ye Dahei,

665
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,630
who is this guy?

666
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,750
Ye Dahei?

667
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,870
Is he in Huizhou City?

668
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,560
According to reliable sources,

669
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,750
this person recently

670
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,030
may have appeared near Huizhou.

671
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,360
What do you mean by "may"?

672
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,790
I raised salt prices with Deng Yunfeng,

673
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,720
cutting off supply

674
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,510
to force him to emerge.

675
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,240
Ye Dahei has been a key figure

676
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,720
in the illegal salt trade
of the demonic sect,

677
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,480
and he's very dangerous.

678
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,310
What's with Ye Dahei?

679
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,520
Is he scary?

680
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,980
Is he more scary

681
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,260
than being molested?

682
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,540
Red Twin Blade Ye Dahei

683
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,900
only wields one blade.

684
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,260
Oh, I see.

685
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,500
He's quite the trickster.

686
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,340
Because those who've seen
his second blade

687
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,380
are no longer alive.

688
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,740
Vice Chairman He,

689
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,180
your task isn't to capture him, right?

690
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,260
That's too risky.

691
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,540
I need at least a hundred heroes.

692
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,620
I'll lead them.

693
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,500
So we're not catching him for now.

694
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,940
Listen carefully,

695
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,100
what I'm about to say

696
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,740
is top secret.

697
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,820
Ye Dahei

698
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,900
has

699
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,940
a list of illegal salt channels.

700
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,580
If the demonic sect gets this list,

701
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,340
the consequences would be dire.

702
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,260
So,

703
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,020
we can't use force.

704
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,500
We must first send an undercover

705
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,580
for a strategic capture.

706
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,060
Is it really that complicated?

707
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,300
Can't we just burn it all?

708
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,940
Ah, Mr. Zhuge,

709
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,820
you always have sharp insights.

710
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,180
But we can't burn it.

711
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,660
Why not?

712
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,340
Because the people on this list

713
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,860
are certainly not ordinary.

714
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,220
What nonsense

715
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,420
are you all talking about?

716
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,980
I just have one question.

717
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,660
Is the hero point high?

718
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,220
If you complete this mission,

719
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,580
you can rise to Snake-rank hero.

720
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,620
Then I'm at odds with Ye Dahei.

721
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,740
Where is he now?

722
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,780
Demonic sect undercover.

723
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,860
- Undercover.
- Wonderful.

724
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,620
We can finally return to the sect.

725
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,780
- Snake Rank.
- Don't celebrate yet.

726
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,220
Red Twin Blade, Ye Dahei.

727
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,140
He's terrifying.

728
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,500
What's so terrifying?

729
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,260
With my master's talent,

730
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,980
it's easy to approach him.

731
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,420
We can also explore

732
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,300
the Moon Sword Skill.

733
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,220
Let's go!

734
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,980
Come back.

735
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,540
I should be the undercover.

736
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,180
What's it to you?

737
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,300
Right?

738
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,820
It's good to have a backup.

739
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,740
Master!

740
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,290
- Master.
- Go away.

741
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,580
Investigate molestation with Yingdan.

742
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,940
It's just a small case.

743
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,300
Yingdan can handle it herself.

744
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,900
I'd just get in her way if I went.

745
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,100
Don't think

746
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,660
I don't know what you're up to.

747
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,580
Go away.

748
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,620
Master.

749
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,220
Defying my orders will get you expelled
from the sect.

750
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,140
Then go ahead.

751
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,290
- Where would you live then?
- I...

752
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,460
Alright,

753
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,540
I'll investigate the molestation with Zhuge.

754
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,700
Don't worry.

755
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,620
You'll still get your share of points.

756
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,340
Yingdan,

757
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,100
you're the best.

758
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,780
This is my thanks for testing the poison.

759
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,660
Then,

760
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,980
I'll leave it to you.

761
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,900
I'm off.

762
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,660
Be careful.

763
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,860
Such a dangerous task.

764
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,340
I wonder if my master alone

765
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,540
can handle it.

766
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,780
Come on, drink up!

767
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,700
Cheers!

768
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,460
Finish it!

769
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,820
(Sincerity as Priority)

770
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,900
Pour it, pour it!

771
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,820
Here we go!

772
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,380
Don't dawdle,

773
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,340
just drink it!

774
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,780
Who are you?

775
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,980
Sneaking around.

776
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,620
- What are you doing?
- I...

777
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,300
Judging from your face...

778
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,500
You're probably one of ours.

779
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,940
One of ours.

780
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,380
One of ours.

781
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,700
Are you from the demonic sect?

782
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,140
I'm here to see Ye Dahei.

783
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,140
- Who?
- Who?

784
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,060
A gentleman uses his tongue

785
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,940
in our divine sect,

786
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,340
instead of

787
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,740
his fits...

788
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,860
Take it slow.

789
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,780
Behave.

790
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,780
Stop looking around.

791
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,740
Sir,

792
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,500
what's going on?

793
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,380
Many people are looking for Ye Dahei

794
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,220
these days.

795
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,140
What?

796
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,980
Oh my goodness.

797
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,460
Even if the demonic sect is notorious,

798
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,020
they are very united.

799
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,500
You disguise as one of them.

800
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,460
That way, you can blend in.

801
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,900
So from now on,

802
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,800
remember this,

803
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,740
you're a disciple

804
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,580
of Ge Tianlou of Eightfold Tower.

805
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,980
He's the most mysterious

806
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,820
blade master from the demonic sect lately.

807
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,740
Trust me, Ye Dahei won't be his acquaintance.

808
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,260
This way,

809
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,580
you'll be safe.

810
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,340
Enter by yourself.

811
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,820
Eight... Eightfold Tower.

812
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:53,060
Ge Tianlou of Eightfold Tower.

813
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,660
(Could he be the legendary Ye Dahei?)

814
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,860
Pardon me.

815
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,780
Lately, many pretend to be my fellows.

816
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,580
We must set an example.

817
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,380
Falsely posing as a fellow?

818
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,540
How despicable!

819
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,500
State your name.

820
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,580
Why are you seeking Ye Dahei?

821
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,220
I heard Mr. Ye

822
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,780
is visiting Huizhou City,

823
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,500
so I came to meet him.

824
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,740
I'd like to learn from him.

825
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,940
My name is Gou Lingfeng.

826
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,460
I am a disciple

827
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,380
from the Eight...

828
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,980
Eight Night Tower

829
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,060
under Ge Balou.

830
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,260
Are you referring to

831
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,060
Ge Tianlou of the Eightfold Tower?

832
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,340
Yes, yes, exactly.

833
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,580
It was renamed later.

834
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,780
I never expected that.

835
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,300
Three years ago,

836
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,100
I only met Ge Tianlou once.

837
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,820
I never expected after three years,

838
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,340
he'd change his name,

839
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,620
and even take a disciple.

840
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,780
(What kind of intel is this?)

841
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,700
(Didn't He Changzai say he never met him?)

842
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,020
Such is the unpredictability of life.

843
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,260
(Did something go wrong?)

844
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:31,460
(The End of Episode 9)

845
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,060
Any news on the list's whereabouts?

846
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,620
It's indeed with Ye Dahei.

847
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,860
Retrieve it.

848
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,500
You must keep it safe personally.

849
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,420
But Deng Yunfeng...

850
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,220
Make sure he never gets it,

851
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,580
even if you have to destroy it.

852
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,020
What about Eunuch Deng?

853
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,860
You don't need to worry about that.

854
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,460
