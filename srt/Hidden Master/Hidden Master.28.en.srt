1
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,110
Is everything okay

2
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,270
with the Hero Gathering?

3
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,720
Godfather,

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,000
everything has been arranged.

5
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,350
However,

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,830
in Poison Alley,

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,800
Gou Lingfeng

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,230
clearly agreed

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,320
to fight for us,

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,030
but he changed his mind

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,640
after he came back.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,670
I've staked everything

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,390
for you to compete this time.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,640
Yunfeng,

15
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,750
don't let me down.

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,870
Aye!

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,720
Godfather,

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,350
about Gou Lingfeng...

19
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,200
Gou Lingfeng is indeed a talent,

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,710
and it'd be good
if he could work for us.

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,640
However, now he's been

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,000
deceived by Wu Guangming.

23
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,320
But you don't need to worry too much.

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,000
I've got

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,520
a trump card waiting for him.

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,000
If that doesn't work,

27
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,240
we can't let him become

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,350
our biggest threat.

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,640
Godfather, you mean...

30
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,790
Though wildfires rage endlessly,

31
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,120

=Episode 28=

78
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,680
That cunning fox, Eunuch Deng,

79
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,080
is so shameless.

80
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,400
Uncle Wu, you were right.

81
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,310
They must've been
planning this for a long time.

82
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,560
I can't believe

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,520
they dared to set you up.

84
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,750
That assassin from last time

85
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,470
was definitely sent by them.

86
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,630
Lingfeng,

87
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,120
you're our only hope

88
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,870
in the Hero Gathering.

89
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,840
Don't worry,

90
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,910
I won't let them succeed.

91
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,870
You've seen

92
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,240
Eunuch Deng's methods.

93
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,030
He's not only colluded with
the demonic sect

94
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,030
but controls the entire Hero Gathering

95
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,560
with just an imperial edict.

96
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,630
I, Wu Guangming,

97
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,400
am willing to die for the association,

98
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,840
but I can't stand against
the Imperial Court.

99
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,200
Lingfeng,

100
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,120
you're brave and talented.

101
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,810
So, among the heroes in the association,

102
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,310
I only trust you.

103
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,470
Uncle Wu,

104
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,720
I've always seen you as my role model.

105
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,070
No matter how the association changes,

106
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,070
I will always trust you.

107
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,120
Okay.

108
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,480
I knew I was right about you.

109
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,270
Don't worry,

110
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,720
I'll help you get the hero token.

111
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,350
However,

112
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,270
Eunuch Deng has forbidden

113
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,830
the use of demonic skills.

114
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,470
Well...

115
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't worry about that.

116
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,950
I have a plan.

117
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,480
Really?

118
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,000
Of course.

119
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,120
But the Hero Gathering is coming,

120
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,510
and all forces will try to get
what they want.

121
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,190
You must stay clear-headed.

122
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
During this time,

123
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,720
don't let anyone manipulate you.

124
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,560
Don't worry.

125
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
It's not working.

126
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,680
It's not working at all.

127
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,880
Did you forget?

128
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,870
I'm your living remedy.

129
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,240
Why are you here?

130
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,680
I knew you'd need me,

131
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,160
so I came.

132
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,230
But...

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,160
the Hero Gathering is coming.

134
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
You can't lose blood now.

135
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,240
Yes,

136
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,920
the Hero Gathering is important,

137
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,200
but

138
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,480
you're far more important.

139
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,910
Let's go home.

140
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,230
Yingdan,

141
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,630
you're awake.

142
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,310
You idiot.

143
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,510
If you don't feel well,

144
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,680
you must tell me.

145
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,600
As long as I'm here,

146
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,830
I won't let you suffer from the recoil.

147
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,480
Thank you.

148
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,800
Don't be so polite to me.

149
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,720
You really don't
take care of yourself at all.

150
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,630
The recoil was fierce,

151
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,070
yet you faced it alone.

152
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,000
If I hadn't discovered it,

153
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,630
anything could happen.

154
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,360
From now on,

155
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,120
you can't leave me

156
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,870
for more than two hours.

157
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,830
Yingdan, I just want you

158
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,800
to relax and be

159
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,480
a carefree child

160
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,830
when you're with me.

161
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,240
You can laugh and cry

162
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,950
whenever you want to.

163
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,750
You can cry on my shoulder.

164
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,720
I'm here for you.

165
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,560
Okay?

166
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,670
Master.

167
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,000
Gou.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,480
How's Yingdan doing?

169
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,320
She's fine now.

170
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,560
She's fallen asleep.

171
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,640
That's good.

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,840
Master.

173
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,630
Focus on the Hero Gathering.

174
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,830
Ling'er and I will take care of Yingdan.

175
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,720
Eunuch Deng alone

176
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,000
has stirred up chaos in the association.

177
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,920
If Prince Chang meddles in,

178
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,830
who knows what will happen?

179
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,630
That's not true.

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,070
My father would never

181
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,430
- stir up conflict.
- Your Highness.

182
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,390
Your Highness,

183
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,230
it's late.

184
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,480
What brings you here?

185
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,870
Now you know

186
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,920
who controls the association, right?

187
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,800
You're family,

188
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,120
so don't pretend to take our side.

189
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,240
Prince Chang asked you
to marry Deng Yunfeng

190
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
just to work with Eunuch Deng

191
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,720
to control the association.

192
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
It's not that simple.

193
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,600
I don't know who's in power,

194
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,870
but I trust the chairman.

195
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,440
If I tell you he won't be the chairman

196
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,910
after the Hero Gathering,

197
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,720
do you still want to follow him?

198
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,240
What do you mean?

199
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,720
As you can see,

200
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,390
the association has many problems.

201
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,150
The so-called imperial court oversight

202
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,080
was just a way

203
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,510
to control the forces

204
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,910
in the martial world.

205
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,360
However, the oversight

206
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,150
seems to have changed.

207
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,550
With just an imperial edict,

208
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,390
the rules of the Hero Gathering
can be changed.

209
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,510
Is this really an oversight?

210
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,750
Moreover,

211
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,080
lately,

212
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,720
many strange events
have happened in Huizhou,

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,670
yet they always turned out to be

214
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,440
related to the association
or the demonic sect.

215
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,510
Is this really just a coincidence?

216
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,750
I know our association
has many problems,

217
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,670
but I believe

218
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,790
Chairman Wu is trying to

219
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,030
improve it.

220
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,030
And I will help him

221
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,150
to build a new association.

222
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,790
- Your Highness.
- Yingdan.

223
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,030
What are you trying to say?

224
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,320
Why are you here?

225
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,150
Floral Knight, you're here.

226
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,240
Now that we have a smart person,

227
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,270
things will be easier.

228
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,510
Recently,

229
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,600
I've got a lot of suspicious intel.

230
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,240
I was worried you might be deceived,

231
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,670
so I came here to share it with you.

232
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,000
Your Highness,

233
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,270
we're not interested in your intel.

234
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,110
Ling'er.

235
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,590
Let her speak.

236
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,270
As far as I know,

237
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,480
every officer in the association

238
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,000
must be strictly reviewed
by the chairman.

239
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,510
Back then,

240
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,200
the vice chairman

241
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,550
was actually the head
of the Alchemy Division,

242
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,550
and during his tenure,

243
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,390
he maintained connections
with the demonic sect.

244
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,550
As the chairman,

245
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,120
how could he not know

246
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,550
such a serious situation?

247
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,870
That was because

248
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,360
he wasn't in Huizhou

249
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,320
but in the Imperial City.

250
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,750
There were many internal affairs

251
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,790
that he didn't know.

252
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,200
The Alchemy Division
also took advantage of this

253
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,670
and acted so brazenly.

254
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,110
Okay.

255
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,750
Maybe that's true.

256
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,440
Then let's

257
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,240
talk about Puppet Knight.

258
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,080
As far as I know,

259
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,870
the Imperial Court never issued an order

260
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,150
to hunt Puppet Knight,

261
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,910
yet He Changzai still insisted

262
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,360
on executing him on the spot.

263
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,320
Who

264
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,790
wanted to kill him so badly?

265
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,750
Your Highness,

266
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,480
it was chaotic at the time.

267
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,390
Besides,

268
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,360
He Changzai is an opportunist,

269
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,630
so this

270
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,150
doesn't prove much.

271
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,750
Mr. Zhuge,

272
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,080
the Sword Alliance has been
under Eunuch Deng's command.

273
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,000
Let's think about it.

274
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,080
Even if Zhuge Xun was bold,

275
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,960
would he dare to act alone

276
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,480
to seize power and rebel?

277
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,270
Unless

278
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,320
someone was

279
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,270
pulling the strings

280
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,720
and

281
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,670
provided enough support for him.

282
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,840
So, who could

283
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,870
this person be?

284
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,230
Okay.

285
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,360
I've told you so much.

286
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sure you have

287
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,550
your answer, right?

288
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,320
These cases have been solved,

289
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,870
and you're bringing them up now.

290
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,030
Don't you have selfish intentions?

291
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,910
You can say that,

292
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,840
but I am not stirring up conflict.

293
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,150
The Martial Artists Association
is under my father's command,

294
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,670
and it was my father

295
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,270
who promoted Wu Guangming.

296
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,270
Whatever Wu Guangming can offer you,

297
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,200
my father can do the same.

298
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,120
Your Highness,

299
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,550
what exactly do you want?

300
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,480
I just don't want everything

301
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,000
to be so chaotic.

302
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,630
If you truly care about the association,

303
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,550
why not fight for my father

304
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,600
and the association?

305
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,030
Ridiculous.

306
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,840
I am fighting for the chairman

307
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,550
and the association.

308
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,000
What's the difference?

309
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,910
Gou Lingfeng,

310
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,870
after all I've told you,

311
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,150
have you truly understood nothing?

312
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,720
Wu Guangming

313
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,600
is not someone
you can easily see through.

314
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,000
He's manipulative.

315
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,870
Stop trying to persuade me
to work for Prince Chang.

316
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,800
Okay.

317
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,270
Then let me ask you, Mr. Zhuge.

318
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,600
Mr. Zhuge.

319
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,440
Your Highness.

320
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,440
The Sword Alliance has always been
under Eunuch Deng's control.

321
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,630
Now that it's in a great crisis,

322
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,120
has Eunuch Deng ever stepped in

323
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,440
to help resolve your trouble?

324
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,750
If my father is in charge of
the Sword Alliance,

325
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
he would never

326
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,270
turn a blind eye.

327
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,670
Your Highness,

328
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,360
stop turning us against each other.

329
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,750
Ms. Ling'er,

330
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,240
do you truly love Mr. Zhuge?

331
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,910
What have you given him?

332
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,870
Wealth,

333
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,750
power,

334
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,030
or betrayal?

335
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,440
Your Highness, what do you mean?

336
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Your Highness,

337
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,630
don't talk to her like that.

338
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,600
Mr. Zhuge,

339
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,240
my father and I can help you

340
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,630
resolve the urgent crisis
of the Sword Alliance.

341
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
I hope you can consider this.

342
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,510
Don't worry.

343
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,390
I don't force others to comply,

344
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,670
nor do I ask for any sacrifice from you.

345
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,910
I only hope

346
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,960
if my father and I

347
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,360
ever need the Sword Alliance's help,

348
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,080
you can remember our kindness

349
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,360
and lend us a helping hand.

350
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,510
Heng,

351
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,790
don't trust her.

352
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,800
Okay.

353
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,670
I've said enough.

354
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,720
I think it's clear.

355
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,550
I hope you can make a decision.

356
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,550
This year's Hero Gathering

357
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,030
will be a great show.

358
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,910
Heng,

359
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,360
don't trust her words!

360
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,440
She just said

361
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,670
she and Prince Chang

362
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,480
can solve the Sword Alliance's problem.

363
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,350
Ling'er,

364
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,390
once the problem is solved,

365
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,030
we can finally get married.

366
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,000
Zhuge,

367
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,510
you must think about it carefully.

368
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,910
I thought about it

369
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,030
before.

370
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,200
If we rely on other people's help,

371
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,510
it won't address the root
of the problem.

372
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,750
The Sword Alliance must rely on itself.

373
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,200
Lingfeng.

374
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,670
I think

375
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,320
Princess Linglong had a point.

376
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,960
I've thought about everything she said.

377
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,750
Perhaps it was Chairman Wu...

378
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,600
Chairman Wu...

379
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,480
I know him better

380
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
than any of you.

381
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,670
He truly cares for me.

382
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,320
I would never betray him.

383
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,750
Tomorrow is the Hero Gathering.

384
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,750
It's too late.

385
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,600
I'm going to sleep.

386
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,800
Lingfeng...

387
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,670
Master!

388
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,750
Are you there?

389
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Tomorrow,

390
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,320
I'll go to the Hero Gathering.

391
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,200
I must get the hero token!

392
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,790
This old man

393
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,120
always fails me at crucial moments.

394
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,600
My disciple

395
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,720
is a good man,

396
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,960
but he's so foolish.

397
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,200
Master!

398
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,390
You freaked me out!

399
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,270
You need a lesson.

400
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,200
Master,

401
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,550
tomorrow is my big day,

402
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,080
but I'm so confused right now.

403
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,240
Silly boy,

404
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,360
why are you confused?

405
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,370
Why don't you

406
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,870
compete for the divine sect tomorrow?

407
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,630
After all, I've given you the clothes.

408
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,030
Master, stop teasing me.

409
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,600
I'm really annoyed now.

410
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
Everyone

411
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,510
has their own ideas.

412
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,670
My head is a mess.

413
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,270
Listen,

414
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,150
believe in yourself.

415
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,670
There will be many variables tomorrow,

416
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,000
but the only thing that's certain

417
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,720
is that you'll get the hero token.

418
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,390
Not for anyone else

419
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,840
but for yourself.

420
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,600
Understand?

421
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,990
Master!

422
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,000
Next time,

423
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,870
let's change a place.

424
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,640
It really stinks here.

425
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,350
Yingdan.

426
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,270
I'm really worried about you.

427
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,440
Listen,

428
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,830
if you can't win,

429
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,750
don't push yourself.

430
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,590
Got it?

431
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,000
Got it.

432
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,270
Where are Zhuge and Ling'er?

433
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,110
No idea.

434
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,310
I haven't seen them since morning.

435
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,030
What a fair-weather friend.

436
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,350
Luckily, I have you, Yingdan.

437
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,750
Who's a fair-weather friend?

438
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,720
Gou, you're going to the competition.

439
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,620
You should eat more.

440
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,590
Don't starve.

441
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,680
You'll have energy after eating.

442
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,720
I knew you wouldn't

443
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
ignore me.

444
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,560
Go away!

445
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,440
(Single-Day Ticket)

446
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,480
(5 for 1 day, 9 for 2 days)
One!

447
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,720
Buy your tickets here!

448
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,750
Come here, sir.

449
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,880
Do you need tickets?

450
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,920
5% discount!

451
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,110
This way, this way!

452
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,070
- Over here!
- I'll take one!

453
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,240
Miss, how many tickets?

454
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,110
Just one.

455
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,790
Are you with that lady?

456
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,270
- Two tickets for a 5% off.
- No, just one.

457
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,480
Line up here!

458
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,640
Two tickets for a 5% off!

459
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,200
- Do you need tickets?
- Just one.

460
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,040
One ticket?

461
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,200
- Okay.
- This way, please.

462
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,040
Here you are.

463
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,860
(Hero Gathering)

464
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,420
(Wind Surges in the Hero Gathering,)

465
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,060
(Heroes Gather to Show Their Talent.)

466
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,100
(Hero Gathering)

467
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,020
(Grand celebration
of the 3rd Hero Gathering)

468
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,660
(Wind Surges in the Hero Gathering,)

469
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,180
(Heroes Gather to Show Their Talent.)

470
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,480
(Go, Lingfeng! We love you!)
Lingfeng, you're so handsome!

471
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,480
(Lingfeng, keep going!)
Lingfeng!

472
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,830
You're so handsome!

473
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,020
- Keep going!
- Lingfeng!

474
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,590
Lingfeng!

475
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,430
Got it.

476
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,030
Why are there so few audiences?

477
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,590
Maybe the tickets are too expensive.

478
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,070
Why does the Hero Gathering

479
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,070
charge tickets?

480
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:18,220
(Hero Gathering)

481
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,160
We live for justice!

482
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,920
Today is the first day
of the Hero Gathering.

483
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,920
(Hero Gathering Winner)
Let's stay tuned!

484
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,880
Don't hit me!

485
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,030
Why hasn't Master made a move?

486
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,480
I don't know.

487
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,980
(Deng Yunfeng, Gou Lingfeng)

488
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,400
Great!

489
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,790
It's all rigged!

490
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,070
Shame on you!

491
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,030
(Deng Yunfeng, Gou Lingfeng)
We're entering the semifinals.

492
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,640
The winner will compete in

493
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,680
tomorrow's final for the hero token.

494
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,720
Deng Yunfeng, the inspector of MAA,

495
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,000
has won

496
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,510
and made it into the final.

497
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,590
Let's welcome Divine-Sword Knight!

498
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,830
This is too much.

499
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,310
This is a duel

500
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,160
between Loyalty Knight from Huizhou

501
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,070
and Divine-Sword Knight from Luzhou.

502
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,200
The duel begins!

503
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,960
May I ask your name?

504
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,310
I'm Liu Yue,
Divine-Sword Knight from Luzhou.

505
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,070
I've heard much about
the young and talented Loyalty Knight.

506
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,510
I can finally spar with you today.

507
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,400
My weapon is the Celestial Sword,

508
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,790
and I've mastered

509
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,240
the 26 styles of Celestial Swordplay.

510
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,920
Looking forward to sparring with you.

511
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,350
Loyalty Knight,

512
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,640
please make your move.

513
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
Guangming,

514
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,550
I've heard Divine-Sword Knight
is a righteous man

515
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,920
who never cheats,

516
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,510
and his swordplay

517
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,200
is also one-of-a-kind.

518
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,750
It seems Gou Lingfeng

519
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,920
will have a hard time.

520
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,310
Without real abilities,

521
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,920
you can't win

522
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,880
in the Hero Gathering.

523
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,400
I believe in Lingfeng.

524
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,960
You can never

525
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,030
foresee the result.

526
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,000
Indeed.

527
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,640
Let's wait and see.

528
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,070
I think

529
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,640
Gou Lingfeng is bound to lose.

530
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,140
In the earlier rounds,

531
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,510
he won by sheer luck.

532
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,750
But Divine-Sword Knight

533
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,240
is a famous hero.

534
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,090
He won't go easy on him.

535
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,070
Lingfeng, make your move!

536
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,070
Don't disturb him.

537
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,750
He's analyzing the opponent's weakness.

538
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,270
You know nothing.

539
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,480
Lingfeng is using his internal energy

540
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,000
to battle with him.

541
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,510
He also used this

542
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,030
against All-Around Knight last time.

543
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,680
It was impressive.

544
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,750
Really?

545
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,790
Why hasn't Master made a move yet?

546
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,000
No idea.

547
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,190
In that case,

548
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,880
I won't hold back.

549
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,350
Master!

550
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,510
- What's going on?
- Great!

551
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,590
Master!

552
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,350
Keep it up!

553
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,720
Lingfeng!

554
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,440
Did he use demonic skills?

555
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,830
Eunuch Deng,

556
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,680
you've warned him.

557
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,720
- He wouldn't dare use it.
- You...

558
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,620
(Deng Yunfeng, Gou Lingfeng)

559
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,700
(Deng Yunfeng)

560
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,300
(Gou Lingfeng)

561
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,400
Master, that was incredible.

562
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,270
You made it to the final so easily.

563
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,070
But we didn't even see it clearly.

564
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,350
Divine-Sword Knight

565
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,240
just lost on his own.

566
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,550
What do you mean by "lost on his own"?

567
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,030
That was my punch!

568
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,680
We get it.

569
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,960
There was a flash of golden light.

570
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,070
Did you throw a flash bomb?

571
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,760
Go away!

572
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,110
You're always talking nonsense.

573
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,200
Lingfeng,

574
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,400
what really happened?

575
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,590
Yeah, Gou.

576
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,310
I've never seen you
use that move before.

577
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,680
It looked incredible.

578
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,880
It was the chairman's arrangement.

579
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,960
He secretly taught me a technique

580
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,240
that can alter
the form of demonic skills.

581
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,480
You need to know that martial arts

582
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,510
know no good or evil,

583
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,640
yet the heart

584
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,510
of a martial artist does.

585
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,680
When you comprehend the way of justice

586
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,030
and reach a certain level,

587
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,880
you'll be able to
combine all the skills.

588
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,790
In that case,
you can control your martial arts

589
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,790
and release them

590
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,240
in whatever form you like.

591
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,520
Uncle Wu...

592
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,910
Uncle Wu,

593
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,480
I'm using demonic skills, right?

594
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,310
Have you ever heard that justice comes

595
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,510
in all forms, and martial arts

596
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,750
know no good or evil?

597
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,030
Yes, my master often says it.

598
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,110
Well, do you know my master?

599
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,720
I don't know your master.

600
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,000
But I didn't expect

601
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,510
he'd told you the same thing.

602
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,750
It seems your master
is also a true expert.

603
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,960
That's why I can compete

604
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,350
in the Hero Gathering

605
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,200
and fulfill my dream of

606
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,680
becoming a great hero.

607
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,880
Chairman Wu is impressive.

608
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,200
What an amazing method.

609
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,310
Master, you can teach me.

610
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,630
Lingfeng!

611
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,350
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

612
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,240
- We worried for nothing.
- Exactly.

613
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,880
I just wanted to surprise you all.

614
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,790
Besides, Chairman Wu
asked me to keep the secret.

615
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,590
Such a powerful technique

616
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,480
must be saved until the last moment.

617
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,920
Anyway,

618
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,880
I must get the hero token!

619
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,510
Tomorrow is the final.

620
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,350
Master, you must teach
Deng Yunfeng a lesson.

621
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,190
- Sure.
- Come on.

622
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,200
Wish you get the hero token!

623
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,040
Okay!

624
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,760
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

625
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,520
Three moves.

626
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,400
Where is Ling'er?

627
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,510
She went out to buy something.

628
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,720
She should be back soon.

629
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,510
Get off me!

630
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,240
Heng!

631
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,480
Get off me!

632
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
- Ling'er!
- Get off me!

633
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,350
- Heng!
- Get off her!

634
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,550
- Stop!
- Get off me!

635
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,110
- Your Highness.
- Are you okay?

636
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,480
What are you doing?

637
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,840
Mr. Wang.

638
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,630
I'm here.

639
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Tell them

640
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,310
what happened.

641
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,270
Actually, that day,

642
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,110
I followed you to Poison Valley,

643
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,680
and I discovered Ms. Ling'er

644
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,720
secretly contacted the association.

645
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,560
You...

646
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,590
- This...
- Ling'er.

647
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,480
Ms. Ling'er,

648
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,160
although I don't like you,

649
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
when Mr. Wang

650
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,720
told me about this,

651
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,070
I couldn't believe it.

652
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,750
However, I've been

653
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,160
keeping an eye on you ever since.

654
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,200
You just came back
from Wu Guangming's place, right?

655
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,400
So, tell me,

656
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,200
what role will you play

657
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,920
at tomorrow's Hero Gathering?

658
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,430
Ling'er,

659
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,310
are they telling the truth?

660
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,390
Check that spot.

661
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,220
Ling'er,

662
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,820
why did you do this?

663
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,340
Because Gou

664
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,220
can't stay in Poison Valley.

665
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,580
He must attend the Hero Gathering.

666
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,100
Chairman Wu knew
Eunuch Deng's conspiracy all along,

667
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,540
and Gou

668
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,740
is the only one
who can get the hero token.

669
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,900
- I...
- He doesn't want

670
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,100
the association to be controlled
by Eunuch Deng.

671
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,060
Ling'er,

672
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,580
do you have some hidden reasons?

673
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,860
Did Wu Guangming force you

674
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,700
to do this?

675
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,020
No,

676
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,700
I did everything

677
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,260
willingly.

678
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,090
Chairman Wu said

679
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,220
Prince Chang and Eunuch Deng

680
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,830
have always coveted the association,

681
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,440
and they both want

682
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,980
Gou and Heng's help.

683
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,740
Gou is soft-hearted,

684
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,380
and Heng is impulsive.

685
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,500
I just don't want you

686
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,660
to be used by others.

687
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,220
I meant no harm.

688
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,180
But you've been using us all along.

689
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,580
I reported to the chairman,

690
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,900
but I never expected

691
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,140
He Changzai would harm you.

692
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,580
Then why did you deceive me?

693
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,780
What about our relationship?

694
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,540
Why would you betray me?

695
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,060
Was your affection for me all fake?

696
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,100
I'm sorry!

697
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,940
Heng, I'm so sorry!

698
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,120
- Ling'er!
- Zhuge!

699
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,340
Calm down.

700
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,300
I have to figure it out.

701
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,420
Ling'er!

702
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,540
Your Highness,

703
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,780
are you satisfied now?

704
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,620
I just want you to know the truth.

705
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,460
Just leave!

706
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,620
Lingfeng.

707
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,460
It's time to leave.

708
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,140
The competition is about to start.

709
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,180
But Zhuge hasn't returned.

710
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,060
What Ling'er did hit him hard.

711
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,540
He needs time to process.

712
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,740
But you're different.

713
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,700
You have to stay strong.

714
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,100
The final is about to start.

715
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,220
Yingdan,

716
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,620
I'm not sure what I'm fighting for.

717
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,020
Chairman Wu saved my life.

718
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,820
He's my idol

719
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,820
and a caring elder.

720
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,420
But

721
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,860
I'm not sure if he's a good person.

722
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,260
He sent Ling'er to watch us,

723
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,500
which means he never trusted us.

724
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,180
As Ling'er said, maybe he just

725
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,740
wanted to protect you.

726
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,580
But...

727
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,140
I don't know.

728
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,620
This time,

729
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,980
I really don't know.

730
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,580
Lingfeng.

731
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,100
Remember,

732
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,780
you don't fight for anyone else

733
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,020
but yourself.

734
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,020
You fight for
the martial world in your heart.

735
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,340
Gou Lingfeng,

736
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,340
do you remember what you said

737
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,540
when you became Loyalty Knight?

738
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,580
The weak will no longer be bullied,

739
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,300
and those in power will be constrained.

740
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,300
(Righteous and Mighty)
With the elders taken care of,

741
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,420
children receiving proper education,

742
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,500
and couples cherishing each other.

743
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,580
I hope everyone can live in peace.

744
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,860
I, Gou Lingfeng, swear

745
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,540
to kick all demon...

746
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,540
all evildoers

747
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,900
out of Huizhou City

748
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,940
and bring peace to everyone.

749
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,060
Yingdan.

750
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,180
In the past,

751
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,980
others always urged me
to get the hero token.

752
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,740
My master,

753
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,940
the chairman,

754
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,860
and Deng Yunfeng.

755
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,180
But this time,

756
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,660
I want to fight for myself.

757
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,380
Thank you, Yingdan.

758
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,140
Let's go.

759
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,140
Wait, Yingdan.

760
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,940
What's wrong?

761
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,780
I need to get something.

762
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,140
Why so secretive?

763
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,980
Let's go, Yingdan.

764
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,460
That's better.

765
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,900
That old man won't bother me anymore.

766
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,740
Let's go.

767
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,540
(The End of Episode 28)

768
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,460
Ling'er.

769
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,780
Tomorrow is the Hero Gathering's final.

770
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,980
I don't know what tricks

771
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
Eunuch Deng will play.

772
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,060
There will surely be casualties.

773
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,140
I have a bottle of elixir
from the Imperial Court.

774
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,500
Take it,

775
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,660
just in case.

776
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,740
Will it be dangerous tomorrow?

777
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,300
Will Zhuge and the others be at risk?

778
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,060
I don't know.

779
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,180
But if they get hurt,

780
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,700
make sure they take it immediately.

781
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,980
This elixir

782
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,100
can fully restore their energy.

783
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,980
Don't worry,

784
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,700
I'll also protect all of you.

785
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,180
You should go back,

786
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,580
or they'll be worried.

787
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,540
