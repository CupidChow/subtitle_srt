00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,000
Can you two stop staring at me?

2
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,000
My Lord, it's Mr. Zhuge's order.

3
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,430
Just give up.

4
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,270
I'm not going back with you.

5
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,750
Tell that old man

6
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,200
I've found my master.

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,790
I want to learn demonic skills.

8
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,120
Oh, no, please don't!

9
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,590
- My Lord! My Lord!
- My Lord, stop!

10
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,080
- My Lord, no, no.
- You can't!

11
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,480
My Lord!

12
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,070
- My Lord, don't!
- Calm down!

13
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,030
- Okay?
- My Lord, My Lord!

14
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,320
My Lord, My Lord!

15
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,560
- Listen,
- My Lord, don't!

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
I, Zhuge Heng,

17
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,950
dare to do anything.

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,710
- My Lord!
- My Lord!

19
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,630
My Lord!

Master!

67
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,870
I've told you I'm not your master!

68
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,790
Master!

69
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,880
Master!

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Please accept me.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,840
I don't want much.

72
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,080
I just want to be strong,

73
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,960
get revenge,

74
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,880
and travel.

75
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,670
Have you mistaken me for someone else?

76
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,680
Besides, you have

77
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,470
quite a few wishes.

78
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,750
This can't be wrong.

79
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,870
Yesterday, you used Dragonfly Steps

80
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,560
and Demon Body-Tempering Method.

81
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,150
They're the ultimate demonic skills

82
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,390
that I want to learn.

83
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,790
Wait.

84
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,920
Who used demonic skills?

85
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,480
Who works for the demonic sect?

86
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,950
Don't talk nonsense.

87
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,190
I used Water Walk

88
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,550
and Buddha Body-Tempering Method.

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,990
I understand, Master.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,840
No...

91
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,760
Master,

92
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,400
did you kill Wang Fugui?

93
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,750
His heart was taken out.

94
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,360
What demonic skills did you use?
Teach me.

95
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,590
I'm begging you.

96
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,880
I'm not from the demonic sect,

97
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,590
and I don't know Wang Fugui.

98
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,950
I... I don't know you either.

99
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,150
Plus, why did you save me?

100
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,390
How am I supposed to explain this?

101
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,560
Don't do this, Master.

102
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,350
What are you really up to?

103
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,080
I only want

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,920
revenge.

105
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,000
It's a blood feud.

106
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,720
What does it have to do

107
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,040
with the demonic sect?

108
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,710
Because my enemy only fears
the sword technique

109
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,510
where the moon
can be seen in the sword light.

110
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,200
You're from the demonic sect,

111
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,000
so you must know that move, right?

112
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,350
Okay.

113
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,710
You want revenge, don't you?

114
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,150
I want revenge too.

115
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,830
A blood feud

116
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,000
with the demonic sect.

117
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,390
If you join the demonic sect,

118
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,360
we'll become

119
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,350
sworn enemies,

120
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,800
and I'll never be your master.

121
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,560
So, do you get it now?

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh? What does that mean?

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I hate when people say that.

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,950
Master.

125
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,830
What's wrong with you?

126
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,870
I've told you a million times

127
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,350
I'm not your master!

128
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,390
Master, what's this?

129
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,440
All heroes have this.

130
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,680
Hero Yang,

131
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,720
Hero Ouyang,

132
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,560
and Hero Guo,

133
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,400
they all drink this.

134
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you don't agree,

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,920
I won't give it back.

136
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,840
Give it to me.

137
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,350
How is it?

138
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,720
Those heroes carry wine.

139
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,000
Why do you carry tea?

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,120
None of your business.

141
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,950
You're using demonic skills!

142
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,480
Come down.

143
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,950
Why are you avoiding me?

144
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,000
Of course, I'm really scared.

145
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,040
Was I

146
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,200
really wrong about you?

147
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,430
Young man,

148
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,320
a jailbreak is a felony.

149
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,270
You should turn yourself in.

150
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,270
I need to get registered
at Martial Artists Association.

151
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,510
Just go.

152
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,070
Martial Artists Association again?

153
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,350
I don't want any ties with it.

154
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,800
It's deeply

155
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,910
corrupted.

156
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,000
Why do people want to join it?

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,920
Shut up!

158
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,560
Join the association and become a hero

159
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,880
is my dream.

160
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,840
Was I

161
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,350
really wrong about you?

162
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,000
How can the master from the demonic sect

163
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,760
be a common folk who wants to join
Martial Artists Association?

164
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,920
It seems

165
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,280
I need to keep searching.

166
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,190
Just go, quickly!

167
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,110
Just go!

168
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,640
No one can stop me
from being a great hero.

169
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,910
I knew you lied.

170
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,270
(Martial Artists Association)

171
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,560
I heard the demonic remnant
was released.

172
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,390
It means he's not the culprit.

173
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,720
- Culprit?
- Culprit?

174
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,240
It's not the demonic sect.

175
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,920
Otherwise, Deng Yunfeng

176
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,760
wouldn't go easy on him.

177
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,470
Wasn't he rescued
by a member of the demonic sect?

178
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,320
I don't know about that.

179
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,070
I wonder

180
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,200
how he offended Floral Knight.

181
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,320
Honey,

182
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,750
the demonic sect is so chaotic.

183
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,630
Yes,

184
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,950
it's quite chaotic.

185
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,160
Someone's here.

186
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,120
Gou Lingfeng,

187
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,000
why are you here?

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,560
I'm really not from the demonic sect.

189
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,950
Back then,

190
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,720
that demonic sect member

191
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,150
knocked everyone down

192
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,590
with a sword aura

193
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,080
and took me away.

194
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,480
That's incredible!

195
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,510
- And then?
- Master!

196
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,690
- What about that person?
- Master!

197
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,920
Then the demonic sect member
showed up...

198
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,880
It's him!

199
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
So, it's you!

200
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,160
It's him!

201
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,430
What a coincidence, young man.

202
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,510
We meet again.

203
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,750
Did I bump into you?

204
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,600
Let me check for you.

205
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,590
Check my registration form first.

206
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,320
Zhuge Heng?

207
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,700
(Hero Registration Form)
Sect,

208
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,680
Sword Alliance.

209
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,230
Martial arts,

210
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,840
Heavenly Sword Technique.

211
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,320
Weapon, Heavenly Sword!

212
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,400
Are you Mr. Zhuge,

213
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,590
the young leader of Sword Alliance?

214
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,990
My apologies.

215
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,630
We live for justice!

216
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,990
Miss, here's my form.

217
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,990
He's my master.

218
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,200
Gou Lingfeng.

219
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,500
No sect.

220
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,350
Self-taught genius.

221
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,590
Martial arts,

222
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,240
Walnut Fist.

223
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,440
What on earth is this?

224
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,480
Miss, let's hurry for the interview.

225
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,990
I need to rush home for dinner.

226
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,150
Let's go.

227
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,350
I'll take you to the backyard.

228
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,990
Let's go.

229
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,420
(Horse)

230
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,200
This is the ranking list of heroes,

231
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,400
which shows each hero's
monthly achievements.

232
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,040
In other words,

233
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,240
(MAA, No. 120)
Achievements will affect

234
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,200
(No. 135, No. 141)
your rankings.

235
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,670
Listen,

236
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,560
I will definitely reach the dragon rank.

237
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,010
Let's go.

238
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,040
Keep up with them!

239
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,560
This is the central hall
of Martial Artists Association.

240
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,550
Only registered heroes

241
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,920
can enter.

242
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,280
Can you see the six paintings
on both sides?

243
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,960
They represent

244
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,400
six hero ranks.

245
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,060
(Snake, Dragon, Tiger, 8th Month Ranking)
Ranked by Dragon, Tiger,

246
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,030
Horse, Snake, Ox, and Mouse

247
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,520
(8th Month Ranking)
in order.

248
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,630
Dragon is the highest rank,

249
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,200
and Mouse is the lowest one.

250
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,590
Look at this.

251
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,990
(Wu Guangming, Radiant Knight)
He's our chairman.

252
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,920
Radiant Knight!

253
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,750
Radiant Knight?

254
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,790
He's Radiant Knight?

255
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,950
He looks so charming,

256
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,680
(Wu Guangming, Radiant Knight)
so majestic,

257
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,400
so mysterious,

258
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,670
- so...
- Pretentious.

259
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,920
Pretentious?

260
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,750
He saved me when I was little.

261
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,440
Saved you?

262
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,040
That's why he's my idol.

263
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,360
I want to become

264
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,110
a great hero like him.

265
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,560
He saved you?

266
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,520
It was a dark, windy morning...

267
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,640
Kid,

268
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,790
don't be afraid.

269
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,070
Anyway,

270
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,470
he's so cool.

271
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,520
I... I adore him.

272
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,520
I will be a great hero like him

273
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,080
and eradicate the demonic sect

274
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,920
to avenge my nanny.

275
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,510
He played pai gow at my house

276
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,870
and lost a lot of money.

277
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,040
A terrible player.

278
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,950
Don't insult him.

279
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,640
Well...

280
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,400
Miss...

281
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,110
What are you doing?

282
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,760
Miss,

283
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,440
I want to know

284
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,440
how I can become

285
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,080
a great hero like Radiant Knight.

286
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,920
Radiant Knight?

287
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,040
You need the hero token.

288
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,320
Let's put that aside for now.

289
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,360
Right now,

290
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,840
you can't even attend
the Hero Gathering.

291
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,160
Only Tiger-rank heroes can.

292
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,560
How can I...

293
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,750
The exam is about to start.

294
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,110
- It's time.
- Let's go.

295
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,470
Aren't you going?

296
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,030
Mr. Zhuge has other things to do.

297
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,470
Go over there.

298
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,700
(Martial Arts)

299
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,630
We live for justice!

300
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,710
Have a seat.

301
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,510
Today,

302
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,200
Mr. Wang is unwell,

303
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,240
so we'll have another chief examiner.

304
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,120
Let's give a round of applause

305
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,560
to welcome the Tiger-rank hero,

306
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,870
Floral Knight,

307
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,750
Ma Yingdan.

308
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,870
- Floral Knight?
- Floral Knight?

309
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,680
Floral Knight?

310
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,120
Why is

311
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,320
everyone so afraid of her?

312
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,200
Keep it down.

313
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,670
She's Floral Knight.

314
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,830
Don't offend her, or you'll be doomed.

315
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,910
Who let you in?

316
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,120
- Get out!
- No.

317
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,080
- Well...
- Get out, okay?

318
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,160
Floral Knight.

319
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,270
Sanniang

320
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,280
brought him in.

321
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,830
Is there a problem?

322
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,470
Is there a problem?

323
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,590
Everyone is here.

324
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,830
- Everyone...
- Don't move.

325
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,790
It's her obsessive-compulsive disorder.

326
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,750
Miss,

327
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,200
I look better.

328
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,830
Appearance is key for a hero.

329
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,990
We may start.

330
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,030
Now I announce

331
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,300
our exam officially starts.

332
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,280
(Martial Artists Association)

333
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,400
First question,

334
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,390
as a hero from
the Martial Artists Association,

335
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,990
what would you do
when you face a corrupted official?

336
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,800
Take from the rich and aid the poor!

337
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,550
Go undercover,

338
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,670
find evidence of corruption,

339
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,150
report to the court,

340
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,230
and await the judgment.

341
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,950
Second question.

342
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,480
During a mission,

343
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,600
what if a martial artist
is killing innocent people?

344
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,560
Kill them immediately!

345
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,150
Subdue the martial artist,

346
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,240
hand them over to our group,

347
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,320
and await the court's judgment.

348
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,230
No potential at all.

349
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,750
Completely hopeless.

350
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Third question,

351
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,350
what would you do

352
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,750
if you meet demonic remnants
while upholding justice?

353
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,510
Subdue them,

354
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,150
hand them over to our group,

355
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,230
and await the court's judgment!

356
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,320
Kill them immediately!

357
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,550
You spare

358
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,200
evildoers' lives,

359
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,520
yet why would you kill demonic remnants?

360
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,990
You're abusing your power.

361
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,200
This exam is so unfair

362
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,440
and unjust.

363
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,300
(Gou Lingfeng's Score)

364
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,400
And it's not transparent.

365
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,040
What are you doing?

366
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,440
Your information is unclear.

367
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,480
And you act strangely.

368
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,160
Let's put aside your identity.

369
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Someone like you

370
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,600
will never

371
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,550
join us.

372
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,630
Go home and be a farmer.

373
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,280
My farm is taken care of.

374
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,000
Enough.

375
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,400
Don't make a scene.

376
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,550
Next,

377
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,160
please proceed to
the martial arts exam ground.

378
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,670
Hey,

379
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,910
did you offend Floral Knight?

380
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,120
Why do I feel

381
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,200
she was targeting you?

382
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,350
How would I know?

383
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,710
She's crazy.

384
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,230
You've got that right,

385
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,630
I heard Floral Knight

386
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,230
is skilled at using poison,

387
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,840
and she's vengeful

388
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,040
and temperamental.

389
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,710
No one dares to approach her.

390
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,680
If you offend her,

391
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,990
you're doomed.

392
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,590
Wait for me!

393
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,750
Am I really that unlucky?

394
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,920
- I...
- Don't touch me.

395
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,630
How did I offend you?

396
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,600
Don't you remember?

397
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,790
I... I...

398
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,320
What did I do?

399
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,870
You're old!

400
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,550
Who are you?

401
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,560
Don't touch me!

402
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,160
Old lady!

403
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,870
You're old! You're old!

404
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,110
I get it now.

405
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,680
That night,

406
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,670
you dyed your hair grey on purpose.

407
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,520
Who would dye their hair grey?

408
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,110
I get it.

409
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,920
You're bald.

410
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,150
You're the bald one!

411
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,960
You ruined my pills

412
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,110
poked me with a silver needle,

413
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,480
and said I was bald!

414
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,160
Did I do all these?

415
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,350
Didn't you?

416
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,400
Even if I did,

417
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,030
you shouldn't fail me

418
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,240
for these trivial matters.

419
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,630
Trivial matters?

420
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,430
Fine.

421
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,720
Madam,

422
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,830
I apologize.

423
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,910
Madam?

424
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,480
Miss.

425
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,800
I... I'm sorry.

426
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I apologize.

427
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,750
But I was right

428
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,000
about the questions.

429
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,630
As a hero,

430
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,350
we must uphold justice

431
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,790
and help people in need.

432
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,720
We can't kill innocent people.

433
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,800
Anyway, you're wrong.

434
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,320
Then tell me, what is a hero?

435
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,670
It's just an occupation.

436
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,800
You're wrong!

437
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,550
Yes,

438
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,480
I'm so wrong.

439
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,320
Hero is the best occupation
in the world.

440
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,000
They don't need to work every day

441
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,080
like a constable,

442
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,270
nor paying taxes every year

443
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,670
like a merchant.

444
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,440
They can uphold justice,

445
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,430
win people's favor,

446
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,910
and enjoy welfare benefits.

447
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,080
If it weren't for this,

448
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,830
who'd be a hero?

449
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,870
I would.

450
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,670
I will fight injustice

451
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,390
and be admired by all.

452
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,350
I don't care what you think.

453
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,520
I really don't mind.

454
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,240
No matter how hard it is,

455
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,870
I won't give up.

456
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,840
Okay.

457
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,670
Follow me.

458
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,110
Can I take the martial arts exam?

459
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,270
Bet you won't pass it.

460
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,430
Thank you, Madam.

461
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,140
(Touchstone)

462
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,390
What's this?

463
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,590
Touchstone.

464
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,400
Shatter it.

465
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,720
It's huge.

466
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,910
You'll pass if you shatter it.

467
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,400
You...

468
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,150
Are you fooling me again?

469
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,280
You can't?

470
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,440
Then you should quit.

471
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,800
Okay, I'll do it.

472
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,080
Just like that?

473
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,080
Just like that.

474
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,520
I didn't know

475
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,350
it was so fragile.

476
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,830
It's Heavenly Black Iron.

477
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,550
Only a hero of Tiger Rank

478
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,800
and above can leave marks.

479
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,440
No one has left a trace
over the past 20 years,

480
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,750
and you just shattered it.

481
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,030
Am I that good?

482
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,150
Better than a Tiger-rank hero?

483
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,240
What skill did you use?

484
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,520
I've never seen it before.

485
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,110
Just an ordinary skill.

486
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,110
And it...

487
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,560
just broke like that.

488
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,960
Maybe it was left outside for too long

489
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,430
and got fragile.

490
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,830
Walnut Fist?

491
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
Did I pass?

492
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,000
Damaging property.

493
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,500
- Fail!
- Wait!

494
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,350
- Get out!
- Wait, you...

495
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,720
What's wrong with you?

496
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,350
- Master?
- Wait, you...

497
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,270
What's wrong with you?

498
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,590
The paintings on your face...

499
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,750
None of your business.

500
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,670
I like them.

501
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,510
Shut up!

502
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,800
Floral Knight!

503
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,830
Is that guy your enemy?

504
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,800
Here's my word.

505
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,350
If that person

506
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,430
joins our association today,

507
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,280
I'll forsake my name!

508
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,800
Villain, what a villain!

509
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,000
Why are you here?

510
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,150
You also failed?

511
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,200
No worries.

512
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,670
After all, you want to join
the demonic sect.

513
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,540
(Hero Approval Certificate)
What?

514
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,680
Did you pass it?

515
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,720
I heard a fool missed the exam

516
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,640
and failed.

517
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,960
Was it you?

518
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,400
Missed the exam?

519
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,630
A fool?

520
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,120
You've gone too far, Ma Yingdan!

521
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,670
Floral Knight?

522
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,830
Did you offend her?

523
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,190
Did I offend her?

524
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,030
I don't think so.

525
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,590
Did I upset her?

526
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,160
I think I did.

527
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,190
Floral Knight

528
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,830
was born with a poisonous body.

529
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,030
Whoever touches her dies.

530
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,350
No one dares to approach her.

531
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,200
Besides, with unique meridians,

532
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,430
she can't learn martial arts.

533
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,590
She seems miserable.

534
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,270
Well, how did she

535
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,720
become a hero?

536
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,000
She's got great medical skills,

537
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,630
and she's a poison master.

538
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,590
She can kill without a trace.

539
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,920
How does she usually use poison?

540
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,870
I think

541
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,320
she poisons the food.

542
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,600
Master, come with me.

543
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,390
This way, Master.

544
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,640
Please.

545
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,720
Is this your home?

546
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,040
It's quite unique.

547
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,240
Unique?

548
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,280
Let me ask you.

549
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,630
How did you pass it?

550
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,830
They begged me to pass.

551
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,830
Why?

552
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,030
Master,

553
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,240
you should think about

554
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,910
how to get Floral Knight's approval.

555
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,910
Should I try to seduce her?

556
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,040
Maybe I'm not handsome,

557
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,150
but I grow on people.

558
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,630
They'll gradually like me.

559
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,320
Would they?

560
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,320
Maybe just a little bit.

561
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,480
Maybe I should give her some money.

562
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,350
Master,

563
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,240
how can you be so vulgar like them?

564
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,630
Then what should I do?

565
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,320
I think...

566
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,470
Come on.

567
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,110
Besides, you don't seem

568
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,720
to be rich.

569
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,870
Did you rent this place?

570
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,430
What's wrong?

571
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,510
Nothing.

572
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,000
It looks like

573
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,110
my family's estate in Huizhou.

574
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,840
Your family?

575
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,960
Gou Family Trade Association?

576
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,740
(Universal Banknote)

577
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,280
The weather

578
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,080
suddenly got warm.

579
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,240
Gou Lingfeng.

580
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,350
The martial world is over.

581
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,710
Everyone

582
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,480
is living a mundane life.

583
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,240
My Lord,

584
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,520
the eyewitness is here.

585
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,400
Greetings, My Lord.

586
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,510
I've told him

587
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,160
everything I know.

588
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,080
Be honest.

589
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,510
This is Mr. Deng.

590
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,430
He has some questions.

591
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,590
Tell me every detail about

592
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,200
what you saw.

593
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,120
Remember,

594
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,000
every detail.

595
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,670
I'm just a sewer worker.

596
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,510
That night,

597
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,960
I went to the Martial Artists Association
to collect manure.

598
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,350
Then I saw two people

599
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,910
having tea in that room.

600
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,800
It seems to be

601
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,870
a perfect tonight for murder.

602
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,910
When do we act?

603
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,900
(Wang Fugui, Wealthy Knight)

604
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,670
You know too much.

605
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,830
What did they say?

606
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,750
I was really scared.

607
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,320
I didn't hear clearly.

608
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,270
They talked about demon

609
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,430
and pill.

610
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,000
My Lord, could it be
that the demonic sect

611
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,720
has returned to the martial world?

612
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,190
As long as Mr. Deng is here,

613
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,550
no demonic sect members

614
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,830
can make a scene,

615
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,630
let alone return to the martial world.

616
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,480
They must pay for their crimes.

617
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,520
- Enough.
- Yes.

618
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,830
Is there anything special

619
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,560
about this person?

620
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,960
Only one good eye,

621
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,880
and broken eyebrow.

622
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,120
What else?

623
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,320
Well...

624
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,400
The culprit looked

625
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,830
quite wealthy.

626
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,750
One-eyed,

627
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,800
with broken eyebrow,

628
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,430
and looking wealthy.

629
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,840
Could it be...

630
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,920
(Martial Artists Association)

631
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,590
I'll announce Wang Fugui's death.

632
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,230
Are you crazy?

633
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,350
Deng Yunfeng warned us

634
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,590
not to leak any information.

635
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,960
Who does he think he is?

636
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,200
This is our internal matter.

637
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,760
It's my duty to deal with it.

638
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,880
We can't let him take all the credit.

639
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,800
I don't understand.

640
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,920
Speak properly.

641
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
The chairman sent a secret letter.

642
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,760
When this is done,

643
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,320
we'll get a generous reward.

644
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,030
(Righteous and Mighty)
We live for justice!

645
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:49,870
We live for justice!

646
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,320
Heroes,

647
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,080
a few days ago,

648
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,830
our Tiger-rank hero, Wang Fugui,

649
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,550
was killed by the demonic sect.

650
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,590
It was tragic!

651
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,720
I gathered you all here

652
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,110
because I need you to help me

653
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,790
find the culprit.

654
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,680
I don't want

655
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,070
an outsider to take all the credit

656
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,830
for solving

657
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,960
our internal affair, okay?

658
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,680
Yes, can't let outsiders take it!

659
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,720
Whoever provides clues

660
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,590
will be promoted to a higher rank.

661
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,190
If you catch the person,

662
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,240
you'll jump three ranks!

663
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,190
Three ranks?

664
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,910
Clue?

665
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,880
My Lord,

666
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,200
someone saw it when Mr. Wang was killed,

667
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,120
and we found him.

668
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,150
The suspect is one-eyed,
with broken eyebrows.

669
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,990
Do you know?

670
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,800
I do.

671
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,880
I can help.

672
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,830
I have clues.

673
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,200
Why are you here?

674
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,960
- Get out!
- None of your business.

675
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,830
I will join
the Martial Artists Association.

676
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,400
Someone,

677
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,350
kick him out!

678
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,590
Hey, Miss, I'm sorry.

679
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,070
I really have clues.

680
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,990
Get out!

681
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,760
Hold this for me.

682
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,110
What are you doing?

683
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,590
Everyone is watching!

684
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,440
My dad said this would work.

685
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,590
- Stop.
- What are you doing?

686
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,720
Everyone is watching.

687
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,590
What are you doing with the money?

688
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,480
Manager He,

689
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,830
he is not reliable.

690
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,280
I really have clues.

691
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,840
Floral Knight,

692
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,480
he says he has clues.

693
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,030
This is crucial.

694
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,550
We should take him to

695
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,720
the vice chairman.

696
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,150
Don't you agree?

697
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,920
Mr. He,

698
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,640
if you want to mess with him,

699
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,560
I won't stop you.

700
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,200
But I warn you,

701
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,510
the vice chairman has been unwell.

702
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,800
You better not bother him.

703
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:41,950
Come with me.

704
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,000
Wait a minute.

705
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,920
I'll join you.

706
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,240
Come on.

707
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,160
Okay.

708

(Hawkeye Knight, Vice Chairman)

709
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,990
Please.

710
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,910
Vice Chairman,

711
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,510
this gentleman said

712
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,000
he had clues about Mr. Wang's death.

713
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,240
Did he tell you?

714
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,790
I wouldn't dare to ask.

715
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,320
You should be the first to know.

716
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,000
Let him speak.

717
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,350
Come on.

718
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,270
Okay.

719
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,480
That person is one...

720
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,280
One...

721
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,560
Why did you stop? What one?

722
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,000
He's...

723
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,150
The eye...

724
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,830
No.

725
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,520
The eyebrow...

726
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,910
No.

727
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,350
The figure...

728
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,790
Why are you comparing it

729
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,720
to our vice chairman?

730
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,590
He's nothing like the vice chairman.

731
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,790
Of course not.

732
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,790
Get to the point.

733
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,630
Don't worry, our vice chairman
will support you.

734
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,960
My stomach hurts.

735
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,640
I'll go home and be a farmer.

736

737
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,800

739
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,800
It's too crowded here.

740

Let's

741

(Oh no,)
