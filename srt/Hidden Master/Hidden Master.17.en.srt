(Gou Mansion)

2
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,630
You startled me!

3
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,350
Gou,

4
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,320
you're rich.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,240
Have a seat.

6
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,750
Why are you here?

7
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,430
Where's Lingfeng?

8
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,800
Don't even mention it.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,560
That stubborn boy has quite a temper.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,240
He has caused quite a stir

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,080
at the MAA again.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,680
That's just how he is.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,040
Please take care of him.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,600
What... what does this mean?

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Just take it, take it.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,350
Well... then I'll accept it.

17
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,720

64
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,840
Yu,

65
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,760
please get off.

66
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,510
We've arrived.

67
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,200
Where is this place?

68
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,360
This is where I end things with you.

69
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,670
It seems

70
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,320
you've been planning this for a while.

71
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,370
Was the assassination of the MAA Inspector

72
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,830
your doing?

73
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,830
That's right.

74
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,320
It was me.

75
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,710
May I ask

76
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,640
why you wanted to kill us?

77
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,990
Why would I want to kill you?

78
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,480
Because I'm of illegitimate birth.

79
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,040
Yet you're the Sword Saint.

80
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm destined to serve you.

81
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,830
What gives you the right

82
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,630
to turn the sacred Sword Alliance

83
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,950
into a mercantile guild reeking of profit?

84
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,120
Meanwhile, my aspiration

85
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
to accomplish great achievements

86
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,320
doesn't even get a chance.

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,160
Yu,

88
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,560
do you remember what the Sword Alliance

89
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,080
used to stand for?

90
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,000
You, a traitor to the Sword Alliance.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,440
Just cut to the chase.

92
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,480
Since the founding of the Sword Alliance

93
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,420
by our ancestor Zhuge Feng 180 years ago,

94
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,470
we've always been leaders
of the righteous path.

95
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,350
When we issued orders,

96
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,000
no one dared to disobey.

97
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,360
Even in recent years,

98
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,190
when the Imperial Court established the MAA

99
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,830
to oversee matters in the martial world,

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,360
the Sword Alliance

101
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,240
still used to hold an unmatched status.

102
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,830
But look at it now.

103
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,150
What has it become?

104
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,990
Does the current Sword Alliance

105
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,350
still deserve the name?

106
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,480
Now, it's nothing more than

107
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,030
a pawn of the Gou Family Trade Association.

108
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,480
And all of this is because of you,

109
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,510
Zhuge Yu.

110
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,200
Let me tell you,

111
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,390
only I

112
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,640
can lead the Sword Alliance
to reclaim its glory.

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,390
Do you really think

114
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,680
that mere fighting and killing

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,150
can bring peace to the Sword Alliance,

116
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,120
or help the people of the realm?

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,270
What unmatched status,

118
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,470
what glory,

119
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,600
are nothing but

120
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,800
excuses for your ambition.

121
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,590
Even if you kill me, it's useless.

122
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,830
Heng is the rightful heir.

123
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,760
Zhuge Heng,

124
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,190
the son of a demonic sect witch.

125
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,160
How could he deserve it?

126
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,880
Don't insult Shun!

127
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,870
Even if she's from the demonic sect,

128
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,000
she never did anything

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,320
against humanity.

130
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,640
So what?

131
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,120
Demonic sect followers must be eradicated.

132
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,680
Years ago,

133
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,000
I accidentally uncovered her origins

134
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,830
and reported it to the MAA

135
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,710
to force you to abdicate willingly.

136
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,760
Who would've thought she'd be so foolish,

137
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,680
risking her life to defend you.

138
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,030
She ruined all my plans.

139
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,830
Her death

140
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,880
was caused by your actions.

141
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,710
Zhuge Xun.

142
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,000
So, it was you.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,640
It really was you!

144
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,680
I'll avenge Shun!

145
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,470
My dear big brother,

146
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,120
your sword aura is fading.

147
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,120
Why keep struggling?

148
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,830
You're a dead man!

149
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,910
Don't touch my father!

150
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,710
Heng.

151
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,830
- Father.
- Why are you here?

152
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,270
I saw the Sword Alliance carriage,

153
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,800
so I followed it here.

154
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,120
You walked right into this.

155
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,320
Very well.

156
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,190
Saves me the trouble.

157
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,110
Zhuge Xun,

158
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,910
I will kill you

159
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,560
to avenge my mother.

160
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,160
Heng!

161
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,390
Father.

162
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,310
Heng,

163
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,590
you must leave now!

164
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,790
Father.

165
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,880
This time,

166
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,640
I won't leave you.

167
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,270
Time to reunite you with your family.

168
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,680
Stop!

169
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,750
Grandmaster.

170
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,800
Grandmaster.

171
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,720
Who are you?

172
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,270
Zhuge Xun.

173
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,080
I won't deal with you myself.

174
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,080
If you can defeat Heng,

175
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,800
I'll spare your life for now.

176
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,590
A defeated foe

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
still dares to boast?

178
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,080
Grandmaster,

179
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,830
I can't defeat him.

180
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,800
Heng,

181
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,630
you're curious about learning

182
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,710
the sword technique
that reveals the moon.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,350
This sword technique

184
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,160
is called Moonlight Phantom.

185
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,950
Only your mother
had the right to use it.

186
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,150
Today, I'll teach this technique to you,

187
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,200
so that you can

188
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,200
avenge your mother.

189
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,280
Mr. Zhuge,

190
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,000
be cautious.

191
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,230
The first move,

192
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,280
Moon Rising.

193
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,840
Sword light cuts through the night,

194
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,870
a soul as deep as mountains and seas,

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,080
and lights the path ahead.

196
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,320
Flashy.

197
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,110
What a lousy sword technique,

198
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,280
merely a child's play at best.

199
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,160
Today,

200
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,240
I'll show you clearly

201
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,800
how I kill this worthless father and son.

202
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,000
Second move,

203
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,710
Flicker of Light.

204
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,750
Sword sweeps like the stars,

205
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,670
endless and ever true,

206
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,800
guarding the edge of dawn and night.

207
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,200
Impossible!

208
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,830
You left me no choice.

209
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,160
Heng, watch out!
He's using Shadow Swordplay!

210
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,400
Third move,

211
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,350
Moonlight Traversing.

212
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,510
The sword dances through the clouds,

213
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,560
filled with love,

214
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,870
weaving the hearts of those who cling.

215
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,520
You coward!

216
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,280
Do you dare to kill me?

217
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,510
Speak!

218
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,160
How did you learn the Shadow Swordplay?

219
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,350
Your father long abandoned martial arts.

220
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,040
He still knows nothing to this day.

221
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,280
The secret manual
of the Shadow Swordplay

222
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,510
has long been taken by me.

223
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,680
He's not fit to lead the Sword Alliance!

224
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,190
Heng,

225
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,000
the sword technique you just used

226
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,360
was specially created

227
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,280
by your grandfather for your mother.

228
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,040
What did you just say?

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,920
Do you mean

230
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,680
he is my grandfather?

231
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,440
Then where is he now?

232
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,990
He's left.

233
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,800
He said you're doing well

234
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,350
and hopes to drink with you next time.

235
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,470
Shun.

236
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,320
Shun.

237
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,560
Did you hear me?

238
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,870
Shun,

239
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,950
I miss you, my daughter.

240
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,750
Heng is truly a good child.

241
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,000
Shun,

242
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,710
I miss you dearly.

243
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,560
My dear Shun...

244
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,280
Xun,

245
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,550
if you continue down this path,

246
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,360
it will lead to a tragic end.

247
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,350
Spare me your words.

248
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,280
You've already sided
with the demonic sect.

249
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,040
What right do you have to lecture me?

250
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,150
Father, don't waste words on him.

251
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,030
Let me finish him off

252
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,280
and avenge my mother!

253
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,470
Watch out!

254
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,750
Gou Lingfeng,

255
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,670
are you alright?

256
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,800
Where did they go?

257
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,430
Yingdan,

258
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,350
I feel my inner energy

259
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,200
has completely vanished.

260
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
This is bad.

261
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,560
It seems to be Fatigue Powder.

262
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,040
Yingdan,

263
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,440
you seem fine to me.

264
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,630
Didn't you say I'm immune to poisons?

265
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,080
Why did it work for me?

266
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,110
Fatigue Powder isn't a poison.

267
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,830
It's a miracle remedy for healing.

268
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,510
After extracting inner energy,

269
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,230
it turns into Qi and Blood to heal wounds.

270
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,200
However,

271
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,240
the loss of Qi and Blood

272
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,870
causes one to feel weak and sore.

273
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,320
Since I lack inner energy,

274
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,830
I avoided its effects.

275
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,870
Take a rest first.

276
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,520
We'll leave once your energy returns.

277
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,230
Lingfeng!

278
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,320
This place is nice, Lingfeng.

279
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,950
Lingfeng!

280
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,950
May I ask who you are?

281
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,710
Excuse me,

282
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,630
is this Gou Lingfeng's residence?

283
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,630
I am his father.

284
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,240
Ah, Chairman Gou.

285
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,350
Please, come in.

286
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,080
May I ask who you are?

287
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,030
I am Ling'er,

288
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,520
a friend of Gou.

289
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,350
Chairman Gou, please have a seat.

290
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,440
A friend of Lingfeng?

291
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,160
Chairman Gou, have some tea.

292
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,870
Here,

293
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,830
a gift for the occasion.

294
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,720
Chairman Gou,

295
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,110
I really can't accept this.

296
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,080
You're too kind.

297
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,040
Miss Ling'er.

298
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,350
You're quite thoughtful.

299
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,560
Miss Ling'er.

300
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,200
How long have you known Lingfeng?

301
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,320
We've known each other

302
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,680
for quite some time now.

303
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,470
Miss Ling'er,

304
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,230
what do you think of Lingfeng?

305
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,520
He is a righteous man,

306
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,720
always putting others first.

307
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,390
He embodies the spirit of a hero,

308
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,000
earning my deep admiration.

309
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,200
When I was gravely ill,

310
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,120
it was thanks to Gou's help

311
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,080
that I narrowly escaped death.

312
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,000
Miss Ling'er,

313
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,800
when do you plan to marry Lingfeng?

314
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,200
Chairman Gou, you've misunderstood.

315
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,000
I... Gou and I

316
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,560
are merely friends.

317
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,950
Friends?

318
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,510
I hear you,

319
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,440
but I don't believe it.

320
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,590
Take it slow.

321
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,070
Come.

322
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,120
Lingfeng.

323
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,040
This Fatigue Powder...

324
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,030
I heard my mother mention it,

325
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,800
but I've never dealt with it myself.

326
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,240
I can only try using harmful poison

327
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,560
to counteract its effects.

328
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,440
It might cause some damage to your body.

329
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,750
No need to explain.

330
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,800
Just try it directly.

331
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,830
Miss Ling'er,

332
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,520
what happened?

333
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,120
Gou and Yingdan

334
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,480
went to rescue the Sword Saint.

335
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,510
They haven't returned yet.

336
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,440
I'm worried they might be in danger.

337
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,040
Who's Yingdan?

338
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,400
Chairman Gou.

339
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,080
Shouldn't you worry about
your son first?

340
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,720
Zhuge Yu's martial arts

341
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,270
are impressive. I'm not worried.

342
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,920
Lingfeng's skills are even better.

343
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
Miss Ling'er,

344
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,390
is that Yingdan you mentioned

345
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,040
also Lingfeng's friend?

346
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,200
That Prince Chang

347
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,680
surely has an outstanding daughter.

348
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,360
Yunfeng,

349
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,830
you should learn from that young lady.

350
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,480
In terms of intellect and strategy,

351
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,840
you are far behind her.

352
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,760
Yes.

353
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,280
Father,

354
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,870
could the princess be right

355
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,200
that Zhuge Xun tried to assassinate me?

356
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,360
If that's really the case,

357
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,280
things could get bad.

358
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,000
Yingdan and the others

359
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,320
might be in danger.

360
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
I'll lead my men

361
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,880
to capture Zhuge Xun.

362
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,870
Wait.

363
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,800
Sit down.

364
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,590
You're getting anxious again.

365
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,480
Let me ask you.

366
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,440
If there's no one supporting him,

367
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,030
how could Zhuge Xun alone

368
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,560
stir up such a storm?

369
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,190
- Mr. Deng.
- Ling'er!

370
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,040
Why are you here?

371
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,160
Yesterday, Heng, Yingdan,

372
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,000
and Gou went to

373
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,110
rescue the Sword Saint.

374
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,960
They haven't returned.

375
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,280
I'm worried something might've happened.

376
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,350
Ah, the mask has slipped.

377
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,200
I want to see for myself

378
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,240
who's behind all this scheming.

379
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,840
Yunfeng,

380
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,670
let's head to Sword Alliance immediately.

381
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Two, right?

382
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,500
(Sword Alliance)
Got it.

383
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,480
Hold it carefully.

384
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,790
Okay.

385
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,960
Alright, come again!

386
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,560
Isn't that the Sword Saint?

387
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,150
What's going on here?

388
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,680
What exactly happened?

389
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,350
- What crime was committed?
- What crime?

390
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,390
Everyone,

391
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,560
the Sword Alliance,

392
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,590
the Zhuge Family,

393
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,870
has encountered a great disgrace.

394
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,310
My elder brother,

395
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,150
Zhuge Yu, leader of Sword Alliance,

396
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,590
colluded with the demonic sect

397
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,000
and tried to

398
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,910
assassinate the MAA Inspector,

399
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,800
Deng Yunfeng.

400
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,440
How is this even possible?

401
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,670
How could the Sword Saint
collude with them?

402
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,070
What did you just say?

403
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,270
Assassinate Mr. Deng?

404
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,240
Is it true?

405
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,590
Yes, is it really true?

406
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,110
- Is it true?
- Vice President Zhuge,

407
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,030
he's led
Sword Alliance for years.

408
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,000
Do you have any proof for such claims?

409
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,240
He has already confessed.

410
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,000
- For the Zhuge Family,
- Confessed?

411
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,760
- Did he?
- he lost our face entirely.

412
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,640
Could it be true?

413
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,670
It is indeed true.

414
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,240
Zhuge Yu,

415
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,000
let me ask you this.

416
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,390
Did you collude with the demonic sect

417
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,040
and use Sword Alliance's Shadow Swordplay

418
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,870
to assassinate Inspector Deng Yunfeng?

419
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,350
I colluded with the demonic sect

420
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,720
and assassinated Inspector Deng Yunfeng.

421
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,590
Because my wife was
from the demonic sect,

422
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,430
she was forced to death by the MAA.

423
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,910
Resentment grew in my heart,

424
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,960
and that's why I did it.

425
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,270
- You liar!
- Scoundrel!

426
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,310
You're a complete liar!

427
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,310
Liar!

428
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,750
- Liar!
- Scoundrel!

429
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,270
Hit him for me!

430
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,310
You fraud!

431
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,310
- Hit him!
- Liar!

432
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,240
- Liar! Hit him!
- Scoundrel!

433
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,430
You fraud!

434
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,180
Scoundrel! Scoundrel!

435
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,100
(Sword Alliance)

436
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,150
- Who is this?
- Who?

437
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,670
Everyone, stay calm.

438
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,350
Zhuge Xun

439
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,400
is the real culprit.

440
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,030
He framed the Sword Saint.

441
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,720
You were all fooled by him.

442
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,030
Gou!

443
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,350
Heng is in the carriage. Hurry!

444
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,670
Yingdan, the carriage.

445
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,390
Fellow martial artists,

446
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,590
Zhuge Yu's demonic allies
are here to save him.

447
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,150
Capture them all together!

448
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,910
Who are you?

449
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,670
Speeding and overloading fines.

450
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,670
This…

451
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,120
Zhuge.

452
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,670
Zhuge.

453
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,610
Wake up.

454
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,570
Are you alright?

455
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,120
Yingdan.

456
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,560
Mr. Deng.

457
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,600
Mr. Zhuge.

458
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,790
It's been a long time since I visited here.

459
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,040
What a lively scene!

460
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,830
Mr. Deng,

461
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,870
I've found the assassin behind you.

462
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,590
It is my elder brother, Zhuge Yu.

463
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,200
I will kill him now to avenge you.

464
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,120
Deng Yunfeng,

465
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,790
don't believe his nonsense.

466
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,400
The assassin is actually him.

467
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,240
Are you ready to uphold justice
against kin?

468
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,960
Such noble integrity.

469
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,440
But why have you confined

470
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,910
three heroes of the MAA?

471
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,790
Mr, Deng,

472
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,030
they are all accomplices

473
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,350
of Zhuge Yu from the demonic sect.

474
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,550
Are you implying that

475
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,040
the MAA is harboring the demonic sect?

476
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,560
Fellow swordsmen,

477
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,830
the current Vice Chairman of the MAA

478
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,730
is He Changzai,

479
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,030
and Wu Guangming as Chairman.

480
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,590
Deng Yunfeng serves as the Inspector,

481
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,280
using the MAA's name,

482
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,440
colluding with the demonic sect

483
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,670
to destroy the Sword Alliance.

484
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,680
Your ambition knows no bounds.

485
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,790
How absurd!

486
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,590
Today, I, Zhuge Xun,

487
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,720
will show no mercy!

488
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,830
Such bold words.

489
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,400
Who dares speak here?

490
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,390
Eunuch Deng.

491
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,720
Are you calling me a culprit too?

492
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,720
(Why is he here too?)

493
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,560
Eunuch... Deng.

494
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,080
(Oh no...)

495
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,630
Sword Alliance belongs to me!

496
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,150
Radiant Knight!

497
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,870
My hero.

498
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,790
Father, Father.

499
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,610
Are you alright?

500
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,550
- Yingdan.
- I'm fine.

501
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,670
Please check my father.

502
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,990
Mr. Zhuge.

503
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,920
Chairman Wu.

504
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,800
The Shadow Swordplay
is the Sword Saint's pinnacle skill.

505
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,830
Too bad that you handle it like a noob.

506
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,510
Zhuge Xun.

507
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll end you!

508
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,630
Zhuge, Zhuge, Zhuge, Zhuge!

509
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,510
No, no, stop! Don't act rashly.

510
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,560
Gou Lingfeng.

511
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,590
Do you still remember the rules of the MAA?

512
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,630
Of course, I remember.

513
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,430
When someone commits senseless killings,

514
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
they must be handed over

515
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
to the Imperial Court

516
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,720
and await punishment.

517
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,920
Excellent.

518
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,630
Zhuge Xun.

519
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,880
You attempted to assassinate

520
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,870
MAA Inspector Deng Yunfeng,

521
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,080
then harmed the Sword Saint
of Sword Alliance.

522
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,960
Your crimes

523
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,150
are unforgivable.

524
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,960
- Guards!
- Yes!

525
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,880
Take him away.

526
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,240
Wu Guangming.

527
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,030
You all...

528
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,000
You despicable fools!

529
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,240
You shameless scoundrels!

530
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,070
I'll kill you all!

531
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,080
Zhuge Xun,

532
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,630
you've harbored ill intent

533
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,350
for twenty years.

534
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,040
Though Mrs. Zhuge
was from the demonic sect,

535
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,000
she obeyed the rules

536
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,870
and committed no wrongdoing.

537
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,960
Yet you sowed discord,

538
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,830
driving a wedge between
the Sword Saint and his son,

539
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,150
which ultimately led to

540
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,830
the fall of the Sword Alliance.

541
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,320
Do you feel no regret at all?

542
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,640
Take him away.

543
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,740
Wu Guangming, you're dead!

544
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,490
Move!

545
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,590
- Yingdan.
- Let me go!

546
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,550
Are you alright?

547
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,920
- I will kill you!
- I'm fine.

548
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
You arrived just in time.

549
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,910
Thanks a lot.

550
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,230
Eunuch Deng,

551
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,670
I am late.

552
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,960
I hope you're not too shaken.

553
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,440
Chairman Wu,

554
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,080
you're finally here.

555
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,270
A few days ago,

556
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,430
I learned Deng Yunfeng was attacked.

557
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,720
I've been wondering

558
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,800
who could be bold enough

559
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,240
to harm someone from the MAA.

560
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,320
He thinks he's above the law!

561
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,480
I learned the killer is in Sword Alliance,

562
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,870
so I rushed over immediately.

563
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,320
But I still...

564
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,760
arrived a step too late.

565
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,240
You've worked hard.

566
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,480
It's what I ought to do.

567
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,110
Zhuge.

568
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,080
Deng.

569
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,040
Thank you, Deng,

570
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,630
and Wu for stepping in.

571
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,590
Zhuge,

572
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,070
time truly flies.

573
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,110
Who would've thought our meeting

574
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,350
would happen under these circumstances.

575
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,430
It stirs countless feelings in me.

576
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,110
How have you been?

577
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,840
Father.

578
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,160
Let us talk back at my mansion.

579
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,240
Hurry, let's go!

580
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,710
After you.

581
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,960
Radiant Knight.

582
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,150
He's looking more dashing.

583
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:47,860
(Righteousness)

584
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,590
Lingfeng just started at the MAA

585
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,320
and nearly lost his life due to Zhuge Xun.

586
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,240
Thank you, Guangming,

587
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,150
for capturing the traitor.

588
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,720
But Guangming,

589
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
a man's face can't reveal

590
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,800
what's in his heart.

591
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,270
You've been away from Huizhou for long.

592
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,000
Many things may have changed.

593
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,200
The MAA still needs you

594
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,640
to keep a close watch over everything.

595
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,830
We must stay vigilant.

596
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,760
You're right.

597
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,000
The assassination of Inspector Deng

598
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,350
was my oversight.

599
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,590
I'll enforce stricter control of the MAA

600
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,000
to prevent such incidents.

601
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,870
Zhuge,

602
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,720
although Zhuge Xun's scheme has failed,

603
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,760
I can't help but feel

604
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,430
there's more behind

605
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,520
this incident of the Sword Alliance.

606
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,750
After all,

607
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,430
even the MAA has been dragged into it.

608
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,830
Indeed,

609
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,480
the martial world is dangerous.

610
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,080
Even I was deceived by Zhuge Xun.

611
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,000
Eunuch Deng,

612
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,670
without you and Zhuge's help,

613
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,240
the Sword Alliance
would've been collapsed.

614
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
From now on,

615
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,960
the Sword Alliance will work with the court

616
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,390
and the Martial Artists Association

617
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,870
to uphold peace in the martial world.

618
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,190
You are too modest, Zhuge.

619
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,760
The demonic sect grows rampant.

620
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,040
My effort alone is insufficient.

621
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,830
We must strengthen our cooperation.

622
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,310
The big picture of the martial world

623
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,520
relies on unity.

624
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,870
Indeed, that's true.

625
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,030
Guangming,

626
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,400
our goals align perfectly.

627
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,320
Yes.

628
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,070
I believe if Sword Alliance and MAA

629
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,920
join forces with the Imperial Court,

630
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,750
we can eliminate the demonic sect

631
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,870
and ensure peace in the martial world.

632
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,720
Guangming,

633
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,430
Zhuge,

634
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:53,150
we must not let His Majesty down.

635
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,680
In the future, I'll rely more

636
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,720
on you, Eunuch Deng, Zhuge.

637
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,560
I'll take my leave now.

638
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,880
I need to conduct

639
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,240
further investigation

640
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,000
and provide a satisfactory reply soon.

641
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,590
Guangming, you make a good point.

642
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,870
Then thank you in advance.

643
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,630
Mr. Gui.

644
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,240
Mr. Gui.

645
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,880
This Mr. Gui...

646
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,310
Didn't he say as long as I came here

647
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,830
and called him when no one was around,

648
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,880
he would appear?

649
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,240
Where is he?

650
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,710
Mr. Gui.

651
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,270
Mr. Gui.

652
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,190
Mr. Gui!

653
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,480
Why are you sleeping here?

654
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,760
The smell here is awful.

655
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,080
Help me up.

656
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,720
How much did you drink?

657
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,160
Let's go.

658
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,750
Let's go.

659
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,080
Let's go.

660
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,520
Let's go. Move.

661
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,830
Hurry, come on.

662
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,560
Father, forgive me.

663
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,720
I've been wrong.

664
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,360
Heng.

665
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,150
We have avenged your mother.

666
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,320
Father, I recall being here years ago,

667
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,430
my mother held me and said

668
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,080
that she didn't like the name Shun.

669
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,470
Because

670
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,790
she felt she was like someone sent by heaven,

671
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,630
only meant to stay briefly with you.

672
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,800
So she named me Heng.
[*Heng: forever]

673
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,600
She hoped

674
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,030
that I could

675
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,350
stay by your side forever.

676
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,880
How wonderful.

677
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,150
What's wrong, Yingdan?

678
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,720
Seeing them reconcile

679
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,390
is quite enviable.

680
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,400
Why do I feel

681
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,830
that you never mentioned your father.

682
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,280
I don't have a father.

683
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,480
Gou.

684
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
Ma.

685
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,800
Thank you for your help.

686
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,190
Otherwise, my Sword Alliance

687
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,720
would have faced utter ruin.

688
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,640
Mr. Zhuge,

689
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,280
why say such things?

690
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,960
This was our duty to do.

691
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,080
We're friends with Zhuge.

692
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,640
However,

693
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,280
I want to ask something.

694
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,920
Speak.

695
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,040
Why has the Sword Alliance
turned into a shop?

696
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,140
(The End of Episode 17)

697
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,080
Such an impressive swordplay!

698
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,080
Who's speaking?

699
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,320
Who's speaking?

700
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,520
Shun?

701
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,000
Shun.

702
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,630
You're finally back.

703
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,590
Sir, you've mistaken me.

704
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,040
I'm not Shun.

705
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,510
Then who are you?

706
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,630
I am Linglong.

707
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,000
I saw you're slightly tipsy

708
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,400
and worried you might be in danger,

709
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,520
so I followed you here.

710
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,830
I have some fine wine and roast chicken.

711
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,520
I wonder if you want some?

712
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,880
I watched your sword technique.

713
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,150
It was truly mesmerizing.

714
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,870
Could you perform it again?

715
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,830
So I can broaden my horizons.

716
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,080
You, young lady,

717
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,760
are quite thoughtful.

718
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,990
Alright.

719
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,390
Let me show you once more.

720
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,880
Perfect!

721
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,560
So much delicious food here.

722
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,110
And there's wine too.

723
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,350
I wonder

724
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,630
if you have a place to stay now.

725
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,350
Why not stay at my home for a few days?

726
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,400
No, that won't do.

727
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,320
I just wanted to show you something new.

728
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,960
Just this once.

729
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,520
But I won't teach you.

730
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,280
There's fine wine in my home

731
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,240
and all kinds of delicacies.

732
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,720
It's not just roast chicken.

733
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,000
Still, still, that won't work.

734
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,520
I live right across from Gou Lingfeng.

735
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,480
Miss, you seem quite clever.

736
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,520
You don't seem like a bad person.

737
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,490
Staying for a few days should be fine.

738
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,160
However,

739
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,520
wine and roast chicken are a must.

740
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,710
No problem.

741
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,440
- Alright.
- Sir,

742
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,360
let's go.

743
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,160
Wait, wait, wait.

744
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,750
Come on, let's go.

745
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,400
This rascal.

746
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,550
His sword dance stance

747
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,400
really resembles his mother.

748
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,040
He's got real potential.
