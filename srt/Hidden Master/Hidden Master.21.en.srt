00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,480
Fish, oh fish.

2
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,000
Tell me,

3
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,320
has His Majesty forgotten me?

4
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,190
Yan'er,

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,440
Yan'er!

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,480
Mother.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,800
What's got you so happy?

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,000
Yan'er, you've recovered!

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,190
In a few days,

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,960
Lord Deng will escort you

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,350
to the capital

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,000
for your wedding with His Majesty.

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,430
So soon?

14
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,960
What a heaven-sent joy!

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,640
A true blessing from the heavens!

16
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,000
You're fully recovered,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,560
and now summoned by His Majesty.

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,320
I must go to the ancestral shrine
and offer incense

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,150
to thank them for their blessing.

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,950

(Sky Knight, He Changzai)

70
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,430
Master! Master!

71
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,120
- What now?
- What do we do?

72
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,200
We've got this.

73
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,960
Vice Chairman He!

74
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,800
Vice Chairman!

75
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,870
Here you are.

76
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,520
What's the meaning of this?

77
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,080
- We just want to see you.
- Yes, yes!

78
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,630
Liu's walnut crisps,

79
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,960
Zhou's sweet osmanthus brew,

80
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,150
and your favorite

81
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,150
Zhu's Nu'er Hong liquor.

82
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,310
- We've offended you before.
- Yes, truly.

83
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,240
We always made you angry.

84
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,120
That's right.

85
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,150
But you, sir,

86
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,630
you never held it against us.

87
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,870
Although you tricked me out of
my money,

88
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,800
this is...

89
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,640
Lingfeng!

90
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,630
That wasn't tricking you out of money.

91
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,080
That was contributing to the MAA's
daily needs!

92
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,430
Yes, yes! A contribution!

93
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,400
A noble cause!

94
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,910
What is the matter?

95
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,750
A small one.

96
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,920
A small one.

97
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,520
We want to ask Anicca Knight
something important.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,680
But he's in jail right now.

99
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,870
Would you

100
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,710
be able to arrange a visit?

101
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,680
- Anicca Knight?
- Yes.

102
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,520
A prison visit?

103
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,480
You know Anicca Knight

104
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,600
is now classified

105
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,950
as a top-level criminal.

106
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,870
Of course, of course.

107
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,830
He's being held jointly
by the authorities and MAA.

108
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,750
Yes, yes.

109
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,270
I don't have a problem with it,

110
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,560
right?

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
But

112
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,480
as for Inspector Deng,

113
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,480
I'm afraid I can't help.

114
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,360
Deng Yunfeng?

115
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,510
I'll go talk to him.

116
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,560
You can give this to Inspector Deng.

117
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,160
This He Changzai

118
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,720
is so cunning!

119
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,190
Help!

120
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,120
Help!

121
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,270
Please save my son!

122
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,560
What's going on, sir?

123
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,560
My son

124
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,240
fell ill with a strange disease
last year.

125
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,120
We went to so many doctors,

126
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,360
- What happened?
- no one could cure him.

127
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,560
But this morning,

128
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,430
he suddenly

129
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,680
recovered,

130
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,160
said he wanted to come sell goods
with me.

131
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,600
I thought maybe

132
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,750
a deity had descended

133
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,510
and cured him.

134
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,830
We had just set up the stall,

135
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,000
and then, he collapsed.

136
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,390
Has your son ever seen Anicca Knight?

137
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,160
That Miracle Healer?

138
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,480
He's the greatest benefactor

139
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,310
of our family!

140
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,600
Son!

141
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,080
Deng Yunfeng,

142
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,950
Anicca Knight isn't the killer.

143
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,870
What nonsense.

144
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,240
He's a murderer, we caught him

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
red-handed.

146
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
There was an eighth murder just now.

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,800
But Anicca Knight is still locked up.

148
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,480
He couldn't possibly have done it.

149
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,710
Besides,

150
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,950
the victims

151
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,240
all saw him as a lifesaver.

152
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,480
He wouldn't be the killer.

153
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,800
What are you doing?

154
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,310
If you don't believe it, come with me.

155
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,040
Stop pulling me around!

156
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,480
Those victims

157
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,600
were deceived by him.

158
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,160
Which means Anicca Knight

159
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,190
is even more cunning and

160
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,430
dangerous than we thought.

161
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Deng Yunfeng!

162
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,000
Are you even being reasonable?

163
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,040
I follow evidence.

164
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,680
Why do you care so much
about Anicca Knight?

165
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,430
- I...
- Speak!

166
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,680
Yingdan is missing.

167
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,560
The last person she saw
was Anicca Knight.

168
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,630
At least let me see him once.

169
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,830
I want to know where she is.

170
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,950
What's that got to do with me?

171
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,240
I'm just in charge of the case.

172
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,710
- Deng Yunfeng!
- He's not here!

173
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,680
Where's my comb?

174
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,230
Sir!

175
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,680
Sir!

176
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,750
Master, be quick!

177
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,270
Sir!

178
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,040
Sir!

179
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,240
Can you please tell me
where Yingdan went?

180
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,750
You again?

181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,840
Come closer.

182
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,920
I won't tell you.

183
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,070
Old man, don't push it too far!

184
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,270
Sir,

185
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,920
let's talk this out.

186
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,510
Don't be so stubborn, yeah?

187
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,120
I know you're not the killer.

188
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,390
And how do you know that?

189
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,190
Today, in Huizhou, a vendor's son died.

190
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,070
Same cause of death as the others.

191
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,430
Ah, that kid, huh?

192
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,320
That's right.

193
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,680
I really didn't kill anyone.

194
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,390
But their deaths are related to me.

195
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,040
Related to you?

196
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,600
What exactly did you do?

197
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,440
Yeah.

198
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,750
They took pills I gave them.

199
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,670
But they weren't poison.

200
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,030
Not poison?

201
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,440
Then how did they die?

202
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,270
It's a kind

203
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,790
of medicine that dulls pain,

204
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,870
not lethal by itself.

205
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,910
But it speeds up the depletion

206
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,750
of a sick person's remaining energy.

207
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,960
It's like drinking poison
to quench thirst!

208
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,270
That is killing them!

209
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,480
You're a healer,

210
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,510
your job is to save lives!

211
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,790
People even call you the Anicca Knight!

212
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,030
You don't deserve the word "knight"!

213
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,120
Watch your mouth!

214
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,080
I don't deserve it?

215
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,000
Then who does?

216
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,720
Do you understand what it's like
to endure chronic pain?

217
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,870
Do you understand the torment
of waiting to die?

218
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,750
You don't.

219
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,150
I was helping them find peace.

220
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,550
Come on.

221
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,030
Sir!

222
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,230
Yingdan,

223
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,630
where did she go?

224
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,440
Enough already.

225
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,870
Sir.

226
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,600
Kid.

227
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,000
Gui Lao is your master, right?

228
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,440
How do you know that?

229
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,270
You knew my master?

230
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,550
Your master and I are old friends.

231
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,120
Righteousness and evil don't mix.

232
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,080
How could someone from the MAA

233
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,000
be friends with him?

234
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,480
Tell me,

235
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,550
what is righteousness? What is evil?

236
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,840
Saving lives is righteous.

237
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Taking lives is evil.

238
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
You sure seem evil to me!

239
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,360
Few days back,

240
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,630
he came to Huizhou

241
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,910
bragging about his new disciple.

242
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,030
Said everything was great,

243
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,120
except the fierce-looking face.

244
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,720
When I checked your pulse recently,

245
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,120
I felt a strong inner power,

246
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,000
just like that old rascal.

247
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,360
And you really don't look like
a good guy.

248
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,720
Come on, sir,

249
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,270
back to the point, please!

250
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,320
Where is that old rascal now?

251
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,320
My master's dead.

252
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
Dead?

253
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,870
Where's he

254
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,510
buried?

255
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,630
At Wulipo,

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,870
south of Huizhou.

257
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,390
I set up a cenotaph for him.

258
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,390
Sir,

259
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,440
what are you doing?

260
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,550
This comb looks familiar.

261
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,550
I'm breaking out.

262
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,480
Breaking out?

263
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,750
I've known him a long time.

264
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,870
I have to go see him.

265
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,670
I heard noise, let's check it out.

266
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,200
People are coming, let's go!

267
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,120
Sir! Tell me

268
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,320
where Yingdan went!

269
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,510
Take care of yourself.

270
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,670
As for Miss Ma,

271
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,000
her fate is in her own hands.

272
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,150
- Just tell me!
- Go, go, go!

273
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,510
You've gone too far!

274
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,670
Master.

275
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,080
Let's just leave.

276
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,030
Let's go.

277
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,960
That old man...

278
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,160
Wait a sec.

279
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,790
Have you gained weight lately?

280
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,550
You should train harder.

281
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,480
You're weak

282
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,200
and always blaming others.

283
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,510
Keep it down!

284
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,470
Come on,

285
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,240
- why did you come home?
- Just come.

286
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,910
- Yingdan's still missing!
- Let's talk about it later.

287
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,840
She's in danger right now.

288
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,960
Alright, let's go.

289
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,480
- Why did you come home?
- Come on, Master!

290
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,630
Yingdan's still out there!

291
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,510
Careful! Just listen to me.

292
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,350
What now?

293
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,480
You're finally back.

294
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,790
Yingdan!

295
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,360
Yingdan, you're back!

296
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,600
You're finally back!

297
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,720
Gou Lingfeng!

298
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,150
Where have you been these past days?

299
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,790
I was worried sick!

300
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,750
I'm not dreaming, am I?

301
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,720
You're too much.

302
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,910
I'm not dreaming.

303
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,440
- Sorry.
- You really came back.

304
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,040
It's okay.

305
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,720
It's all okay now.

306
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,270
Why's he here?

307
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,120
Lord Deng brought Yingdan back.

308
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,510
You've lost weight, I think.

309
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,030
Where have you been all these days?

310
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,320
I've been looking for you.

311
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,240
- These past few days I...
- Yingdan,

312
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,470
I'm gonna go first.

313
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,680
Okay.

314
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,480
Yunfeng,

315
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
you're here too?

316
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,870
When did you get here?

317
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,320
Can you not call me that?

318
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,000
Goodbye.

319
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,120
Yingdan,

320
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,960
I'm heading off.

321
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,390
Call me when you need me.

322
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,480
Be safe on the road.

323
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,510
Alright.

324
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,160
Ling'er, where are you going?

325
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,480
Heng! Wait for me a sec!

326
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,960
Don't treat Deng Yunfeng
like that again.

327
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,840
- He's a good person.
- He's not a good person!

328
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,440
Yingdan, you don't know,

329
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,670
when I was looking for you,

330
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,120
I asked him to help me
talk to Anicca Knight,

331
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,270
and his attitude, ugh!

332
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,320
Good thing you're back,

333
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,550
so I don't need to see
Anicca Knight anymore.

334
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,720
That guy's a killer!

335
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,510
Anicca Knight is not a killer.

336
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,550
He admitted it himself!

337
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,320
He gave them those pills.

338
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,440
What gives him the right to decide
who lives or dies?

339
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,270
Even ants cling to life,

340
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,390
as long as you're alive, there's hope.

341
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,960
And if it were me?

342
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,800
Yingdan,

343
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,960
you're different.

344
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,030
How am I different?

345
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,040
We're the same,

346
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,870
we're all dying.

347
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,630
Yingdan, what wrong?

348
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,870
Why suddenly bring this up?

349
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,030
What are you planning?

350
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,840
Sir,

351
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,960
you've suffered.

352
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,720
Oh, it's you.

353
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,800
No, no, don't.

354
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,320
There's no need for this.

355
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,960
I came to thank you, sir.

356
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,910
You let me hold on with dignity
until the emperor summoned me.

357
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,390
I have no regrets now.

358
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,750
What's going on?

359
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,390
The emperor and I grew up together.

360
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,200
He promised I'd be his consort.

361
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,360
Every day I lived,

362
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,750
I hoped

363
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,790
to enter the palace and marry him.

364
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,630
But

365
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,670
I got red butterfly rash,

366
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,240
an illness with no cure.

367
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,440
All I could do was wait to die,

368
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,110
and

369
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,150
suffer pain every single day.

370
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,790
You saved me, sir.

371
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,800
Lord Deng,

372
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,320
I'm afraid I can't go with you

373
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,910
to meet the emperor.

374
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,750
What do you mean?

375
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,230
Lady Yu.

376
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,470
Let me check.

377
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,870
How is she?

378
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,120
Lord Deng,

379
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,390
I beg you, please don't

380
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,240
make things hard for my savior.

381
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,270
I'll take you home.

382
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,270
I just checked her pulse,

383
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,510
she won't make it through the night.

384
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,240
Do you know who she is?

385
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,360
Yu Yan'er,

386
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,510
His Majesty's

387
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,150
childhood sweetheart.

388
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,390
If anything happens to her,

389
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,000
many people will lose their heads.

390
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Do you understand?

391
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,550
Didn't you hear

392
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,240
what she said just now?

393
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,840
You'd better head to the Yu Mansion
right now

394
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,840
before chaos breaks loose.

395
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,470
Lock the door.

396
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,670
Whatever his intentions were,

397
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,750
they can't change the fact
that people died because of him.

398
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,440
Deng Yunfeng.

399
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,550
When did you get back?

400
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,630
Deng Yunfeng.

401
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,840
Where did you pop out from?

402
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,440
Master, doesn't he look like

403
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,830
he's been possessed or something?

404
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:18,910
You...

405
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,350
Ling'er?

406
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,440
Wait, wait! Let me see.

407
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,510
This is the last mask, huh?

408
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,200
Heng, quit messing around!

409
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,510
I am really Ling'er!

410
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,640
What are you doing?

411
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,240
When I was talking to Yingdan just now,

412
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,110
she told me

413
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,960
Anicca Knight isn't the killer,

414
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,110
and she even owes him her life.

415
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,750
He gave her the antidote too.

416
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,920
- I think Anicca Knight
- The antidote?

417
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,960
- should not be punished
- Really?

418
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,400
because of what he did.

419
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,680
So I had a sudden idea,

420
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,510
if I disguise myself as Deng Yunfeng,

421
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,590
I could sneak into the prison

422
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,160
and get Anicca Knight out!

423
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,350
Our Ling'er's so clever!

424
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,510
Here, have a seat.

425
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,480
Yingdan, the antidote.

426
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,160
Anicca Knight gave it to you?

427
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,790
Did you take it?

428
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,430
I did.

429
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,160
That's great!

430
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,030
My dear Yingdan's okay!

431
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,400
But let's be clear,

432
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,550
I still think Anicca Knight is a killer.

433
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,790
He's a physician,

434
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,240
he should save lives,

435
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,440
not decide when people die.

436
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,750
Have you all thought this through?

437
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,720
You're going to rescue him?

438
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,440
You don't have to come.

439
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,030
- I...
- Master,

440
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,680
can you not be so stubborn?

441
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
Anicca Knight didn't

442
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,590
decide who lives or dies.

443
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,720
When someone could be saved,

444
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,440
like Yingdan, he saved them.

445
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,160
I think Heng is right.

446
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,920
Even so,

447
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,440
I still believe

448
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,030
what he did was wrong.

449
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
I...

450
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,030
I'm saying it here and now:

451
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,310
If I'm coming with you.

452
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,510
I'm not a Gou anymore!

453
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,950
Master, maybe

454
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,440
you can take my surname instead.

455
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,550
When I look at your face

456
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,160
I want to punch it.

457
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,030
Actually, I wanna punch myself too.

458
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
Can I pull out this strand of hair?

459
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,440
They're poking me in the eye.

460
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,160
Alright, Heng,

461
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,240
stop messing around.

462
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,400
You might blow our cover.

463
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,800
Ling'er,

464
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,590
are you really going in?

465
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,160
It's dangerous in there.

466
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,720
Don't worry.

467
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,390
Ling'er,

468
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,000
I'll protect you.

469
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,200
Heng.

470
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,040
Good girl.

471
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,790
- Alright, let's go.
- Can you stop

472
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,550
looking at each other like that?

473
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,880
I'm starting to feel bad for Zhuge.

474
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,110
- So cute!
- Let's go!

475
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,950
Let's go.

476
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,750
Be careful.

477
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,540
(Tianluo Prison)

478
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,520
Hurry.

479
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,790
This way!

480
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,000
Come on!

481
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,670
Move.

482
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,830
This way!

483
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,870
Ling'er!

484
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,510
Master!

485
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,350
We got him out!

486
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,310
Hurry and take off that stupid mask.

487
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,680
It's making me angry.

488
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,240
I forgot.

489
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,400
- Oh, it's you!
- Handsome, right?

490
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,920
No wonder Lord Deng was acting so goofy.

491
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,270
So this is why.

492
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,510
What are you saying?

493
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,720
Don't worry, Anicca Knight.

494
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,680
I drugged the guards.

495
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,790
They won't notice a thing.

496
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,000
She's a girl, huh?

497
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,510
This little lady is sharp.

498
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,680
Of course she is.

499
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,960
Way better than us old guys.

500
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,160
Hey! Speak for yourself!

501
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,110
You are the only old guy here.

502
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,790
Thank you

503
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,350
for saving Yingdan.

504
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,720
You found her?

505
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,520
Good

506
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,830
- But
- That's good.

507
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,350
I still don't fully agree

508
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,070
with what you did.

509
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,070
We should go.

510
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,240
Once the guards wake up,

511
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,640
we'll be in trouble.

512
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,350
- Alright, alright.
- Go, go, go!

513
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,830
Master, just go along

514
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,670
with what they said.

515
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,070
I honestly didn't expect

516
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,960
Miss Yan'er to plead with

517
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,790
Deng Yunfeng to save me.

518
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,040
Sir,

519
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,240
Yingdan's really okay?

520
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,680
Don't worry.

521
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,110
Miss Ma's poison has been cured.

522
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,190
She's safe now.

523
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,550
Still, I'm not totally convinced.

524
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,160
She said that backlash

525
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,720
couldn't be cured.

526
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,030
How did you fix it so easily?

527
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,880
Yeah!

528
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,790
Oh, I'm tired.

529
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,440
Where am I sleeping tonight?

530
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,030
- Sleep?
- You want to sleep now?

531
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,960
You didn't explain everything yet!

532
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,270
Will Yingdan's poison come back?

533
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,480
Didn't I already say?

534
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,360
It's been cured!

535
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,920
Why are you two so suspicious?

536
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
Are you hiding something?

537
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,280
Yeah.

538
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,070
What could I possibly be hiding?

539
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,030
She was my patient.

540
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,480
She paid me,

541
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,350
I treated her.

542
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,640
Simple as that.

543
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,510
Then why did you cry
when you saw her the first time?

544
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,270
She looked like my mother, okay?

545
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,310
I miss my mom. Happy now?

546
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,920
- What?
- That makes it more suspicious!

547
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Yingdan looks like his mother?

548
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,380
(Chairman Wu Guangming)

549
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,320
Chairman,

550
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,030
how should we

551
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,160
deal with Gou Lingfeng?

552
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,960
What is it now?

553
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,480
The serial murder case is closed.

554
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,480
Anicca Knight is set to be sent
to the capital after autumn

555
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,510
to be executed publicly.

556
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,680
The court has already credited the case.

557
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,030
But Gou Lingfeng and the others

558
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,750
broke Anicca Knight out of prison.

559
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,070
This thing...

560
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,000
Yeah, Chairman,

561
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,550
what do you think we should do?

562
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,510
If the higher-ups find out,

563
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,960
this would be a crime
of deceiving the emperor.

564
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,480
- Deceiving the emperor!
- Exactly.

565
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,030
Yes, Chairman, Gou Lingfeng

566
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,070
is completely

567
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,240
out of line!

568
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,640
I'm talking about you two!

569
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,110
The case obviously had more to it,

570
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,510
but you reported it to the court

571
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,200
haphazardly and called it solved.

572
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,960
You were careless!

573
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,240
Now look at you,

574
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,110
you were beaten by a Snake-grade hero,

575
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,310
and you have the nerve to come
complain to me?

576
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,240
Deng Yunfeng.

577
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,080
- Yes.
- He Changzai.

578
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,110
I'm taking back the merits
from both of you.

579
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,270
You may leave.

580
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,830
But, Chairman,

581
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,750
Gou Lingfeng...

582
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,740
(Martial Artists Association)

583
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,590
The MAA recently solved
a serial murder case.

584
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,790
The Emperor has issued a decree

585
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,960
granting merit to us.

586
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,240
That merit

587
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,350
belongs to you.

588
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,400
I actually came here to talk to you
about that.

589
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,240
If I'm not mistaken,

590
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,350
it was you who freed Anicca Knight,
right?

591
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,190
It was.

592
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,270
But only after thorough investigation,
we realized

593
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,160
there's still controversy
around the case.

594
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,790
Convicting him then

595
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,030
would be too hasty.

596
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,200
I am just about to report the truth.

597
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,270
Yu Yan'er was loyal and kindhearted.

598
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,830
If the Emperor found out

599
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,510
that her wish was fulfilled,

600
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,110
he may even commend you.

601
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,960
There's no need for that.

602
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,960
But

603
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,000
lately,

604
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,070
Eunuch Deng's influence

605
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,200
has been seeping into the MAA.

606
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,830
He deceives the court above

607
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,110
and bullies the people below.

608
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,750
As Chairman of the MAA,

609
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,310
I haven't been able to speak up
for the people

610
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,880
or bring peace to the martial world.

611
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,200
It's laughable.

612
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,160
Without young people like you,

613
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,750
the MAA would be a complete joke.

614
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,720
Gou Lingfeng,

615
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,960
are you willing

616
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,310
to contribute more to the association?

617
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,790
Uncle Wu, don't say that.

618
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,920
I'd give my life if needed!

619
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,110
Then let me ask you:

620
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,680
do you want to enter the Hero Gathering,

621
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,720
win the Hero Token,

622
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,110
and become my successor?

623
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,480
I do!

624
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,510
But Uncle Wu,

625
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,550
to participate in it,

626
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,160
you have to be at least Tiger-rank.

627
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,200
I've taken on tons of missions,

628
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,510
but I keep messing them up.

629
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,830
I'm still just a Snake-rank.

630
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,830
Don't worry about that.

631
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,480
You have a way?

632
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,380
This merit you've earned

633
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,070
is enough to promote you to Tiger-rank.

634
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
Besides,

635
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,440
you've shown true loyalty to the MAA.

636
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,590
You care about

637
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,440
the people more than yourself.

638
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,960
You stand up

639
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,000
to injustice.

640
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,030
That's why I've decided to grant you
the title—

641
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,200
Loyalty Knight.

642
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,000
Loyalty Knight!

643
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,480
That's my title now.

644
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,400
Loyalty Knight!

645
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,680
I finally have a title of my own!

646
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,550
But winning the Hero Token

647
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,200
won't be easy.

648
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,640
What else do I need?

649
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,720
Being a Tiger-rank hero

650
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,400
is just the starting point.

651
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,960
You'll also need

652
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,000
martial skill, wealth,

653
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,030
a team, and reputation.

654
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,960
That much?

655
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,590
I thought it'd be simpler.

656
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,790
But your martial arts

657
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,070
are already top-tier.

658
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,070
And you're the only heir of the GFTA.

659
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,110
As for a team,

660
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,310
Mr. Zhuge Heng and Floral Knight

661
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,310
can back you up.

662
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,640
Right now, the only thing you're missing

663
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,480
is reputation.

664
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,440
Reputation?

665
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,070
How do I get that?

666
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,590
I'll help you rise.

667
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,900
(The End of Episode 21)

668
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,440
My Lady? What brings you here?

669
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,270
I was worried the pastries

670
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,160
last time weren't to Lord Deng's taste.

671
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,680
This time,

672
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,830
I brought some nice liquor

673
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,680
that Father brought back
from the palace.

674
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,640
Thank you, My Lady.

675
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,510
But I already have plenty
of liquor here.

676
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,550
How can this

677
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,310
compare to the palace's finest?

678
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,560
Here,

679
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,880
I will drink with you.

680
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,950
Good liquor.

681
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,030
This success

682
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,000
of Gou Lingfeng's

683
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,400
might just be the beginning.

684
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,160
Wu Guangming likely has

685
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,000
far more ambitious plans.

686
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,000
If I'm not mistaken,

687
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,240
he's aiming at this year's
Hero Gathering.

688
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,000
You are right, My Lady.

689
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,750
I must hurry

690
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,030
and report this to my godfather.

691
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,720
Lord Deng,

692
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,550
even if your godfather knows it,

693
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,160
I fear it won't help.

694
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,750
If Lord Deng

695
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,830
ever feels troubled and needs relief,

696
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,920
I would be happy

697
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,550
