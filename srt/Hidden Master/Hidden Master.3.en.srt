1
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,080
Master.

2
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,320
- Something's not right.
- What is it?

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,720
This Dragon-Subduing Claw you taught me,

4
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,070
every time I use it,

5
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,640
centipedes and skulls pop out.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,000
It's terrifying.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,150
Could this be some kind of
demonic technique?

8
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,040
Have you heard of
the Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms?

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,270
Of course!

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,280
The storytellers talk about it
all the time.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,670
They say it's a technique
only great heroes know.

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,720
Super powerful.

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,560
Well, the Dragon-Subduing Claw

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,720
is one of the moves from
the Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,670
Now, do you think it's
a demonic technique or a divine one?

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,920
Really?

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,790
Wait, hold on...

18
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,790
What now?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,400
One's a claw, one's a palm,

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,960
that's a pretty big difference,
isn't it?

21
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,840
You're truly ignorant.

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,360
Fine. Just wait.

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,760
Master.

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,800
Look at these.

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,330
Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms.
Dragon-Subduing Claw.

26
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,150
Great Sage Divine Fist.

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,670
Buddha Body-Tempering Method.

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,360
Blade of True Qi.

29
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,840
Just by the names alone,

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,560
they're clearly divine techniques!

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,480
Master.

32
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,790
I'm really going to become a hero!

33
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,120
Master.

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,720
I'm really going to become a hero!

35
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,790
Read them carefully.

What am I supposed to say?

- You're obviously...
- Enough.

86
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,080
Don't make things hard for him.

87
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,240
I've worked so hard in the WAA,

88
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,390
and was just about to revive
our divine sect.

89
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,270
What a pity.

90
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,110
Wang Fugui actually discovered
my true identity.

91
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,590
And he dared to threaten me.

92
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,510
What?

93
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,560
We didn't hear anything!

94
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,630
I heard everything!

95
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,040
Now that you heard it,

96
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,800
today is the day you die.

97
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,760
Heard it!

98
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,670
Now he's about to kill us!

99
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,990
Hurry up!

100
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,360
Make your move!

101
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,640
I searched high and low to no avail,

102
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,040
turns out, you're the big boss

103
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,150
of the demonic sect I've been seeking
for years!

104
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,430
Master,

105
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,800
please take me in as your disciple.

106
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,240
I'm willing to do anything.

107
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,160
What the...

108
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,270
Even your blind eye was fake?

109
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,110
And you,

110
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,510
didn't you just join the WAA?

111
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,720
You forgot all the rules already?

112
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,160
Joining that stupid WAA

113
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,190
was never my goal!

114
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,920
I, Zhuge Heng, just want to
become stronger,

115
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,280
take revenge and wander.

116
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,720
You don't want to be a proper hero,

117
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,390
but choose revenge
and wandering instead?

118
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,120
Like this guy?

119
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,160
The Vice Chairman of the WAA

120
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,240
is actually from the demonic sect.

121
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,590
Isn't that ironic enough?

122
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,630
This disgrace who killed his comrade,

123
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,240
isn't he also one of those
so-called heroes?

124
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,560
Enough.

125
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Didn't you want to take me
as your master?

126
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,480
Yes!

127
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,160
And isn't it exactly because of
people like him

128
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,630
that the world needs heroes like us?

129
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,510
Enough.

130
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,920
Let's not waste time.

131
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,310
You're all going to die anyway.

132
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,800
I'll kill you first.

133
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,830
Are you alright?

134
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,840
I'm bleeding.

135
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,790
Bleeding?

136
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,240
Do I look bad?

137
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,720
You look cool.

138
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,040
- Yingdan.
- What?

139
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,030
Did you see Gou Lingfeng?

140
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,030
He went with He Changzai to see
the Vice Chairman.

141
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,350
Dragonfly Steps?

142
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,780
Fallen Buddha Mountain Fist.

143
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,560
Those are the old sect leader's
exclusive techniques!

144
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
How do you know them?

145
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,800
Who are you?

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,590
What steps? What fist?

147
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,680
No wonder your martial arts are trash,

148
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,710
you even got the names wrong.

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,190
It's called the Vajra Fist.

150
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,030
And what old sect leader?

151
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,800
I knew I was right about you.

152
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,390
Right about what?

153
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,080
You're still bleeding.

154
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,080
Lie down.

155
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,390
Who is your master?

156
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,710
You don't need to know who my master is.

157
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,310
You just need to remember

158
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,230
I am

159
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,950
Gou Lingfeng,

160
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,560
a hero of the WAA.

161
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,800
How come I've never heard of you?

162
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,030
Didn't you fail the entry test?

163
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,680
You two are so annoying.

164
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,680
At a time like this,

165
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,870
can you stop ruining the mood?

166
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,360
You must have stolen
our sect's techniques!

167
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,720
Shameless thief!

168
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,640
Take this!

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,920
Heart-Devouring Claw!

170
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,030
Dragon-Subduing Claw!

171
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,040
Why is your demonic technique
even stronger than mine?

172
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,180
I lost.

173
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,920
Go ahead.

174
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,350
I won't kill you.

175
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,240
I'll hand you over to the WAA

176
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,950
and let them give you the judgment
you deserve.

177
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,240
But...

178
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,160
No buts!

179
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,520
No buts.

180
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,230
I'm new to the martial world.

181
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,590
I don't want to take lives so easily.

182
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,860
You...

183
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,750
Besides, from you I've seen

184
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,920
how terrifying hatred can be.

185
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,390
I don't want

186
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,550
my careless killing

187
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,280
to cause the entire martial world to...

188
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,320
You did that on purpose, right?

189
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,840
- Such strong internal energy!
- No!

190
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,320
- I'm impressed!
- I didn't!

191
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,540
I didn't!

192
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,980
I didn't even try!

193
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,420
Who exactly are you?

194
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,940
Don't tell me...

195
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,300
Don't tell me you're
the sect leader's...

196
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,620
No, no, no!

197
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,260
Your skill has already

198
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,620
reached a level of mastery.

199
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,820
The rise of our sect is within reach!

200
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,820
Master, please take me as your disciple!

201
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,260
Stop causing trouble.

202
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,540
Vice Chairman.

203
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,860
Vice Chairman.

204
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,180
Vice Chairman!

205
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,300
What... What happened to you?

206
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,420
What happened?

207
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,060
Wasn't he fine just now?

208
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,380
He... He's dead.

209
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,700
What happened?

210
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,900
- Wasn't he fine just now?
- Be quiet.

211
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,220
Keep your voice down.

212
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,020
Wait!

213
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,300
The wound's not right.

214
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,340
What's wrong with it?

215
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,700
The Vice Chairman's wound is strange.

216
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,820
It's a demonic technique.

217
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,500
Demonic... Demonic technique?

218
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,580
Gou Lingfeng!

219
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,300
- It's not that!
- I can't believe I misjudged you.

220
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,540
No.

221
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,180
Actually, I never misjudged you.

222
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,180
You are from the demonic sect.

223
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,020
Who?

224
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,100
Who is it!

225
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,500
Who's from the demonic sect?

226
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,540
I'm not!

227
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,500
Me neither!

228
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,300
An investigation will clear it up.

229
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,900
What are you doing?

230
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,820
Step aside.

231
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,780
The martial arts of our Sword Alliance

232
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,140
are not something you common folk

233
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,020
could ever comprehend.

234
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,940
So you're saying I misjudged that?

235
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,820
- No, I...
- You definitely misjudged that.

236
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,540
I also think there's something off
about you.

237
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,100
I mean, as a constable,
why are you always

238
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,300
meddling in the WAA's affairs?

239
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,220
He Changzai!

240
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,420
Let me warn you.

241
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,500
Any demonic sect member
should be killed on sight.

242
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,860
- That's enough, stop talking.
- Guards!

243
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,780
Demonic sect?

244
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,100
Take him away.

245
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Take who away?

246
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,180
Take who?

247
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,100
Take

248
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,340
the body!

249
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,540
Why so loud just to take a body?

250
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,620
Gou Lingfeng!

251
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,740
Your daddy's here.

252
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,660
I'll remember you.

253
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,740
Thanks for remembering me.

254
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,700
(Righteous and Mighty)
We live for justice!

255
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,580
Everyone,

256
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,340
the case of Examiner Wang's
assassination

257
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,100
has finally been solved.

258
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,940
How tragic.

259
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,300
How heartbreaking.

260
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,940
There was actually

261
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,180
a terrifying traitor hidden
within our WAA,

262
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,620
and he was from the demonic sect!

263
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,700
Fortunately,

264
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,140
we had a hero like Mr. Zhuge

265
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,340
who helped us catch the traitor.

266
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,340
Now,

267
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,980
let's invite him to say a few words.

268
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,740
- Bravo!
- Address us!

269
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,140
- Well done!
- Mr. Zhuge, well done!

270
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,540
Mr. Zhuge, address us!

271
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,940
- Yes! Let's hear it!
- Mr. Zhuge!

272
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,620
I am

273
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,180
just someone who wants to seek revenge,

274
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,180
wander the world,

275
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,140
and grow stronger.

276
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,460
Joining the WAA

277
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,060
was purely a matter of chance.

278
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,540
So what kind of chance was it?

279
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,260
I guess it was

280
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,140
the demonic sect.

281
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,620
The demonic sect?

282
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,100
He really wants to join
the demonic sect.

283
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,060
That said,

284
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,780
I must thank the demonic sect.

285
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,740
Without them,

286
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,460
there would be no me today.

287
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,220
It's the demonic sect that brought

288
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,860
peace, hope,

289
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,820
and freedom to me and

290
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,740
the entire martial world.

291
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,900
So I believe

292
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,500
we cannot be without the demonic sect.

293
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,020
What?

294
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,380
(Righteous and Mighty)

295
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,100
Don't forget to thank me.

296
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,980
For this case,

297
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,660
there's someone we must
especially thank.

298
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,580
And that is

299
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,220
the great hero

300
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,540
Gou Lingfeng!

301
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,180
Let's also thank Mr. Zhuge!

302
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,100
Thank you!

303
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,700
Our Mr. Zhuge truly lives up

304
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,980
to being the Sword Saint's successor.

305
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,940
To him, the demonic sect

306
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,980
is nothing but a joke.

307
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,460
Three months from now,

308
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,300
the Hero Gathering will be held.

309
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,540
- The Hero Gathering!
- Then, heroes

310
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,620
- from everywhere
- Great!

311
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,100
will gather in one place

312
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,220
to compete for the Hero Token.

313
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,180
I also hope that all of you

314
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,220
can show your best selves,

315
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,620
follow the example of Mr. Zhuge,

316
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,980
strive for excellence,

317
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,980
and contribute your strength
to protect the peace

318
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,780
and harmony of the martial world,
alright?

319
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,700
Come on!

320
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,540
We live for justice!

321
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,980
We live for justice!

322
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,590
I want to join the Hero Gathering too.

323
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,020
Hero Gathering my foot!

324
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,140
(Tiger)

325
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,340
Tiger rank?

326
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,780
Mr. Zhuge,

327
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,660
you just joined the WAA,

328
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,580
and have already become
a Tiger-ranked hero

329
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,540
and are qualified to enter
the Hero Gathering

330
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,020
and fight for the Hero Token.

331
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,260
Truly impressive!

332
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,260
How about staying over tonight?

333
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,980
I'll make you something good to eat,

334
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,500
help you replenish your strength.

335
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,980
This is already pretty replenishing.

336
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,900
Straight to Tiger rank?

337
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,180
That Vice Chairman case

338
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,980
gave him so much credit?

339
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,740
Sanniang,

340
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,020
where's my token?

341
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,420
Yours?

342
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,780
(Mouse)

343
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,380
Why am I only Mouse rank?

344
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,170
The battle

345
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,700
was fought by Mr. Zhuge.

346
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,900
The enemy

347
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,500
was killed by Mr. Zhuge.

348
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,700
You didn't do anything,

349
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,380
didn't even pass the entry test.

350
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,500
We've already registered you.

351
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,540
You are still not satisfied?

352
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,900
If it hadn't been for Mr. Gou
at the time,

353
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,380
I would've been chopped into pieces.

354
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,580
Giving him just Rat rank

355
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,940
seems unfair.

356
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,300
Isn't your WAA being a bit heartless?

357
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,300
Mr. Zhuge,

358
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,820
it's my fault, then.

359
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,660
In that case,

360
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,340
take this instead.

361
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,740
You are changing it so easily?

362
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,660
(Chou)

363
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,580
Wait, doesn't Chou mean ugly?

364
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,420
The WAA's hero ranks are divided
into six levels:

365
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,940
Mouse, Ox, Snake, Horse, Tiger, Dragon.

366
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,020
Zi-Rat, Chou-Ox, Wu-Horse,
Si-Snake, Yin-Tiger.

367
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,100
Don't you know the twelve

368
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,500
zodiac signs align with the twelve hours?

369
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,780
I know!

370
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,460
But can't you give me Ox instead?

371
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,940
How am I supposed to wear this around?

372
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,220
You sure talk a lot.

373
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,100
You should thank Mr. Zhuge already.

374
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,060
- Do you want it?
- Yes, yes, yes!

375
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,660
I just want to ask:

376
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,820
From Ox to Tiger, is that a hard leap?

377
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,140
You?

378
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,620
Finish 300 tasks first, then we'll talk.

379
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,540
How many?

380
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,900
Well, you are trying to join

381
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,580
the martial world at forty.

382
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,780
Big sis!

383
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,300
I'm only in my twenties!

384
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,460
Who are you calling big sis?

385
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,420
Give me back my token!

386
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,340
You...

387
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,060
I'm outta here, big sis.

388
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,660
- You...
- How old are you exactly?

389
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,780
Naughty boy.

390
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,940
Here's the evidence you wanted.

391
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,100
Why are there so many secret manuals?

392
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,980
I bought them.

393
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,140
I put in tons of effort

394
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,740
just to join the demonic sect.

395
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,820
These things are even for sale?

396
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,700
My master said

397
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,900
a lot of techniques
are forbidden secrets.

398
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,940
Take a look at this move.

399
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,860
You've used it.

400
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,980
(Demon Body-Tempering Method)

401
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,780
First move: Body of the Demon.

402
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,740
Practicing this strengthens the body,

403
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,340
allowing it to resist external attacks.

404
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,580
This is the secret manual
my master gave me!

405
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,900
The name's different.

406
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,380
Mine says "Buddha,"

407
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,940
not "Demon."

408
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,700
Your master must've given you a fake.

409
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,660
Let me show you a few moves.

410
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,590
- Watch closely.
- Alright.

411
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,140
Look.

412
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,340
Fallen Buddha Mountain Fist?

413
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,780
Isn't that the Vajra Fist?

414
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,300
Crippled Heaven Palm?

415
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,340
Isn't that the Righteous Bright Palm?

416
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,020
That doesn't seem righteous at all.

417
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,420
I am sure of it.

418
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,260
And this move.

419
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,340
What about this one?

420
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,020
Black Widow Kick.

421
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,180
Back when they attacked
the Demonic Sect,

422
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,740
countless righteous martial elders

423
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,180
died from this move.

424
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
Master!

425
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,020
I've been learning demonic techniques?!

426
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,060
You've doomed me, Master!

427
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,180
Master,

428
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,140
please also feel free to doom me.

429
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,140
I want to learn that move

430
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,180
where you can see the moon
within the sword light.

431
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,860
You lied to me for fifteen whole years!

432
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,860
I don't know
a single righteous technique!

433
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,260
I can't go on like this!

434
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,900
There are 299 techniques,

435
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,740
and every single one turned out
to be demonic!

436
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,660
Master,

437
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,780
you're truly ruthless.

438
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,940
Master,

439
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,100
didn't your master ever teach you

440
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,260
that sword skill with moonlight?

441
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,420
Your master must have taught you

442
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,660
some secret hidden techniques.

443
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,540
"Rule the World"?

444
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,460
No?

445
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,860
All my master

446
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,100
left me was this one manual.

447
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,020
Let me see.

448
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,980
I haven't even looked through it myself.

449
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,820
I stole it from him.

450
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,740
Wait.

451
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,700
Don't ruin it!

452
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,300
(Moon)

453
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,420
It has a "moon" on the cover.

454
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,380
This must be it!

455
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,060
Wait, what is this?

456
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,380
Did you get scammed?

457
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,940
My master's unorthodox.

458
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,380
This is his treasure.

459
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,540
I have to keep it safe.

460
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,260
You should really think carefully

461
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,820
about your demonic cultivation.

462
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,980
Zhuge,

463
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,740
my mind is made up.

464
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,980
Master,

465
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
I'm ready.

466
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,260
An eye for an eye leads nowhere.

467
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,340
Demonic cultivation
brings endless trouble.

468
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,180
I've decided to abolish
my own cultivation.

469
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,220
Zhuge, you once said

470
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,700
if you reverse
your internal energy flow,

471
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,940
you'll go mad and lose

472
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,860
all your cultivation.

473
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,300
Yes, but...

474
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,700
No buts.

475
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,500
Master!

476
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,980
Master!

477
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,620
Isn't that the long-lost
demonic technique,

478
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,060
Yin-Yang Reversal Art?

479
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,180
It's incredibly powerful,

480
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,460
but practiced too much,
it'll rupture your meridians,

481
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,460
and kill all your martial arts.

482
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,220
Meridians rupture!

483
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,860
Meridians rupture!

484
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,780
Master!

485
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,940
Master.

486
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,620
Master,

487
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,100
didn't see this coming, huh?

488
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,700
I've destroyed every demonic art
you taught me.

489
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,900
You're okay, Master?

490
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,900
Yeah,

491
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,180
why am I okay?

492
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,580
I...

493
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,300
I get it now.

494
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,940
This is part of
the Demon Body-Tempering Method,

495
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,340
the "Demonic Body Tempering."

496
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,940
Back in the day,
many top demonic leaders used

497
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,780
this move to withstand

498
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,020
legendary weapons from all over.

499
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,060
They used it to go all-out.

500
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,420
I am now going all-out on myself.

501
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,740
Master,

502
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,940
nothing is hard in this world

503
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,380
if you're willing to give up.

504
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,860
- Get lost!
- Gou Lingfeng!

505
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,900
Who's it?

506
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,580
How'd you get in here?

507
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,900
I don't think my door's open.

508
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,940
I've got a question:

509
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,380
Heart-Devouring Claw,

510
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,660
Nether Soul-Refining Art,
whose techniques are those?

511
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,500
- Whose?
- Whose?

512
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,660
- Whose?
- No clue, huh?

513
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,380
(Heart-Devouring Claw)
Then whose are all these

514
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,340
demonic manuals?

515
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,420
I bought them.

516
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,300
I just want to know

517
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,780
how the Vice Chairman got those wounds.

518
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,780
One palm strike

519
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,740
shattered all his meridians.

520
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,980
Didn't we already tell you?

521
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,820
Sword Alliance secret technique!

522
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,820
I wasn't asking you.

523
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,220
Didn't he tell you already?

524
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,100
Sword Alliance!

525
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,580
- Gou Lingfeng!
- secret technique!

526
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,100
Who exactly are you?

527
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,500
Didn't you just call me Gou Lingfeng?

528
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,220
You know what I mean.

529
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,660
Oh, Lord Deng is here too.

530
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,540
Mr. Zhuge,

531
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,780
Liu Sanniang asked me to tell you

532
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,380
there's now a Tiger-level mission
posted.

533
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,860
You're eligible to take it.

534
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,860
What about me?

535
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,940
Let me remind you,

536
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,860
my status isn't the same anymore.

537
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,620
(Chou)
I'm officially a hero

538
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,140
of the MAA now.

539
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,620
Well, that token

540
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,180
really suits you.

541
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,620
(Tiger)
I'm in the MAA too!

542
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,700
A Tiger-ranked hero.

543
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,700
Gou Lingfeng,

544
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,180
I've got my eye on you.

545
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,740
Are you nuts?

546
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,940
Gou Lingfeng, I've got my eye on you.

547
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,180
Does the Association have any way

548
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,740
to completely destroy
someone's martial arts?

549
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,700
Well...

550
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,020
I think the Floral Knight can do that.

551
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,980
The Floral Knight?

552
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,900
How?

553
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,460
She can use poison to fight poison.

554
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,900
Master,

555
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,180
you can't give up demonic arts!

556
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,740
If you do, how will you
keep teaching me?

557
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,900
I'll teach you verbally.

558
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,380
No time to waste.

559
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,260
Who's that?

560
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,220
- Hello!
- Hey!

561
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,660
It's you two!

562
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,220
Who let you in?

563
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,940
Why don't you dodge?

564
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,590
My legs went weak.

565
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,300
Master! It's terrifying!

566
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,260
Let's just go.

567
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,380
Why are you here?

568
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,340
Floral Knight,

569
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,100
we have a favor to ask.

570
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,500
My master taught me a martial art that

571
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,540
hurts the enemy less

572
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,060
but hurts me more.

573
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,580
So I beg you to abolish it for me.

574
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,140
I also want you

575
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,780
to abolish that for me too.

576
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,700
You?

577
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,700
Why?

578
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,820
Because I want to learn demonic arts.

579
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,740
Not a chance!

580
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,740
Well, if you won't help me abolish them,

581
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,140
- I might as well just die!
- Go ahead.

582
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,460
Master! You can't die!

583
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,780
If you die, what'll I do?!

584
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,500
I don't want to die!

585
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,060
Floral Knight, please help us.

586
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,980
I admit I did wrong in the past.

587
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,140
I shouldn't have called you old lady.

588
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,900
I shouldn't have wrecked
your alchemy furnace.

589
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,900
I shouldn't have triggered your traps.

590
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,260
I shouldn't have...

591
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,940
Okay, you was being outrageous for sure.

592
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,020
How was I supposed to know

593
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,980
she left her furnace there?

594
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,830
If I knew, I...

595
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,700
Enough nonsense.

596
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,620
I just want to know one thing:

597
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,060
Who killed the Vice Chairman?

598
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,940
To tell you the truth,

599
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,340
it was me.

600
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
- You?
- Of course

601
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,540
not.

602
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,900
Technically,

603
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,900
it was my master.

604
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,740
You?

605
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,220
It was me.

606
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,220
My dear disciple,

607
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,260
go on.

608
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,380
My master pulled out the demonic blade,

609
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,660
sliced off the Vice Chairman's arm,

610
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,340
chopped off his leg,

611
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,700
blinded both of his eyes,

612
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,460
then cut off his other arm,

613
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,380
then,

614
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,540
just for case,

615
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,140
blinded him again!

616
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,700
And finally,

617
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,420
a giant tree falls from the sky,

618
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,820
split the Vice Chairman clean in two.

619
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,980
That's...

620
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,660
That's brutal.

621
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,580
Super brutal.

622
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,700
Beyond brutal.

623
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,540
Unimaginably brutal.

624
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,580
So now you see,

625
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,460
my martial arts harm others and myself.

626
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,740
Please, just help me abolish them.

627
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,420
Alright.

628
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,860
I'll go get you the pill.

629
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,300
She agreed!

630
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,700
Why do I feel like

631
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,780
something's off with the atmosphere?

632
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,820
Off?

633
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,940
It's so passionate!

634
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,500
That's how easy it is.

635
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,060
Vice Chairman.

636
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,690
Yingdan, come,

637
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,660
drink this medicine.

638
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,220
Don't worry.

639
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,940
I'll search the world for rare remedies

640
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,860
to cure the poison in your body.

641
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,780
Thank you, Vice Chairman.

642
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,100
No need to thank me.

643
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,580
You always

644
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,940
bottle everything up inside.

645
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,860
Your parents aren't around,

646
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,740
and no one understands you.

647
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,020
But I know what you've been through.

648
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,380
Don't worry.

649
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,100
Whatever happens,

650
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,700
come talk to me, okay?

651
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,460
You're enjoying the act, huh?

652
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,780
Even happier not seeing you.

653
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,220
Watching you two perform is a joy.

654
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,420
What are you doing here?

655
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,500
Helping you.

656
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,460
You? That kind?

657
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,620
I came to tell the Floral Knight

658
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,220
that you killed the Vice Chairman.

659
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,980
Wow, such a nosy mutt.

660
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,060
Wait a minute.

661
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,220
What's her relationship
with the Vice Chairman?

662
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,460
You really don't know?

663
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,660
They were like

664
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,580
brother ans sister.

665
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,460
Lord Deng,

666
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,700
why are you here?

667
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,620
Yingdan, I heard

668
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,740
you were very close
with the Vice Chairman.

669
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,300
This is his token.

670
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,780
I brought it so you can

671
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,500
keep it as a memento.

672
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,460
Thank you, Lord Deng.

673
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,300
No need.

674
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,220
Wanna run?

675
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,980
You really want to run?

676
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,740
No.

677
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,180
Just stretching.

678
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,340
Here's your pill.

679
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,820
Eat it.

680
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,260
I... I changed my mind.

681
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,060
Even if I hurt myself

682
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,580
more than I hurt the enemies,

683
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,100
I still want to contribute
to the martial world!

684
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,460
- Right.
- Then you eat it.

685
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,740
I've changed my mind too.

686
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,820
I'll follow Master.

687
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,180
I even want to

688
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,940
enhance my martial arts now.

689
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,860
Right.

690
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,660
Good.

691
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,620
I've got a pill here
to boost your power.

692
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,140
Take it.

693
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,500
Go on, swallow it.

694
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,940
Master,

695
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,700
I believe in the Floral Knight.

696
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,220
As a tiger-ranked hero, she would never

697
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,980
abuse her power for personal revenge.

698
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,140
I, Gou Lingfeng,

699
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,340
trust the Floral Knight's

700
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,940
righteousness.

701
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,300
Master!

702
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,820
Wait. Wait a second.

703
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,260
Actually,

704
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,140
give me the one
that removes martial arts.

705
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,900
Why don't you take both of them?

706
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,140
Master? What's wrong, Master?

707
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,500
Master?

708
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,540
Master!

709
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
I choked.

710
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
You okay?

711
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,140
How do you feel?

712
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,380
How are you?

713
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,500
This isn't right.

714
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,220
I'm fine.

715
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,980
That's good.

716
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,260
Thank you, Floral Knight!

717
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,700
- I'm fine! I'm fine!
- Just wait, you messy bangs.

718
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,340
- Say that one more time!
- My martial arts aren't gone!

719
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,620
I'm just glad you're alive.

720
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,620
Yingdan,

721
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,780
did you hesitate just now?

722
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,700
(The End of Episode 3)

723
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,260
That brat hits way too hard.

724
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,540
Master! Master!

725
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,220
Let's keep sparring!

726
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,980
I haven't even gone all out yet.

727
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,180
I've gotta use my Tortoise Breath.

728
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,460
Master!

729
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,980
Master!

730
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,100
You are doing this again!

731
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,100
Master!

732
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,300
Master!

733
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,020
Playing dead again, you geezer!

734
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,860
Master!

735
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,580
Master

736
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,460
(Brat, stop shaking me!)

737
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,780
(Oh no!)

738
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,900
(My treasure!)

739
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,580
What's this?

740
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,100
Wake up! Master!

741
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,380
Master!

742
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,460
Master!

743
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,580
- Master!
- (You brat!)

744
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,980
(You did it on purpose!)

745
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,540
Sir,

746
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,420
I've failed.

747
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,780
I didn't succeed.

748
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,020
What?

749
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,540
How could you fail?

750
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,100
I heard that Ma Yingdan

751
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,380
doesn't even know martial arts!

752
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,940
Was the info wrong?

753
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,180
That's not it.

754
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,100
Deng Yunfeng was always with her.

755
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,980
I never had the chance.

756
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,140
Deng Yunfeng!

757
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,140
Instruct our men, when Prince Chang

758
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,660
visits Huizhou in a few days,

759
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,860
we'll take them all down in one strike.

760
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,100
Yes.
