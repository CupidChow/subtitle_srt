1
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,960
Take this one.

2
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,350
Okay.

3
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,800
Isn't this a special

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,590
sugar pill from the north?

5
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,800
Have you seen it?

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,000
I handled a case there.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,680
Remember,

8
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,150
this is called

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,360
Tianshan Snow Pill

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,190
or Icy Detox Pill.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,400
Anyway, don't tell others.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,720
You're acting like

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,080
you know everything.

14
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,510
Tianshan Snow Pill.

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,140
Icy Detox Pill.

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,030

Wait!

65

Yingdan!

66
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,800
Master, stay strong.

67
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
You can survive.

68
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,840
I'll find Ling'er.

69
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,960
You... Zhuge...

70
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,310
You're a monster!

71
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,390
- You...
- Let's go.

72
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,390
What are you doing?

73
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,760
What is all this?

74
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,870
Yingdan,

75
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,030
this is really unnecessary.

76
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,160
Just the antidote I took last time.

77
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Icy Detox Pill needs to be made fresh.

78
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,200
You think it's always available?

79
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,880
Isn't it called Tianshan Snow Pill?

80
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,710
Icy Detox Pill

81
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,600
is another name for Tianshan Snow Pill.

82
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,840
They're so different.

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,550
Are you fooling me?

84
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,760
How is it?

85
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,360
This drink is too sour.

86
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,510
This one is too bitter.

87
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,510
Why does it taste so awful?

88
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,830
Is this poison or an antidote?

89
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,160
That's weird.

90
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,430
These two poisons can counter

91
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,320
all the antidotes in the world.

92
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,550
But they didn't work on you.

93
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,880
What are you doing, Yingdan?

94
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,800
Yingdan, this... this isn't...

95
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
What are you doing?

96
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,310
Does it hurt?

97
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,590
Of course.

98
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,320
That's good.

99
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,190
I thought your techniques

100
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,750
made you immune to poison

101
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,350
and even changed your sense of pain.

102
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,870
Look at you.

103
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,160
My hand hurts.

104
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,640
Remember to shave better next time.

105
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,710
Heng.

106
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,840
It's done.

107
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,110
It's done?

108
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,600
Does it look good?

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,470
You're so skillful, Ling'er.

110
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,030
What have you been painting

111
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,560
these days?

112
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,150
I've been painting my dad.

113
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,510
I'm afraid one day,

114
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,150
I might forget his face.

115
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Father was kind and gentle,

116
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,350
yet ended up like this.

117
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,350
I just don't understand.

118
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,510
Why did He Changzai

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,710
have to be so cruel?

120
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,720
Ling'er.

121
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,830
Everyone makes mistakes.

122
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,470
But we must

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,270
face the consequences.

124
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,800
He Changzai was indeed cruel,

125
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,440
but your father was...

126
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,240
A fugitive.

127
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
You know?

128
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,560
Heng,

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,880
actually, I've always known this.

130
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,240
Young and forgetful as I was,

131
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,390
I knew that

132
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,510
he was a tough guy

133
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,950
who couldn't have done such crafts.

134
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,200
Perhaps,

135
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,120
his identity,

136
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,760
words,

137
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,240
and face

138
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,880
were all fake.

139
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,470
But his love for me was true.

140
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,040
Ling'er.

141
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,320
I remember he once told me

142
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,000
that

143
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,280
meeting you

144
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,910
was the happiest moment of his life.

145
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,350
So Ling'er,

146
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,560
you must live well for him.

147
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,830
If you want to cry, just cry.

148
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,470
Heng...

149
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,560
I miss my dad!

150
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,200
I miss him so much!

151
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,470
Linglong,

152
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,390
I'll leave Huizhou tomorrow.

153
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,560
Are you sure you want to stay?

154
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,120
The martial world is in chaos.

155
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,800
Even though we control the association,

156
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,270
since the demonic sect emerged,

157
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,440
we've seen many uncertainties.

158
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,190
Recently, Eunuch Deng

159
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,350
has taken a lot of actions.

160
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,510
And he's got great influence.

161
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,430
Yes.

162
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,350
I think

163
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,240
if we can work with Eunuch Deng,

164
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,870
the chaos of the court

165
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,470
will be eased.

166
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,800
So, I want to stay

167
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,510
and support you, Father.

168
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,480
That's my favorite daughter.

169
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,270
Eunuch Deng

170
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,360
has agreed to

171
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,320
your marriage with Deng Yunfeng.

172
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,190
It seems

173
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,150
he also wants to cooperate.

174
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,040
After I leave,

175
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,630
you should get along with Deng Yunfeng.

176
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,640
I like that young man.

177
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,150
I understand.

178
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,110
Father.

179
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,000
There's one more thing.

180
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,830
Just tell me.

181
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,000
Although Eunuch Deng
has agreed to the marriage,

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,840
he is quite shrewd,

183
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,990
not entirely trustworthy.

184
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,600
Before the situation is clear,

185
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,510
I think

186
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,350
we should prepare for all scenarios.

187
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,550
The Gou Family Trade Association

188
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,480
is very successful in business

189
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,750
with great assets.

190
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,800
We should try
to cooperate with them more.

191
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,590
And the Sword Alliance,

192
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,830
the martial arts family,

193
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,590
has a high prestige
in the martial world.

194
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,390
Though Zhuge Heng,
the heir of the Sword Alliance,

195
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,400
has now joined
the Martial Artists Association,

196
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,870
it seems

197
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,670
he's not so close

198
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,320
to the group.

199
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,440
If one day,

200
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,560
he takes over the Sword Alliance,

201
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,520
he might become another threat.

202
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,710
So, I think,

203
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,160
if Eunuch Deng changes his mind,

204
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,150
Zhuge Heng

205
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,150
can also be a good choice

206
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,470
for my marriage.

207
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,790
Linglong,

208
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,240
I didn't expect you
to be so far-sighted.

209
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,200
You're even smarter than me.

210
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,790
After I leave,

211
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,630
keep a close eye on
the Martial Artists Association

212
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,020
and the court's forces in Huizhou.

213
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,520
But don't act rashly,

214
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,320
or they'll suspect you.

215
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,920
Also, take care of yourself.

216
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,720
Don't worry, Father.

217
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,640
Good.

218
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,240
Congratulations.

219
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,120
Congrats, Vice Chairman.

220
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,360
Sky Knight, congratulations

221
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,320
(Martial Artists Association)
on your promotion.

222
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,270
- Thanks.
- Congratulations.

223
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,670
My nephew wants to join the association.

224
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,520
- Mr. He, please...
- I understand.

225
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,550
Mr. He, you're the vice chairman now.

226
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,230
Congratulations.

227
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,670
Chairman Wu Guangming
is traveling around the world.

228
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,720
From now on,

229
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,870
we need to count on you, Vice Chairman.

230
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,830
- Please.
- We're counting on you.

231
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,840
Look at you.

232
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,280
You're too polite.

233
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,030
Don't you know

234
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,630
what kind of person I am?

235
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,870
It's my great honor to help

236
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,400
everyone in the association.

237
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,870
This year,

238
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,320
we really depend on you

239
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,040
for the court's rewards.

240
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,840
You're too modest.

241
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,760
Well...

242
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,040
Excuse me.

243
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,440
I heard

244
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,030
the former vice chairman

245
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,230
was a spy of the demonic sect.

246
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,390
I wonder if you have

247
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,510
figured it out.

248
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,720
Is that true?

249
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,950
Moreover,

250
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
is it possible that

251
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,750
Vice Chairman He is also...

252
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,720
He might also be...

253
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,580
Nonsense.

254
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,150
Get out! Get out!

255
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,480
- Martial world...
- Get out now!

256
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,740
- I...
- Get out!

257
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,620
(Eliminate Evil and Uphold Justice)

258
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,440
He Changzai.

259
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,630
If there's nothing to hide,

260
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,550
why fear my questions?

261
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,790
Wang Zipeng, are you that bored?

262
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,030
Martial World Publishing House.

263
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,320
I need to stay informed about
everything in the martial world.

264
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,510
Common people

265
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,440
also like the news about heroes.

266
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,830
It's my duty.

267
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,480
Then ask something useful.

268
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,360
If you're innocent,

269
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,350
why are you so nervous?

270
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,920
Listen,

271
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,440
I'll tell you a place.

272
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,040
Write it down.

273
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,870
Southern Huizhou City.

274
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,200
Find a man named Gou Lingfeng.

275
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,120
Who?

276
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,080
- Gou Lingfeng.
- Gou...

277
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,800
- He...
- Impressive.

278
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,920
Listen,

279
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,870
he's been involved in many events.

280
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,950
The demonic sect's attack
on Prince Chang,

281
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,830
the Puppet Knight case,

282
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,510
and the death
of the former vice chairman,

283
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,750
which you're concerned about...

284
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,710
- He...
- He's involved.

285
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,880
Find him.

286
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,960
I didn't know you had

287
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,950
such a talent.

288
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,280
I'm so ignorant.

289
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,870
Thanks, Vice Chairman.

290
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,590
Gou Lingfeng,

291
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,160
sounds like a handsome guy.

292
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,190
Bye.

293
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,600
Someone.

294
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,520
Yes.

295
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,040
Vice chairman.

296
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Ask Gou Lingfeng and Zhuge Heng over.

297
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,160
Aye.

298
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,680
What does he need us for?

299
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,230
What's wrong?

300
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,280
What's the matter?

301
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,160
Here's the thing.

302
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,830
You protected Prince Chang,

303
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,200
and he really appreciates it.

304
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,080
As Princess Linglong and Mr. Deng's
marriage is coming,

305
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,200
she'll stay for a while.

306
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,840
However, she's a princess.

307
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,960
It's inappropriate for her

308
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,200
to live here.

309
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,360
Zhuge,

310
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,200
your place is big...

311
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,440
Wait, Vice Chairman.

312
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,990
We don't have extra rooms.

313
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,720
Besides, Floral Knight planted

314
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,630
many toxic herbs in our yard.

315
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,120
If Princess Linglong touches them,
we'll be doomed.

316
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,470
- Doomed!
- Who'll be responsible?

317
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,870
We can't let that happen.

318
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,230
Sorry, we can't help you.

319
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,680
Don't worry.

320
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,080
We've bought

321
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,910
the Su Mansion

322
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,040
across from your place
for Princess Linglong.

323
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,950
If nothing else,

324
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,080
- we'll head back.
- Let's go.

325
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,000
Wait.

326
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,470
It's been empty for years.

327
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,320
Now we're short-handed,

328
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,800
so you'll clean it up.

329
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,920
Me?

330
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,470
I'm the heir of
the Gou Family Trade Association.

331
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,880
Me?

332
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,720
I'm the heir of the Sword Alliance.

333
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,800
Clean up for her?

334
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,230
You're neighbors...

335
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,680
Is that appropriate?

336
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,280
I don't think so.

337
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,560
You can look out for each other, right?

338
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,310
Wait.

339
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,470
This is Prince Chang's order.

340
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,800
Prince Chang?

341
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,520
Without tools, how can we clean up?

342
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,920
Yingdan, why are you here?

343
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,680
Now that we're living together,

344
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,950
I'll lend a hand.

345
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,240
Why should we clean up

346
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,550
this shabby place?

347
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,430
That's right.

348
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,350
Better hire a servant.

349
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,200
Hire a servant?

350
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,600
Do you think it's for fun?

351
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,080
It's Prince Chang's order.

352
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,360
Clean it up.

353
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,200
Princess Linglong.

354
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,790
I know you.

355
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,950
You're Princess Lingdang!

356
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,200
Please don't mind, Princess Linglong.

357
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,630
He's a bit slow.

358
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,800
I heard you were cleaning the house,

359
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,320
so I came to reward you.

360
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,950
Something's wrong with Mr. He.

361
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,560
With so many options,

362
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,630
he asked us to clean up.

363
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,240
That's right.

364
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,960
We should hire someone

365
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,200
for this.

366
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,800
We have cases to solve.

367
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,530
Actually,

368
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,320
I told He Changzai
the same thing, but...

369
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,750
I'm not blaming you.

370
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,000
He Changzai is really a bad person,

371
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,200
always making things hard for us.

372
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,040
That's why I'm here to apologize.

373
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,830
Sorry for the trouble.

374
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,230
Princess, you're so kind.

375
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,480
Princess, we live so close.

376
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,150
We can often visit each other.

377
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,070
Gou Lingfeng.

378
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,800
The princess is busy.

379
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,230
Don't bother her with everything.

380
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,470
It's okay.

381
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,150
I'm happy to drink tea

382
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,750
and chat with you.

383
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,110
Mr. Zhuge,

384
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,160
you saved my life last time.

385
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,830
I haven't thanked you properly.

386
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,230
Why don't we have a drink tonight?

387
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,670
You should join us.

388
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,750
No problem.

389
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,110
No need, Princess.

390
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,280
Zhuge Heng needs
to take care of Ling'er.

391
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,870
That's right.

392
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,150
Ling'er is feeling down lately.

393
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,230
I need to look after her.

394
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,200
Ling'er is feeling down?

395
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,280
Feeling down.

396
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,700
(Empty)

397
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,310
Lingfeng.

398
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,910
Master, why are you here?

399
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,840
I miss you so much!

400
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,040
Stop shaking me.

401
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,160
Full of strength.

402
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,240
Master,

403
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,950
how did you end up like this?

404
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,790
I've traveled a long way

405
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,630
only to find you.

406
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,240
We've been apart for so long.

407
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,630
I miss you so much!

408
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,120
- Really?
- I miss you too, Master.

409
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,070
Did you eat well?

410
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,390
Did you sleep well?

411
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,040
Did anyone bully you?

412
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,480
Look,

413
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,160
you're so skinny.

414
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,270
Am I?

415
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,720
I've waited for you all morning,

416
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,430
but you didn't come.

417
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,520
I've been busy today.

418
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,070
Besides, why wait in the restroom?

419
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,430
Come on, let's head back.

420
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,960
Drinking really messes things up.

421
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,320
Lingfeng,

422
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,960
can I borrow some money from you

423
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,590
to buy clothes?

424
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,510
Master.

425
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,240
Stop pretending.

426
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,350
Wipe off the oil on your face first.

427
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,040
You want money?

428
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,440
I haven't blamed you

429
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,880
for teaching me demonic skills.

430
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,320
You little brat.

431
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,000
Where's my secret manual?

432
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,080
Give it back.

433
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,390
I've kept it safe,

434
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,160
no doubt.

435
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,000
Where is it?

436
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,080
Where is it?

437
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,000
At Gou Mansion.

438
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,920
What?

439
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,440
You little brat.

440
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,400
How could you not carry

441
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,960
such a precious item with you?

442
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,030
Master.

443
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,390
Are you really from the demonic sect?

444
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,400
I've been determined to eliminate

445
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,510
all demonic sect members
since childhood.

446
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,200
It's a divine sect.

447
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,120
Divine...

448
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,000
I can't believe you joined
the Martial Artists Association.

449
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,920
However, you're only a Chou-rank hero.

450
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,000
Old man!

451
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,910
Don't mention it.

452
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,480
If it weren't for
the demonic skills you taught me,

453
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,870
they wouldn't have seen me
as a demonic sect member

454
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,550
and despised me.

455
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,470
So,

456
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,640
instead of being despised here,

457
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,960
why not return with me
and be the sect leader?

458
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,280
- I...
- Revitalize the divine sect.

459
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,920
The bright sky has perished.

460
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,280
The long night is coming.

461
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,880
I shall follow my path

462
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,350
to embrace the new beginning.

463
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,320
Leader, please take over the sect.

464
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,480
You're really from the demonic sect.

465
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,830
Oh my god!

466
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,910
Tell me,

467
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,190
did you take another disciple?

468
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,830
Zhuge Heng?

469
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,000
He's the heir of the Sword Alliance.

470
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,150
I advise you to stay away from them.

471
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,130
After all,

472
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,940
you're a divine sect member hiding in

473
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,240
the Martial Artists Association.

474
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,720
The Hero Gathering
will be held in three months.

475
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,070
If you can't get the hero token,

476
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,910
you must come back
and be the sect leader.

477
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,230
Me?

478
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,760
As an Ox-rank hero,

479
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,190
I'm not even qualified
for the Hero Gathering.

480
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,920
Moreover, I can't use my skills.

481
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,560
How can I get the hero token?

482
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,960
That's not my problem.

483
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,790
If you don't come back,

484
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,910
I'll reveal your identity to the world.

485
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,070
Didn't you say

486
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,430
you were destined to be a great hero?

487
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,190
Bye!

488
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,320
Is my move that ugly?

489
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,000
You ruined my reputation.

490
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,430
He's lost weight.

491
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,040
Enough.

492
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,630
Did you fall into the cesspit?

493
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Don't bother me.

494
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm in a bad mood.

495
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,960
Can't even have peace in the latrine.

496
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,470
Where's your broom?

497
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,000
Hurry up.

498
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,150
So,

499
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,430
the Sword Saint's son

500
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,240
is your disciple.

501
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,080
No wonder.

502
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,150
No wonder you defeated
the vice chairman.

503
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,590
Hey, who are you?

504
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,030
How did you find this place?

505
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,240
An Ox-rank hero murdered

506
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,550
the vice chairman,

507
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,240
a Tiger-rank hero.

508
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,830
Something must be wrong.

509
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,480
Who told you that?

510
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,670
That demonic remnant

511
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,400
was killed by Zhuge Heng.

512
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,520
Just ask him.

513
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,000
Hold on, let me ask you first.

514
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,510
How did you get in here?

515
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,400
Well...

516
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,830
Your identity is quite suspicious.

517
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,720
I'll write this down.

518
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,680
- Suspicious...
- Wait!

519
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,870
Don't write it down!

520
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,190
Who are you?

521
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,390
He's Wang Zipeng, a reporter at
Huizhou Martial World Publishing House.

522
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,350
Martial World Publishing House?

523
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,760
The Prince?
[*Prince: Homophone of Wang Zi]

524
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,120
Peng.

525
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,440
Say it together.

526
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,110
It's me, Wang Zipeng.

527
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,860
(Qingyu Garden)

528
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,760
He really likes to show off.

529
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,430
That's right.

530
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,430
He's finally been noticed.

531
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,110
Since childhood,

532
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,960
no one has truly cared about him.

533
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,150
But listen,

534
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,640
Wang Zipeng

535
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,320
is famous for his tricky questions.

536
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,390
It's a miracle that they haven't

537
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,880
had a fight yet.

538
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,720
Who is this?

539
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,800
It's me.

540
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,440
It doesn't look like you.

541
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,080
You know nothing.

542
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,720
I have an unusual face that can

543
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,960
stand the test of time.

544
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,520
As a hero from
the Martial Artists Association,

545
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,160
I killed the vice chairman

546
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,440
and protected Prince Chang.

547
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,680
Aren't these impressive?

548
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,670
Aren't they worth writing down?

549
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,030
Wait a minute.

550
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,880
The vice chairman
was killed by the Sword Saint's son.

551
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,680
- I...
- If I'm not mistaken,

552
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,960
he's also the one
who protected Prince Chang.

553
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,240
Now you're

554
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,240
taking all your

555
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,400
disciple's credit.

556
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,260
Such a behavior

557
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,440
will only ruin your reputation.

558
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,080
You're talking nonsense.

559
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,790
When Jia Mansion was haunted,

560
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,640
I was the one who stood up

561
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,150
and guarded the mourning hall.

562
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
When it was haunted,

563
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,110
didn't you faint right there?

564
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,550
Didn't Floral Knight slap you many times

565
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,880
to wake you up?

566
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,350
That's a rumor.

567
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,920
Where did you hear that rumor?

568
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,750
Alright, let's talk about Puppet Knight.

569
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,590
You did play a part
in the Puppet Knight case.

570
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,430
Indeed.

571
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,110
Many people witnessed it.

572
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,920
But Puppet Knight
was a criminal wanted by the court

573
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,630
and the Martial Artists Association.

574
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,510
You betrayed both the court

575
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,550
and the association

576
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,790
for your own benefit.

577
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,720
With evidence,

578
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,570
I'll write that down.

579
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,790
Nonsense!

580
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,630
I was upholding justice!

581
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,510
Let's talk about Juhong Pavilion,

582
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,350
okay?

583
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,510
You smashed two tables with a palm.

584
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,790
- Yes.
- Right?

585
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,710
Yes.

586
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,480
Did you pay for them?

587
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,110
The owner and my dad are friends.

588
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,390
No need to pay.

589
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,590
Alright.

590
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,160
Juhong Pavilion's owner and
Gou Family Trade Association's chairman

591
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,630
are having an affair.

592
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,960
As a reporter,

593
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,390
is this how you write stories?

594
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,520
You damaged property,

595
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,320
refused to admit your mistakes,

596
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,400
took others' credit,

597
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,920
and now you're hitting someone.

598
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,880
I...

599
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,800
Hitting someone.

600
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,560
- You...
- Help!

601
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,810
What's wrong, Master?

602
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,240
Look at your master.

603
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,560
Do you need me to kill him?

604
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,760
Okay, fine.

605
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,790
Order his disciple to harm

606
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,350
- You...
- a weak scholar.

607
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,720
- Shame on you.
- You...

608
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,960
You're doomed!

609
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,350
God,

610
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,240
please take away this troublemaker.

611
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,880
Yingdan.

612
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,440
Do you have any food?

613
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,150
I'm starving.

614
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,840
Not bad.

615
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,680
Hero Gou is getting famous.

616
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,630
Stop talking about that.

617
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,350
Yingdan, stop reading.

618
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,440
Find me something to eat.

619
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,430
I'm starving.

620
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,760
Where's Zhuge?

621
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,590
Is Ling'er giving him a makeover again?

622
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,960
Yingdan, listen...

623
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,470
This isn't right.

624
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,430
Why does it taste like
Tianshan Snow Pill?

625
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,590
Isn't this Tianshan Snow Pill?

626
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,510
That's not right.

627
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,560
That's not Tianshan Snow Pill.

628
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,240
It's a sugar pill.

629
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,280
No wonder you got the name wrong.

630
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,560
This isn't the antidote, is it?

631
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:17,790
Wait.

632
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,240
If it wasn't the antidote,

633
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,150
I should've been dead by now.

634
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,560
This...

635
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,680
Anyone who touches me

636
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,350
dies within half an hour.

637
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,670
And there's no cure.

638
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,190
In other words,

639
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,110
you were never poisoned.

640
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,190
- Not poisoned?
- In other words,

641
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,070
you are immune to all poisons.

642
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,720
Immune to all poisons?

643
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,320
Wait.

644
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,080
Back then, my hands were so black.

645
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,720
And every time you touch me,

646
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,590
my heart races, and my face blushes.

647
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,640
I was definitely poisoned.

648
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,480
You weren't poisoned at all.

649
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,920
Aren't you supposed to be with Ling'er?

650
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,350
It's too late. Ling'er is asleep.

651
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,240
You weren't poisoned.

652
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,310
Your hands turned black

653
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,350
because you touched
my black hair ointment.

654
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,720
Black hair ointment?

655
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,200
Zhuge,

656
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,430
try this too.

657
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,750
It's good.

658
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,800
Is this a northern sugar pill?

659
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,840
Where did you buy it?

660
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,190
Ma Yingdan!

661
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,720
As for the vice chairman's case,

662
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,920
I apologize for my offense.

663
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,840
Thanks.

664
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,760
I prepared these for you.

665
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,880
Hope you can forgive me.

666
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,270
Yingdan, you're too kind.

667
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,320
Yes. Yingdan, it must be expensive.

668
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,110
Yes, Yingdan.

669
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,670
Yingdan.

670
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,480
Were you born poisonous?

671
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,190
I come from Poison Valley.

672
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,670
I was born with a toxic body,

673
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,520
so I didn't have any friends.

674
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,760
When I turned 18,

675
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,590
I decided to leave the mountain

676
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,760
without my mom's permission

677
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,350
to find a way

678
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,110
to cure the poison.

679
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,270
Yingdan,

680
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,680
did you join the association

681
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,830
to cure your poison?

682
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,110
I've asked many renowned doctors,

683
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,390
but none of them could help.

684
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,560
Not only that,

685
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,430
I've harmed many people by accident.

686
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,430
I heard

687
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,000
there were many talents
at the association,

688
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,560
so

689
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,390
I wanted to give it a try.

690
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,270
What if I can find the cure?

691
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,110
So,

692
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,030
Yingdan,

693
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,680
do you think

694
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,670
I can cure your poison?

695
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,320
At least,

696
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,830
you're the only one

697
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,430
who's immune to my poison.

698
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,560
I just want to

699
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,120
give it a try.

700
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,510
What if you can cure my poison?

701
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,430
Yingdan.

702
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,720
What's wrong?

703
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,520
Is there something else?

704
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,750
You're not usually like this.

705
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,000
You poisoned me just like that.

706
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,310
Yingdan,

707
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,310
don't worry.

708
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,440
My master loves

709
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,720
to help others.

710
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,350
He'll definitely help you.

711
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,430
Right?

712
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,590
Come on, Gou Lingfeng.

713
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,350
Wait, this...

714
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,270
This... Yingdan...

715
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,480
I especially prepared this for you.

716
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,400
Try it.

717
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,800
Help others.

718
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,830
Yingdan, can you give me a heads-up

719
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
before testing poison on me?

720
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,640
This thing,

721
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,000
at first glance,

722
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,080
is quite disgusting.

723
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,910
You should at least warn me.

724
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,760
Aren't you scared at all?

725
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,070
I'm

726
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,110
Gou Lingfeng,

727
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,390
a man destined to be a great hero.

728
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,480
How could I fear this?

729
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,080
Yingdan.

730
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,520
Did you move to the Zhuge's place

731
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,350
to poison me more easily?

732
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,110
Are you going to test it until

733
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,040
I'm poisoned?

734
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,080
Exactly.

735
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,960
That's terrifying!

736
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,280
Master, help others!

737
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,580
(The End of Episode 8)

738
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,110
Ms. Ling'er, what are you doing?

739
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,030
Mr. Gou.

740
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,440
Ms. Ling'er,

741
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,830
could you paint one for me?

742
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,110
Sure, Mr. Gou.

743
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,590
Taller, a bit taller.

744
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,320
Slimmer, a bit slimmer.

745
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,630
Mr. Gou, it's done.

746
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,390
This looks exactly like me.

747
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,760
I'm glad you like it.
