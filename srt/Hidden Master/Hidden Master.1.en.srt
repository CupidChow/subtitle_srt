1
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,000
Young lady,

2
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,350
it's so late already,

3
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,560
are you alone?

4
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,410
Bro, bro,

5
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,520
look at her white hair.

6
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,600
That looks wild.

7
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,240
Stay calm.

8
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,520
You'll get your share soon.

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,230
Bro, you say that every time.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,720
You're this badly injured,

11
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,000
and you're still out robbing?

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,840
That lunatic from the demonic sect

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,360
ruined our good plans.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,240
But we've been secretly watching you.

15
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,110
You're all alone.

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,870
Leave that old lady alone!

17
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,150
I... I...

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,790
My furnace!

19
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,640
Sorry, old lady.

20
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,640
You are old!

21
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,680
Oh, come on!

22
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,590
Not again!

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,480
Why are you always haunting us?

24
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,510
- I...
- Help!

25
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,200
- The demonic sect is here!
- Murder!

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,230
You demonic sect scum

27
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,550
dared destroy my furnace!

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,160
I'll kill you!

29
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,680
(I am Gou Lingfeng.)

30
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,310
(I want to become a great hero.)

31
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,910
(But my path to heroism)

32
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,830
(is full of thorns and hardships.)

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,240
(This is the nineteenth time
I've tried to act chivalrously)

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,790
(and got mistaken for
a demonic sect member.)

35
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,710
(Why didn't the poison needle work?)

36
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,680
Old lady!

37
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,950
- Your needle...
- Don't come any closer!

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,710
Old lady, are you alright?

39
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,080
There are so many traps here,

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,760
you really have to be careful.

41
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,440
Don't come closer!

42
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,080
Put the needle in your hand away first.

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,880
This spot is just right.

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,790
Old lady, how did you get hit again?

45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,360
You really need to be more careful.

46
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,630
- Old lady...
- You are old!

47
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,790
Who are you?

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,200
I...

49
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,560
I'm Gou Lingfeng,

50
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,670
a man destined to become a great hero.

51
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,200
A hero?

52
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,480
Don't think you can fool me.

53
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,910
You used demonic skills,

54
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,190
you think I didn't see?

55
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,590
I'm not part of the demonic sect!

56
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,800
You... You gotta let me explain!

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,720
Explain what?

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,470
Look at the scar on your face.

59
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,480
How could you be a good person?

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
You...

61
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,240
Is that really how you judge

62
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,550
good and bad people?

63
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,590
(Looks like this is)

64
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,760
(a demonic sect member pretending
to be a hero.)

65
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,510
(Don't blame me.)

66
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,880
(You asked for this.)

67
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,760
Darn it!

68
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,760
(What amazing lightness skill!)

69
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,470
(I didn't expect)

70
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,800
(that before my hero journey
even started,)

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,390

118

(Many years ago,)

119
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,040
(the Demonic Sect wreaked havoc
across the martial world,)

120
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,480
(committing every imaginable crime,)

121
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,240
(bringing a storm of blood and chaos.)

122
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,350
(No one could stop them.)

123
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,160
(Righteous sects were
brutally massacred.)

124
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,720
(Gou's Cloth)
(The common people feared)

125
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,680
(even mentioning them.
Until the appearance)

126
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,240
(Martial Artists Association)
(of the Martial Artists Association.)

127
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,040
(It united all the righteous sects
of the martial world)

128
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,430
(Martial Artists Association)
(and launched a counterattack,)

129
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,660
(Great Evolution Divine Sect)
(annihilated the Demonic Sect.)

130
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,560
(Flourishing Days)

131
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,460
(Peace)
(From then on,)

132
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,160
(Grand Gathering)
(There were no factional divisions.)

133
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,630
(Martial Artists Association)
(All heroes)

134
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,440
(came under the protection
and governance of the Association.)

135
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,600
(Thus,)

136
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,030
(the martial world welcomed
a long-lost peace.)

137
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,000
(Fifteen Years Ago)

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,920
Afterward,

139
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,000
to inspire all heroes, the Association

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,810
(Tea House)
held the Hero Gathering.

141
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,680
Come take a look!

142
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,830
The first champion
of the Hero Gathering,

143
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,510
(Fu Qingfeng, Yang Chuxin)
Was the Radiant Knight,

144
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,000
Wu Guangming.

145
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,560
He held the Radiant Sword,

146
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,950
wore the Radiant Armor.

147
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,120
(Hero)
A hero token hung at his waist,

148
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,760
truly radiating might and majesty.

149
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,590
Speaking of this hero token,

150
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,920
it is a treasured item
that all martial heroes long for,

151
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,240
a supreme symbol of honor.

152
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,350
The Hero Gathering is held
every five years.

153
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,120
At that time, heroes
from all over gather,

154
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,600
masters converge,

155
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,350
all competing for the hero token.

156
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,240
Whoever wins the hero token has a chance

157
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,590
to become the leader
of the Martial Artists Association,

158
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,480
and command the martial world,

159
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,910
gaining the admiration of thousands.

160
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,150
- Bravo!
- Great!

161
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,870
Hey storyteller, tell me,

162
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,390
can I win the hero token?

163
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,630
Well, um,

164
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,350
the book doesn't say that!

165
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,630
Just tell me.

166
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,720
How am I supposed to answer that?

167
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,240
You, with that...

168
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,640
with that face,

169
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,720
how about

170
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,590
I teach you how to join
the Demonic Sect instead?

171
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,800
You...

172
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,510
I'm destined to become a great hero!

173
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,110
Good!

174
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,370
Good boy. Well said.

175
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,080
Crane Knight!

176
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,510
Everyone look!

177
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,000
It's the Moonblade Crane Knight!

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,120
He's come to Gou Town!

179
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,390
Let's go, let's go!

180
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,680
Go take a look!

181
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,670
Don't go!

182
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,040
You haven't paid yet!

183
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,750
What kind of people are these?

184
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,040
Scum, the lot of them.

185
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,240
Hey!

186
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,600
You just got here,

187
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,280
why are you paying?

188
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,470
This is what a true hero should do.

189
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,350
Well...

190
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,550
That's not quite right.

191
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,710
How about I perform a piece
just for you?

192
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,430
What?

193
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,870
This kid...

194
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,240
He...

195
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,440
He looks like that,

196
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,230
and isn't too bright either.

197
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,260
(Breeze Teahouse)

198
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,220
(Gou Mansion)

199
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,110
Chairman Gou.

200
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,560
I admire you, Tiger-rank hero,
Crane Knight.

201
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,160
The face,

202
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,470
the physique,

203
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,980
the attire,

204
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,940
(Tiger)
the token...

205
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,750
Crane Knight,

206
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,390
your presence brings great honor
to the Gou Mansion.

207
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,440
You flatter me.

208
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,360
Chairman Gou,

209
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,110
you're too kind, far too kind.

210
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,200
So, what important matter

211
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
did you invite me here for?

212
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,750
I've long wanted to find

213
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,470
a powerful master for my son,

214
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,790
so that one day he can join the MAA

215
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,990
and become a great hero.

216
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,320
I've tossed and turned,

217
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,630
sleepless night after night,

218
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,950
thinking it over and over—

219
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,280
Moonblade Crane Knight,

220
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,750
you are exactly the one

221
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,400
I've been looking for!

222
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,990
Ah, Chairman Gou,

223
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,470
as you know,

224
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,390
joining the MAA

225
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,150
has very strict requirements.

226
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,070
Of course.

227
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,630
You'd either have to be like me,

228
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,910
charming and elegant.

229
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,830
Right.

230
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,280
Or like me,

231
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,680
born from

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,150
a prestigious family.

233
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,070
Absolutely.

234
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,520
Or like me again,

235
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,160
having connections

236
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,870
up top.

237
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,960
Exactly, exactly!

238
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,440
You're the model of the MAA!

239
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,680
No, no, no!

240
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,830
Chairman Gou,

241
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,600
although I am a Tiger-rank hero

242
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,230
and head of the Divine Blade Sect,

243
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm very cautious when it comes

244
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,630
to taking in disciples.

245
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,830
Naturally, of course.

246
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,520
However,

247
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,520
to take Chairman Gou's son
as my disciple

248
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,350
would be an honor for me.

249
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,440
Dad, I'm back!

250
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,950
Lingfeng.

251
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,790
Well?

252
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,960
This is my son, Gou Lingfeng.

253
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,680
Isn't he good material
to be a great hero?

254
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,240
Lingfeng,

255
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,920
this is Uncle Crane Knight.

256
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,240
He's agreed to take you as a disciple.

257
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,560
Quick, go hug your master!

258
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,320
Really, Crane Knight?

259
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,480
Please accept my bow!

260
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,400
N-no, no!

261
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,510
You sure he's your biological son?

262
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,470
Of course.

263
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,760
Doesn't he look like my son?

264
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,320
Master, will you take me to the MAA?

265
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,270
Chairman Gou,

266
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,320
I just remembered there's still

267
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,720
something I haven't taken care of.

268
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,790
I'll be taking my leave now.

269
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,710
Farewell.

270
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,760
Crane Knight!

271
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,470
This guy

272
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,710
has no sense of honor.

273
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,240
Lingfeng,

274
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,230
this is the eighth master
I've found for you.

275
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,080
None of them want to teach you.

276
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,600
You might as well

277
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,000
inherit the family business.

278
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
No! I won't!

279
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,520
Lingfeng!

280
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,680
Great hero!

281
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,920
Spare me, great hero!

282
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,070
Please, spare me.

283
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,480
You little brat,

284
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,080
go play somewhere else.

285
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,480
Call me "great hero" a few more times

286
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,590
and I'll give you more food.

287
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,440
Are you insane or something?

288
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,200
Go away,

289
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
you startled me just now.

290
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,160
Demonic Sect remnant!

291
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,750
I won't let you go!

292
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,120
How do you know
I'm from the Demonic Sect?

293
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,750
You look like someone
from the Demonic Sect!

294
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,400
Does appearance really matter that much?

295
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,350
So being ugly

296
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,630
is a crime now?

297
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,360
Just because I'm not good-looking,

298
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,150
no one wants to teach me martial arts.

299
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,400
It's not fair.

300
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,670
I work so hard every day,

301
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,350
just to learn martial arts.

302
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,110
(Just like me.)

303
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,080
Come.

304
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,160
Hit me.

305
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,590
How did you do that?

306
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,080
Wanna learn?

307
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,950
You still seem like
you're from the Demonic Sect.

308
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,590
There's no good or evil in martial arts.

309
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,830
What there is a balance of
yin and yang, loss and gain.

310
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,390
Some martial arts

311
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,800
benefit the practitioner,

312
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,440
some devour the practitioner.

313
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,560
Master...

314
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,830
I haven't agreed to take you in yet!

315
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,750
It's fate!

316
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,590
Fate!

317
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,630
Fate!

318
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,110
Fate!

319
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,110
I've finally found

320
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,200
a martial arts prodigy.

321
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,470
Master!

322
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,920
Chairman Gou, you're too kind.

323
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,880
Mr. Gui,

324
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,840
thank you for teaching my son.

325
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,280
This is your due reward.

326
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,590
Mr. Gui,

327
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,230
may I ask,

328
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,150
what profound techniques

329
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,520
has my son been learning?

330
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,590
(This child truly
is a martial arts prodigy.)

331
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,160
(If only his brain
worked a little better.)

332
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,830
I am destined to become a great hero!

333
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,470
Master,

334
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,870
I think I've already mastered it.

335
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,150
I'm ready to go down the mountain
and uphold justice!

336
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,440
So naive.

337
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,920
Disciple,

338
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,350
tell me—what is a hero?

339
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,200
Of course—a hero helps the weak

340
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,040
and punishes the wicked!

341
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,520
You're

342
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,150
still too young.

343
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,320
Then what do you say

344
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,520
a hero is, Master?

345
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,120
Someone who fears not death,

346
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,750
who sacrifices for others—that
is a true hero.

347
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,790
What you mentioned

348
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,710
is just showing off.

349
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,630
Eradicating the Demonic Sect,

350
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,870
upholding justice,

351
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,830
that is what a true hero does.

352
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,360
I want to become

353
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,870
the greatest hero in the world!

354
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,560
You're wrong.

355
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,720
Master,

356
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,160
how am I wrong?

357
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,440
Justice comes in all forms,

358
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,880
and martial arts bear
no label of good or evil.

359
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,390
Blades don't kill,

360
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,920
people do.

361
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,670
Master,

362
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,470
where did you hear that from?

363
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,750
There's a new storyteller
at the Newbud Teahouse.

364
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,550
He tells it really well.

365
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,510
No, not that!

366
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,990
What storyteller?

367
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,910
Those are principles
I've come to understand myself!

368
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,800
You have a lot to learn.

369
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,310
Justice comes in all forms.

370
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,150
You and your little brain...

371
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,500
Martial arts bear
no label of good or evil.

372
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,720
Go down the mountain now.

373
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,300
(Busy and Bustling)

374
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,000
Mr. Zhuge,

375
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,070
those two Demonic Sect remnants
you asked me to catch,

376
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,520
well, the reward money...

377
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhuge!

378
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,080
Thank you for your generosity!

379
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,890
Coming!

380
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,200
Anyone here?

381
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,430
Coming, coming!

382
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,240
I need a room.

383
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,160
Alright!

384
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,430
A room, huh?

385
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,070
Right this way.

386
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,990
This way,

387
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,670
this way.

388
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,040
Did you see that guy?

389
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,270
So scary.

390
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,590
He scared me.

391
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,150
Could that person be a big shot

392
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,720
- from the Demonic Sect?
- Who knows.

393
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,560
Exactly.

394
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,160
That face just screams Demonic Sect.

395
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,400
Alright, alright, drink, drink!

396
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,630
Let's calm the nerves.

397
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,590
Why does everyone say
I'm from the Demonic Sect?

398
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,870
Just because I look like this?

399
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,440
I'm clearly very gentle.

400
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,520
Someone!

401
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,190
Catch the thief!

402
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,590
There's a thief!

403
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,190
My chance to uphold justice has come!

404
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,000
You vile thief!

405
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,350
I'm here to catch you!

406
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,830
Demonic Sect remnant!

407
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,670
We've finally lured you out!

408
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,600
Me?

409
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,720
The Demonic Sect has been
stirring up trouble lately.

410
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,400
We came to investigate,

411
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,760
and finally got you.

412
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,190
I'm not!

413
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,480
Save your breath.

414
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,400
Surrender now.

415
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,590
I'm telling you...

416
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,640
So fast!

417
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,960
I'm not!

418
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,670
That's Dragonfly Steps,

419
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,720
a top-level technique
from the Demonic Sect!

420
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,880
You're incredible!

421
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,790
- And you!
- No no no!

422
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,520
I'm not with them!

423
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,000
Master! Master!

424
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,400
So you're the Demonic Sect big shot

425
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,550
I've been looking for!

426
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,440
I'm not!

427
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,300
You all...

428
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,720
What the heck?

429
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,640
Who even

430
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,030
are you people?

431
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,830
Stop pretending!

432
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,000
You know exactly

433
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,320
why we've come for you.

434
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,190
You're a Demonic Sect remnant!

435
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,040
I'm not!

436
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,110
I hate the Demonic Sect the most!

437
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,000
I... I'm a hero!

438
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,350
Master,

439
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,760
please take me as your disciple!

440
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,910
(Wanted)
Liang Goudan!

441
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,790
Hu Yibiao!

442
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,720
Liu Dachui!

443
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,640
Wu Xiaogui!

444
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,430
Emm...

445
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,190
It's not him.

446
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,760
What's going on?

447
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,000
Let's go!

448
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Hurry! Go! Go!

449
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,110
What a...

450
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,590
(Mouse)
What is this?

451
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,000
That's a Hero Certificate
issued by the MAA.

452
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,320
Hero Certificate?

453
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,240
Upholding justice requires
official permission.

454
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,160
Got it?

455
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,240
Martial Artists Association,

456
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,160
have you heard of it?

457
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,430
Of course,

458
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,750
I'm going to be a great hero

459
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,800
like Radiant Knight!

460
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,390
Where is the MAA?

461
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,860
(Martial Artists Association)

462
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,900
(Wang Fugui, Wealthy Knight)

463
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,830
You know too much.

464
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,660
(Righteous and Mighty)

465
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,600
- Lord Deng!
- Lord Deng!

466
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,720
From today onward,

467
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,480
all matters of Huizhou's defense
and the martial world

468
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,760
will be handled
by the Prison Suppression Division.

469
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,520
All city affairs

470
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,080
must be reported to me.

471
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,430
Understood?

472
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,800
May I ask

473
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,750
which Lord Deng are you?

474
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,630
Chief Constable of the PSD—

475
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,480
Deng Yunfeng.

476
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,790
Oh, Lord Deng!

477
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,880
I've heard so much about you!

478
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,920
You've finally arrived.

479
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,750
I am Sky Knight of the MAA—He Changzai.

480
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,590
Did you hear anything unusual
last night?

481
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,190
Nothing out of the ordinary.

482
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,320
Judging by the wounds on the body,

483
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,390
it was likely the work
of the Demonic Sect.

484
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,160
The Demonic Sect?

485
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,720
This is no small matter.

486
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,080
From now on,

487
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,910
this case will be handled by the PSD.

488
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,440
All information must be sealed.

489
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,390
No leaks allowed.

490
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,630
Even the MAA must not act
without permission.

491
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,880
Lord Deng,

492
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,720
isn't that a bit much?

493
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,670
Looks like

494
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,280
the Demonic Sect is making a comeback.

495
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,200
(Huizhou City)

496
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,150
Come here.

497
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,790
Why are the inspections so strict?

498
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,710
Right?

499
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,750
There weren't this many guards
when I left the city.

500
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,800
I'm doing business.

501
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,830
Did something happen
in the city recently?

502
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,560
Something happen?

503
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,430
What happened?

504
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,990
You! Stop.

505
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,080
What is it?

506
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,200
Look at all those scars on your face,

507
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,510
and that scruffy beard!

508
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,960
You don't look like a good person
at all!

509
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,190
Guards, arrest him!

510
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,830
- What are you doing?
- Don't move!

511
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,880
- What do you want?
- Take him away!

512
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,720
- Let go!
- Move!

513
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,640
Let go of me!

514
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,680
What are you doing?

515
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,600
Move!

516
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,920
Do I look

517
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,320
kind of friendly?

518
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,640
Don't worry, Master.

519
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,590
I won't judge you just because

520
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,670
you don't look like a good guy.

521
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,950
Master!

522
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,030
Master!

523
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,180
(Martial Artists Association)

524
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,560
- Sanniang!
- Sanniang!

525
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,880
How's the pressure?

526
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,830
Sanniang, try this!

527
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,150
Sanniang's skin is so nice!

528
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,350
This one's too sweet. I don't like it.

529
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,520
I want to apply for a Hero Certificate.

530
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,280
Who's this now?

531
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,080
Young man,

532
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,910
you are new here, huh?

533
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,830
You want to join the MAA?

534
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,630
I'm Liu Sanniang, the Dexterous Knight.

535
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,760
I'm in charge of hero registration.

536
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,830
Come on, I'll take you to the back.

537
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,920
Why is it you again?

538
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,880
This is my master.

539
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,080
He wants to join the MAA.

540
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,280
Oh, so you're his master!

541
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,640
Take it off.

542
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,440
The mask.

543
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Better not.

544
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,360
It's cold.

545
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,110
This is the Demonic Sect remnant

546
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,960
who injured a bunch of our men
last night!

547
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,600
I'm not...

548
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,880
Don't be scared,

549
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,800
handsome one.

550
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,030
I'll use my Acupoint Technique

551
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,040
to seal his pressure points!

552
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,760
Heroes,

553
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,880
he's all yours!

554
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
No, wait!

555
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,320
What's all this ruckus?

556
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,800
This is unnecessary.

557
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,110
My Lord!

558
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,030
That's the Demonic Sect remnant!

559
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,590
I'm not from the Demonic Sect!

560
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,350
I came here to join the MAA!

561
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,390
Watch your words.

562
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,760
This is Constable Deng Yunfeng

563
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,200
of the PSD,

564
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,440
straight from the Imperial City.

565
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,150
Was that your doing?

566
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,440
What?

567
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,760
That.

568
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,070
I don't know what you're talking about.

569
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,070
It's him!

570
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,790
Several heroes have already
identified him.

571
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,790
He's the one who attacked people
last night.

572
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,640
I... I...

573
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,480
Still won't admit you're from
the Demonic Sect?

574
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm not!

575
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,040
I hate the Demonic Sect the most!

576
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,000
Put those dexterous hands away.

577
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,320
It's itchy.

578
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,190
Ma'am, it's fine!

579
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,680
What are you doing?

580
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,730
Stay away from me!

581
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,620
I didn't do anything!

582
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,000
What's going on?

583
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,320
So lively!

584
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,720
The Floral Knight is here.

585
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,520
How's the elixir refining coming along?

586
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,310
Don't even mention it.

587
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,110
It was ruined by a Demonic Sect remnant.

588
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,240
Floral Knight.

589
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,910
This is...

590
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,480
The new Constable Deng.

591
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,430
I...

592
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,430
My furnace!

593
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,310
Sorry, old lady.

594
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,320
You are old!

595
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,480
Why does this look so familiar?

596
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,270
Young lady,

597
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,190
is this your...

598
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,430
Why'd you hit me?

599
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,960
Because it's you!

600
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,070
Who are you exactly?

601
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,030
Who are you,

602
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,440
to dare cause trouble in the MAA?

603
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,870
How could you hit someone so casually?

604
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,800
No wonder everyone's so afraid of you.

605
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,920
Floral Knight,

606
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,320
do you need some help?

607
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,160
Lord Deng, is it?

608
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,080
Yes.

609
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,030
He

610
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,350
is a remnant of the Demonic Sect.

611
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,670
I...

612
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,630
I'm not with the Demonic Sect!

613
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,030
Look! Look at the scars on my face!

614
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,720
This is what the Demonic Sect did to me!

615
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,720
No need for more excuses.

616
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,070
No, I...

617
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,000
Take him away.

618
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,070
I'm not!

619
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,510
You've got the wrong guy!

620
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,510
- I...
- Move!

621
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,000
I really am not!

622
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,440
- I'm not with the Demonic Sect!
- Handsome,

623
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,550
your master is from Demonic Sect.

624
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,790
I'm not!

625
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,080
You better be careful.

626
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,780
(Justice is Watching)

627
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,280
Brazen Demonic Sect scum!

628
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,590
Confess honestly!

629
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,200
Why did you kill MAA examiner

630
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,400
Wang Fugui?

631
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,480
Now we only know he's from
the Demonic Sect.

632
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,760
We don't have solid evidence

633
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,080
he killed Wang Fugui.

634
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,600
No.

635
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,240
Sir,

636
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,910
why won't you understand?

637
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,720
Sir, listen,

638
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,350
forget about Wang Fugui or whoever,

639
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,960
you've all misunderstood!

640
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,150
I'm the young master
of the Gou Family Trade Association!

641
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,200
I came to the MAA

642
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,430
to register as a hero,

643
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,880
so I could walk the martial world

644
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,240
and uphold justice!

645
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,160
Pah!

646
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,960
Master Gou and I were once acquainted.

647
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,750
He was refined

648
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,240
and elegant.

649
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,200
No way he could've had a kid
as ugly as you!

650
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,120
I...

651
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,800
(I remember now.)

652
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,750
(Back then, the Gou family did)

653
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,720
(seem to have a little boy.)

654
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,510
Hold on.

655
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,430
Lord Deng,

656
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,160
there might be a misunderstanding here.

657
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,910
The Floral Knight has already
identified him.

658
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,000
He is with the Demonic Sect!

659
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,350
What?

660
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,510
Floral Knight?

661
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,350
I don't even know who that is!

662
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,030
My lord,

663
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,240
we've found a witness who saw the killer

664
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
of Examiner Wang that day.

665
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,320
The witness said the suspect had

666
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,790
one eye, and a broken eyebrow.

667
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,000
Speak up.

668
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,960
The suspect had

669
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,880
one eye,

670
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,030
and a broken eyebrow.

671
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,280
M-my lord...

672
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,710
Young Master Gou,

673
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,110
apologies for the scare.

674
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,030
Lord Deng,

675
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,830
we've got the wrong person.

676
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,720
Whatever.

677
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,390
What do you mean "whatever"?

678
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,270
Is this how you people handle justice?

679
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,680
Then we'll lock you up for now, and

680
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,320
investigate whether you're
with the Demonic Sect.

681
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,400
(Just beginning my journey)

682
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,640
(in the martial world,)

683
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,280
(and I'm already going to jail?)

684
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,640
(No way.)

685
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,140
(Justice is Watching)

686
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,310
You're seriously this cool?

687
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,520
Who goes there?

688
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,750
Who's

689
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,760
in charge here?

690
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,560
I just want to say one thing to them.

691
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,190
You can say several if you want.

692
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,560
Nope.

693
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,800
Just one.

694
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,950
Speak.

695
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,720
Prison break.

696
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,670
Prison break?

697
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,830
We the Demonic Sect will return!

698
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,080
I'm not one of them!

699
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,640
Don't chase them!

700
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,950
Lord Deng! You...

701
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,550
You just let him go like that?

702
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,080
Didn't you say we got the wrong person?

703
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,400
And the one

704
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,320
who let him go was that kid.

705
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,600
You know him?

706
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,310
You don't recognize the successor

707
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,390
of the Sword Alliance?

708
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,590
What kind of magistrate are you?

709
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,420
(The End of Episode 1)

710
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,700
(Dragon Demon)

711
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,200
I must survive

712
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,480
to restore my Divine Sect,

713
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,320
and avenge them!

714
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,870
Fate!

715
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,280
Fate!

716
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,920
Fate!

717
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,720
I've finally found

718
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,800
a martial arts prodigy.

719
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,480
I will have him

720
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,390
revive the Divine Sect!
