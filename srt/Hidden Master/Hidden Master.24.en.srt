1
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,800
Mom, what are you doing?

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,080
You need to stay in your room

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,910
and reflect on yourself.

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,430
Why do I have to reflect on myself?

5
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,800
I just came back. I...

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,510
My head's still spinning.

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,480
Look at you.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,760
How could you end up like this?

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,320
I tried to persuade you so many times.

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,190
If I let you leave

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,480
Poison Valley again,

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,800
I won't deserve to be your mother!

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,800
Mom.

14
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,470
I want to know my father...

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,310
You have no father.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,000
When I was gathering herbs,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,430
I found a small mushroom

18
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,640
and turned it into you.

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,790
Mom!

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,840
- My Lady!
- Rang, you...

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,520
Valley Master is just too happy.

22
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,520
Since you left,

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,750
she's been talking about

24
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,430
lacking a mahjong player.

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,320
My mom has missed me.

26
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,520
My Lady,

27
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,670
she truly cares about you.

28
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,960
She sent people to follow you.

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,430
She even knows you and Mr. Gou

30
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,710
love each other.

31
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,590
Love each other?

32
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,920
Who loves him?

33
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,320
Tell me,

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,280
do you like Gou or not?

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,640
None of your business.

82
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,470
You little brat.

83
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,430
It's been so many years,

84
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,430
and you're still so reckless.

85
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,800
You haven't improved at all.

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,840
Master,

87
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,190
what happened in Wulipo?

88
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,240
If you'd listened to me,

89
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,400
I wouldn't have...

90
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,800
Enough.

91
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,960
Don't talk about this.

92
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,800
Master,

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,150
I've been thinking a lot about it,

94
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,080
and something feels off.

95
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,710
Based on my assumptions,

96
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,800
I can't draw any conclusions yet.

97
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,080
However,

98
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,680
you must be cautious of Wu Guangming.

99
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,960
- Chairman?
- Yes.

100
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,800
No way!

101
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,560
He's been so good to me.

102
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,310
He has nothing to do with this.

103
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,510
It's because

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,680
you taught me demonic skills.

105
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,920
I couldn't do anything.

106
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,630
And Zhuge Heng,

107
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,390
he actually dared to challenge me...

108
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,230
I...

109
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,830
Useless thing!

110
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,000
Do you know

111
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,800
my grandson was trying to wake you up?

112
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,190
You have no idea.

113
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,040
All-Around Knight
doesn't know martial arts at all.

114
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,230
What?

115
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,350
Impossible!

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,040
He's All-Around Knight!

117
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,600
He ranks only second to

118
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,160
Chairman Wu in the association.

119
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,480
How could he not know martial arts?

120
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,830
And he's so famous.

121
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,870
Famous.

122
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,960
Weren't you also famous before?

123
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,830
I...

124
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,120
That's just the association's trick!

125
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,360
No way.

126
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,000
No way!

127
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,870
Enough.

128
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,480
Get out of here.

129
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,950
I want to

130
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,630
take a rest alone.

131
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,160
I haven't slept well in ages.

132
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,070
Just go, just go.

133
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,070
How is Ma Yingdan doing?

134
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,520
Yingdan...

135
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,390
was pissed off and left because of me.

136
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,830
What?

137
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,390
She's such a good girl.

138
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,600
How could you lose her?

139
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,630
Do something, you idiot!

140
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,510
I'm so pissed off!

141
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,480
Deng Yunfeng?

142
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,920
Why are you here?

143
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,830
Everyone hates you right now.

144
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,870
You look so miserable drinking alone here.

145
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,920
I decided to have mercy

146
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
and drink with you.

147
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,360
Fine wine.

148
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,190
Do you have something to say?

149
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,680
I'm not in the mood.

150
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,600
Can't I just drink with you?

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,190
Fine, I'll get to the point.

152
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,750
I hope you can earn the hero token.

153
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,750
What? Why?

154
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,270
Didn't you always say

155
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,430
you were destined to be a great hero?

156
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,440
Think about it.

157
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,040
Is there a greater hero
than the chairman

158
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,870
of the association?

159
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,750
If you want to earn it,

160
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,920
I'll do everything I can to help you.

161
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,240
When you become the chairman,

162
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,510
even if you want to exploit the people

163
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,630
or abuse your power for your family,

164
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,800
as long as you don't feel guilty,

165
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,950
I won't stop you.

166
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,950
How can the association

167
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,480
have someone like you,

168
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,480
always talking about

169
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,680
exploiting the people and abusing power?

170
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,750
Hasn't the association

171
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,680
always be like this?

172
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,160
Loyalty Knight.

173
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,430
Cheers.

174
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,950
Chairman also

175
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,190
asked me to go to the Hero Gathering,

176
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,190
but now

177
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,680
I'm not interested anymore.

178
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,870
I know what might interest you.

179
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,720
Do you want to know where Yingdan is?

180
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,720
Do you know where she is?

181
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,480
Where is she?

182
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,270
Tell me.

183
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,950
Where is she?

184
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,000
Now you're impatient.

185
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,270
Why should I tell you?

186
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,390
If it weren't for your actions,

187
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,040
would Yingdan have left?

188
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,200
I...

189
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,480
You're lying.

190
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,360
How could you possibly know
Yingdan's whereabouts?

191
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,440
Do you really think

192
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,440
you know everything about her?

193
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,030
You know nothing about

194
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,910
the bond between Yingdan and me.

195
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,600
Hey, what do you mean?

196
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,240
Yingdan and I

197
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,670
have known each other for years.

198
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,960
Back then, we...

199
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,080
we were best friends.

200
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,120
Later, my godfather took me to the capital.

201
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,440
I didn't even say goodbye,

202
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,750
and Yingdan lost her only friend.

203
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,240
She had been all alone

204
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,510
until she met you.

205
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,750
Why are you telling me this?

206
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,320
I want to go to Poison Valley,

207
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,270
but I don't know where it is.

208
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,360
So, I'm here to ask you.

209
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,270
Did Yingdan return to Poison Valley?

210
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,390
Yes.

211
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,680
And...

212
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,510
I've called everyone back for you.

213
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,160
Zhuge.

214
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,390
What are you doing?

215
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,120
Gou, there's no need for this.

216
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,230
Zhuge.

217
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,320
Ling'er.

218
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,720
Even if you kneel, I won't forgive you.

219
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,440
Hit me. Come on, hit me.

220
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,000
- No.
- Stay away from me.

221
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,240
Is that enough?

222
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,040
So disgusting.

223
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,840
Stop acting like children.

224
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,510
Let's hurry and bring Yingdan back.

225
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,030
Yes, let's go find her.

226
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,710
Hey.

227
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,720
I'm going with you.

228
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,000
Why are you going with us?

229
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,910
Because only I know

230
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,320
why

231
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,390
she left Huizhou.

232
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,910
Can you tell us now?

233
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,150
Deng Yunfeng.

234
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,390
What do you actually know?

235
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,270
That day, He Changzai and I

236
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,670
went to Anicca Clinic.

237
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,870
So,

238
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,390
can you really cure me?

239
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,230
Miss,

240
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,600
you don't have much time left, right?

241
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
I can't be wrong.

242
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,480
Your poison

243
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,550
is the same as the sect leader's wife's.

244
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,160
What?

245
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,480
Stop talking nonsense.

246
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,750
You didn't hear it?

247
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,080
You're still young,

248
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,510
and you're already hard of hearing?

249
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,720
I said,

250
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,470
thou

251
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,920
art,

252
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,440
you

253
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,800
are,

254
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,720
Your Excellency,

255
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,600
you're the daughter of Liu Guang,
the sect leader

256
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,240
of the Great Evolution Divine Sect!

257
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,030
Did you hear it clearly?

258
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,630
- You're from the demonic sect?
- Yes.

259
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,080
What demonic sect?

260
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,630
It's the divine sect.

261
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,080
Back when

262
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,670
our leader was still alive...

263
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,630
Old man, what's wrong with you?

264
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,270
Stop talking nonsense.

265
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,120
Where did Zhuge find

266
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,150
you psycho?

267
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,080
Say it again, and I'll kill you, okay?

268
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,720
You asked me to say it again.

269
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
Why are you so angry?

270
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,000
You can't slander me without proof!

271
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,270
Your poison body is the proof!

272
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,240
Back then,

273
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,150
our leader wanted to master
the Poison Art,

274
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,910
so Mrs. Liu from Poison Valley

275
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,440
tested poisons for him.

276
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
However, she accidentally

277
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,670
turned her own body into a poison body.

278
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,790
Our leader was
so obsessed with the Poison Art,

279
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,030
and Mrs. Liu felt he lost control

280
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,200
and became a demon.

281
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,550
They argued a lot.

282
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,200
Then it kept getting worse,

283
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,720
and Mrs. Liu left in anger.

284
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,440
When she left,

285
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,320
he didn't know she was pregnant.

286
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,120
Actually, he regretted it immediately.

287
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,790
He was so guilty and begged me

288
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,600
to make an antidote for him.

289
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
After much effort,

290
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
we finally found a way
to cure the poison.

291
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,320
However, before we could
find Mrs. Liu to save her,

292
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,270
we got the news that she had died.

293
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,030
Our leader was heartbroken.

294
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,510
He ordered me
to throw away the only antidote.

295
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,280
However...

296
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,870
I couldn't bear

297
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,390
to destroy the antidote

298
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,870
that took years to make,

299
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,750
so I secretly retrieved it

300
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,240
as a memento.

301
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,320
I never expected

302
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,150
that I'd deliver this to you in person.

303
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,870
You must've been blessed

304
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,550
by our leader's soul.

305
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,150
How... How's that possible?

306
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,480
Believe it or not,

307
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,120
I heard it with my own ears.

308
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,030
- Yingdan.
- Why are you here?

309
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,870
Let's go.

310
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,840
He Changzai is coming.

311
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,440
If he finds out who you really are,

312
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,510
he won't go easy on you.

313
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,680
Just go!

314
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,670
Thank you, Little Stone.

315
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,590
Gou Lingfeng.

316
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,280
Gou Lingfeng.

317
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,320
Can you go home with me?

318
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,750
Isn't this your home?

319
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,670
I meant Poison Valley.

320
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,960
Alright, no problem.

321
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,200
This is all my fault.

322
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,840
Yingdan asked me to go back

323
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,200
to Poison Valley with her.

324
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,600
I agreed

325
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,030
but never did it.

326
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,800
Deng Yunfeng,

327
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,510
why are you helping Yingdan?

328
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,630
Why should I tell you?

329
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,470
I...

330
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,080
Forget it.

331
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,870
As long as it's good for Yingdan,

332
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,550
I won't stop you.

333
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,510
You're not in a position
to say it's good for Yingdan.

334
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,360
Deng,

335
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,790
don't go too far.

336
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,790
We have three people.

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,840
Childish.

338
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,670
Forget it, Zhuge.

339
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,790
We agreed to travel together,

340
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,270
so I'm sure Inspector Deng
knows what he's doing.

341
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,960
Zhuge, have you forgiven me?

342
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,800
Go away!

343
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,080
Someone's following us.

344
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,470
Don't look back!

345
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,670
Pretend you don't know.

346
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
I'll cover you.

347
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,470
How's the situation?

348
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,670
I think

349
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,670
there are at least 20 people.

350
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,320
20 people?

351
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,670
That many?

352
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,150
Could it be He Changzai's men?

353
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,510
It's possible.

354
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
After you left,

355
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,720
Wu Guangming's plan
might've been disrupted.

356
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,000
He's probably worried

357
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,670
you'll turn to my godfather,

358
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,200
so he's trying everything

359
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,840
to bring you and Zhuge back.

360
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,200
Then I have to

361
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,480
explain it to him when I return.

362
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,000
Are you a coward?

363
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,910
Or do you think
you can't protect Yingdan?

364
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,270
We're already here.

365
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,480
There's no reason to turn back.

366
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,630
Exactly.

367
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,600
Get some rest.

368
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,440
I'll keep watch.

369
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,200
Sorry, boss.

370
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,840
Ling'er.

371
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,120
What are you burning?

372
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
I can smell it.

373
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,600
I saw some mugwort,

374
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,680
so I brought it over and burned it.

375
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,630
It can keep mosquitoes away.

376
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,960
Mugwort?

377
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,870
Ling'er is so thoughtful.

378
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,670
I have an idea.

379
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,390
- What idea?
- What idea?

380
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,390
Tonight,

381
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,790
watch and learn.

382
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
So mysterious.

383
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,720
So mysterious.

384
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,630
Hurry up!

385
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,000
Heng,

386
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,080
what did you do?

387
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,270
They can't catch up with us.

388
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,960
They must be busy with diarrhea.

389
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,160
You gave them laxatives?

390
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,350
Not laxatives.

391
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,310
Anicca Knight gave me some

392
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,400
medicine for constipation.

393
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,960
He said, use a toothpick to dip a bit,

394
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,750
and it guarantees smooth bowels
for three days.

395
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,240
I just gave them a bit more.

396
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,440
Let's go.

397
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,200
Is this Poison Valley?

398
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,750
It's terrifying.

399
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,510
According to Yingdan's description,

400
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,400
this should be the place.

401
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,800
- Let's go!
- Wait a moment.

402
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,000
This...

403
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,550
This miasma is poisonous, right?

404
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,790
This is Poison Valley.

405
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,960
You tell me.

406
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,400
It doesn't matter.

407
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,720
Even if it's a sea of flames,

408
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,400
I'll still charge through today.

409
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,240
Wait a minute.

410
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,030
You're immune to all poisons,

411
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,920
but what about Ling'er and me?

412
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,160
We're just ordinary mortals.

413
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,200
It's just Poison Valley.

414
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,310
In this world,

415
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,480
there's no place

416
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,550
I cannot reach.

417
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,160
- Showing off again.
- You're always doing this.

418
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,200
- So pretentious.
- Pretentious.

419
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,110
So pretentious.

420
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,280
Ling'er, are you okay?

421
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,480
- Much better.
- Now,

422
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,270
what should we do?

423
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Maybe you should leave.

424
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,480
I'll go into the valley alone.

425
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,510
No way.

426
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,880
We agreed to face this together.

427
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,790
Gou Lingfeng,

428
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,400
are you trying to
use the miasma to get rid of me?

429
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,960
It's not going to happen.

430
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,270
Okay.

431
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,920
Inspector Deng, tell us

432
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,240
what we should do.

433
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,640
Just slow down a bit.

434
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,510
We need to detoxify as we move.

435
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,400
Are you crazy?

436
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,030
It's a big forest.

437
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,240
We won't get out until the year

438
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,750
of monkey.
[*Idiom: It'll take forever.]

439
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,550
Gou,

440
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,790
but it's the Shen Year right now.
[*Shen Year: Year of monkey]

441
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,790
What's wrong?

442
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,160
Then it's the year of monkey.

443
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,480
This is the perfect timing,

444
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,680
but with the wrong people.

445
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,430
You...

446
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,750
Valley Master!

447
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,510
We're Yingdan's best friends!

448
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,830
We're very close!

449
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,030
Can you please

450
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,920
let us in?

451
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,720
He's not her friend.

452
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,030
He doesn't need to get in.

453
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,870
You...

454
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,960
Rang, what did you say?

455
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,310
- He's really here?
- Yes.

456
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,240
He's in the miasma forest.

457
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,080
Miasma forest?

458
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
It doesn't matter.

459
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,510
He's immune to all poisons.

460
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,510
The miasma

461
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,750
won't affect him.

462
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
My Lady,

463
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,270
do you really like that fool?

464
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,880
Fool?

465
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,960
Yes.

466
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,680
He can't get out of the forest

467
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,480
and is shouting nonsense.

468
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,160
What a fool.

469
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,020
(Strength Trial)

470
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,400
Is this really Poison Valley?

471
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
Why does it feel like a trial game?

472
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,750
We just got out of the forest
full of miasma.

473
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,480
My head is still buzzing.

474
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,630
My home?

475
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,030
It's quite casual.

476
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,920
Casual?

477
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,400
I've never heard anyone describe

478
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,160
their home with this word.

479
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,000
People used to describe
my appearance like that.

480
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,830
For outsiders,

481
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,880
they not only
need to pass the miasma forest

482
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,070
but also pass the three trials
set by my mother.

483
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,790
The first trial is strength.

484
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,310
Many get stuck there because they can't

485
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,790
resolve the mystery.

486
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,030
But it's actually quite simple.

487
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,480
Just break the rock at the entrance.

488
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,270
So casual?

489
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,110
People fear Poison Valley

490
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,160
and think we use poison for evil.

491
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,720
But that's not the truth.

492
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,880
We only use the miasma

493
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,550
to neutralize the poison
in our own bodies.

494
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
My mother

495
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,640
is actually a very simple person.

496
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,640
She set those trials

497
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,200
to keep outsiders

498
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,830
from disrupting our lives.

499
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,790
Yingdan,

500
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,000
when you return to Poison Valley,

501
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,550
I will go there and visit you.

502
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,040
For what?

503
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,270
I don't know.

504
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,310
I haven't thought about it.

505
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,550
I just want to see you.

506
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,590
Yingdan,

507
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,440
I get it now.

508
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,070
Are you still waiting for me?

509
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,070
That's it?

510
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,350
Let's go.

511
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,920
Simplicity is the way.

512
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,580
(Toxic Gas Trial)

513
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,830
We've finally reached
the toxic gas goat.

514
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,110
Toxic gas gate!

515
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,350
- Toxic gas trial!
- Toxic gas trial!

516
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,910
Idiot.

517
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,350
Eat this first.

518
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,870
What is this?

519
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,030
A magical antidote.

520
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,870
Where did you get it?

521
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,400
When Anicca Knight
treated your constipation,

522
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,510
he gave this to me.

523
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,030
He said one day,

524
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,550
I'd come to Poison Valley.

525
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,390
Let's go.

526
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,680
The second trial is poison.

527
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,880
There are over ten toxic gases.

528
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,720
But I don't think

529
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,310
they can affect you.

530
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,790
I'm immune to all poisons, right?

531
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,640
Why do I still have

532
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,680
adverse effects?

533
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,920
Your demonic skills
are not that impressive.

534
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,640
Didn't we agree not to bring this up?

535
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,590
That's what He Changzai said.

536
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,590
I never agreed to that.

537
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,430
Yes.

538
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,790
He Changzai scammed me

539
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,400
out of a great sum of money
because of this.

540
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,510
I can't handle this.

541
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,160
- Ling'er.
- Are you okay?

542
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,880
The poison trial
isn't just about toxic gas.

543
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,510
My mother also set up some formations.

544
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,200
Mysterious Formation?

545
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,480
Your mother is so impressive.

546
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,440
No.

547
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,440
You're overestimating her.

548
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,000
In fact, those formations

549
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,030
are just

550
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,240
her usual dance moves.

551
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,110
That's indeed

552
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,430
casual.

553
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,590
If it weren't for her poison body,

554
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,110
my mother

555
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,510
is actually a very adorable person.

556
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,310
Yingdan,
you said your mother was simple,

557
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,880
but so are you.

558
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,920
Didn't you say that pill
was an antidote?

559
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,240
Well, I took the wrong one.

560
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,920
This is the Tianshan Snow Pill.

561
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,480
Gou Lingfeng, Gou Lingfeng.

562
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,830
I can't believe

563
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,270
you even screw your allies over.

564
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,400
No wonder it smells

565
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,640
so familiar.

566
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,240
Look,

567
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,960
wait for me outside.

568
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,480
I'll go in first.

569
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,720
Once I get the antidote,

570
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,000
I'll come back for you.

571
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,080
It makes sense.

572
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,350
Master,

573
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,960
take care.

574
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,200
Be careful.

575
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,830
Keep this for fun.

576
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,390
Let's go.

577
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,680
We're not sisters.
[*Homophone of "fun"]

578
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:18,540
(Poison Valley)

579
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,640
Lingfeng.

580
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,040
Yingdan.

581
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,030
Yingdan, I've finally found you.

582
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,240
How are you?

583
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,080
Are you okay?

584
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,200
Did the poison harm you?

585
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,680
I'm fine. You know me.

586
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,350
I'm immune to all poisons.

587
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,270
That was a piece of cake.

588
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,880
Lingfeng,

589
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,110
do you know?

590
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,680
I missed you so much

591
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,000
when you were not around.

592
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,200
Yingdan,

593
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,590
you're acting strange.

594
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,270
Has your poison been cured?

595
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,830
Did it affect your brain?

596
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,110
It affected your brain!

597
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Yes, yes.

598
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,590
It's really you.

599
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,750
You're still so strong.

600
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,400
Not strange at all.

601
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,400
Come on.

602
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,590
How are you doing?

603
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,480
My legs are numb.

604
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,880
Completely numb.

605
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,030
My legs are numb too.

606
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,040
Vice Chairman,

607
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,000
there's a fork in the road.

608
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,110
Which way should we go?

609
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,270
Slow down.

610
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,840
Look over there.

611
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,800
Let's head that way.

612
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,150
Come on.

613
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,000
Lingfeng,

614
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,750
I know you must've been

615
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,550
tired and hungry on the way.

616
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,800
Look.

617
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,550
I prepared some pastries

618
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,390
and tea.

619
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,830
- Yingdan, you're the best.
- Of course.

620
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,920
I was starving the whole time.

621
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,110
Try this.

622
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,430
Have some tea.

623
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,160
You must be exhausted.

624
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,430
What are you doing?

625
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,790
Just to make sure I'm not dreaming.

626
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,070
How could this be a dream?

627
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,240
Am I just a dream?

628
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,720
So foolish.

629
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,790
Yingdan, do you know?

630
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,000
When we lived together,

631
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,270
I often talked to you
when I couldn't sleep at night.

632
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,480
After you left,

633
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,160
I could only talk to Zhuge.

634
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,590
Zhuge was annoying,

635
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,830
but I had no one else to turn to,

636
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,240
so I just talked to him.

637
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,110
When I talked to him,

638
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,000
he started to annoy me,

639
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,400
but I had no other choice

640
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,110
because you weren't there...

641
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,440
What are you talking about?

642
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,070
I don't know either.

643
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,590
But I really miss you.

644
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,400
Lingfeng,

645
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,680
I miss you too.

646
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,510
From now on, talk to me

647
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,920
whenever you need to, okay?

648
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,760
Okay.

649
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,400
Yingdan, I... I didn't mean to.

650
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,000
It's okay.

651
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,240
It's okay?

652
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,150
Yes, it's okay.

653
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,350
You're not Ma Yingdan!

654
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,440
Who are you?

655
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,590
I...

656
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,920
I'm Yingdan.

657
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,790
No, you're not.

658
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,030
Yingdan would never

659
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,680
ignore the cup like that.

660
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,750
Who are you?

661
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,480
Dragonfly Steps?

662
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,160
You really mastered demonic skills.

663
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,400
Who are you?

664
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,270
I'm Ma Linglan,

665
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,480
Yingdan's mother.

666
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,790
Senior!

667
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,640
I'm also the valley master here.

668
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,480
Yes, yes.

669
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,640
Senior.

670
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,790
I'm Gou Lingfeng.

671
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,200
You can just call me Gou.

672
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,240
You recognized me,

673
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,590
which means
you really care about Yingdan.

674
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,960
Yingdan said you were

675
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,510
a bit slow and dull,

676
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,160
but I don't think so.

677
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,240
You inhaled a bit of

678
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,440
our special hallucinogen.

679
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,960
A small amount

680
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,350
can cause hallucinations,

681
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,790
seeing the person

682
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,030
you think about.

683
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,550
Luckily,

684
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,200
you were thinking about Yingdan.

685
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,750
Senior.

686
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,310
Where is Yingdan?

687
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,640
I want to see her.

688
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,430
Yingdan...

689
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,270
is gone.

690
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,900
(The End of Episode 24)

691
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
I'm fine now.

692
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,240
Let's go.

693
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,150
Ling'er.

694
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,190
How are you feeling?

695
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
Heng,

696
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,200
I'll only drag your feet.

697
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,110
You should leave me behind.

698
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,310
Don't talk nonsense.

699
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,590
Ling'er.

700
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,510
How can I leave you behind?

701
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,350
Don't worry.

702
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,830
No matter what happens,

703
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,790
I'll stay by your side.

704
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,310
Heng...

705
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,910
Ling'er...

706
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,880
Aren't you worried about Yingdan?

707
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,350
How can you show affection

708
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,350
at this point?

709
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,240
Mind your own business.

710
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,480
Do you like Yingdan?

711
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,590
I'm warning you, don't talk nonsense.

712
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,160
What does it matter?

713
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,790
We all have someone we like.

714
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,310
However, she might not

715
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,880
like you back.

716
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,110
Listen,

717
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,680
my master and Yingdan

718
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,720
are a perfect couple.

719
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,110
One's born with a poison body,

720
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,680
while the other
is immune to all poisons.

721
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,510
What a pity.

722
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,240
You don't stand a chance.

723
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,200
Exactly.

724
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,790
Say that again.

725
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,550
Do you like Yingdan or not?

726
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,510
You like her,
but she might not feel the same.

727
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,510
You're right?

728
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,240
Are you happy now?

729
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,670
