00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,800
Little Stone.

2
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,910
- Little Stone!
- The poisonous kid!

3
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,270
Stand behind me!

4
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,670
Little Stone,

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,670
where are you?

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,040
Look, I brought you something tasty.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,230
Little Stone,

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,670
I also brought you
a bottle of new medicine.

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,600
Stop yelling.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,920
He won't come.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,150
A few days ago, someone took him away.

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,800
The poisonous kid has no friends now.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Her friend is gone.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,240
We won't play with you.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,920
Let's go. Don't play with her.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,840

Why did you take me here?

64
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,080
So many mosquitoes.

65
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,030
Senior.

66
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,270
Focus, okay?

67
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,190
You've been playing cool
and making money.

68
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,710
Look at your belly.

69
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,440
Your martial skills
are completely wasted.

70
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,360
The Lifetime Strike...

71
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,510
What kind of technique is it?

72
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,510
The Lifetime Strike

73
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,800
is just

74
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,150
draw the blade, swing the blade,

75
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,080
and then this.

76
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,560
- Just draw and swing?
- Yes.

77
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,080
That's why I think
I'm not my father's biological son.

78
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,360
Focus! Use your strength!

79
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,880
Why aren't you dodging?

80
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,750
There's no way to dodge it.

81
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,030
You're bleeding!

82
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,080
Are you okay?

83
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,040
I'm fine.

84
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,390
Go ahead.

85
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,360
Why do you have to do this?

86
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,280
Senior.

87
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,640
When I was a child, I only met you once,

88
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,230
but I've seen you as my idol.

89
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,390
I've trained tirelessly

90
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,960
just to become a hero like you.

91
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,390
I want to uphold justice

92
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,200
and punish the wicked.

93
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,910
Don't dwell on past glories.

94
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,830
It's all in the past.

95
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,760
Senior!

96
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,360
Come on.

97
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,830
- It's pointless.
- Come on!

98
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,270
It's all in the past!

99
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,510
What are you doing?

100
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,350
That's my Money Tree!

101
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,640
Hey, what are you doing?

102
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,510
That's my Longevity Pine!

103
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,630
How dare you tear it up?

104
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,120
Do it!

105
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,000
How dare you?

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,360
Do it!

107
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,590
Don't move!

108
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,800
That's impressive!

109
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,590
Is this the Lifetime Strike?

110
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,590
If I was slow,

111
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
I would've died.

112
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,120
Is this...

113
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,390
really the Lifetime Strike?

114
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,360
Though it's just a simple draw

115
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,280
and release,

116
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,830
after being honed by you

117
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,390
tens of thousands of times,

118
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,680
combined with your
profound internal energy

119
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,240
and agile footwork,

120
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,950
it can unleash astonishing power

121
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,880
in desperate times like this.

122
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,000
This move is truly unparalleled

123
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,270
and invincible!

124
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,520
Father.

125
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,680
I've truly mastered it.

126
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,950
Gou, you're so impressive.

127
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,760
With this Lifetime Strike,

128
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,950
I'll win the hearts of countless girls!

129
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,040
- Finally over.
- Exactly.

130
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,350
The mosquitoes are killing me.

131
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,720
Last time, we witnessed

132
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,920
a duel between Black Knight
and White Knight's disciples.

133
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,390
We've finally got the chance to witness

134
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,150
the showdown between
Crane Knight and Swallow Knight.

135
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,320
Who will be the winner?

136
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,100
(Huizhou Drill Ground)

137
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,390
It has begun!

138
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,710
Crane,

139
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,270
take this move!

140
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,760
You're still that same loser.

141
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,040
It's all my father's fault.

142
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,600
He passed down all the skills to you.

143
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,910
So, you don't deserve
to wield the Rockblade.

144
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,440
Hand it over now!

145
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,680
Sir,

146
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,800
stop using those flashy techniques.

147
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,560
Just use the Lifetime Strike!

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,200
A blade is not just a weapon,

149
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,270
but the extension of your soul.

150
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,760
Communicate with the blade
through your heart,

151
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,150
fuse with it, and dance with it,

152
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,080
and you can grasp the unity
of man and blade.

153
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,440
Drawing the blade

154
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,200
must be as natural as breathing.

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,120
This is the essence
of the Lifetime Strike.

156
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,950
So, when drawing
and releasing the blade,

157
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,760
it should be an instinct

158
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,590
instead of an imitation.

159
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,790
Life

160
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,080
time

161
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,390
Strike!

162
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,200
Lifetime Strike?

163
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,680
Didn't Swallow say this guy was useless?

164
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,870
This is impossible.

165
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,590
Master once said

166
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,120
with your personality,

167
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,440
you could never unleash the true power

168
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,040
of the Lifetime Strike.

169
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,920
Stop fighting!

170
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,360
What's wrong, Yingdan?

171
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,280
We can't let them destroy each other.

172
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,200
Are you two his reinforcements?

173
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,120
Hey, you...

174
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,920
I've always believed

175
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,800
that the Blade God is upright and just.

176
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,320
Whether as a father

177
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
or as a master,

178
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,000
he would never hand the Rockblade

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,520
to one side easily.

180
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,000
What?

181
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,870
You don't have it?

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,240
You killed my father back then.

183
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
How could he give it to me?

184
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,590
I told you I didn't kill Master.

185
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,720
A few days ago,

186
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,870
I reviewed many records

187
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,160
about the Blade God and found

188
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,360
the Divine Blade Sect

189
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,320
was the only force
rivaling the Sword Alliance.

190
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,550
With the Rockblade, the Blade God

191
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,670
could lead all blade masters

192
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,710
and intimidate the enemy.

193
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,480
Since the Blade God passed away,

194
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,110
the Divine Blade Sect has fallen.

195
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,670
The Blade God loved both of you.

196
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,870
So, the Rockblade

197
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,560
must be hidden
somewhere familiar to you.

198
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,280
Somewhere familiar...

199
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,560
Could it be my father's old home?

200
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,350
It's possible.

201
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,400
No.

202
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,920
I've been there many times

203
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,360
but never found the Rockblade.

204
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,280
Yes.

205
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,670
I've also searched it many times.

206
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,590
Swallow!

207
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,480
How could you sneak into

208
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,630
my father's old house?

209
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,520
Aren't you ashamed?

210
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,110
Don't think about fighting all the time.

211
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,950
Let her finish.

212
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,320
Now that the Rockblade is missing,

213
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,550
what's the point of

214
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,630
fighting here?

215
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,470
Floral Knight,

216
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,710
it's not that I don't trust you.

217
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,040
But you must tell me

218
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,670
where the Rockblade is.

219
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,750
How would I know?

220
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,040
Yingdan,

221
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,240
you don't know?

222
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,670
Then why are you saying all this?

223
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,590
Shut your mouth!

224
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,030
How dare you deceive me?

225
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,240
No violence!

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,160
Think carefully.

227
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,520
Do you have any special memories

228
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,280
with the Blade God?

229
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,790
Junior,

230
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,200
your figurine crafting is awful.

231
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,840
You claimed it's a model of me,

232
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,320
but it's not even one-tenth
as handsome as me.

233
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,280
This blade tassel

234
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,470
was a gift from the second lady
of the Silk Manor.

235
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,040
I must keep it safe.

236
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,550
It's been many years,

237
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,200
and Master hasn't found it.

238
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,080
From now on, we'll keep our

239
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,630
important items here, okay?

240
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,550
Okay.

241
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,630
Could it be there?

242
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,240
Hurry, let's go!

243
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,110
He can't get the Rockblade first!

244
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,870
- Why did they run?
- Follow them!

245
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,950
They're gone.

246
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,040
Yingdan.

247
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,160
Zhu...

248
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,040
Yingdan.

249
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,360
Catch up with them,

250
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
in case anything bad happens.

251
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,440
What about you?

252
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,630
Go!

253
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,550
Okay.

254
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,200
This box requires two keys to open.

255
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,630
I only have one.

256
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,040
The other key

257
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,040
must be gone.

258
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,800
You've kept it?

259
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,340
(To Crane and Swallow)

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,040
It's really here.

261
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,060
(To Crane and Swallow)

262
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,350
Destiny is always fair.

263
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,440
Crane is stubborn,

264
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,320
longing to achieve fame
in a single battle.

265
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,350
But overindulging in blade techniques
may ruin him.

266
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,240
Swallow is talented,

267
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,320
mastering all kinds of martial arts.

268
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,830
Each of you has your strengths

269
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,520
and unique abilities.

270
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,630
This box belongs to both of you.

271
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,040
If you can unlock it one day,

272
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,630
it will reveal that you,

273
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,870
though not blood-related,

274
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,590
still have an everlasting bond.

275
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,990
Cherish the brotherhood

276
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,160
and support each other.

277
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,230
If it weren't for
those years of hard training,

278
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,680
I couldn't have mastered blade skills.

279
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,040
Yet I've been blaming my father.

280
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,000
It turns out...

281
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,040
Master wanted us to be united.

282
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,320
If I had understood this earlier...

283
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,360
Zhuge.

284
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,320
Let's head back.

285
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,760
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,920
I never expected...

287
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,560
that he'd know about this place.

288
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,040
Back then,

289
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,950
did he also know about the relationship

290
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,000
between the second lady
of Silk Manor and me?

291
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,920
What did you say?

292
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,590
She was my first love!

293
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,520
Forget it.

294
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,520
It's all in the past.

295
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,510
We should move on.

296
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,430
That's right.

297
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,910
Senior Blade God

298
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,840
wanted you to work together

299
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,590
to carry on the legacy
of the Divine Blade Sect.

300
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,110
I can't believe

301
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,950
this is the truth.

302
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,800
Don't talk about these pointless things!

303
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,160
Now that the martial world has returned...

304
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,710
Sir!

305
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,350
I'm going to kill you

306
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,000
to honor and avenge

307
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,080
my father!

308
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,630
Sir, calm down!

309
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,440
Listen to me.

310
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,510
There must be some misunderstandings.

311
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,060
- Yes.
- Shut up!

312
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,800
Back then,

313
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,350
my father treated you better
than he treated me.

314
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,630
How could you bear to kill him?

315
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,320
I've told you so many times

316
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,480
I didn't kill him.

317
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,150
Then why was your blade
in my father's chest?

318
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,670
I don't know either!

319
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,830
You don't know?

320
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,230
You don't know?

321
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,870
Then why did you

322
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,200
lead a group of brothers

323
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,920
and establish the Blade Tomb

324
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,710
without any explanation?

325
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,670
Who else could it be?

326
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,750
You insisted on
accusing me of killing him.

327
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,670
Even if I tried to explain,

328
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,840
would you believe me?

329
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,630
So, who killed my father?

330
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,800
Wait a minute. Calm down.

331
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,920
Back then, you two
turned against each other,

332
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,110
and the Divine Blade Sect split in two.

333
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,910
Could it be

334
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,680
someone stirred up the conflict?

335
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,430
Yes, that... that makes sense!

336
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,320
Someone must be behind this.

337
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,840
Boss,

338
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,000
we must retrieve the Rockblade today.

339
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,150
Don't act recklessly.

340
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,080
Can't you see
our sect leader is still inside?

341
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,240
He hasn't attended
the succession ceremony,

342
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,350
right?

343
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,000
But he's inherited
all the old sect leader's skills.

344
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,590
We just need to keep an eye on
Crane and Swallow.

345
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,510
When the time is right,

346
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,150
we'll make our move.

347
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,400
Aye.

348
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,320
Let's go.

349
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,510
Go!

350
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,940
(Tiger)

351
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,880
Feng.

352
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,200
You will be the inspector
of the association.

353
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,760
(Tiger)
Tomorrow, you'll leave for Huizhou

354
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,240
and take office as soon as you can

355
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,520
to avoid any complications.

356
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,710
Aye.

357
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,080
Besides,

358
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,150
you must keep an eye on...

359
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,390
Zhu Gou Team.

360
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,960
What a name.

361
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Keep an eye on them?

362
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,960
Their influence is substantial

363
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,870
in the martial world.

364
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,390
Try to win them over,

365
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,280
so they can work for us.

366
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,710
Aye.

367
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,960
(Sky Knight, He Changzai)
Congratulations!

368
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,870
Crane Knight,

369
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,830
you've reclaimed...

370
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,430
I must change how I address you.

371
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,590
Blade God, congratulations on
reclaiming the Rockblade.

372
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,240
You're too kind.

373
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,070
Back when

374
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,870
your father was alive,

375
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,030
the Divine Blade Sect was unmatched.

376
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,150
It stood equal to the Sword Alliance.

377
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,310
With his unparalleled skills,

378
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,760
he earned the respect
of all blade masters.

379
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,590
However,

380
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,240
since he passed away,

381
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,590
the Divine Blade Sect has fallen.

382
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,830
Fortunately,

383
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,240
you've mastered

384
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,480
his ultimate skill, the Lifetime Strike,

385
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,880
and reclaimed the Rockblade.

386
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,350
You are undeniably

387
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,190
the new Blade God.

388
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,670
Keep a low profile, please.

389
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,920
Blade God,

390
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,320
the martial world is in turmoil,

391
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,590
and the demonic sect is resurging.

392
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,790
Now that you've taken over
the Divine Blade Sect,

393
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,750
you should unite all blade masters

394
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,160
and bring peace to the martial world.

395
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,520
To be honest,

396
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,900
I returned this time

397
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,200
because Chairman Wu Guangming wanted me

398
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,520
to revive the Divine Blade Sect.

399
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,640
However, they didn't know

400
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,040
that I didn't have the Rockblade.

401
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
However,

402
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,240
fate has brought it back to me.

403
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,910
It's time for
the Divine Blade Sect to thrive.

404
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,560
From now on,

405
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,920
we'll be counting on you, Blade God.

406
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,960
I'm so flattered.

407
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,400
By the way, He,

408
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,320
there's one more thing.

409
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,430
This time, I couldn't have
reclaimed the Rockblade

410
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,480
without Gou Lingfeng's help.

411
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,350
I wonder, for my sake, if you could

412
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,870
erase his offense records.

413
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,830
It's not a big deal.

414
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,240
But after all,
the demonic sect is involved.

415
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,110
I have to report to Chairman Wu first.

416
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,240
Rest assured,

417
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,550
there won't be

418
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,750
any problems from me.

419
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,880
I won't give him a hard time.

420
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,030
I promise

421
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,430
I'll do you this favor.

422
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,150
Thanks, He.

423
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,560
No need to be polite.

424
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,640
Here, put it down.

425
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,560
Okay.

426
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,160
Yingdan,

427
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,510
what did you make?

428
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,400
Wonton Noodles?

429
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,670
It's my favorite!

430
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,880
Enough.

431
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,630
Wake Zhuge Heng up.

432
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,480
Zhuge?

433
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,480
Is Zhuge back?

434
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
Zhuge is back?

435
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,020
- Brat, you're back.
- What are you doing?

436
00:20:59,030 --> 00:20:59,920
Get down!

437
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,860
- I won't!
- You're so heavy!

438
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,110
I knew you weren't mad at me.

439
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,280
Get down! Get off me!

440
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,120
Did you rinse your mouth? It stinks.

441
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,430
Then enjoy it.

442
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,870
Get down! Get off me!

443
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,560
- I love wontons!
- No!

444
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,000
- I'll eat your wontons!
- Enough.

445
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,920
It's spilled.

446
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,400
Did you wash your hands?

447
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,320
I did.

448
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:18,790
I'll have some noodles.

449
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,710
No!

450
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:20,980
Enough.

451
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,040
Look at you.

452
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,550
When you're on the outs,

453
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,590
you don't say a single word.

454
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
When things are good,
you're inseparable.

455
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,350
Who's inseparable with him?

456
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,430
Enough.

457
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,110
I... I apologize.

458
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,160
It's my bad.

459
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,320
I don't want it.

460
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,750
Enough.

461
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,000
I haven't seen Crane Knight for days.

462
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,840
Where has he been?

463
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,280
He's working with Swallow Knight
to revive the Divine Blade Sect.

464
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,720
They're so interesting.

465
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,680
After years of fighting,

466
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,080
they suddenly made up.

467
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,480
Heng and Gou, you're just like them.

468
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,760
- Who's like them?
- Who's like them?

469
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,910
Looks like everyone is here.

470
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,080
He Changzai.

471
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,480
Are you here to arrest him?

472
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
I didn't escape on my own.

473
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,190
Don't try to frame me.

474
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,960
Gou,

475
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,070
Crane Knight

476
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,240
already pleaded for you.

477
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,080
I must respect him.

478
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,070
However,

479
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,400
after all, the demonic sect is involved.

480
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,190
If you wander around like this,

481
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,000
people will criticize you.

482
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,520
How about this?

483
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,070
Go back and stay for a few days.

484
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,200
- It won't be long.
- You...

485
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,960
I'll report to the chairman immediately.

486
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,120
What do you think?

487
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,920
Okay, as long as it clears my name,

488
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,960
I'll do whatever it takes.

489
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,910
Master!

490
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,880
It's okay.

491
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,080
Don't worry about me.

492
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,750
The truth will be clear very soon,

493
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,280
and I won't give Gou a hard time.

494
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,240
Mr. Zhuge, Floral Knight, please

495
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,880
go back to the association with me.

496
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,280
I need to announce something important.

497
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,640
(Martial Artists Association)
I want to

498
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,910
announce something today.

499
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,130
Recently, a lot has happened

500
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,590
in the association.

501
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,280
I've been thinking about it for a while,

502
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,870
and I believe

503
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,510
that we should create a new position

504
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,280
to oversee all internal matters.

505
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,920
He gathered everyone here

506
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,240
just for this?

507
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,000
Yingdan,

508
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,910
do you think he'll stop
targeting my master?

509
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,830
Given his attitude,

510
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,720
I don't think so.

511
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,520
Actually,

512
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,720
I already have someone in mind.

513
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,720
In many past events,

514
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,960
three heroes

515
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,270
of the association...

516
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,430
No need.

517
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,350
Long time no see.

518
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,160
Mr. Deng,

519
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,280
when did you come back?

520
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,550
Here's the court's order.

521
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,480
From now on,

522
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,550
Deng Yunfeng will be
the chief warden of PSD

523
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,350
as well as the inspector
of Martial Artists Association.

524
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,000
- What?
- He works for the court!

525
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,590
Exactly. How could he...

526
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,080
You have an imperial edict.

527
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,270
Mr. Deng,

528
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,640
the association and the magistrate's office

529
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,870
have always operated independently.

530
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,870
Though we're affiliated to the court,

531
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,760
and there are times we work together,

532
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,040
Mr. Deng, you're not even a hero.

533
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,550
Isn't it inappropriate for you

534
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,590
to meddle in

535
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,760
our business?

536
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,480
What makes you think

537
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,320
(Tiger)
I lack the authority?

538
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,960
Tiger-rank hero?

539
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,910
Tiger-rank Token.

540
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,080
Is it fake?

541
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,140
(Tiger)

542
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,700
(Righteous and Mighty)

543
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,110
Tiger-rank Hero Certification

544
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,480
must be approved by the chairman.

545
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,670
How can it be fake?

546
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,800
I've always been
a member of the association.

547
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,630
It's just that for years,

548
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,630
I've been serving the court.

549
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,240
Recently, many things
have happened in the association.

550
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,720
And the court is paying attention.

551
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,680
So, I'm here to inspect
the internal affairs

552
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,160
and ensure its integrity.

553
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,080
Do you

554
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,560
have a problem?

555
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,670
It's starting to rain.

556
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,720
The clothes are almost dry.

557
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,830
We'll collect the herbs.

558
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
We should go.

559
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,110
Let's go.

560
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,480
I'm talking to you!

561
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,960
Stop, all of you!

562
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Gou.

563
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,990
Senior?

564
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,590
I'm here to save you.

565
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,790
No, Senior, really no need.

566
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,480
I tried so hard to get back.

567
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
Besides,

568
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,280
I'm doing fine here.

569
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,040
No way.

570
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,520
I must save you!

571
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,280
Hey, you...

572
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,630
Junior, you're also here.

573
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,760
Senior, what are you doing here?

574
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,270
With all the noise,
what if they find out?

575
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,750
Relax, there's just one guard.

576
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,800
I've knocked him out.

577
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,520
Why are you

578
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,350
both so reckless?

579
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,040
Oh, no.

580
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,320
I'm doomed this time.

581
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,840
Mr. Gou,

582
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,310
we both owe you a favor.

583
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,750
I can't bear to see you suffer.

584
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,240
I must get you out of here.

585
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,320
- Let's go.
- I won't go!

586
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,070
- No matter what,
- Go!

587
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,160
I won't go.

588
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,800
- No, I won't go!
- Mr. Gou, let's go!

589
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,000
- I won't go!
- Enough.

590
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,320
I won't go.

591
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,080
It doesn't matter.

592
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,430
I'll head to the Imperial City

593
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,870
to ask the chairman

594
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,000
to release Gou.

595
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
I'll also tell him about
the Divine Blade Sect.

596
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,430
Senior,

597
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,110
come with me.

598
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,870
I'm sure the chairman will like you.

599
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,070
We'll work together

600
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,630
to restore the honor of our sect!

601
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,120
Junior.

602
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,750
Senior.

603
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,760
Are you really leaving?

604
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,080
Are you really not going to save me?

605
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,240
At least talk with me for a while.

606
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,480
I can't believe it.

607
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,700
(Tianluo Prison)

608
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,760
I knew you'd come.

609
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,270
Swallow,

610
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,350
don't let them fool you.

611
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,160
Get the Rockblade
and complete your mission.

612
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,190
You nasty rascal!

613
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,190
You fooled me!

614
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,910
You only want the blade.

615
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,870
How dare you come here?

616
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,750
Today, Swallow and I will show you

617
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,350
the true power of the Divine Blade Sect.

618
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,870
Ridiculous.

619
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,270
Look how fat you are.

620
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,760
The Divine Blade Sect
is not what it used to be.

621
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,280
None of you

622
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,040
deserve to wield the Rockblade.

623
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,630
If you're smart,

624
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,190
give it to me now,

625
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,760
and I'll spare your lives.

626
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,560
Mr. Dao,

627
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,350
you deceived me!

628
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,960
I'll kill you!

629
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,830
Is someone fighting?

630
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Crane Knight?

631
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,960
Want to lure me out?

632
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,430
Stop dreaming.

633
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,040
Before you die,

634
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,630
I'll tell you a secret.

635
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,350
I was the one who killed the Blade God.

636
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,040
Go to hell!

637
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,590
Lifetime Strike!

638
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,870
Senior!

639
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,350
Senior!

640
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,630
Senior!

641
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,920
Senior!

642
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,080
Hang in there!

643
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,190
Senior!

644
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Junior...

645
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,870
It was him.

646
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,910
It was him.

647
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,720
He killed Master!

648
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,480
Senior,

649
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,670
don't speak.

650
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,150
Let's see a doctor.

651
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,590
There's no point.

652
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,760
I've committed great sins.

653
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,350
I let Master down,

654
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,760
and I failed...

655
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,600
Senior...

656
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,110
It's really a pity

657
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,760
that we can't revive

658
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,040
the Divine Blade Sect together.

659
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,560
No… Senior!

660
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,870
No, Senior!

661
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,190
You can't leave me!

662
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,560
Senior!

663
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,240
Senior!

664
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,630
Back then,

665
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,040
the second lady of the Silk Manor and I

666
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,560
really loved each other.

667
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,670
I know.

668
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,150
I know...

669
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,430
Senior.

670
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,080
Senior...

671
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,320
Stop talking.

672
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,150
I don't want to see you suffer.

673
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,560
Over the years,

674
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,630
I've been blinded by hatred

675
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,800
and missed too much.

676
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,080
If I have a second chance,

677
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,110
I will definitely find the second lady.

678
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,360
Junior.

679
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,110
Don't try to steal her from me.

680
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,080
Senior.

681
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,350
Are you deceiving me?

682
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,240
Don't set me up like this!

683
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,680
It's not too late to see a doctor!

684
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,240
- Let's go!
- Don't worry.

685
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,040
After all,

686
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,430
I'm the Blade God's disciple.

687
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,430
How could that rascal kill me so easily?

688
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,390
It's you.

689
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,760
Leader!

690
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,510
Who's your leader?

691
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,080
Stop talking nonsense.

692
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,190
Leader.

693
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,310
Kill Crane Knight

694
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,510
and take the Rockblade,

695
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,480
and we'll be able to
revitalize the divine sect!

696
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,590
I've told you a million times

697
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,040
I'm not the sect leader!

698
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,110
I'm Gou Lingfeng, an Ox-rank hero
of the Martial Artists

699
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,030
Association!

700
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,030
Lingfeng,

701
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,200
he killed my father

702
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,480
and injured Swallow.

703
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,320
Did you kill the Blade God?

704
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,200
Did you turn Crane and Swallow
against each other

705
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,520
and try to use the Blade Tomb
to revitalize the demonic sect?

706
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,480
Do you really

707
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,630
want to let Gui Lao down?

708
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,480
Who cares about that old man?

709
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,760
He screwed me over.

710
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,520
If that old man weren't

711
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,270
too hesitant

712
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,720
to achieve anything great,

713
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:43,550
why would I need to use the Blade Tomb
to revitalize the divine sect?

714
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,040
Shut your mouth.

715
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,040
Surrender now.

716
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,720
Gou Lingfeng!

717
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,350
Your martial skills...

718
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,350
You're clearing using

719
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,160
demonic skills!

720
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,190
What are you doing?

721
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,150
I'm doing what a hero should do.

722
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,470
Stop!

723
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,840
Lingfeng!

724
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,590
Zhuge, Ying Dan?

725
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,510
Lingfeng!

726
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,870
Are you alright?

727
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,320
I'm fine, Yingdan.

728
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,480
But they're not okay.

729
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,420
(Martial Artists Association)

730
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,360
Gou Lingfeng.

731
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,710
You protected the Blade God

732
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,440
and captured Mr. Dao
from the demonic sect.

733
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,030
As the vice chairman, I've decided

734
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,030
to free you from imprisonment.

735
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,360
Your sins are cleansed.

736
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,630
I'm free!

737
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,190
I'll report this
to Chairman Wu Guangming.

738
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,310
You're still an Ox-rank hero

739
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,560
of the association.

740
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,190
Here's Eunuch Deng's decree.

741
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,670
Gou Lingfeng's identity
has been verified,

742
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,440
not a demonic sect member.

743
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,880
That's obvious.

744
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,670
A few days ago,

745
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,190
I visited my godfather.

746
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,760
He said there have been

747
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,110
other heroes that can use

748
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,590
demonic skills.

749
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,110
As long as you're a good man

750
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,030
and stop using them,

751
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,000
you'll be forgiven.

752
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,840
Deng Yunfeng,

753
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,080
who do you think you are?

754
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,320
Our chairman is Wu Guangming,

755
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,710
the Radiant Knight.

756
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,480
Who are you

757
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,590
to meddle in our business?

758
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,550
The association
is affiliated to the court,

759
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,630
and I'm the inspector now.

760
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,920
Do you have a problem?

761
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,400
Why did Dull-face Feng

762
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
come to the association as an inspector?

763
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,630
I've told you

764
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,190
he'd definitely take action

765
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,190
after this trip.

766
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,680
You two...

767
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,960
From now on,

768
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,880
we won't have peaceful days anymore.

769
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
So what?

770
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,400
Have we ever had peaceful days?

771
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,480
But I've got this feeling

772
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,400
that he's different

773
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,000
after this trip.

774
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,070
I'm sure

775
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,630
he's up to no good.

776
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,360
Yingdan.

777
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,360
My hand is injured.

778
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,360
Injured?

779
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,150
Injured!

780
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,190
Let me see. Come on.

781
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,710
Let me blow on it.

782
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,240
Does it still hurt?

783
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,660
(The End of Episode 14)

784
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,230
Stop waiting.

785
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,520
It's time to leave.

786
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,280
Sir, can I say goodbye to my friend?

787
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,790
My only friend.

788
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,790
You should call me Godfather.

789
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,000
Remember,

790
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,440
when you grow up and gain power,

791
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,590
you'll have a lot of friends.
