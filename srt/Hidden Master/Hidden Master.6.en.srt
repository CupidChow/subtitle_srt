that I...

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,800
didn't conspire with the demonic sect?

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,680
Save these words for the king of hell.

We were ordered to take your life!

Your so-called justice

is so ridiculous!

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,520

58
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,710
Zhen.

59
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,510
Is it you?

60
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,510
You're asking the wrong person.

61
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,600
This kind of mask

62
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,950
was made by Wang Mang in the west.

63
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,640
It's rare to see.

64
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,760
You once said

65
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,920
you must learn this skill.

66
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,160
I remember you said

67
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,270
you'd use golden threads

68
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,320
to carve the patterns,

69
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,200
so the face

70
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,080
would be resilient.

71
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,830
You also said

72
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,670
when you learned it,

73
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,830
you'd make masks

74
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,550
for me and my father.

75
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,440
Senior.

76
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,390
Long time no see.

77
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,390
Zhen...

78
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,800
All these years,

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,440
where have you been?

80
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,830
Tell me,

81
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,510
did you really steal

82
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,590
the luminous pearl?

83
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,710
You're so foolish!

84
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,720
If you asked me for it,

85
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,320
would I refuse you?

86
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Who was I to ask for it?

87
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,950
Your junior fell off a cliff and died

88
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,800
in that ambush years ago.

89
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,390
Now, I'm just a father.

90
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,830
Only this medicine can save my daughter.

91
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,200
Back then, I was hunted
by the Martial Artists Association

92
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,680
and fell off a cliff.

93
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,950
Perhaps god had mercy on me,

94
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,080
granting me a new life.

95
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,590
After that,

96
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,240
I started to make masks with dead bodies

97
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,710
to deceive for money.

98
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,510
However, one day,

99
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,440
I met Ling'er,

100
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,950
and everything changed.

101
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,240
Dad.

102
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,120
Dad.

103
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,710
She lit up my world like a ray of light.

104
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,120
- At that moment...
- Dad.

105
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,510
You must be tired. Have some water.

106
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,310
I decided not to leave her alone.

107
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,240
Thank you, Ling'er.

108
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,680
I want to give her
a happy and peaceful life.

109
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,080
I will be a good man.

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,680
Sir,

111
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,600
you...

112
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,680
Junior,

113
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
you...

114
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,640
Why do you have to do this?

115
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,150
This medicine can save Ling'er.

116
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,830
Luckily, I got the luminous pearl.

117
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,640
Once she takes it,

118
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,510
I'll accept any punishment.

119
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,830
Mr. Zhuge,

120
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,590
I only have one request.

121
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,350
Please protect Ling'er.

122
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,830
Don't let her know about this.

123
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,230
Promise me.

124
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,120
Mr. Deng,

125
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,320
wait a minute.

126
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,960
Mr. He.

127
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,920
What a coincidence.

128
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,840
What's the matter?

129
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,000
We've been hunting Puppet Knight
for many years.

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,270
Don't you think

131
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,440
our association should take the credit?

132
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,070
The court also wants Puppet Knight.

133
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,680
Let's see who catches him first.

134
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,110
Come here.

135
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,310
What do you need, Mr. He?

136
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,440
Since Deng Yunfeng and his men
are so eager to catch him,

137
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,190
we'll station our people

138
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,760
at all key spots.

139
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,350
Let's play the waiting game

140
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,320
and let them do all the work.

141
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,150
Wise!

142
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,910
I'm afraid I can't escape this time.

143
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,270
I've been wandering
with Ling'er for years.

144
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,930
I won't survive this time.

145
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,510
Back then,

146
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,350
did you really collude
with the demonic sect?

147
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,870
The world isn't as simple as you think,

148
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,270
not just black and white.

149
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,760
That matter was really complicated.

150
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,000
Did you or didn't you?

151
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,480
I did.

152
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,310
I just helped a desperate hypocrite.

153
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,280
But even so...

154
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,680
I deserve to die.

155
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,880
But Ling'er is innocent.

156
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,830
You should leave.

157
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,560
Please take care of Ling'er.

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,920
Sir.

159
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,030
Ling'er needs her father.

160
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,950
How is she, Sir?

161
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,160
With this medicine,

162
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,760
Ling'er should be fine.

163
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,990
That's great.

164
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,720
Sir,

165
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,990
who's more handsome, me or you?

166
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,640
Mr. Gou, hand me over

167
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,750
to the Martial Artists Association.

168
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,800
But one thing has to be clear.

169
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,870
I'm more handsome.

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
How can you say that? I'll...

171
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,120
Master,

172
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,160
he's not an evil person.

173
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,440
He did all this

174
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,560
for Ling'er.

175
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,440
Don't you remember

176
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,280
how others misunderstood you?

177
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,750
Because of your face, they thought

178
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,750
you worked for the demonic sect.

179
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,200
You know what it feels like.

180
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,120
Enough.

181
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,470
Sir,

182
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,630
don't die.

183
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,120
Take care of Ling'er.

184
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,040
She needs her father.

185
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,120
That's right.

186
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,620
So cool.

187
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,880
However,

188
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,560
you must admit I'm more handsome.

189
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,620
Are you really planning to save me?

190
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,630
I've made up my mind.

191
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,280
I don't know about the past

192
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,400
or the rules of

193
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,680
the association.

194
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,030
But you saved Ling'er

195
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,550
without hurting anyone,

196
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,830
so I will save you.

197
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,360
You don't understand

198
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,080
what you're up against.

199
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,790
Well, I have to

200
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,950
help you this time.

201
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,750
If Scholar Jia were alive,

202
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,560
he would save you too.

203
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,590
Maybe he's not handsome,

204
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,920
but he's a good person.

205
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,820
(Wine)

206
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,040
Puppet Knight,

207
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,590
you're surrounded.

208
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,110
You can't escape.

209
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,240
Surrender now.

210
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,200
Mr. Zhuge,

211
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,270
take care of Ling'er!

212
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,800
Okay, what about you?

213
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,030
Mr. Gou and I will distract them.

214
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,600
Leave with Ling'er
through the back door.

215
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,200
We'll meet in the alley.

216
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,280
Okay.

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,280
Are you scared, Zhuge?

218
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,960
Why would I?

219
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,920
I think your situation
is more dangerous.

220
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,680
My good disciple.

221
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,360
Sir,

222
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,400
do you remember

223
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,440
the phrase you often say?

224
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,910
Always carry a mask?

225
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,830
Yes.

226
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,920
I'm a bit scared now.

227
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,950
Why did you make a mask of my face?

228
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,000
Zhuge,

229
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,230
today, I'll let you be

230
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
the great hero.

231
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,680
That's so kind of you.

232
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,120
Mr. Zhuge.

233
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,200
Today,

234
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,590
I'll also let you be the great hero.

235
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,200
Wait, why do you also have this?

236
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,830
Are you ready?

237
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,040
Yes.

238
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,230
No!

239
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,680
Two Zhuge Heng?

240
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,800
It's a mask.

241
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,830
Go get them!

242
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,640
What are you doing?

243
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,040
Zhuge.

244
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,470
Yingdan.

245
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,160
Did you do this?

246
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,600
What are you doing?

247
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,560
Yingdan,

248
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,120
please help my master!

249
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,030
Deng Yunfeng is catching them
at the salon.

250
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,280
Why should I help you?

251
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,670
My master can't use demonic skills.

252
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,080
We see you as a friend.

253
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,030
Please help him.

254
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,150
Who's your friend?

255
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,440
You've violated the rules, understand?

256
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,800
It's not for us.

257
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,920
Puppet Knight

258
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,680
is Ling'er's father.

259
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,280
Sir!

260
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,190
Your face!

261
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,110
Play tricks with me?

262
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,040
I knew it was you.

263
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,230
That guy is Gou Lingfeng, right?

264
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,920
I'm your grandpa.

265
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,630
Sir,

266
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,630
you go first.

267
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,320
I'll handle it.

268
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,550
I don't believe

269
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,910
everyone only cares about appearance.

270
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,040
Is there no justice at all?

271
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,150
Hurry up and leave!

272
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,680
Ling'er is waiting for you.

273
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,000
Thanks.

274
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,560
- Move aside.
- No way.

275
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,950
How dare you shield Puppet Knight?

276
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,150
What are you talking about?

277
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,870
I'm standing right here.

278
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,000
Why don't you

279
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,630
try to pass me?

280
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,150
That's exactly what I want.

281
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,240
Take another route!

282
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,790
Head out of the city!

283
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,710
Aye!

284
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,520
I'll take care of you.

285
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,240
You don't fight back?

286
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,750
I've tempered my body.

287
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,440
Why don't you use demonic skills?

288
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,870
This slash

289
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,990
will kill you.

290
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,470
Ma Yingdan?

291
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,640
Yingdan?

292
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,320
Deng Yunfeng, what are you doing?

293
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,590
Do you want to be our enemy?

294
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,040
You know how important he is to me.

295
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,670
Your hand...

296
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,470
Do you have to do this?

297
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,440
(Demon Body-Tempering Method)

298
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,870
(Demonic Body Tempering)

299
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,520
Was I

300
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,800
wrong about it?

301
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,630
If you knew

302
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,720
I'd stop before

303
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,800
it reached your heart,

304
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,950
I'd admire your patience.

305
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,680
This time,

306
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,470
I lost.

307
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,080
Are you a psycho?

308
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,830
You didn't have mercy,

309
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,230
so I won't have mercy next time.

310
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,520
Okay.

311
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,920
You'll be punished.

312
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,320
As a Chou-rank hero,

313
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,470
you have nothing to lose.

314
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,270
It's Ox Rank.

315
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,190
Enough.

316
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,870
I can't leave now.

317
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,160
What are you going to do?

318
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,110
I promised I wouldn't

319
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,590
let Ling'er lose her father.

320
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,430
Take it.

321
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,000
It can stop the bleeding.

322
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,630
You must save yourself

323
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,710
before saving others.

324
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,890
Your hand...

325
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,770
Don't worry about me.

326
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,920
Where are they?

327
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,920
Come with me.

328
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,000
Where's my father?

329
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,960
Don't worry, Ling'er.

330
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,870
We'll meet him very soon.

331
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,870
Ling'er...

332
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,800
Ling'er...

333
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
Sir!

334
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,080
You...

335
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,240
Mr. Gou...

336
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,150
Help...

337
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,440
- Help...
- Ling'er is coming.

338
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,310
Gou Lingfeng,

339
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,680
help him put on the mask.

340
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,280
Ling'er.

341
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,920
Get off me!

342
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,630
Let me go!

343
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,920
Let me go!

344
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,670
- Sir!
- Dad!

345
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:17,990
Dad!

346
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,350
- Dad!
- Sir!

347
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,720
Mr. Zhuge and Mr. Gou are good people.

348
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,390
They'll take care of you.

349
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,240
I don't want to go with them.

350
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,160
Dad.

351
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,680
I'll eat well.

352
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,000
I'll keep drawing.

353
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,640
I don't want to go with them, Dad!

354
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,590
Don't leave me, Dad!

355
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
I won't leave you alone.

356
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,960
Let's go!

357
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,310
- Catch Puppet Knight.
- Aye!

358
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,230
Don't you dare move!

359
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,800
Are you defying the government?

360
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,870
The Jia Mansion case is solved.

361
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,280
Puppet Knight stole the pearl.

362
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,110
I must take him back.

363
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,960
You can't take him away!

364
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,210
- You...
- Yes.

365
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,110
It's us.

366
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,120
Good.

367
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,470
Great.

368
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,080
If that's the case,

369
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,830
let's settle it with martial arts!

370
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,320
Dad!

371
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,750
Dad!

372
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,880
Dad!

373
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,230
Dad!

374
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,360
Dad!

375
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,840
Dad!

376
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,550
- Sir!
- Dad!

377
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,470
Sir!

378
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,080
He Changzai!

379
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,080
He Changzai,

380
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,190
why did you kill him?

381
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,430
You know his connections
with the demonic sect!

382
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,880
Mr. Deng,

383
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,960
this is our internal affair.

384
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,240
It's none of your business.

385
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,640
Let's go.

386
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,790
Let's go.

387
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,710
Dad...

388
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,630
Please take care of Ling'er.

389
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,830
Dad,

390
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,000
you promised

391
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,640
not to leave me alone!

392
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,510
- How can you leave me?
- Sir.

393
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,520
Dad!

394
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,430
Dad!

395
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,830
Dad!

396
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,910
Dad!

397
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,000
Dad!

398
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,830
Dad!

399
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,200
Dad!

400
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,110
Wake up!

401
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,480
Don't leave me!

402
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,560
Dad, please wake up!

403
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,560
Dad!

404
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,560
Life is complicated.

405
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,670
- That's true.
- Dad...

406
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Dad...

407
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,440
Why did He Changzai have to kill him

408
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,430
without reason?

409
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,000
He's clearly turned over a new leaf.

410
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,000
He even encouraged me

411
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,590
to face myself bravely.

412
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,870
This is the martial world.

413
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,830
It's not what I expected.

414
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,950
Dad...

415
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,320
Although

416
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,960
they're more good-looking

417
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,080
than him and me,

418
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,030
they're all pretentious

419
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,480
and ruthless.

420
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,320
They're the ones who wear masks.

421
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,400
Sir,

422
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,080
I understand now.

423
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,040
Appearance is important,

424
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,040
but more importantly,

425
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,800
we must remain true
to our original aspiration.

426
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,140
(Martial Artists Association)

427
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,240
Ma Yingdan,

428
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
as a Tiger-rank hero,

429
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,790
you violated our rules and tried

430
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,640
to stop the officials.

431
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,480
The government is... Shut up!

432
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,390
Shut up...

433
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,200
So, we've decided

434
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,160
to punish you.

435
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,790
- Any objections?
- I have.

436
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,830
What's your objection?

437
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,800
Why can't I disagree?

438
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,830
I deserve to be punished.

439
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,750
I will accept it.

440
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,670
You...

441
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,400
So...

442
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,070
Sky Knight, you're so powerful.

443
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,350
You're the big boss!

444
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,560
Mr. Zhuge,

445
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,510
this flower is innocent.

446
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,440
Besides, Puppet Knight

447
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
was a thief, and he colluded

448
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,160
- He's doing it again.
- with the demonic sect.

449
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,880
He had it coming.

450
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,000
As a hero, you shouldn't be

451
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,080
blinded by emotions.

452
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,380
This means nothing to me!

453
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,340
(Tiger)

454
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,560
Thank you, Sir.

455
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,910
Don't be so polite.

456
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,880
We're friends, right?

457
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,390
Stop calling me that.

458
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,630
Just call me

459
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,320
Heng.

460
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,480
Heng.

461
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,400
Come on.

462
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,390
Don't be so polite.

463
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,350
Make yourself at home.

464
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,720
I can't.

465
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,800
Why not?

466
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,320
We have many rooms.

467
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,360
Don't worry.

468
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,430
We'll

469
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,430
take care of you.

470
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,520
Yingdan, are you also moving in?

471
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,190
I'll move in

472
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,070
to take care of Ling'er.

473
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,670
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

474
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,510
Isn't it a good thing?

475
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,440
It is.

476
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,000
You don't need to bring me meals.

477
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,550
And you'll have

478
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,760
more time

479
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,430
to take on tasks.

480
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,960
Yingdan, I can't get any tasks now.

481
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,030
I have some tasks. Are you interested?

482
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,950
Yes!

483
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,870
Yingdan, I'll be at your service.

484
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,600
Come with me.

485
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,590
Kind lady, please help us.

486
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,350
Could you spare us some money?

487
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,710
Here.

488
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,990
Take this.

489
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,200
- Thank you, kind lady.
- Thank you, kind lady.

490
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,720
She's so kind.

491
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,590
She gives us money
every time she sees us.

492
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,000
She even gave me a roast chicken once.

493
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,960
Yes, she's very kind.

494
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,880
Be good.

495
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,310
Look, we have money now.

496
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,000
We can buy some buns.

497
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,560
Let's get some buns!

498
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,020
(Osmanthus Cake)

499
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,350
You're really troublesome.

500
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,560
You took forever in the toilet.

501
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,160
Here.

502
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,320
What is it?

503
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,000
I passed an osmanthus cake shop,

504
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,200
and it smelled good,

505
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,590
so I bought you some.

506
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,880
I don't want it.

507
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,550
Fine, it doesn't matter.

508
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,830
But don't be so rude.

509
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,070
Did you wash your hands?

510
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,000
No, I didn't.

511
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,720
Don't be so picky.

512
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,800
Just take it.

513
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,480
Why did you bring me here?

514
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,320
For a task.

515
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,150
For this?

516
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,110
Is this the task?

517
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,910
Heroes have ranks,

518
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,720
so do tasks.

519
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,910
As a Chou-rank hero,
what else do you want?

520
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,030
Will you do it?

521
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,950
Okay.

522
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,120
That was fast.

523
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,590
Did you use demonic skills?

524
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,080
You promised to keep the secret.

525
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,720
I had a great time.

526
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,760
I couldn't get tasks without you.

527
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,270
Though this is an easy task,

528
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,400
I'm really happy.

529
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,920
Feel like I've done
some meaningful things.

530
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,840
We're good...

531
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,430
colleagues.

532
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,710
Don't be so polite.

533
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,190
Yingdan.

534
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,760
It's good for you
to stay at Zhuge's place.

535
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,440
Why?

536
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,160
Spending a day with you,

537
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,590
I feel my poison

538
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,000
is much relieved.

539
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,920
Poison?

540
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,510
The one that makes my face blush
and my heart race

541
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,480
when I see you.

542
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,400
- And sweating...
- Stop.

543
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,440
I'm moving in tomorrow.

544
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,360
Yingdan.

545
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,390
Osmanthus cake.

546
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,080
See you tomorrow.

547
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,720
What an idiot.

548
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,070
- What are you practicing?
- Nothing.

549
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,480
Help me serve the food.

550
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,400
Coming.

551
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,750
Master,

552
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,480
were you fooled by Ma Yingdan again?

553
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,800
The association manages heroes.

554
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,310
Climbing tree for a shuttlecock

555
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,760
or saving cats and dogs

556
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,960
are not our tasks.

557
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,080
She's a bad person.

558
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,760
Don't you agree, Ling'er?

559
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,160
I don't think she'd

560
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,590
fool you, right?

561
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,430
Master,

562
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,110
Ma Yingdan is moving in.

563
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,240
You need to be careful.

564
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,160
Maybe she'll sneak into

565
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,310
your room again

566
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,800
and do improper things.

567
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,830
I don't think she'd do that.

568
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,680
You didn't see that.

569
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,750
It was terrifying.

570
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,670
Oh no,

571
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,830
I was careless.

572
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,960
I forgot about that.

573
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,630
Are you saying bad things about me?

574
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,800
You're a liar.

575
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,830
Those tasks you took me on

576
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,310
weren't from our association,

577
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,230
were they?

578
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,640
Smells good.

579
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,520
Answer me!

580
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,960
- Wait, I...
- Move.

581
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,320
Oh.

582
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,290
Oh?

583
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,350
How can you say that?

584
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,110
I hate when people say that to me.

585
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,670
Oh.

586
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,110
Mr. Deng,

587
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,480
what are you doing here?

588
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,430
Floral Knight is moving today.

589
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,550
I'm here to see if I can help.

590
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,030
You can help by staying away.

591
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,000
Please.

592
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,710
Enough.

593
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,280
Deng Yunfeng is here today

594
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,390
for something important.

595
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,270
Recently,

596
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,880
there have been
some strange poison cases

597
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,150
in Huizhou City.

598
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,750
If you don't want to die,

599
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,160
let me check every meal

600
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,520
before you eat

601
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,960
to prevent poisoning.

602
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,430
I think I'm poisoned.

603
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,880
My face is blushing,

604
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,110
and my heart is racing.

605
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,030
Master, Master.

606
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,720
Could it be the work of

607
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,320
the demonic sect's pill hall?

608
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,630
They're experts in poison.

609
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,230
Very likely.

610
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,320
We must remain vigilant.

611
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,680
Yingdan,

612
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,240
I'm glad you're here.

613
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,760
You can help me with my poison.

614
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,360
Just stop talking.

615
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,800
Well, Heng...

616
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,770
Well,

617
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,110
you call Mr. Gou Master,

618
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,550
so is his martial arts

619
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,110
better than yours?

620
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,080
Zhuge,

621
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
you're always

622
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,310
talking about revenge.

623
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,230
Who's your enemy?

624
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,480
None of your business.

625
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,960
With your skills,

626
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,280
revenge shouldn't be hard.

627
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,520
You don't understand.

628
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,150
That old scoundrel

629
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,190
is an unmatched master.

630
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,350
Only with that move,

631
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,390
the demon... the sword technique
that projects the moon

632
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,150
into the sword aura,

633
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,000
can I defeat him.

634
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,790
It's not that complicated.

635
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,080
Tell me who he is.

636
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,870
I'll help you get revenge tomorrow.

637
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,350
Even Zhuge Heng can't defeat him.

638
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,720
As a Chou-rank hero,

639
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,590
you're quite arrogant.

640
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,670
I can hire someone.

641
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,560
I have money.

642
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,670
Enough. I lost my appetite.

643
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,480
Ling'er, take me to my room.

644
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Okay, Yingdan.

645
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,830
- Yingdan.
- Listen,

646
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,080
Gou has been
tidying up the room all day.

647
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,320
I won't go to your room tonight.

648
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,800
Floral Knight, please wait.

649
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,120
He Changzai.

650
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,870
What do you mean?

651
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,960
Mr. Deng, you're also here.

652
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,350
You must know

653
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,480
the recent poison case

654
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,480
is getting worse.

655
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,910
Why not investigate?

656
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,390
Why are you here?

657
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,630
Floral Knight,

658
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,040
where were you last night?

659
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,590
At home.

660
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,510
Which home?

661
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,120
What do you mean?

662
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,430
Literal meaning.

663
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,630
A few days ago, the vice...

664
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,630
the demonic remnant's stuff was stolen.

665
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,130
And it wasn't some elixir

666
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,300
but poison.

667
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,050
Poison...

668
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,310
And among the heroes,

669
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,350
only you

670
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,440
know his daily activities so well.

671
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,880
And only you

672
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,350
became so emotional after his death.

673
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,430
Did you get your revenge?

674
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,200
Except you,

675
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,480
who else can poison

676
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,960
so many people?

677
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,080
But she's been with us.

678
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,480
A while ago,

679
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,480
we found this in her

680
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,080
pill room.

681
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,920
It was the stolen poison

682
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,400
of the demonic remnant.

683
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,320
Floral Knight, tell me,

684
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,080
if it wasn't you,

685
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,760
who else

686
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,350
could it be?

687
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,270
Mr. He,

688
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,000
since the vice chairman died,

689
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,350
you've been guarding the room.

690
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,280
I've never been there.

691
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,870
He Changzai,

692
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,790
today, Floral Knight and I

693
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,590
investigated the poison case.

694
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,110
And we think

695
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,070
it was the pill hall
of the demonic sect.

696
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,630
That's just your side of the story.

697
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,190
Mr. He.

698
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,240
He who has a mind to beat his dog

699
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,830
will easily find his stick.

700
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,750
I know

701
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,630
you all have issues with me.

702
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,670
If that's the case,

703
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,080
Mr. He...

704
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,400
Listen, Floral Knight,

705
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,280
I always act impartially.

706
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,000
Why would I be biased?

707
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,800
- Take her.
- Stop.

708
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,480
You're definitely biased.

709
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,720
If she wanted to kill the vice chairman,

710
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,080
why would she poison innocent people?

711
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,390
She could've killed me and Zhuge.

712
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,670
You're just fantasizing.

713
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,150
In your eyes,

714
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,910
anyone could be the culprit!

715
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,080
You,

716
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,430
you,

717
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,510
and you!

718
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,110
According to your logic,

719
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,830
I

720
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,480
can also be a suspect!

721
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,070
Fine, now that you've admitted it,

722
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,350
take them back together.

723
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,480
- Don't you dare!
- Wait.

724
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,870
Calm down, calm down.

725
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,950
Calm down.

726
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,760
Deng Yunfeng,

727
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,510
what do you want?

728
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,150
The poison case is full of doubts.

729
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,440
Now, I,

730
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,630
PSD Chief Constable Deng Yunfeng,

731
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,110
will take Ma Yingdan to
the magistrate's office for interrogation

732
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,030
to thoroughly investigate the case.

733
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,950
He Changzai,

734
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,280
do you have a problem?

735
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,920
As you please.

736
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,590
Whatever you like.

737
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,750
Let's go.

738
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:52,760
Mr. Deng,

739
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
are you helping me?

740
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,920
Am I or am I not?

741
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,840
Thanks.

742
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,270
It's okay.

743
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,150
The poison case

744
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,910
is getting more complicated.

745
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,150
I smelled the drug

746
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,480
He Changzai just took.

747
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,520
I think it's the rouge
from Juhong Pavilion.

748
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,760
We don't have much time.

749
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,240
Let's head to Juhong Pavilion

750
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,160
and investigate it.

751
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,750
We can't alert them.

752
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,230
We need to be prepared.

753
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,070
Zhuge,

754
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,360
we should go with them.

755
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:37,110
I think I'm poisoned again.

756
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,340
(The End of Episode 6)

757
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,020
We're here, Yingdan.

758
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,900
This room looks good.

759
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,420
Take a look.

760
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,060
Not bad, huh?

761
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,180
I'll be staying here.

762
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,020
I can even plant some flowers.

763
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,660
Yingdan, you can stay anywhere you like.

764
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,780
If you want my room,

765
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,980
I'll give it to you.

766
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,820
Who wants your room?

767
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,860
Yingdan, this place...

768
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,900
Well, it's...

769
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,180
Yingdan,

770
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,500
- are you moving in?
- Ling'er.

771
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,780
That's wonderful.

772
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,660
Once I move in,

773
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,860
I can take care of you.

774
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,500
Thank you, Yingdan.

775
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,940
Then I'm leaving.

776
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,140
She...

777
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,180
- Is she always like this?
- Yes.

778
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,060
She's been so cheerful lately.

779
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,700
She's not happy.

780
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,500
After all, she just lost her father.

781
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,580
She just

782
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,300
doesn't want us to worry about her.

783
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,980
