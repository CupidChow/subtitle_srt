00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,270
My Lord, emergency.

2
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,110
Speak.

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,870
According to our spy, Zhu Gou Team
really went to the Sword Alliance.

4
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,000
Did you discover anything?

5
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,230
My Lord,

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,550
the Sword Saint is still alive

7
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,030
and has been away for days.

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,350
Tomorrow, we will

00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,870

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,520

00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,750

Check our rouge and powder, Miss.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,870
I didn't expect

63
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,710
the Sword Alliance to be so lively.

64
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,590
It's more bustling than Huizhou City.

65
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,360
And there's so much tasty food.

66
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,280
You're always eating.

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
Yingdan, have you noticed

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
Zhuge's been acting strange lately?

69
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,520
Of course.

70
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,910
All clues about
assassinating Deng Yunfeng

71
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,120
lead to the Sword Saint.

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,360
He had to return.

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,120
Crispy and delicious handmade pastries.

74
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,510
Have a taste.

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,240
Sir, Miss,

76
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,190
look at these rabbits.

77
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,190
They're so cute, aren't they?

78
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,910
Buy a pair and raise them.

79
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,240
I promise, they'll

80
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,870
love each other

81
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,710
and have many children

82
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,590
just like you two.

83
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,590
What... Love each other?

84
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,360
Stop saying nonsense!

85
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,960
Yingdan,

86
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,150
what does that mean?

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,840
Go away.

88
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,030
Yingdan.

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,560
If you like rabbits,

90
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,590
we can buy two and raise them.

91
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,310
Why would I buy them?

92
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,560
No.

93
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,630
I'm just looking.

94
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,150
Yingdan, do you think there's

95
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,080
an animal immune to poison?

96
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,800
There's no such animal in this world.

97
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,710
I'm a small animal immune to poison.

98
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,200
Yingdan,

99
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,560
I will definitely find

100
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,590
an animal immune to poison

101
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,430
and give it to you.

102
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,300
(Righteousness)

103
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,000
Heng, you've gone too far.

104
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,270
You've been away for half a year

105
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,110
and never returned.

106
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,010
Uncle.

107
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,430
Can you untie this for me?

108
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Why would you tie such a tight knot?

109
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,000
I...

110
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,190
Where was I just now?

111
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,270
Been away for half a year.

112
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,110
Yes.

113
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,630
You've been away for half a year.

114
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,480
If your dad died,
wouldn't you come back?

115
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,320
- That old man...
- I...

116
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,270
He pretends to be dead all the time.

117
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,360
Am I supposed to rush home every time?

118
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,640
That's right.

119
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,510
Over the years,

120
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,270
he's faked his death many times.

121
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,270
But it's because he misses you, right?

122
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,430
Okay, enough.

123
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,310
I came back this time to ask you

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,920
who else in the Sword Alliance
can use the Shadow Swordplay

125
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,510
other than my dad?

126
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,160
It's our ultimate skill.

127
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,750
Over the years,
only your dad can master it.

128
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,120
What is

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,630
this old man thinking?

130
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,870
He's neglecting his duties.

131
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,560
We should thrive through martial arts.

132
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,950
How can we get tainted
by greed and wealth?

133
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,310
I've been telling him this,

134
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,190
but he never listens.

135
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,310
Where is he right now?

136
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,310
He didn't know you'd come back

137
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,390
for his fake death.

138
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,720
So, after leaving that message,

139
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,040
he went to Huizhou to find you.

140
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,000
Went to Huizhou?

141
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,320
It's good.

142
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,870
It's inconvenient

143
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,480
to do it here.

144
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,840
You...

145
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,160
What did you say?

146
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,790
Oh, nothing.

147
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,830
I'll take my leave.

148
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,360
No time to waste. Goodbye, Uncle.

149
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,560
Heng, Heng! Wait a minute!

150
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,430
(Sword Alliance)
Master! Master!

151
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,310
Let's go!

152
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,150
Heng.

153
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,480
Who are they?

154
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,390
Uncle, they are my friends.

155
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,430
This is Gou Lingfeng.

156
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,270
This is Ma Yingdan.

157
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,470
This is my second uncle,

158
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,430
Zhuge Xun, the vice leader
of Sword Alliance.

159
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,870
Hello, Vice Leader.

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,840
Hello, Vice Leader.

161
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,670
Heng,

162
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,680
come home.

163
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,240
After all, this is your home.

164
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,640
I have no home.

165
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,270
- Watch your words.
- Vice Leader,

166
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,000
I've noticed that

167
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,120
the layout of the shops and streets
is similar to

168
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,830
the Gou Family Trade Association.

169
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,750
Are you

170
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,190
imitating us?

171
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,030
Nonsense.

172
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,920
Our streets

173
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,920
were all designed by your father.

174
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,310
My father?

175
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,800
- It's really your family's work.
- Yes.

176
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,910
Heng,

177
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,560
do you have to leave in such a hurry?

178
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,120
I asked Auntie Wang to make

179
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,430
your favorite braised pork.

180
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,720
Uncle, we'll skip the meal.

181
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,600
I'm really in a hurry.

182
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,830
Goodbye, Uncle.

183
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,670
Let's go.

184
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,430
Go, go!

185
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,560
Go, go!

186
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,470
Zhuge.

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,480
You're rushing to find your father.

188
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,750
Do you think
he assassinated Deng Yunfeng?

189
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,310
How's that possible?

190
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,360
He's the noble Sword Saint.

191
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,390
Assassinating Deng Yunfeng

192
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,000
would stain his hands.

193
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,670
Master.

194
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,070
I need your help.

195
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,160
Stop resisting!

196
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,750
You're going to die today!

197
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,920
No way!

198
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,480
I, Zhuge Heng,

199
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,560
haven't fulfilled my three aspirations.

200
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,480
Don't drink the Oblivion Soup

201
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,920
and save your dreams for your next life.

202
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,510
Demonic remnant,

203
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,870
how dare you hunt my son?

204
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,440
Senior,

205
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,720
sorry for this.

206
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,160
You're really in Huizhou.

207
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,200
Zhuge, calm down.

208
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,270
We haven't asked him
about the assassination.

209
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,200
It's hard to lure you out.

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,600
- Heng...
- Don't call me Heng!

211
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,870
Today, I'm going to kill you

212
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,750
to avenge my mother!

213
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,030
Zhuge! Zhuge!

214
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,240
Get off me!

215
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,080
Senior,

216
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,200
is there some

217
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
misunderstanding?

218
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,270
What misunderstanding?

219
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,390
He's nothing but a vain

220
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,910
and selfish hypocrite!

221
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,750
Heng.

222
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,320
What happened back then
isn't what you think.

223
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,150
Get off me.

224
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,200
Zhuge...

225
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,280
Zhuge Yu.

226
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,360
You're a scum!

227
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,870
The biggest mistake my mom made

228
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,790
was to marry you.

229
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,960
You don't deserve to be my father.

230
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,080
I truly wish

231
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
I was someone else's son.

232
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,560
Unfilial son!

233
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,870
Don't you dare insult
your mother's spirit.

234
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,670
I was right.

235
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,480
You're so angry.

236
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,080
It turns out I'm really not your son.

237
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,240
You...

238
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,080
Senior.

239
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,440
Hit me.

240
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,840
Come on, hit me.

241
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,720
Why don't you kill me?

242
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,630
- Heng!
- Don't call me Heng!

243
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,960
Zhuge.

244
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,910
I, Zhuge Heng,

245
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,800
swear

246
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,870
on my blood

247
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
and my sword

248
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,600
to challenge Zhuge Yu, the Sword Saint,

249
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,120
to a Sword Oath Duel!

250
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,870
You want to challenge me to a duel?

251
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,480
Do you know what it means?

252
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,320
Hasn't the title of Sword Saint always been

253
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,000
the most important thing to you?

254
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,510
I will take it from you.

255
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,600
Okay.

256
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,080
Tomorrow at noon,

257
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,120
let's fight at the drill ground!

258
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,030
Okay!

259
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,870
Senior,

260
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,790
please wait.

261
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,030
I have a small question.

262
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,670
Who are you?

263
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,030
I am Gou Lingfeng.

264
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,960
Chairman Gou of the Gou Family
Trade Association is my father.

265
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,910
Gou's son?

266
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,270
Why did you learn demonic skills?

267
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,270
That's a long story.

268
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,790
All you need to know is

269
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,390
I have a kind heart.

270
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Fine.

271
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
What's the matter?

272
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,270
As for the assassination of Deng Yunfeng
from the Martial Artists Association,

273
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,110
you...

274
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,000
I've heard about it.

275
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,320
Are you asking me if I did this?

276
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,510
Listen,

277
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,870
if I were the one,

278
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,030
Deng Yunfeng wouldn't have
withstood five moves.

279
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,510
He really didn't withstand five moves.

280
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,600
You did it.

281
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,550
I mean, he would've died
within five moves!

282
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,710
Senior,

283
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,240
Zhuge and you...

284
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,630
This is a family affair.

285
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,270
Since you're his friend,

286
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,030
please look after him for me.

287
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,200
Don't let him do anything reckless.

288
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,320
Zhuge.

289
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,080
Heng,

290
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,160
I'll drink with you.

291
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,790
Ling'er, you...

292
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,040
Gou Lingfeng,

293
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,120
what's going on here?

294
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,150
The enemy Zhuge often mentions

295
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,030
turns out to be his father.

296
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,790
And he challenged his father

297
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,000
to a Sword Oath Duel.

298
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,910
Sword Oath Duel?

299
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,990
Oh, no.

300
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,960
The Sword Oath Duel

301
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,750
is a deathmatch to decide
the Sword Alliance's Sword Saint.

302
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,480
Once the current Sword Saint

303
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,520
accepts the challenge,

304
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,870
there's no holding back.

305
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,390
The winner

306
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,750
will be the next Sword Saint.

307
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,230
Zhuge,

308
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,910
do you really hate your dad that much?

309
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,790
Is there some misunderstanding?

310
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,270
You don't know what I've been through.

311
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,960
You won't understand.

312
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,960
I must reveal
that hypocrite's true colors.

313
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,480
- But he's your father!
- Yes.

314
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,320
How could you wield your sword
to attack him?

315
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,080
I've made up my mind.
Don't try to stop me.

316
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,130
Heng,

317
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,080
every parent loves their children,

318
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,550
including the Sword Saint.

319
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,910
If misunderstandings

320
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,440
lead to disaster,

321
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,000
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

322
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,440
For the title of Sword Saint,

323
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,750
he killed my mother.

324
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,900
(Righteousness)

325
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,030
Are you really

326
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,960
a member of the demonic sect?

327
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,480
What if I am?

328
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,840
What if I'm not?

329
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,480
I'm asking you again.

330
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,150
Are you really a demonic sect member?

331
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,080
Yes.

332
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,200
I'm the Demonic Witch

333
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,240
that everyone wants to kill.

334
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,080
Do you want to kill me?

335
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,320
Demonic Witch!

336
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,360
Kill her!

337
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,120
Zhuge Yu,
you're the Demonic Witch's ally!

338
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,480
You don't deserve to be our leader!

339
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,080
Kill her, kill her, kill her!

340
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,510
I saw him kill my mother
with my own eyes,

341
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,480
so I must kill him

342
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,200
to avenge my mother!

343
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,790
I see.

344
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,960
Your mother was a member
of the demonic sect,

345
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,320
so you've longed to

346
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,510
join the demonic sect

347
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,080
and learn that demonic skill

348
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,200
to avenge your mother.

349
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,910
I saw their duel before.

350
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,630
Whenever my mother used

351
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,000
the Moon Sword Skill,

352
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,080
she could defeat Zhuge Yu.

353
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,270
So, I must learn that move.

354
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,080
Is the Sword Saint allergic to the moon?

355
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,710
What did you say?

356
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,270
Ridiculous.

357
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,550
That's all?

358
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,630
Zhuge,

359
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,120
you should confirm it.

360
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,510
Can your father

361
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,120
really be defeated by that sword skill?

362
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,160
Exactly.

363
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,150
You can't even defeat me with that move.

364
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,270
I wonder who bewitched him.

365
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,080
What's wrong with Ling'er?

366
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,390
It's not that weak, right?

367
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,960
Ms. Ling'er...

368
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,000
How dare you slap me?

369
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,030
Why did you teach Zhuge Heng
that sword skill?

370
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,440
Do you want to harm him?

371
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,510
Harm him?

372
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,350
Do you know Zhuge Heng's biggest wish

373
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,440
is to learn that sword skill

374
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,550
and get revenge?

375
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,720
Do you think you can help him?

376
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,960
Do you know who his enemy

377
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,880
is?

378
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,830
Do you know he wants to kill

379
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,030
his father?

380
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,240
What?

381
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,640
I'm Zhuge Yu, the 7th Sword Saint
of the Sword Alliance.

382
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,790
Today, I accept Zhuge Heng's
Sword Oath Duel challenge.

383
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,880
I swear on my blood

384
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,480
and my sword,

385
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,030
if you defeat me,

386
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,000
you'll be the 8th Sword Saint.

387
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,510
What Sword Saint?

388
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,350
It means nothing to me.

389
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,640
I only want to kill you.

390
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,440
- Sword Saint is Zhuge's father.
- So what?

391
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,200
I am Zhuge's master.

392
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,720
So, should I call

393
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,830
the Sword Saint brother?

394
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,560
Shut up.

395
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,160
It's not something

396
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,640
that outsiders can gossip about.

397
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,720
Come, Heng.

398
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,480
Show me what you've got.

399
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,830
Have your sword techniques improved?

400
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,070
Your strike is too slow,

401
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,030
and the angle is wrong.

402
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,310
Heng,

403
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,000
your martial arts are unfocused,

404
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,510
and your True Qi is a mess.

405
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,750
It seems you've been blinded by hatred.

406
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,070
You've been too impatient

407
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,640
and wasted your talent.

408
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,030
Don't try to teach me!

409
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,400
Mom, you're pretty and powerful.

410
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,550
Dad, you're so silly.

411
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,030
Heng, you're right.

412
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm so silly.

413
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,680
I still can't counter that move.

414
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,110
Mom,

415
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,400
what's this move?

416
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,790
I want to learn it.

417
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,790
If my dad bullies me,

418
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,790
I'll use it to teach him a lesson.

419
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,960
When you grow up,

420
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,310
I'll teach you this move.

421
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,720
If your dad dares to bully you,

422
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,000
you'll use it to defeat him.

423
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,030
That's right.

424
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,400
If you learn this move,

425
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,030
I won't dare to bully you anymore.

426
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,400
Do you want to bully Heng?

427
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,760
I wouldn't dare.

428
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,350
Heng!

429
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,580
Zhuge.

430
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,110
- How did you learn this?
- Heng!

431
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,920
Who taught you?

432
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,720
The Sword Oath Duel

433
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,750
cannot be interfered with by others.

434
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,590
- Zhuge.
- Only this move

435
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,880
can defeat you.

436
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,350
I can't believe you did this to me.

437
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,640
Didn't you do the same to my mother?

438
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,510
I didn't kill your mother!

439
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,240
I saw it with my own eyes!

440
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,270
I wanted to save her!

441
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,350
Save her?

442
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,920
Did you save her

443
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,160
by stabbing her with a sword?

444
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,110
I didn't!

445
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,960
Enough.

446
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,590
Prepare to die!

447
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,070
Zhuge! Zhuge!

448
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,270
- Zhuge!
- Heng!

449
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,150
Zhuge.

450
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,310
I hereby declare

451
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,720
the winner of the 7th Sword Oath Duel

452
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,680
is Zhuge Heng.

453
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,000
Senior!

454
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,110
Sword Saint!

455
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,840
Senior.

456
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,350
Senior.

457
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,680
You're seriously injured.

458
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,790
You still need

459
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,920
to rest for a few months.

460
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,590
Senior,

461
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,440
what happened between you and Zhuge?

462
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,920
It's all in the past.

463
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,480
I don't want to bring it up.

464
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,680
Besides...

465
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
You...

466
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,200
- Well...
- Even if Heng knows,

467
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,680
it won't change anything.

468
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,510
He'll only be heartbroken.

469
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,350
Senior, do you really want to be his enemy

470
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,790
for the rest of your life?

471
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,920
Senior,

472
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,960
since I met Zhuge Heng,

473
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,720
he's been trying to

474
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,310
join the demonic sect

475
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,720
to learn that sword skill to defeat you.

476
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,830
He's been living in pain.

477
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,310
Do you really want him

478
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,440
to get lost

479
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,750
go astray?

480
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,200
Does he know his mother
was a demonic sect member?

481
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,920
It's not a secret.

482
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,110
He knew it all along.

483
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,640
Why else would he want
to join the demonic sect?

484
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,240
- Senior!
- Senior!

485
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,590
Does it still hurt?

486
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,950
No.

487
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,510
You totally deserved it!

488
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,110
I'm sorry, Ling'er.

489
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,640
You must be worried.

490
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,680
A while ago,

491
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,550
you went to Linglong's place
to train every night.

492
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,110
I saw it.

493
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,790
I was eager to practice sword skills.

494
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,000
Don't get me wrong.

495
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,200
I believe you.

496
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,830
Since I learned about your burden,

497
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,590
I've believed you.

498
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,550
Sword Saint should be awake.

499
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,790
Talk to him

500
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,270
and make things clear.

501
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,350
I'm not going.

502
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,830
Will you go or not?

503
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,000
Fine, I'll go!

504
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,550
I'll go, okay?

505
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,480
I thought I could

506
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,750
help Shun keep this secret.

507
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,550
But Heng found out.

508
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,310
I'm so stupid.

509
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,200
He's been holding a grudge
against me all these years.

510
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,540
(Righteousness)
Zhuge Yu,

511
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,400
as the leader of the Sword Alliance,

512
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,270
how could you marry this Demonic Witch?

513
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,030
You're a disgrace
to the righteous martial sects!

514
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,870
Indeed!

515
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,680
As members of
the Martial Artists Association,

516
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,960
we should stand united as one.

517
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,440
However, you've ruined the

518
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,030
century-long prestige
of the Sword Alliance!

519
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,510
Zhuge Yu,

520
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,270
you're a disgrace to the martial world!

521
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,200
Are you really

522
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,000
a demonic sect member?

523
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,880
What if I am?

524
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,240
What if I'm not?

525
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,920
Let me ask you again.

526
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,400
Are you really a demonic sect member?

527
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,320
Yes.

528
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm the Demonic Witch

529
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,480
that everyone wants to kill.

530
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,200
Are you going to kill me?

531
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,030
No...

532
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,030
Demonic Witch!

533
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,000
Kill her!

534
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,550
Zhuge Yu, you're
the Demonic Witch's ally.

535
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,880
You don't deserve to be our leader!

536
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,480
- Kill her!
- Kill her! Kill her!

537
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,590
Kill me!

538
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Shun!

539
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,030
Kill me,

540
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,440
and you'll secure
the title of the Sword Saint,

541
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,400
protect the reputation
of the Sword Alliance,

542
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,480
and erase

543
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,830
the shame I've brought upon you.

544
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,850
You've never brought me shame.

545
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,760
We...

546
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,670
Shun!

547
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,480
Heng...

548
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,640
Take care of Heng...

549
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,440
Don't let him know

550
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,680
his mother...

551
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,000
was a demonic sect member.

552
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,320
Okay...

553
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,110
To protect me and Heng,

554
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,030
Shun threw herself onto the sword.

555
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,720
I couldn't pull back in time.

556
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,880
It was all my fault!

557
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,510
The day I met Shun,

558
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,000
I already knew her identity.

559
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,400
I didn't care

560
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,110
whether she was
from the demonic sect or not.

561
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,400
All I knew was

562
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,680
that she was kind

563
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,440
and brave.

564
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,680
She was the one and only

565
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,200
in my life!

566
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,110
However,

567
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,640
I never told her any of this.

568
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,200
I panicked at that time.

569
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,510
I shouldn't have pointed
my sword at her.

570
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,920
It was all my fault!

571
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,480
Just like that,

572
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,880
I've been living with the guilt

573
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,160
toward Shun.

574
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,310
Since then, I stopped fighting

575
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,030
and lived a secluded life.

576
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,440
I found Gou
at the Gou Family Trade Association.

577
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,520
My father?

578
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,310
I asked your father

579
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,830
to turn the Sword Alliance

580
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,070
into a trade association.

581
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,960
And we started to do business as well.

582
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,870
Senior,

583
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,550
what about

584
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,110
the Moon Sword Skill?

585
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,920
Moon Sword Skill...

586
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,590
Shun once said

587
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,790
her father created

588
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,750
that sword skill for her.

589
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,110
Every time I saw her do that move,

590
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,640
I'd be stunned by her beauty.

591
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,000
We had a deal.

592
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,550
Whenever she felt unhappy,

593
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,640
she'd use that move,

594
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,720
and I'd surrender.

595
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,150
Zhu...

596
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,760
It turns out

597
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,550
the Moon Sword Skill

598
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,270
was the promise of love
between you and your wife.

599
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,400
That's so touching.

600
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,830
If Zhuge Heng knows about this,

601
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,270
his mother will rest in peace.

602
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,310
Zhuge.

603
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,440
- Zhuge.
- What are you doing?

604
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,790
If you want to listen, come inside.

605
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,200
No need for that kowtow.

606
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,510
Heng, don't do this.

607
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,590
I forgive you.

608
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,100
Zhuge.

609
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,640
No matter what you say,
I won't believe you.

610
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,830
You killed my mother!

611
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,440
- Heng! Heng!
- Zhuge! Zhuge! Zhuge Heng!

612
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,280
Senior!

613
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,440
Heng!

614
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,400
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

615
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,040
Yu!

616
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,240
Yu.

617
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,080
Senior.

618
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,110
Yu, how did you get hurt like this?

619
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,720
Nothing serious.

620
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,070
Well, I heard

621
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,200
what happened.

622
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,440
How did it end up like this?

623
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,400
Heng has really gone too far!

624
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,430
By the way,

625
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,070
thank you for saving him.

626
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,910
It's okay.

627
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,680
I'll take Yu

628
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,030
back to rest.

629
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,080
Senior.

630
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,550
The Sword Saint is seriously injured.

631
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,920
He should rest here.

632
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,920
Don't worry.

633
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,000
The Sword Alliance

634
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,110
has the best doctors and medicine.

635
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,590
Yu will recover

636
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,720
soon.

637
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,030
Right, Yu?

638
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,200
Okay.

639
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,000
Ling'er.

640
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,200
They couldn't have reconciled

641
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,750
without your help.

642
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,750
I don't want Heng to live in regret.

643
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,960
Speaking of which,

644
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,830
where is Zhuge?

645
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,110
It doesn't matter.

646
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,070
This is too much for him.

647
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,160
Let him take a break.

648
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,030
Yes.

649
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,480
Just let him take a break.

650
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,070
He's been through a lot.

651
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,630
That's right.

652
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,640
No one can play with me.

653
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,270
Are you a kid?

654
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,910
Your mouth...

655
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,400
The other side!

656
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,910
- Here?
- No!

657
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,590
Where is it?

658
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,590
Here!

659
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,070
Here!

660
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,070
Where is it?

661
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,510
Deng.

662
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,070
I'm really curious.

663
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,110
Don't you know how to knock?

664
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,160
I'm here for a case.

665
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,270
What case?

666
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,310
Where's Zhuge Yu?

667
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,310
He returned.

668
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,310
What about Zhuge Heng?

669
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,720
None of your business.

670
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,590
Yunfeng.

671
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,510
Did something happen?

672
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,270
I have reasons to suspect

673
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,750
that they're

674
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,200
involved in the assassination

675
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,000
of the inspector
of Martial Artists Association.

676
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,350
Isn't that your case?

677
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,920
Then why don't you hand them over?

678
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,560
No way!

679
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,270
I asked the Sword Saint.

680
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,070
He said he didn't do it.

681
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,910
Evidence.

682
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,750
The evidence is

683
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,240
that he said if he was the one,

684
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,640
you wouldn't survive five moves.

685
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
Enough.

686
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,720
Yunfeng.

687
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,640
Why are you so certain?

688
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,510
Do you have any proof?

689
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,480
What proof could he have?

690
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,920
Yingdan,

691
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,760
look at this.

692
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,960
Here are the records of
entry and exit of Huizhou.

693
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,680
The Sword Saint has been
in Huizhou for several days.

694
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,830
I also found

695
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,960
Zhuge Xun has been traveling frequently

696
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,310
between Huizhou and the Sword Alliance.

697
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,790
Moreover, I found

698
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
the move that hurt me

699
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,270
was the Shadow Swordplay
of the Sword Saint.

700
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,070
This is the evidence.

701
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,790
Mr. Deng.

702
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,440
That wasn't the Shadow Swordplay

703
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,160
but Phantom Shadow of the demonic sect.

704
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,040
Yunfeng.

705
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,510
The assassin can't be
Zhuge Heng or his father.

706
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,640
I'll explain it later. Let's go.

707
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,510
Sword Saint is in danger.

708
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,480
In danger?

709
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,520
Yingdan!

710
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,240
Godfather.

711
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,240
Yunfeng, you're back.

712
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,680
Why are you here?

713
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,830
I heard you were attacked,

714
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,480
and I was deeply worried,

715
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,880
so I rushed to Huizhou.

716
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,640
But now it seems

717
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,750
you are fine.

718
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,830
I can rest assured.

719
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,750
Look at you.

720
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,880
You should be resting at home.

721
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,960
Why did you go out?

722
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,110
I'm fine now.

723
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,200
Thank you for your concern.

724
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,960
I've investigated it,

725
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
and I suspect

726
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,270
the assassin

727
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,880
was Zhuge Yu from the Sword Alliance.

728
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,440
Zhuge Yu?

729
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,320
Report.

730
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,640
Why is she here?

731
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,840
Invite her in.

732
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,950
Aye.

733
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
Your Highness.

734
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,480
Godfather.

735
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,750
We're not in the palace.

736
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,590
There's no need for formalities.

737
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,160
I just heard

738
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,830
that you came to Huizhou.

739
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,960
I just want to have a chat with you.

740
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,880
Okay.

741
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,400
Let's sit and talk.

742
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,270
Here, Your Highness.

743
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,510
You've been in Huizhou for a while.

744
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,480
Are you settling in well?

745
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,310
Thank you for your concern.

746
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,750
I've been good.

747
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,200
Mr. Deng is always busy,

748
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,480
but he's treated me well

749
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,400
and cared about me.

750
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,440
There's no need to worry.

751
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,880
I know Yunfeng well.

752
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,270
Maybe he's a bit boorish,

753
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,440
but he's honest and kind.

754
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,830
He's a good boy.

755
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,270
Your Highness,

756
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,110
what can I do

757
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,550
for you?

758
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,720
Hearing about the assassination,

759
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,790
I was so worried

760
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,000
and gathered many clues.

761
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,960
So, I'm here

762
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,310
to help him solve the case.

763
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,110
Okay.

764
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,790
Your Highness, who

765
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,070
do you think

766
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,200
is the assassin?

767
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,780
(The End of Episode 16)

768
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,900
(Occupied)

769
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,670
Master, stop

770
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,400
coming out of the latrine every time!

771
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,920
I... I'm traumatized!

772
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,800
- Pull me out!
- No.

773
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,110
Pull me out!

774
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,110
Don't persuade me to be the sect leader,

775
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,480
or I'll be angry.

776
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,030
I heard your disciple

777
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,480
will have a Sword Oath Duel

778
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,840
with Zhuge Yu tomorrow.

779
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,150
I tried to persuade him,
but he wouldn't listen.

780
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,320
- So stubborn.
- How could he defeat that rascal?

781
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,840
Master.

782
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,670
Didn't you want to kill Zhuge Heng?

783
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,960
Why are you concerned about him now?

784
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,480
None... None of your business.

785
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,550
Get out!

786
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,110
Get out!

787
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,360
I need to use the latrine!

788
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,280
I need to use it too!
