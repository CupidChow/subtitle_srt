1
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,670
So this is your disciple?

2
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,480
That's right.

3
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,390
He's perfectly inherited

4
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,030
all 299 divine techniques
of the Divine Sect.

5
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,240
He's the undisputed candidate
for the next chief.

6
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,590
He looks fine.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,400
What's the situation over at Swallow?

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,480
Those martial artists

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,470
insist on

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,240
some formal duel to prove

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,790
they're worthy of wielding
the Rockblade.

12
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,750
Then let them fight.

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,000
You, Mr. Dao, haven't concerned

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,350
yourself with worldly affairs in years.

15
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,320

the Rockblade now?

62
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,440
Master,

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,960
try to remember again, would you?

64
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,390
The Moonlight Swordplay,

65
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,760
I feel like Grandmaster was
trying to teach me that day.

66
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,910
He must know how to do it.

67
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,440
Don't bring him up again.

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,230
He's a madman.

69
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,240
That day,

70
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,430
he nearly killed you.

71
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,760
And you still want to see him?

72
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,710
Talk to him for me, please?

73
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,870
Honestly,

74
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,880
it seems hopeless.

75
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,080
Seems like your Sword Alliance
pissed him off.

76
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,710
He said you're mortal enemies now,

77
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,760
and he'll kill every last one of you
on sight.

78
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,790
Zhuge.

79
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,120
Watch yourself.

80
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,840
Yingdan. Are you okay?

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,750
Zhuge.

82
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,670
You...

83
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,810
- Yingdan!
- Yingdan.

84
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,990
Don't blame Zhuge.

85
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,510
It's just my old condition.

86
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,390
Here.

87
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,600
Have your meal first.

88
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,640
Don't forget to wash your hands.

89
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,150
You made Yingdan cough up blood!

90
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,150
Stop talking nonsense.

91
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,360
She's suffering from poison backlash.

92
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,360
It's been going on a while.

93
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,310
Backlash? Why'd you only tell me now?

94
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,510
Would it have mattered if I had?

95
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,160
Have you ever truly cared about her?

96
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,720
I did care! I was in prison,

97
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,680
how could I show it?

98
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,480
It's not like I could be by her side
every day!

99
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,720
I have my own stuff going on too!

100
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,070
Oh please! What stuff?

101
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,870
You and your "three great passions,"
right?

102
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,870
Getting stronger, revenge,
and wandering?

103
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,270
Revenge for what, exactly?

104
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,390
It sounds like a comedy routine.

105
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,000
You... I...

106
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,640
(Mr. Dao from the demonic sect.)

107
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,270
Swallow,

108
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,270
you can handle Crane,

109
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,440
right?

110
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,320
Crane doesn't scare me.

111
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,440
I know his ways,

112
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,710
he'd never fight personally.

113
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,200
He's probably

114
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,630
already found a disciple

115
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,880
to fight in his place.

116
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,080
That's even better, isn't it?

117
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,560
Even if he sends ten disciples,

118
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,080
you could still beat them all.

119
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,840
No,

120
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,120
if Crane really sends a disciple,

121
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,510
then by the code

122
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,000
of the martial world,

123
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,600
you defeating the student

124
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,470
would still be an unfair victory.

125
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,160
Am I right?

126
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,150
That Crane

127
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,000
is truly a sly one.

128
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,640
Just in case,

129
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,440
I should take in a disciple too.

130
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,880
Well...

131
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,190
Then how about picking one of them

132
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,680
to be your disciple?

133
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,080
No no no, sir,

134
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,830
you know

135
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,270
our level.

136
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,240
Useless!

137
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,440
A bunch of trash!

138
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,950
I've supported you this long,

139
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,950
for what?

140
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,960
Waiter!

141
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,990
Bring liquor!

142
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,110
Coming!

143
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,000
Come one, come all!

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,040
The only official replica
of the Rockblade,

145
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,590
authorized by Crane Knight,
the only disciple of the Sword God!

146
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,070
And it's engraved with his signature!

147
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,950
Limited stock—

148
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,270
first come, first served!

149
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,240
If anyone wants to get up close
and personal

150
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,920
or even touch Crane Knight,

151
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
line up here

152
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,880
and pay five taels of silver!

153
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,750
Come on,

154
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,630
you actually made a fake Rockblade

155
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,640
and are selling it here?

156
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,640
Even wandering the world costs cash.

157
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,150
And this is easy money.

158
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,560
You're just in time.

159
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,600
I was looking for you.

160
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,940
(Drunken Rain Pavilion)

161
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,200
Gou,

162
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,910
Swallow's been sneaking men
into the city lately.

163
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,390
They're all eyeing me like I'm prey.

164
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,750
Sure, I'm a top-level martial artist,

165
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,030
hardly anyone's my match.

166
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,910
But you know the saying:

167
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,760
even a master can't fight
four hands alone.

168
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,240
So starting today,

169
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,830
you'll be my personal bodyguard.

170
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,430
Wait.

171
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,120
You're a Dragon-ranked hero,

172
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,830
and you're scared of them?

173
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,640
Just listen to me.

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,510
You beat Swallow for me,

175
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,950
I clear your criminal record.

176
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,200
Mutual benefit.

177
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,000
Fine, fine.

178
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,400
But actually,

179
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,510
I came to ask you something.

180
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,080
Have you heard of Poison Valley?

181
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,560
Vaguely.

182
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,600
Then you probably know

183
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,270
people from there are born
with toxic bodies

184
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,590
and suffer from backlash.

185
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,030
You've roamed the world for years,

186
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,000
have you ever heard of a cure?

187
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,000
I heard there's no cure.

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,920
Why?

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,920
Nothing.

190
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,160
Yingdan!

191
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,870
Are you insane?

192
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,240
Cooking this early in the morning?

193
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,160
I got it.

194
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,440
You?

195
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,560
You know how to cook?

196
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,350
Do I know how to cook?

197
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,040
Let me slice this potato for you.

198
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,320
Sure, knock yourself out.

199
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,480
Yingdan,

200
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,750
you scared the hell out of me
last night.

201
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,950
Scared you again, huh?

202
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,510
Zhuge Heng said

203
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,520
it's because of your poison backlash.

204
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,920
Don't listen to him talk nonsense.

205
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,920
Where is Zhuge anyway?

206
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,080
Who knows where he is having fun?

207
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,310
Having fun?

208
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,280
Wasn't it you who made him leave?

209
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,440
Yingdan,

210
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,230
what poison are we testing today?

211
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,830
Gou Lingfeng,

212
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,710
you in such a rush to die?

213
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,990
I got a batch of special poisons today.

214
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,040
You're testing every single one for me.

215
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,560
Gou Lingfeng.

216
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,230
What?

217
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,470
Forget it.

218
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,240
I've been doing some research lately.

219
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,960
I might be immune to all poisons

220
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,160
because of the techniques
I've been practicing.

221
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,510
I've been studying

222
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,440
the manuals my master left me.

223
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,590
I know I can find a way
to cure your poison.

224
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,480
And hey,

225
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,720
once you're feeling better,

226
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,360
you should try practicing a bit too.

227
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,040
Maybe it'll help you recover.

228
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,520
Heng!

229
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,590
Heng, don't go!

230
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,320
Please don't go.

231
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,240
What's wrong?

232
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,400
Ling'er.

233
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,080
Zhuge, what are you doing?

234
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,360
You two are usually thick as thieves,

235
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,830
what's with this sudden drama?

236
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,710
Zhuge,

237
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,110
this is my fault.

238
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,950
From today on,

239
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,230
you're no longer my master.

240
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,030
- I've Swallow Knight as my master.
- I...

241
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,030
I'm leaving now.

242
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,870
What?

243
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,790
Zhuge.

244
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,560
But this is your home!

245
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,800
You've gone too far.

246
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,160
You're betraying your master?

247
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,920
You have no real skills,

248
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,720
but you're great at deceiving people.

249
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,640
I...

250
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,120
Tell me, are all those manuals with you?

251
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,000
I wanted to teach you
some demonic techniques,

252
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,200
but you insisted on learning

253
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,000
some sword technique about
seeing the moon.

254
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,920
Like I'd know that!

255
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,000
Gou Lingfeng,

256
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,790
you really don't know that sword style?

257
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,660
Yingdan,

258
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,400
you think I'm lying to him too?

259
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,590
He's so dumb,

260
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,030
why should I lie to him?

261
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,720
Hey! Stop with the personal insults.

262
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,080
- Zhuge Heng, what are you doing?
- Stop yelling!

263
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,990
Why are we making such a scene?

264
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,830
What is this?

265
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,280
Even if you want revenge,
you need a proper plan.

266
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,760
Yingdan,

267
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,830
ignore him.

268
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,550
He's an idiot.

269
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,240
Gou! I've had enough of you!

270
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,200
- I...
- You never think before you speak.

271
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,320
It's not about the sword technique!

272
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,790
What I can't stand about you is that

273
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,030
you can't even tell right from wrong.

274
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,550
- I...
- Enough!

275
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,080
Ye Dahei gave his life to protect
that list,

276
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,920
and you handed it right over
to He Changzai.

277
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,680
Do you even have a conscience?

278
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,750
You say I don't care about my friends?

279
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,080
When Yingdan was suffering,

280
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
- Zhuge!
- where were you?

281
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,120
When we were running all over

282
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,080
- taking care of her,
- Heng.

283
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,920
- where were you?
- Enough.

284
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,030
Enough, Zhuge!

285
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,230
I'm not a good friend?

286
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,600
Whatever! I'm done.

287
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,840
- Heng, don't go!
- I...

288
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,110
- Zhuge! Ling'er!
- Don't go, Heng!

289
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,680
Don't go.

290
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,750
Heng, please don't go!

291
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm sorry,

292
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,920
Ling'er.

293
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,710
I have to master

294
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,350
the Moonlight Swordplay.

295
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,950
Because I have to take revenge.

296
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,800
Be good, okay?

297
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,560
Once I've settled things,

298
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,710
I'll come back for you.

299
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,080
Heng!

300
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,750
Aren't you going after him?

301
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,750
I...

302
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,670
Go!

303
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,680
Zhuge!

304
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,470
Zhuge, what are you exactly doing?

305
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,920
Zhuge,

306
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,320
what took you so long?

307
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,280
Who are these people?

308
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,030
So this is your disciple?

309
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,440
He's perfectly inherited

310
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,080
all 299 divine techniques
of the Divine Sect.

311
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,280
He's the undisputed candidate
for the next chief.

312
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,940
Sect Chief!

313
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,670
Sect Chief!

314
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,470
You've got the wrong guy!

315
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,040
I don't think I was wrong.

316
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,200
That was close.

317
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,000
You're back.

318
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,360
Where's Zhuge?

319
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,080
Taken by the Demonic Sect.

320
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
That brat,

321
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,320
he'll do anything now

322
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,550
just to learn demonic techniques.

323
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,560
Demonic techniques?

324
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,520
No way.

325
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,630
We need to go after him.

326
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,310
- Let's go find him!
- Yingdan.

327
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,360
He's grown up now.

328
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,870
You've got to give him space.

329
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,350
Let me enjoy a bit of peace for once.

330
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,400
Stop pretending!

331
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,870
Don't think I didn't notice you

332
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,840
drinking alone on the rooftop

333
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,950
after dinner.

334
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,030
I...

335
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,600
I was admiring the moon.

336
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,480
Right.

337
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,710
Just don't get the wrong idea.

338
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,120
Godfather.

339
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,830
Please forgive me.

340
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,630
You just can't change
that impatient streak.

341
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,710
Godfather, the list was snatched
by the MAA.

342
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,870
This is no small matter.

343
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,630
I knew about it already.

344
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,200
Godfather,

345
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,720
we have to act fast and get it back,

346
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,640
or it'll

347
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,680
become leverage against us.

348
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,200
There you go again, rushing.

349
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,480
You must understand,

350
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,790
that list is actually

351
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,230
not that important.

352
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,200
Then what is important?

353
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,030
Eunuch Deng,

354
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,560
long time no see.

355
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,440
Your Highness,

356
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,000
you are so refined and dignified,

357
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,710
truly extraordinary.

358
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,360
You're too kind, Your Highness.

359
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,440
You're as elegant as ever,

360
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,230
the envy of all.

361
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,230
Your Highness.

362
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,480
How are things with Linglong?

363
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,710
That girl's been spoiled by me.

364
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,680
She must've given you a hard time.

365
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,520
Thank you for your concern,
Your Highness.

366
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,440
The princess is
exceptionally intelligent.

367
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,910
She's helped me solve many problems.

368
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,160
That's good.

369
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,870
I heard the illegal salt list

370
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,440
fell into the hands of the MAA?

371
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,200
It was my failure.

372
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,800
I've caused worry for you.

373
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,520
Wu Guangming's growing influence

374
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,440
is not a good thing.

375
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,920
Eunuch Deng, do you have
any suggestions?

376
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,120
No need to worry, Your Highness.

377
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,750
I do have a plan.

378
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,000
Let's hear it.

379
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,160
Why not have Yunfeng

380
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,160
take on an official role within the MAA?

381
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,910
That way, we won't always

382
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,320
be the last to get intel,

383
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,080
and half the time it's false.

384
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,280
Would Wu Guangming even agree to that?

385
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,790
Your Highness,

386
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,870
I believe my old face

387
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,590
still carries some weight.

388
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,320
You truly have the court
and His Majesty's

389
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,230
best interests at heart, Eunuch Deng.

390
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,320
And the Sword Alliance's influence
is not to be underestimated.

391
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,550
I've already ordered a revival
of the Divine Blade Sect

392
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,950
to balance out the Sword Alliance.

393
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,630
That way,

394
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,630
when the time comes, it can also

395
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,200
lend you a helping hand.

396
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,520
Wise as ever, Your Highness.

397
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,760
Your Highness,

398
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,200
if we join forces,

399
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,400
there's no problem we can't solve.

400
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,670
We both serve His Majesty after all.

401
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,790
Exactly, exactly.

402
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,390
Alright, I'll leave you two to talk.

403
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,990
I'm going to rest.

404
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,920
Goodbye, Your Highness.

405
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,830
That old fox.

406
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,840
He just came to

407
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,680
give us both a warning.

408
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,880
Yunfeng,

409
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,560
be cautious

410
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,830
in the MAA.

411
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,920
This is a risky move.

412
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,670
Don't worry, godfather.

413
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,510
But,

414
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,800
as far as I know,

415
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,350
Wu Guangming was promoted
by Prince Chang.

416
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,590
Why would he allow me

417
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,910
to enter the MAA?

418
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,960
Wu Guangming isn't a simple man.

419
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,560
Prince Chang is just keeping
his options open.

420
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,540
(Huizhou City)

421
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,560
Ticket.

422
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,500
Here.

423
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,080
Go on in.

424
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,710
Ticket?

425
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,280
You need a ticket?

426
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,590
I'm here to compete.

427
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,150
So what if you're competing?

428
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,560
Crane Knight's orders:

429
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,480
No ticket, no entry.

430
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,150
Go to the back and buy one.

431
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,110
Wanna see if I'll cut you down?

432
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,320
Go ahead and try.

433
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,390
Crane, you jerk!

434
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
These ticket prices,

435
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,000
we could eat for days on that!

436
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,110
Come on, Swallow, you wretch,

437
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,160
you're this broke

438
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,560
and still have the nerve to show up?

439
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,110
Crane.

440
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,080
After years,

441
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,070
aside from acting cool,

442
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,830
when did you pick up that halitosis?

443
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,270
Cut the crap.

444
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,720
What halitosis?

445
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,960
I'm telling you,

446
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,390
today I'm cleaning up
the Divine Blade Sect's name.

447
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,790
Back then, you and a bunch of our men

448
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,720
ran off to start that "Blade Tomb"

449
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,560
and earned pretty nasty reputation.

450
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,270
Heard you're even tied
to the Demonic Sect.

451
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,830
I have a bad rep?

452
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,030
Look at you,

453
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,560
greasy, stinking of money,

454
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,150
disgusting.

455
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,640
You don't deserve the Rockblade.

456
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,960
I don't?

457
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,310
My father, if he could see this
from the afterlife,

458
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,160
would never let a traitor

459
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,110
who killed his master get away with it!

460
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,080
I've told you a hundred times!

461
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,960
I didn't kill my master!

462
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,240
I'm done talking.

463
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,390
We'll settle it on the stage.

464
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,270
Sir,

465
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,040
is Swallow really your senior brother?

466
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,520
Surprised?

467
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,270
Even a heroic figure like me

468
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,110
has a senior brother that lowly.

469
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,430
Yeah.

470
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,000
I can't believe your senior

471
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,910
is actually a lot younger than you.

472
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,190
Shut up.

473
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,390
Touchy, huh?

474
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,350
(Huizhou Drill Ground)

475
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,480
Today's a special day!

476
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,350
We've waited so long,

477
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,000
and finally, it's here:

478
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,270
the ultimate showdown
between Crane and Swallow!

479
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,310
Who will emerge victorious?

480
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,230
Swallow,

481
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,670
this is my personal disciple.

482
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,920
He insisted on fighting in my place.

483
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,200
As his master,

484
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,280
I can't refuse such a display
of filial devotion.

485
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,750
My dear disciple,

486
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,400
take him down.

487
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,560
That kid looks so familiar.

488
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,630
Yeah, why does he look so familiar?

489
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,160
It's starting.

490
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,600
Crane,

491
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,870
if you're scared, just admit it.

492
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Alright then.

493
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,520
I'll have my disciple fight too.

494
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,350
Come here!

495
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,080
Let the two of them battle in our place.

496
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,670
I can't believe it,

497
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,400
the mighty Swallow Knight

498
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,040
is colluding with Mr. Dao
from the Demonic Sect.

499
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,000
He's with the MAA.

500
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,720
Greetings, Master.

501
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,720
He said "Master"?

502
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,080
Young man,

503
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,000
what do you want?

504
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,190
I'm willing to fight Crane Knight
in your place.

505
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,960
Who is he?

506
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,720
No idea. Never seen him before.

507
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,760
And what's your condition?

508
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,110
Perhaps you've heard,

509
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,520
there's a demonic sword technique

510
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,560
where you can see the moon
through the blade's light.

511
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,910
Zhuge?

512
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,190
What are you two doing?

513
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,000
Why does this guy look so familiar too?

514
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,720
The duel is about to begin.

515
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,720
Everyone else, please clear the arena.

516
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,960
Stop it.

517
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,920
Get down from there.

518
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,480
I've taken Swallow Knight as my master.

519
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,270
He promised if I beat you,

520
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,390
he'll teach me that technique.

521
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,880
Swallow's from the Demonic Sect!

522
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,270
Be careful not to get tricked.

523
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,270
I told you, to learn that sword move,

524
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,630
I'll do whatever it takes.

525
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,840
Why are you...

526
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,720
You wouldn't dare use
demonic techniques here.

527
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,110
If you do,

528
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,590
everyone in the crowd

529
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,350
will rush up and hack you to death.

530
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,430
You'll definitely lose.

531
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,790
Come on, fight! Fight!

532
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,790
You're serious?

533
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,960
- Come on!
- Nice one!

534
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,640
Go!

535
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,560
Go for it!

536
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,400
Fight!

537
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,750
Go on!

538
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,400
Nice!

539
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,920
Yes!

540
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,000
Great moves!

541
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,590
Good! Nice!

542
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,670
Nice move!

543
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,750
Great fight!

544
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,670
Totally worth coming!

545
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,560
Beautiful!

546
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,510
Keep going!

547
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,000
(Penglai Pavilion)
Keep going!

548
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,920
Fight!

549
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,270
Fire!

550
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,350
Put it out!

551
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,350
Hurry, the fire!

552
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,390
Quick, put the fire out!

553
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,670
Put it out!

554
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,800
Be careful, all of you!

555
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,320
Master!

556
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,510
Look!

557
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,750
Who...

558
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,920
Who the hell set fire

559
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,670
to my Penglai Pavilion?

560
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,040
My painting!

561
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,160
It's...

562
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,720
It's ruined now,

563
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,350
probably worthless.

564
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,680
That was my father's

565
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,520
favorite painting before he passed.

566
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,910
I once hired someone to make replicas
of it.

567
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,520
Only this one captured his spirit best.

568
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,320
A replica?

569
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,400
After my father died,

570
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,520
I was too heartbroken and left
the old home.

571
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,400
Years later,

572
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,590
I returned to collect his belongings.

573
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,560
But time is merciless.

574
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,720
I just wanted a keepsake.

575
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,590
So I had several copies made,

576
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,870
only this one truly resembled him.

577
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,800
Sir,

578
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,920
I'll have the GFTA

579
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,480
paint you a new one later.

580
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,910
Right now the real problem is

581
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,390
the match was interrupted.

582
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,390
And Swallow's situation...

583
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,030
Don't even mention that!

584
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,440
- You...
- I told you to fight,

585
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,480
but you just mumbled and didn't

586
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,400
even throw a proper move!

587
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,440
What were you thinking?

588
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,070
I didn't know

589
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,030
he'd send out my own disciple!

590
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,880
I don't care whose disciple he is!

591
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,630
If you don't clean this up,

592
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,070
- you can rot in jail!
- You...

593
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,080
- No, wait...
- Let's go.

594
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,670
Yingdan,

595
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,760
what do we do now?

596
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,790
What did the Chairman say?

597
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,480
He said we should cooperate
with Crane Knight

598
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,960
to rebuild the Divine Blade Sect.

599
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,830
And also...

600
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,830
Also what?

601
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,920
He said we should carefully train

602
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,390
Zhu Gou Team.

603
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,590
What're you laughing at?

604
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,830
Zhu Gou Team,

605
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,240
is that even worth training?

606
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,960
I just don't get it.

607
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,880
Without me, He Changzai,

608
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,190
what can they even do?

609
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,000
I think that Zhuge Heng

610
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,150
is actually pretty decent.

611
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,400
Sanniang,

612
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,270
this is the martial world,

613
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,320
not a facial world.

614
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,110
Yes, yes.

615
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,350
In terms of martial arts,

616
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,270
reputation, wealth,

617
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,830
and looks, how can Zhuge Heng

618
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,320
compare to our Sky Knight?

619
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,590
Well, Dexterous Knight.

620
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,430
You should be called

621
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,110
"the Witty Mouth Hero."

622
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,830
Zhuge Heng

623
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,520
is the young master
of the Sword Alliance.

624
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,790
No ordinary

625
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,720
martial sect can match his influence.

626
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,590
And that Gou Lingfeng,

627
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,200
he's the sole heir to the GFTA.

628
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,030
Their wealth is unrivaled
in the martial world.

629
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,950
Okay, okay, fine.

630
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,110
But what does Crane Knight
bring to the table?

631
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,720
Why should I cooperate with him?

632
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,920
You forgot?

633
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,000
Crane Knight

634
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,280
is the son of the Blade God.

635
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,080
He can command all the blade-wielders.

636
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,430
I'm telling you,

637
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,400
once he got all greasy

638
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,830
and pompous,

639
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,800
I forgot his identity.

640
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,590
How could I forget his status?

641
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,270
Crane Knight!

642
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,790
What brings you here so suddenly?

643
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,280
Why didn't you tell me?

644
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
He,

645
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,830
this morning that brat Swallow

646
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,000
came to me again.

647
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,870
He threw down a new challenge,

648
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,800
wants a rematch in three days.

649
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,070
Alright, alright.

650
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,030
Don't worry, don't panic.

651
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,080
Crane Knight,

652
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,390
that disciple of yours isn't great, huh?

653
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,960
He hesitated during the match,

654
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,480
really dragged down your reputation.

655
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,670
That's what I'm saying!

656
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,830
He's just too weak.

657
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,670
He,

658
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,270
is there anyone tougher around Huizhou?

659
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,830
Someone who can actually fight?

660
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,550
Of course there is!

661
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,240
But we already agreed,

662
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,670
Crane Knight, I...

663
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,080
Right?

664
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,040
I'll find anything you want!

665
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,160
This Huizhou water brigade of yours

666
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,150
works too slow.

667
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,910
My Penglai Pavilion suffered
serious losses.

668
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,000
- How are you

669
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,110
- going to compensate me?
- Yes, yes.

670
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,490
- You are right.
- Please sit, please sit.

671
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,330
Crane Knight, have a seat.

672
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,000
I hope the damage wasn't too severe.

673
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,110
So?

674
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,030
Who do we have?

675
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,550
The year-after-year
"Most Popular Knight",

676
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,550
All-Around Knight?

677
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,470
No.

678
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,560
He has no substance.

679
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,630
Total pretty boy.

680
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,000
Then maybe the one

681
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,350
who can travel anywhere,

682
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,510
Night Knight?

683
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,430
Also no good.

684
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,240
He only comes out at night.

685
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,750
Who knows if he has some

686
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,870
unusual hobbies?

687
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,070
Then how about Beast Knight?

688
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,920
Lightning Knight?

689
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,870
Brush Knight?

690
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,000
Hidden Knight!

691
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,550
Your MAA is really

692
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,190
a stagnant swamp.

693
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,960
If I rely on you two...

694
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,670
Oh dear!

695
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,560
Oh dear!

696
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,080
He's so stingy!

697
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,760
He's even upset?

698
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,630
Crane.

699
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,470
What?

700
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,480
Are you afraid to accept the fight?

701
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,680
How about this?

702
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,030
Just hand over the Rockblade,

703
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,190
and I'll cancel our duel right away.

704
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,990
Swallow!

705
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,390
My father is watching

706
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,800
your wicked deeds from the heavens!

707
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,720
You dare to mention Master?

708
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,440
Look what you've done

709
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,080
to the Divine Blade Sect!

710
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,910
With you leading it,

711
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,190
every blade user in the land
will mock you.

712
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,440
Crane?

713
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,110
Can you even take off anymore?

714
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,080
You're not worthy of the Rockblade.

715
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,840
You...

716
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,950
You are...

717
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,400
You are a master killer!

718
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,560
Unforgivable!

719
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,760
I told you

720
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,680
I didn't kill him!

721
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,600
Hold it.

722
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,430
I've thought it over.

723
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,720
Fighting in the streets is uncivilized.

724
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,320
And we could damage public property.

725
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,070
You gave me a challenge, didn't you?

726
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,000
Fine, I accept it.

727
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,040
Two days from now, we settle this
with a fight.

728
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,910
After that fight,

729
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,350
we go our separate ways.

730
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,070
Fate takes us

731
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,040
where it will.

732
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,600
Wait!

733
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,910
Besides all that,

734
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,670
there's the Rockblade.

735
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,550
Whatever.

736
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,550
Alright then.

737
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,240
See you in two days.

738
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,560
You seem really distracted.

739
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,590
I wonder if Zhuge

740
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,310
has enough to eat or

741
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,390
warm clothes to wear.

742
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,960
Now you're worried?

743
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,000
Honestly, if you can't

744
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,910
say the right thing, just say less.

745
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,320
I...

746
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,760
Maybe worry about yourself first.

747
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,160
You're about to face a fight.

748
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,080
What should you do?

749
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,630
Should you fake being sick?

750
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,310
I've never been sick a day in my life.

751
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,430
How do I fake that?

752
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,830
I'm really worried

753
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,080
about you going up against Zhuge Heng.

754
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,960
No,

755
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,830
Crane Knight should fight himself.

756
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,720
He is the Blade God's son, after all.

757
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,920
He's got some skills.

758
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,640
But he said he has a toothache.

759
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,000
A toothache? That's the excuse?

760
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,000
If it's really a toothache,

761
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,920
I can treat it!

762
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,750
Yingdan, calm down.

763
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,760
Let's go!

764
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,180
Wait! Stop! What are you doing?

765
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,320
Weren't you in tooth pain?

766
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,400
She's a physician.

767
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,830
She can cure you.

768
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,880
Nonsense!

769
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,110
It doesn't hurt anymore!

770
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,070
It doesn't?

771
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,960
Then I don't have to fight for you, right?

772
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,590
If I could fight,

773
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,880
why would I even ask you?

774
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,110
That's impossible.

775
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,720
You're the legendary

776
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,630
Dragon-ranked Hero—Crane Knight.

777
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,590
Exactly.

778
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,030
You're that weak?

779
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,590
Good thing I didn't take you
as my master back then.

780
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,360
I...

781
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,470
Sir,

782
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,880
how did you lose to Swallow
back in the day?

783
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,800
Yeah.

784
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,280
To tell you the truth,

785
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,480
my father taught Heichu

786
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,960
all his blade techniques,

787
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,160
but only taught me one move.

788
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,150
Just drawing and swinging the blade.

789
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,590
He called it Lifetime Strike.

790
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,160
Well,

791
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,640
that move can't even slice

792
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,830
a watermelon straight.

793
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,880
So I had no choice but to create
my own sword style.

794
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,910
Of course I lost.

795
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,590
Lifetime Strike?

796
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,910
It sounds impressive.

797
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,910
It's not impressive at all.

798
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,510
Sir,

799
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,390
have you and Swallow always been
at odds?

800
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,480
Not really.

801
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,560
When we were kids,
we were actually pretty close,

802
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,590
always teaming up to outwit my dad.

803
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,630
Hurry up! Dad'll be back soon!

804
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,350
He really didn't notice!

805
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,080
This is our treasure box!

806
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,640
Besides these two keys,

807
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,280
no one can open it.

808
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,590
We hid it well too.

809
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,680
Dad's never moved that painting.

810
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,030
No one knows it's there.

811
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,950
From now on,

812
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,200
this is our secret.

813
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,000
Yeah. Our little secret.

814
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,480
But now, everything's changed.

815
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,110
If you two were that close,

816
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,110
then he definitely wouldn't hurt you.

817
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,950
Sir,

818
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,640
can you show us that

819
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,800
"Lifetime Strike"?

820
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,160
You think I can pull it off?

821
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,000
Who knows? Try it.

822
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Yingdan,

823
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,520
do you really think this move
isn't simple?

824
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,080
I looked up the Divine Blade Sect's
records.

825
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,960
That move has rarely ever been mastered

826
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,840
since the sect was founded.

827
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,920
If the Blade God had him
practice just that move,

828
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,630
there must've been a reason.

829
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,360
What if

830
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,710
his dad was just playing favorites?

831
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,790
That's even less likely.

832
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,440
If he was playing favorites,

833
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,830
he would've handed him
the Rockblade directly.

834
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,590
Then what do we do to help him?

835
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,080
He thinks he's not good enough, right?

836
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,560
Then we make him believe he is.

837
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,790
Give him confidence.

838
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,840
Give him confidence?

839
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,580
(The End of Episode 13)

840
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,630
Heng!

841
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,320
Ling'er!

842
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,440
Heng, you're finally back!

843
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,110
What,

844
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,310
you are sneaking around at home?

845
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,190
I am not.

846
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,280
Right, Heng,

847
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,630
this is your home.

848
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,310
Why is it always you running away?

849
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah, this is my home.

850
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,760
Maybe

851
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,230
I just got used to running away
when I was a kid.

852
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,720
Alright.

853
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,520
Now that you're back, don't leave again.

854
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,110
You know your master.

855
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,080
He's a little crazy, sure,

856
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,840
but not a bad person.

857
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,590
Yeah, Heng,

858
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,590
please don't leave again.

859
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,960
I really missed you.

860
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,800
Yingdan,

861
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,800
who are you talking to?

862
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,720
No one.

863
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,240
No one?

864
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,360
Why did I hear Zhuge's voice?

865
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,470
Forget it.

866
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,880
I'm done thinking about him.

867
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,080
That traitor.

868
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,840
Traitor?

869
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,750
He actually called me a traitor!

870
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,880
That's it!

871
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,150
I'm running away again!

872
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,630
What do we do if he keeps running off
every time

873
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,550
something happens?

874
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,360
