Young man.

00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,360
Sir.

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,110
The salt is nice.

4
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,750
You're too kind, Sir.

5
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,790
Sir,

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,200
when can I

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,270
start to learn martial arts from you?

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,400
Why do you want to learn martial arts?

9
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,550
I... I want to be a great hero.

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,680
No problem.

11
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,190
Let's start tomorrow.

12
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,550
- For real?
- For real.

13
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,790
Thank you, Sir.

14
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,320

61
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,230
Speaking of which,

62
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,080
three years ago,

63
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,150
to make things easier,

64
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,000
I fabricated an identity

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,110
to travel in the martial world.

66
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,600
Back then,

67
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,270
my name was Ge Tianlou.

68
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,560
(He Changzai,)

69
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,320
(I must kill you!)

70
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,030
No wonder you look

71
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,390
so familiar.

72
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,550
Master!

73
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,380
We're finally reunited.

74
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,340
(Chou)

75
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,190
I'll get some good wine,

76
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,800
so we can catch up.

77
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,280
- Stop.
- (Oh, no.)

78
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,880
(Forgot to put it away.)

79
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,950
Martial Artists Association.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,640
Chou-rank hero.

81
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
Gou Lingfeng?

82
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,600
It's Ox Rank.

83
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,790
He's a spy!

84
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,230
No, I...

85
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,200
In that case,

86
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,200
I have to tell you the truth.

87
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,230
Come closer.

88
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,910
Your ear.

89
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,800
Actually,

90
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,120
I'm the sect leader's disciple.

91
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,480
He sent me to the association

92
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,510
as a spy.

93
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,350
This should've been

94
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,240
a secret.

95
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,270
However, Brother Ba,

96
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,120
you're so loyal and righteous.

97
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,070
How could I lie to you?

98
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,480
Don't call me Brother Ba.

99
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,360
Well...

100
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,870
- Brother Ba.
- Shut up!

101
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,910
Today, I'll kill you, traitor.

102
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,640
Demon Blade?

103
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,150
Our old leader's secret blade technique.

104
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,120
You're the old sect leader's disciple?

105
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,830
(Oh my god,)

106
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,830
(the old man is really the leader.)

107
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,150
I was lucky.

108
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,560
Thanks for your warning.

109
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,880
What if

110
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,640
I caught you off guard?

111
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,590
Then I might've killed you.

112
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,360
You've got great martial skills.

113
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,040
And you learned the old sect leader's

114
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,350
secret blade technique
from 20 years ago.

115
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
It won't be difficult for you

116
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,830
to make a name for yourself.

117
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,150
Why join the Martial Artists Association

118
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,070
as a spy?

119
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,910
I told you

120
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,000
the old sect leader sent me!

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,360
The old sect leader sent me!

122
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,680
This title can make things easier.

123
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,270
Stop trying to fool me.

124
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,040
Tell me,

125
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,750
what are you really up to?

126
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,600
Instead of being despised here,

127
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,480
why not return with me
and be the sect leader?

128
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,830
Revitalize the divine sect.

129
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,000
I want to revitalize the divine sect.

130
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,280
What?

131
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,160
You?

132
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,270
Revitalize the divine sect?

133
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,680
Back then,

134
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,710
when I wandered the martial world,

135
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,510
everyone

136
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,710
looked down on me.

137
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,800
Lucky, I was saved

138
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,520
by the old sect leader

139
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,440
and became his last disciple.

140
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,200
He only had one wish.

141
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,910
It's to revitalize the divine sect.

142
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,350
However, all of this

143
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,270
requires money.

144
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,560
So,

145
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,030
you turned to me, a salt smuggler.

146
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,990
Stop it!

147
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,760
Do you have any evidence?

148
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,840
Gou, Gou!

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,040
I believe you now!

150
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,440
Please stop using your power!

151
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,910
I believe you now!

152
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,150
Is this enough?

153
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,590
Indeed.

154
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,950
They're all the old sect leader's
secret skills.

155
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
No wonder

156
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,390
the moment I saw you,

157
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,150
I felt you were

158
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,720
a malicious person

159
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,750
who'd commit all evils,

160
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,070
- harm innocent people,
- Stop!

161
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,710
- and bring disaster...
- Stop, Brother Ba!

162
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,950
Stop praising me.

163
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,840
Okay.

164
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,510
Bro,

165
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,150
I'll show you our business next time.

166
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,560
We'll definitely

167
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,640
make a great fortune.

168
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,240
I'm Zhuge Heng!

169
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,430
Senior Ye, to meet you,

170
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,800
I chose the divine sect's black
as the main color

171
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,310
and wore silver accessories

172
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,600
to present a cold

173
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,750
and mysterious aura.

174
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,270
I shall serve the divine sect!

175
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,740
What?

176
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,720
Come on, Gou.

177
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,070
Look.

178
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,000
Ye.

179
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,750
It's such a big business.

180
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,670
Do you have a client list

181
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,110
or something like that?

182
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,400
Why are you asking about this?

183
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,110
I just want to learn to do business.

184
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,040
Rather than business,

185
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,320
it's

186
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,200
actually

187
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,800
illegal trading.

188
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,470
I don't want

189
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,590
to lead you astray.

190
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,440
We're in the demonic sect.

191
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
Why fear going astray?

192
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,120
What did you say?

193
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,880
I said

194
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,680
this isn't going astray

195
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,320
but helping the people.

196
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,280
Think about it.

197
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,080
Many folks can't get salt.

198
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,990
We buy it for them.

199
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,520
This shouldn't even be called
smuggling salt.

200
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,110
What should it be called?

201
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,870
We should call it

202
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,350
Good Bargain Business.

203
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,320
Sounds a bit rustic.

204
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,350
This is just the beginning.

205
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,350
Once our trade expands,

206
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,560
we'll transport salt by the sea, right?

207
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,200
We can provide a sunrise view service.

208
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,750
That's also a great deal.

209
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,960
Brilliant.

210
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,880
Brilliant!

211
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,110
So brilliant!

212
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,390
Gou,

213
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,560
you're absolutely right.

214
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,750
You're really cut out for this.

215
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,470
After all, I'm from
the Gou Family Trade Association.

216
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,230
With a brother like you,

217
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,800
what more could I ask for?

218
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,040
Bro.

219
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,960
I must write down your brilliant

220
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,880
business ideas.

221
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,190
What?

222
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,400
What's wrong?

223
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,510
Ye,

224
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,350
this...

225
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,870
Mr. Zhuge.

226
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,590
Your Highness.

227
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,990
Your outfit...

228
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,200
I didn't know

229
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,710
you had such a hobby.

230
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,270
But it's quite charming.

231
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,510
Please don't tease me.

232
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,430
Mr. Zhuge.

233
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,870
At the family banquet,

234
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,440
I couldn't fully express

235
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,200
my gratitude for your help.

236
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,990
If you're willing,

237
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,590
I can support you.

238
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,200
Your Highness, you're too kind.

239
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,390
How can you say this?

240
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,790
It was my duty.

241
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,600
I have something to do, so I'll just...

242
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,670
I'll head back.

243
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,630
Goodbye, Your Highness.

244
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,560
Your Highness,

245
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,120
Zhuge Heng

246
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,590
really doesn't know his place.

247
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,590
This

248
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,110
is exactly my type.

249
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,760
Yingdan.

250
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,110
Where's your master?

251
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,630
Don't mention it.

252
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,240
I wanted to create a scene

253
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,150
where I reunite
with my master and my senior

254
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,480
to bring my master out.

255
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,510
Guess what happened at the tavern?

256
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,920
No one was there.

257
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,320
Is your master in danger now?

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,080
I don't think so.

259
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,320
Don't worry, Yingdan.

260
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,270
With his remarkable face,
he looks exactly like

261
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,630
a demonic sect member.

262
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,960
He'll be fine.

263
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,880
Indeed.

264
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,710
I'm so envious.

265
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,320
Yingdan, I'll take a nap first.

266
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,240
I'm exhausted.

267
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,320
Don't sleep.

268
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,750
Let's investigate the molestation.

269
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,320
I need to remove this first.

270
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,560
I look so stupid.

271
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,950
Hurry up.

272
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,800
Rumor has it

273
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,870
that Gou Lingfeng, a Chou-rank hero,

274
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,750
and Princess Linglong

275
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,470
are having an affair.

276
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,920
Mr. Wang.

277
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,200
This is my residence.

278
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,230
They were just cleaning for me.

279
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,000
Misunderstanding.

280
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,630
Missing another inside scoop.

281
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,320
Mr. Wang.

282
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,960
Do you want to know

283
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,680
news from the court?

284
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,590
The court?

285
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,040
Brother Ba.

286
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,750
Gou.

287
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,110
Let's drink.

288
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,510
I haven't had enough.

289
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,430
Okay.

290
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,320
Don't rush to leave, Gou.

291
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,110
Have another drink with me.

292
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,240
Okay.

293
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,350
I'll drink with you.

294
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,080
I, Ye Dahei,

295
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,320
am destined to be a great hero!

296
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,590
Gou.

297
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,350
Actually, my dream

298
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,520
is to become a hero.

299
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,110
It's every man's biggest dream.

300
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,400
Yet, I somehow joined

301
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,710
the demonic sect.

302
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,200
However, I still

303
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,040
care about the people.

304
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,470
I want everyone

305
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,280
to afford salt.

306
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,400
I, Gou Lingfeng,

307
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,160
am also destined to be a great hero!

308
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,630
You...

309
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,920
Ye,

310
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,790
being a hero

311
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,950
is also my biggest dream.

312
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,960
But I

313
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,920
ended up learning demonic skills.

314
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,870
I want to be a hero.

315
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,920
Let's ride a horse to the beach
and enjoy the sea.

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,040
Ye.

317
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,510
You don't look like

318
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,200
a criminal from the demonic sect.

319
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,950
Yingdan,

320
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,480
can we take a short break?

321
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,240
I'm really exhausted.

322
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,160
No, we can't.

323
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,350
Not until we find him.

324
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,880
Get up.

325
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,000
But do we really need to gather

326
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,470
all the one-armed men in Huizhou City?

327
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,710
Ms. Qing said

328
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,320
the molester only had one arm.

329
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,480
It's the fastest way

330
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,990
to gather them together.

331
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,870
This is the last one.

332
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,000
Ms. Qing.

333
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,320
Was it him?

334
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,200
No.

335
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,630
How's that possible?

336
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,200
We've seen every one-armed man
in Huizhou.

337
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,560
None of them?

338
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,720
Yingdan,

339
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,830
none of them.

340
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,360
Qing,

341
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,670
can you describe the molester again?

342
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,990
I'll try to paint him more accurately.

343
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,350
Well, Floral Knight,

344
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,150
I've got water boiling at home.

345
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,390
If there's nothing urgent,

346
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,680
may I leave now?

347
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,910
Be safe on your way home.

348
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,830
There's a molester around.

349
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,040
You...

350
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,560
Ye,

351
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,720
it's so dangerous

352
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,950
to walk on the street

353
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,830
like this.

354
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,800
I heard

355
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,480
both the association and the court

356
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,790
are after you.

357
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,350
Why are you so scared?

358
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,870
The best place to hide

359
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,400
is in plain sight.

360
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,200
The suburbs can't be
as comfortable as here.

361
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,470
Besides,

362
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,590
no one knows what Ye Dahei looks like.

363
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,350
But to be honest, Gou,

364
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,000
you're way more suspicious than me.

365
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,440
I'm more suspicious?

366
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,070
I...

367
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,800
Officer, thanks for your hard work.

368
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,200
What are you doing here?

369
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,120
I...

370
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,060
(Chou)

371
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,160
You're just a Chou-rank hero.

372
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,960
Don't wander around at night.

373
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,800
Take care, Officer.

374
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,040
Ye,

375
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,480
I can't believe it.

376
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,870
What did I just say?

377
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,240
This scene

378
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,150
is perfect for poetry.

379
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,830
Dark windy night,

380
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,960
have a cup of wine.

381
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,800
Brothers in good spirits,

382
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,350
two drunken buddies.

383
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,830
Gou,

384
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,430
how's my poem?

385
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,850
- Just so so.
- You...

386
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,880
Let's go.

387
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,430
Let's take another path.

388
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,040
For what?

389
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,080
Is there an enemy?

390
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,160
No.

391
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,270
It's just a bit dark here.

392
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,870
I'm scared. I'm leaving.

393
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,350
Why are you scared?

394
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,510
Look,

395
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,190
no one is here.

396
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,150
Scared?

397
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,070
What are you scared of?

398
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:21,990
I...

399
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,830
Speaking of which,

400
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,870
there's a molester lately,

401
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,760
which is quite scary.

402
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,110
But given your appearance,

403
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,960
there's no need to worry.

404
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,350
Molester?

405
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,870
I heard it happened nine times.

406
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,040
He's extremely vicious.

407
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Besides...

408
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,600
Besides,

409
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,560
he only has one arm.

410
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,510
Imagine a molester with only one arm

411
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,400
committing nine crimes.

412
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,320
That's unbelievable.

413
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,350
Well, Gou,

414
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,830
I have to go.

415
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,120
Ye!

416
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,040
Sacred?

417
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,240
What is he scared of?

418
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,110
Ghost!

419
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,150
How's that possible?

420
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,350
The descriptions of the other victims

421
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,480
are different from Qing's.

422
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Her description

423
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,320
differs from the others.

424
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,520
Could it be

425
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,440
there's more than one molester
in Huizhou City?

426
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,640
I also think

427
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,920
Qing's description

428
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,960
differs from

429
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,480
the other victims' words.

430
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,750
Is it possible

431
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,390
that Qing lied?

432
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Let's go.

433
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,110
Yingdan, where are you going?

434
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,720
Keep an eye on Qing and the others.

435
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,070
I'll definitely find some clues.

436
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,520
Yingdan, wait for me.

437
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,830
- Hurry up.
- I want to sleep!

438
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,000
Stop complaining. Hurry!

439
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,920
Come on.

440
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,080
(Buns)

441
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,920
Delicious.

442
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,240
- Veggie and meat.
- See you next time.

443
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
- Sir, which filling?
- Yes.

444
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,080
These two,

445
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,350
a veggie bun and a meat bun.

446
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,200
- That's right.
- Coming.

447
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,350
Don't rush. Wait in the line.

448
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,200
Line up, all of you.

449
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,190
Don't forget to pay.

450
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,000
Hurry up.

451
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,800
Did you bring it?

452
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,800
It's here.

453
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,680
Only the best.

454
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,590
Okay.

455
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,510
Here.

456
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,920
The heat's on these days.

457
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,190
Not much stock left.

458
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,440
No matter what,

459
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,240
our supplies can't stop.

460
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,640
Something went wrong.

461
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,880
We don't dare to restock.

462
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,960
Risking life for this stuff

463
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,160
is not worth it.

464
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,800
- What?
- Are you raising prices?

465
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Given the current situation,

466
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,480
even raising prices won't help.

467
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,000
You should be more careful.

468
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,350
Just go. Hurry.

469
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,550
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

470
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,470
Stop!

471
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,640
Stop!

472
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,480
Officers!

473
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,080
Don't run! Stop!

474
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Help!

475
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,160
- Help!
- Officers, mercy!

476
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,960
- Officers, mercy!
- Help!

477
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,670
Officers, mercy!

478
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,160
Wait, this...

479
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,430
Officers, mercy!

480
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,000
The court forbids

481
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,560
the selling

482
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,040
or purchasing of illicit salt.

483
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,760
Violators

484
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,350
will be severely punished.

485
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,190
As for salt smugglers,

486
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,560
we will punish all of them

487
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,000
without mercy!

488
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,240
What salt is this?

489
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,430
All illicit salt buyers

490
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,280
will be considered accomplices

491
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,560
and won't be pardoned.

492
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,870
Everyone,

493
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,240
stay away from illegal salt,

494
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,390
or you'll be punished!

495
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,760
I hope you can

496
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,060
keep that in mind.

497
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,640
Sir,

498
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,070
did we go a bit too far?

499
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,070
I think...

500
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,480
Do you think I wanted this?

501
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,960
He Changzai said

502
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,390
only in this way

503
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,630
can we lure Ye Dahei out.

504
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,600
Your Highness.

505
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,110
The situation in Huizhou
is complicated now.

506
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,720
You should stay at home.

507
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,480
Mind your own business.

508
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,510
You've stirred up chaos in Huizhou.

509
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,320
That's not like you.

510
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,830
This list is very important.

511
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,750
If it gets leaked, it'll affect not only

512
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,430
my godfather but your father.

513
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,640
There are countless ways
to find Ye Dahei.

514
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,750
However,

515
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,960
you chose the foolish one.

516
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,120
Your Highness.

517
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,510
If you have extra salt,

518
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,830
can you send some

519
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,520
to Zhuge Heng's place?

520
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,350
The people of Huizhou

521
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,480
are almost out of salt.

522
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,310
- I'm worried...
- You're worried

523
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,320
that Ma Yingdan has no salt for meals.

524
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,680
I'll keep all my

525
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,800
promises.

526
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,920
Don't worry.

527
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,350
I'll help you.

528
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,030
By the way,

529
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,720
if there's news about Ye Dahei,

530
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,720
I'll tell you right away.

531
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,750
Don't do anything foolish again.

532
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,670
I got it.

533
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,280
Idiot!

534
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,870
What's wrong, Ye?

535
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,950
Gou.

536
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,190
You're just in time.

537
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,590
Do you know?

538
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,000
The magistrate's office

539
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
openly burned a huge batch of

540
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,110
my salt.

541
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,150
I really don't understand.

542
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,910
Didn't they

543
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,530
tacitly allow salt smuggling?

544
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,480
I thought they were just pretending

545
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,190
when the heat was on.

546
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,000
But this time,

547
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,080
they're actually serious.

548
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,550
Looks like someone wants

549
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,150
to hog all the profits.

550
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,720
How's that possible?

551
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,560
Both the association and the court

552
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,240
want to benefit the people.

553
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,980
How could they collude with you?

554
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,210
Gou,

555
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,950
you still don't understand.

556
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,640
Forget it.

557
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,760
Can you help me think of a solution?

558
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,310
I need to deliver the salt safely

559
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,080
to the people who need it.

560
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,670
Ye.

561
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,830
The most

562
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,110
important thing right now

563
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,240
is the list you have.

564
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,350
To be honest,

565
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,830
when I was undercover

566
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,110
in the association,

567
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,430
they sent me here

568
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,870
to get that list.

569
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,640
Why not give me the list

570
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,910
so that I can distract them?

571
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,800
That's right.

572
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,640
I trust your martial arts.

573
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,630
Let me look for it.

574
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,670
Wait a minute.

575
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,320
Which group are you undercover for?

576
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,110
For the Martial Artists Association.

577
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
You?

578
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,200
A spy of
the Martial Artists Association?

579
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,120
I...

580
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,960
A member of the demonic sect?

581
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,440
More precisely,

582
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,670
a hero who learned demonic skills.

583
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,880
Then you're somehow

584
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,670
a demonic sect spy
in the Martial Artists Association.

585
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,110
Ye,

586
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,830
just put these aside.

587
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,200
Give me the list first.

588
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,870
By the way, why did you hide it there?

589
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,920
I thought I found

590
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,280
a like-minded brother.

591
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,520
However...

592
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,320
Stop!

593
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,760
Gui Lao?

594
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,760
I'm not the sect leader.

595
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,520
He'll be the next sect leader?

596
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,470
Master.

597
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,240
Don't push me.

598
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,350
Do you mean he'll be our next leader?

599
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,190
Don't underestimate him.

600
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,870
Neither of us can match him.

601
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,630
Look at him.

602
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,110
He doesn't look like our allies at all!

603
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,560
He does.

604
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,220
But he's clearly
working for the association.

605
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,160
Ye.

606
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,200
I admit

607
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,350
I approached you for the list.

608
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,270
But now,

609
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,240
I think we're alike.

610
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,630
I don't want anything to happen to you.

611
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,910
See?

612
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,510
My disciple

613
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,150
is just too kind.

614
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,960
Are you serious?

615
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,160
Deadly serious,

616
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,350
except for one thing.

617
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,550
He deserves to die!

618
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,110
- Hey.
- What's going on?

619
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,830
Whether he likes it or not,

620
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,760
he'll soon become the new sect leader.

621
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,760
What do you mean?

622
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,350
Listen,

623
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,390
I'm very popular in the association!

624
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,630
Is that so?

625
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,280
Gou Lingfeng,

626
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,910
in the association,

627
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,870
if you use demonic skills,

628
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,190
they'll see you
as a demonic sect member.

629
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,280
If you don't use them,

630
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,390
you'll be a loser.

631
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,720
You're popular?

632
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,590
You know nothing!

633
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,830
Once I get the hero token,

634
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,590
I'll...

635
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,440
Hero token?

636
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,400
Tell me,

637
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,920
how will you get it?

638
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,960
With my companions.

639
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,960
A brat from the Sword Alliance

640
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,190
and a toxic woman everyone avoids?

641
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,000
I've told you

642
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,560
to stay away from that brat.

643
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,830
I won't!

644
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,240
Gou?

645
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,760
Do you have some misunderstandings
about the divine sect?

646
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,240
Misunderstandings?

647
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,080
I saw them kill my nanny.

648
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,480
Seeing isn't always believing.

649
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,760
You've been in the association
for a while.

650
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,000
Is what you see

651
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,590
always what you desire?

652
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,040
Gou,

653
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,480
do you really think

654
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,240
our brothers can open

655
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,190
the salt smuggling channels?

656
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,960
What do you mean?

657
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,520
The list records

658
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,910
the entire salt smuggling network.

659
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,630
Martial Artists Association,

660
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,790
the magistrate's office,

661
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,870
and even the court.

662
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,060
Many high officials are involved.

663
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,430
Without official approval,

664
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,200
how could we build

665
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,760
such a complete network.

666
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,870
For so many years,

667
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,350
we've been doing this business

668
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,390
with official protection.

669
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,800
However,

670
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,800
someone wants a monopoly now.

671
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,480
You're lying.

672
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,480
You're a traitor.

673
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,160
The court provides me with food.

674
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,270
You eat my salt.

675
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,550
Your salt is illegal.

676
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,680
I wouldn't touch it.

677
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,240
You wouldn't touch it?

678
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,550
- What about all the dishes?
- I...

679
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,920
Enough, enough.

680
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,670
Why can't you be serious?

681
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:33,990
Ye.

682
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,390
I promise,

683
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,520
if you give me the list,

684
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,750
I can let them

685
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,310
go easy on you

686
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,960
and spare your life.

687
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,590
Naive.

688
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,190
When will you stop dreaming?

689
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,080
Gou Lingfeng,

690
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,270
do you really want me

691
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,960
to reveal your true identity

692
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,480
to the association?

693
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,560
Hey, how can you...

694
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,920
Get out.

695
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,470
Out!

696
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,320
Gou Lingfeng!

697
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,240
Gou Lingfeng, you...

698
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,760
Are we really letting him go?

699
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,720
He's not as simple as you think.

700
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,630
Look at him.

701
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,720
How could he be a sect leader?

702
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,430
Well,

703
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,030
do you think I'm wrong?

704
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,950
It's not like that.

705
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,350
I trust you.

706
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,630
That's why

707
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,800
I don't want him
to get involved in this.

708
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,630
Stick to the original plan.

709
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,240
Remember,

710
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
protect that list.

711
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,510
If it's lost,

712
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,720
we'll lose a key advantage

713
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,280
against them.

714
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,840
Got it.

715
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,590
Vice Chairman He,

716
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,000
why do we have to meet

717
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,510
at this place?

718
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,550
Do you think we're

719
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,190
too noticeable now?

720
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,510
According to reliable sources,

721
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,590
the best place to meet a spy

722
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,320
is on the rooftop.

723
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,960
How's it going with Ye Dahei?

724
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,100
It's almost done.

725
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,920
His men trust me a lot now.

726
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,390
I'll meet Ye Dahei soon.

727
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,920
Lingfeng,

728
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
I knew I was right.

729
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,280
I knew you could make it.

730
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,670
Vice Chairman He,

731
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,750
I have a question.

732
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,750
Go ahead.

733
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,350
If I can persuade Ye Dahei

734
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,830
to hand over the list,

735
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,280
can we be lenient with him?

736
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,240
Lingfeng,

737
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,390
don't be blinded by your emotions.

738
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,830
Ye Dahei is a salt smuggler
from the demonic sect.

739
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,790
He's our enemy.

740
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,070
You can't shield him!

741
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,070
I'm not shielding him.

742
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,440
Why are you so stubborn?

743
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,510
How am I stubborn?

744
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,160
If I persuade him to hand over the list,

745
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,590
we'll get what we want, right?

746
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,590
In that case,

747
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,320
would his death

748
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,350
benefit you or the association

749
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,630
- at all?
- You...

750
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Fine.

751
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,910
As long as you get the list,

752
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,400
he can even join the association

753
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,590
and become one of us,

754
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,590
and I won't stop it.

755
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,560
You agreed?

756
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,750
I always thought you were just

757
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,160
a greedy and pretentious man

758
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,310
who only thinks about nasty things.

759
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,910
I didn't expect you to be...

760
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,960
Please stop

761
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,630
praising me.

762
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,680
Alright, Vice Chairman He,

763
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,430
wait for my good news.

764
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,260
(Martial Artists Association)

765
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,590
I always feel Gou Lingfeng

766
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,150
is too naive

767
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,430
and single-minded.

768
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,070
If we only

769
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,830
count on him,

770
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,080
I'm afraid something will go wrong.

771
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,680
You should find

772
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,040
Ye Dahei as soon as possible.

773
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,670
When necessary,

774
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,320
you can kill a few demonic sect members.

775
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,150
Why don't you kill them?

776
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,720
Don't instruct me.

777
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,870
You've stirred up

778
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,240
chaos in Huizhou City.

779
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,430
If this continues,

780
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,480
it might lead to a disaster.

781
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
Mr. Deng,

782
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,390
you were the one
who asked for my help.

783
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,480
Don't act like you're innocent, okay?

784
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,550
Besides,

785
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,800
I'm only good at planning
behind the scenes.

786
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,270
Alright, once it's done,

787
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,670
I'll give you more credit.

788
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,560
The heat's on these days.

789
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,830
I made a lot of effort

790
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,760
just to secretly distribute some salt.

791
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,960
It's hard for people to get salt.

792
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,080
Ye.

793
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,870
I've discussed it
with the vice chairman.

794
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,190
He said if you hand over the list,

795
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,720
you can join our association.

796
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,110
Gou.

797
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,830
It's not that I don't trust you.

798
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,190
I just don't trust
those so-called righteous people.

799
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,670
They look virtuous,

800
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,720
but they're all liars.

801
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,960
But you...

802
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,350
Kneel, kneel!

803
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,440
How dare you?

804
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,480
Deng Yunfeng.

805
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,190
Tell me, where is Ye Dahei?

806
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
If you have clues,

807
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,110
I can spare your life.

808
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,550
Ye!

809
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,760
He's my brother!

810
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,520
Stay calm.

811
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,440
They just want to lure you out.

812
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,710
Quite stubborn, huh?

813
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,080
I have many ways

814
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,920
to make you speak.

815
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,320
Take them back.

816
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,510
Ye! Ye!

817
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,590
- No!
- Ye!

818
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,630
Disgusting!

819
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,880
Gou Lingfeng,

820
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,040
look at this.

821
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,040
Are they really
as righteous as you think?

822
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,940
(The End of Episode 10)

823
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,750
Thank you for saving me.

824
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,480
(Yixiang Garden)
Can you take me away?

825
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,480
If you're willing to wait,

826
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,400
I'll definitely

827
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,150
come back for you in five years.

828
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,360
I'll wait for you.

829
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,750
Do you know Hexi?

830
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,590
Hexi?

831
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
It's a beautiful place,

832
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,920
with towering trees,

833
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,190
all kinds of flowers,

834
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,440
and the sea.

835
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,440
Have you seen the sea?

836
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,590
No.

837
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,110
When I'm back,

838
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,040
I'll be successful.

839
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,070
We'll ride a horse

840
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,840
to the beach and enjoy the sea.
