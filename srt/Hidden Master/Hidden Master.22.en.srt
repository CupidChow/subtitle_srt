1
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,080
You're famous!

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,480
Master, check this out!

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,110
You're so famous.

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,350
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,750
(Gou Lingfeng, True Hero)

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,670
This...

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,800
Is this me?

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,640
Of course.

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,510
Yingdan.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,190
- Is this you?
- Though not as cool as me,

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,350
you can barely count as a gentleman.

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,350
Nonsense.

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,440
Gou looks way cooler than you now.

14
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,550
Besides,

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,190
you haven't got a makeover
for a long time.

16
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,960
Let's get a makeover. Come on.

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,800

=Episode 22=

64
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,080
First, your appearance.

65
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,430
Lingfeng, the scar from your childhood

66
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,710
has affected your appearance

67
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,150
and made people look down on you.

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,960
That's why your popularity ranking

69
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,030
in the association

70
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,150
isn't very high.

71
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,030
Not just that.

72
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,560
My master

73
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,190
has topped the Least Popular Heroes

74
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,750
for a long time.

75
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,870
Watch your language.

76
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,750
Your master may not be good-looking,

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,960
but he's a good person.

78
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,080
I'm not saying he's bad.

79
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,800
Ling'er, you really can do this?

80
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,120
Ling'er, good job.

81
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,710
What good job?

82
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,120
It's because I have a good foundation.

83
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,560
I've told you

84
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,520
I grow on people.

85
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,190
Now that the scar is gone,

86
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,470
you're officially a hero.

87
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,910
Just like that?

88
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,240
How's that possible?

89
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,520
Next,

90
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,800
your dressing style.

91
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,600
This outfit

92
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,630
looks way too odd.

93
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll go change it.

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,840
Wait a minute.

95
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,150
That's it.

96
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,510
Uphold the martial world's...

97
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,510
- Uphold...
- Principles.

98
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,510
Uphold the martial world's principles.
And...

99
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,400
Huizhou...

100
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,470
Keep reciting.

101
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,600
This is too hard.

102
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,750
Is this really important?

103
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,120
Of course.

104
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,120
It's not the hero I expected.

105
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,480
Gou,

106
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,480
what are your definitions of a hero?

107
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,920
Well, you must be like...

108
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,480
You need to uphold justice

109
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,920
- Uphold justice
- and eliminate the evil.

110
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,120
and eliminate the evil.

111
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,310
Who are you?

112
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,470
I'm Peng!

113
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,800
Wang Zipeng, why are you here again?

114
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,270
- They called me over.
- Listen,

115
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,360
don't believe or spread rumors.

116
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,040
It's a good virtue.

117
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,320
Lingfeng.

118
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,440
Don't be nervous.

119
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,480
I especially hired Mr. Wang

120
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,950
to boost your reputation.

121
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,120
Boost my reputation?

122
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,040
Him?

123
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,880
Yes.

124
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,920
Your appearance
and dressing style are good.

125
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,390
But you need a good reputation.

126
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,390
Reputation...

127
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,520
Chairman.

128
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,920
Is this the right thing to do?

129
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,000
I never expected someone

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,270
like my master

131
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,360
would chase fame and vanity.

132
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,240
Nonsense.

133
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,120
Listen to me.

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,600
This is necessary for

135
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,560
the Hero Gathering.

136
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,830
Without these things,

137
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,750
how can others notice you?

138
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,040
Let alone acknowledge you.

139
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,240
Were you lying about those

140
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,360
great ambitions?

141
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,830
No, of course not.

142
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,960
Good, then.

143
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,040
Mr. Wang.

144
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,950
Yes.

145
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,630
I want to hear about

146
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,960
and see

147
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,800
articles about Gou Lingfeng,
the Tiger-rank hero,

148
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,630
especially praising him

149
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,630
for his good deeds of

150
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,360
eliminating the demonic remnants
and upholding justice

151
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,800
and his good relationships with friends

152
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,560
and local people.

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,840
Do you have a problem?

154
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,510
Well, what you said...

155
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,120
has no basis.

156
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,070
What... What are you talking about?

157
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,680
Think of something.

158
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,520
Dig deeper.

159
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,590
I'll dig.

160
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,880
Lingfeng,

161
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,630
tomorrow is
the Hero Promotion Commendation Ceremony.

162
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,950
You must memorize it tonight,

163
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,790
understand?

164
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,390
Still not over?

165
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,360
Floral Knight.

166
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,240
If he doesn't memorize it tonight,

167
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,190
don't let him sleep.

168
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,030
Okay.

169
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,000
Do I really have to memorize it?

170
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,840
Yes.

171
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,670
Your Highness.

172
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,110
Your Highness.

173
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,390
Wu Guangming asked me again

174
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,510
to write about
Gou Lingfeng's heroic deeds.

175
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,190
It's like I'm his

176
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,470
personal reporter.

177
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,480
Finally.

178
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,240
I've heard about this.

179
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,950
Just follow Wu Guangming's instructions.

180
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,510
You want me to write about

181
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,240
such a minor figure?

182
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,310
Write about him?

183
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,950
What if I told you

184
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,600
Gou Lingfeng will stir up

185
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,510
a storm in the association,

186
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,720
would you still think he's insignificant?

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,840
Gou Lingfeng?

188
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,750
What kind of storm could he stir up?

189
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,390
Just write as Wu Guangming instructed.

190
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,830
Then let's wait and see.

191
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,200
Of course,

192
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,510
don't focus only on writing the article.

193
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,630
You need to add some fuel

194
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,240
when necessary.

195
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,070
I don't even want to write...

196
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,470
I...

197
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,640
Go ahead.

198
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,310
Once you make a mess,

199
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,510
someone will surely lose patience.

200
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
By then,

201
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,920
you'll be rewarded.

202
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,600
Didn't I ask you to memorize it?

203
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,040
Uncle Wu,

204
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,870
I really can't.

205
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,070
It... It's too hard.

206
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,800
Then just read it aloud later.

207
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,870
You can do that, right?

208
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,000
Read it aloud?

209
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,830
But I'm still nervous.

210
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't be nervous.

211
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,630
You'll face much bigger events.

212
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,830
Just relax.

213
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,670
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

214
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,660
(Tiger-Rank Loyalty Knight,
Gou Lingfeng's Promotion)

215
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,840
(Righteous and Mighty)

216
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,680
Today,

217
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,960
Gou Lingfeng will be officially

218
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,870
promoted to a Tiger-rank hero.

219
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,150
- He looks cool.
- Citizens of Huizhou,

220
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,120
please celebrate with us.

221
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,670
As we know,

222
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,330
since joining us,

223
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,440
Gou Lingfeng has been

224
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,120
working

225
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,550
tirelessly

226
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,960
and always prioritizing chivalry
above all.

227
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,270
He's a true role model for young heroes

228
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,240
and a great example of righteousness!

229
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,790
Therefore,
we honor him with the title of

230
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,270
Loyalty Knight!

231
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,790
Loyalty Knight!

232
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,790
Now, let's welcome

233
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,240
Gou Lingfeng

234
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,630
to give a speech.

235
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,510
Loyalty Knight!

236
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,390
We live for justice.

237
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,960
Dear citizens of Huizhou City,

238
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,840
dear comrades
of the Martial Artists Association,

239
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,320
good morning!

240
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,200
I'm very honored

241
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,670
to share this moment with you.

242
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,080
I, Gou Lingfeng, hereby swear...

243
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,390
Hereby swear...

244
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,150
I shall uphold
the martial world's principles

245
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,960
and try my best

246
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,440
to protect the people.

247
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,960
Without taking sober steps...

248
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,840
Solid steps!

249
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,510
Without taking soul steps...

250
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,510
one cannot reach
the destination miles away.

251
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,560
Say goodbye...

252
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,720
Well, I... I don't

253
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,390
know how to make a speech

254
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,630
or brag about myself.

255
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,150
But when I was young,

256
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,480
I saw my nanny killed by the demonic sect.

257
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,550
Since that day,

258
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,030
I've had a wish.

259
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,200
I hope

260
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,840
the weak will no longer be bullied,

261
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,630
and the strong will know fear.

262
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,960
I hope there will be
no weak or strong people.

263
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,270
Take Huizhou as an example,

264
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,150
I hope everyone can live in peace,

265
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,390
with the elders
cared for by their children,

266
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,510
children receiving proper education,

267
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,630
and couples cherishing each other.

268
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,720
I hope everyone can be happy.

269
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,030
I, Gou Lingfeng, swear

270
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,720
to kick all demon...

271
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,480
all evildoers

272
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,960
out of Huizhou City

273
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,030
and bring peace to everyone.

274
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,150
Bravo!

275
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,510
Well said!

276
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:46,600
Loyalty Knight! Loyalty Knight!

277
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,750
Why are you waiting for?

278
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,800
Sit down.

279
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,150
Uncle Wu,

280
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,270
I didn't mean to skip this.

281
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,600
I... I just couldn't do it.

282
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,390
It was too hard for me.

283
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,080
You did well today.

284
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,510
I'm proud of you.

285
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,630
Really?

286
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,630
Of course.

287
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,960
As a hero,

288
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,150
you expressed your true feelings,

289
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,270
which resonated with the people

290
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,270
of Huizhou City.

291
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,630
I think it's great.

292
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,750
Lingfeng,

293
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,150
you have a bright future.

294
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,510
Thank you, Uncle Wu.

295
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,630
Can I start preparing for
the Hero Gathering?

296
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,510
Of course.

297
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,270
But my demonic skills...

298
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,630
I've told you I can help you.

299
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,470
Uncle Wu.

300
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,720
Loyalty Knight!

301
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,440
So handsome! I saw Loyalty Knight!

302
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,630
- Let's go!
- So cool!

303
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,470
Let's go!

304
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,440
Loyalty Knight!

305
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,630
- We love you, Loyalty Knight!
- Hello.

306
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,600
I will come back!

307
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,390
- I will come back!
- Loyalty Knight!

308
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,960
Are you insane?

309
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,270
He's already lost his mind.

310
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,320
Master, you can't do this.

311
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,150
I heard that back then, the Crane Knight

312
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,910
started to fall like this.

313
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,320
What do you mean by "fall"?

314
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,910
It's growth.

315
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,910
Nonsense.

316
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,750
Lingfeng.

317
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,320
You keep saying
you want to be a great hero.

318
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,480
Do you want to show off?

319
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,840
Of course not.

320
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,270
So tone it down a bit.

321
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,910
I know

322
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,390
you all despise
the association's way of doing things.

323
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,390
But Chairman Wu is right.

324
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,750
If I want to go to the Hero Gathering

325
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,870
and get the hero token,

326
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,150
I have to accept this.

327
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,600
It's not that I want fame and vanity.

328
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,510
I just have no choice.

329
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,390
Gou Lingfeng,

330
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,510
you used to despise these

331
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,150
pretentious words the most.

332
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,960
Exactly. You're so pretentious now.

333
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,630
If you want to be a great hero,

334
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,030
earn it with real skills

335
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,510
instead of doing this.

336
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,080
Don't worry.

337
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,790
I know what I'm doing.

338
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,630
You...

339
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,680
Don't worry.

340
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,750
Don't worry.

341
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,920
Forget it.

342
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,510
Zhuge and Ling'er's marriage

343
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,600
has been delayed because of us.

344
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,270
Now we finally have time.

345
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,270
It's time to arrange their wedding.

346
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,560
It's time.

347
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,440
Isn't this the legendary Loyalty Knight?

348
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,000
You're just a Tiger-rank hero.

349
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,550
Look how proud you are.

350
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,510
Even though you hid that scar,

351
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,120
you still look so annoying to me.

352
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,080
Deng Yunfeng,

353
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,030
I'm working for Chairman Wu now.

354
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,670
Watch your mouth.

355
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,360
Wu Guangming.

356
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,360
How dare you disrespect Chairman Wu?

357
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,600
Do you want to be kicked out of Huizhou?

358
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,200
I'm the Chief Constable
of the Prison Suppression Division

359
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,870
and the inspector
of Martial Artists Association.

360
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,750
I serve the imperial court faithfully

361
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,440
and protect the people.

362
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,600
Who are you to criticize me?

363
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,670
Mr. Deng,

364
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,030
you got me wrong.

365
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,600
I'm just here to check
the preparations for the Hero Gathering

366
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,630
as instructed by Chairman Wu.

367
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,480
Gou Lingfeng.

368
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,240
I don't care who you work for.

369
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,080
The future of the martial world
belongs to us young ones.

370
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,150
We don't have to hold

371
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,000
grudges against each other, right?

372
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,840
Who?

373
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,390
You and me?

374
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,480
Who's your peer?

375
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,590
I'm

376
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,440
a great hero in the martial world,

377
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,630
while you're

378
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,600
a lackey of the imperial court.

379
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,000
We walk different paths,

380
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,120
so we can't work together.

381
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,550
Look how arrogant and ignorant you are.

382
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,670
Do you really want
to collude with Wu Guangming?

383
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,440
Don't you dare insult Chairman Wu!

384
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,000
Eunuch Deng, your godfather,

385
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,030
is the real evildoer who's committed

386
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,080
countless crimes.

387
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
Who are you to judge others?

388
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,670
Now that you've been promoted,

389
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,320
so you think you're so capable, right?

390
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,790
Mr. Deng.

391
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,030
Eunuch Deng told you

392
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,360
to see the bigger picture.

393
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,440
Gou Lingfeng.

394
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,480
I don't believe you can
stir up any storms.

395
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,840
Are you going to

396
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,480
gather all your allies
from the demonic sect?

397
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,030
That's great. I'll capture them all.

398
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,200
You can try.

399
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,630
We'll see.

400
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,630
Lingfeng, don't be afraid.

401
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,550
We'll protect you!

402
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,670
Yes, we'll protect you!

403
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,670
Stop bullying common people!

404
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,630
Don't let fame

405
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,750
blind you!

406
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,350
- Officials are beating people!
- Let's go!

407
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,080
Come on.

408
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,440
(Sword Pavilion)

409
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,280
Ling'er.

410
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,560
Wait for me here.

411
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,460
I'll buy you some new clothes.

412
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,120
Heng, no need to spend so much.

413
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,360
You're about to become a bride.

414
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,120
You must dress up.

415
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,960
Wait for me here.

416
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,300
(Sword Pavilion)

417
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,160
Liu!

418
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,600
Why are you hiding?

419
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,920
Come out!

420
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,870
Why are you hiding?

421
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,990
I need some money.

422
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,720
My Lord, it's not that
I don't want to give you money.

423
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,390
The Sword Alliance's shops

424
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,200
are currently running at a loss.

425
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,430
There's no silver left.

426
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,350
Don't try to fool me.

427
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,060
All the heroes of the association

428
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,300
bought their swords here.

429
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,540
That was in the past.

430
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,340
The trade association in Mobei

431
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,980
also opened a sword workshop.

432
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,700
I heard they asked Crane Knight
to endorse it.

433
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,180
Now, many young people

434
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,180
prefer to buy swords
from their association.

435
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,940
We also have a Tiger-rank hero.

436
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,380
Listen, post my portrait

437
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,220
at the entrance tomorrow.

438
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,180
Give me some money now.

439
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,540
No money left.

440
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,100
This is ridiculous.

441
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,460
I need to talk to them in person.

442
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,300
From now on,
the Sword Alliance's business

443
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,180
needs to count on you.

444
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,620
I'll finish this one.

445
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,500
Well,

446
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,380
I'll finish another one

447
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,500
to entertain you.

448
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,860
Mr. Zhuge,

449
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,740
it's not that
we don't respect the Sword Alliance.

450
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,140
However, the swords forged by
Mobei Trade Association

451
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,260
are not only cheaper

452
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,380
but uniquely designed.

453
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,020
The blades even have
the Crane Knight's signature.

454
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,780
They've launched a Penglai Pavilion
recommended sword,

455
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,020
with the same tassel as Crane Knight's.

456
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,660
Their goods indeed have a broader market.

457
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,140
Mr. Zang,

458
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,140
you might not know this.

459
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,140
Our swords

460
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,540
might be a bit expensive,

461
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,180
but our quality,

462
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,020
craftsmanship,

463
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,100
and materials

464
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,380
are so much better than common ones.

465
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,300
That's true.

466
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,140
But nowadays,

467
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,500
who cares about the sharpness

468
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
or durability of weapons?

469
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,620
As long as the design
is novel and distinctive,

470
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,780
it'll sell well.

471
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,340
Zang,

472
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,140
no matter what,

473
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,740
we need to respect the Sword Saint.

474
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,780
How about this?

475
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,020
Mr. Zhuge,

476
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,140
finish this drink first,

477
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,380
then let's talk, okay?

478
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,740
Okay.

479
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,180
Zhuge.

480
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,060
What are you doing?

481
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,620
Master,

482
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,820
why are you here?

483
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,660
Zhuge,

484
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,860
how could you demean yourself like this?

485
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,860
Demean himself?

486
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,500
Young man, you're so arrogant.

487
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,940
Well,

488
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,340
is doing business embarrassing?

489
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,260
No, Mr. Qian.

490
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,500
I've seen many great heroes.

491
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,740
Let's talk about Crane Knight.

492
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,780
Every time he loses at mahjong,

493
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,860
he refuses to pay.

494
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,220
He's a Dragon-rank hero now,

495
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,500
but he's never changed.

496
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,300
Hero.

497
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,660
Isn't it just a title to scam money?

498
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,380
A Dragon-rank hero is no exception.

499
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,700
Do you even have room
to fall from grace?

500
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,100
You're merely Tiger-rank heroes.

501
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,140
There's definitely room to fall!

502
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,340
What hero

503
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,620
are you again?

504
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
Sorry,

505
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,380
I can't remember.

506
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,580
Sir,

507
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,900
my master is quite

508
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,500
straightforward and clumsy.

509
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,180
I apologize

510
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,500
to all of you.

511
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,340
Zhuge...

512
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,540
Good.

513
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,620
Mr. Zhuge, you're truly generous.

514
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,860
How about this?

515
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,540
As Mr. Qian said,

516
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,900
we need to respect the Sword Saint.

517
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,900
The Zang Family Trade Association

518
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,660
orders one sword

519
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,780
from the Sword Alliance.

520
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,060
Okay!

521
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,620
The Zhang Family Shop

522
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,300
also orders

523
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,500
one sword!

524
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Great, great.

525
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,340
The Qian family also orders one sword.

526
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,500
Mr. Zhuge,

527
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,300
thank you for hosting us today.

528
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,940
We have other things to do.

529
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,140
We'll take our leave now.

530
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,540
Let's go.

531
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,980
The Gou Family Trade Association

532
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,140
orders

533
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,460
ten thousand swords.

534
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,020
Ten thousand?

535
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,660
I, Gou Lingfeng
of the Gou Family Trade Association,

536
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,180
haven't taken over the family business,

537
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,780
but if I don't want

538
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,660
to do business with you,

539
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,140
my word will still count.

540
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,860
Mr. Zhuge,

541
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,660
I was in a hurry

542
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,100
and forgot to pay the deposit.

543
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,140
I ordered 3000 swords.

544
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,180
When will they be delivered?

545
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,100
3000 swords?

546
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,780
I thought it was one.

547
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,540
Mr. Zhuge, you must be drunk.

548
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,460
Yes, exactly.

549
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,900
Each of us clearly ordered

550
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,100
3000 swords.

551
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,700
Isn't that right?

552
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,540
Yes, that's right.

553
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,380
3000 swords.

554
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,500
Here is my deposit.

555
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,550
3000 swords.

556
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,540
3000 swords.

557
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,680
3000 swords for each family.

558
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,420
Didn't we have a deal?

559
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,420
Yes.

560
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,780
Mr. Gou.

561
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,900
Mr. Gou.

562
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,940
I was too blind

563
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,140
to recognize you.

564
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,420
We will visit you next time.

565
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,620
Yes, yes.

566
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,660
Visit you.

567
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,340
Well,

568
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,180
we'll take our leave.

569
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,300
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

570
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,660
Let's go.

571
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,020
3000 swords.

572
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,700
(Dragon)

573
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,380
All-Around Knight!

574
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,020
Who are you, brat?

575
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,380
We're the honor guards

576
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,900
of All-Around Knight, a Dragon-rank hero

577
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,380
who ranks only second to
Chairman Wu Guangming.

578
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,620
If you scare our horses,

579
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,780
can you be responsible?

580
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,540
Get lost!

581
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,860
Ji Yue!

582
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,510
All-Around Knight!

583
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,060
How can you hurt a child?

584
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,380
Little girl, are you alright?

585
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,020
You must be freaked out.

586
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,420
I'm sorry for that.

587
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,460
Sir, you're so handsome.

588
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,100
Little girl,

589
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,100
take this money and buy some candy.

590
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,980
Let's buy some candy.

591
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,620
Let's go.

592
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,660
Aye.

593
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,980
Do you want to drink yourself to death?

594
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,460
Can you recognize yourself?

595
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,260
Besides,

596
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,780
how could you...

597
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,340
How could I...

598
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,620
How could I drink with them?

599
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,180
How could I...

600
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,740
lower myself to beg others?

601
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,700
How could I swallow my pride

602
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,500
for just a small deal?

603
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,900
Yes. How could you do that?

604
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,980
You are the honorable Zhuge Heng!

605
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,220
Now you've been stained by money.

606
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,620
My father was right.

607
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,700
Only by

608
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,020
doing business

609
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,020
can the Sword Alliance thrive.

610
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,900
So, my new three biggest wishes are

611
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,460
to make money,

612
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,100
to make money,

613
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,420
and to make money.

614
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,580
Zhuge,

615
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,700
isn't Ling'er included in your wishes?

616
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,620
Master,

617
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,740
how can I marry Ling'er without money?

618
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,100
How about this?

619
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,100
I'm famous now.

620
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,100
I'll endorse Sword Alliance.

621
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,940
I'm surely better than Crane Knight.

622
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,460
Hey, you...

623
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,420
Master,

624
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,740
he's a Dragon-rank hero.

625
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,380
You only have a Tiger rank.

626
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,500
You still don't understand?

627
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,860
Even the Gou Family
Trade Association's reputation

628
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,100
is better than the title of

629
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,620
Loyalty Knight.

630
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,020
You don't understand.

631
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,580
I don't.

632
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,740
My head hurts.

633
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,820
I'll go to sleep.

634
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,860
Enough.

635
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,390
Heng.

636
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,280
Ling'er.

637
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,100
You drank too much.

638
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,940
I made some porridge.

639
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,380
Eat it while it's warm.

640
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,700
Ling'er.

641
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,700
I'm sorry.

642
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,460
I'm afraid

643
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,220
we need to delay our wedding.

644
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Heng,

645
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,100
I only care how you feel about me.

646
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
That's enough for me.

647
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,100
But I...

648
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
I'm worried I can't take care of you

649
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,860
or give you the life you want.

650
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,820
Heng, don't say that.

651
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,860
We'll face these challenges together.

652
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,980
Now that the Mobei Trade Association

653
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,500
has Crane Knight's recommendation,

654
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,620
the Sword Alliance
can also find a spokesperson.

655
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,620
I heard that

656
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,500
All-Around Knight came to Huizhou today.

657
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,260
I think he's a good choice.

658
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,260
All-Around Knight?

659
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,460
The most popular hero
in the association.

660
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,980
His hero ranking is only
second to Chairman Guangming.

661
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,420
That's right.

662
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,740
Why didn't I think of that?

663
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,540
I'll ask the chairman

664
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,020
to introduce me to All-Around Knight.

665
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,860
Ling'er, you're so smart.

666
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,980
Have some porridge.

667
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,660
Senior!

668
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,820
Have a seat.

669
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,100
What brings you here, Mr. Zhuge?

670
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,100
Have some tea. Nothing special.

671
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,340
Thank you.

672
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,380
I'll get to the point.

673
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,780
Senior,

674
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,820
the Sword Alliance is in trouble.

675
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,140
All-Around Knight,

676
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,340
you have a great reputation.

677
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,860
If you're willing to endorse
the Sword Alliance,

678
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,700
I believe

679
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,860
you'll save us from this crisis.

680
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,820
Mr. Zhuge,

681
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,860
I'm flattered.

682
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,380
Maybe I'm popular,

683
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,820
but as you know, I've stayed low-key.

684
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,660
Such an endorsement

685
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,020
might not suit me.

686
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,220
Senior,

687
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,380
if you agree,

688
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,860
the Sword Alliance will pay a lot.

689
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,620
If there are other projects,

690
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,820
you will always be given priority.

691
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,580
Mr. Zhuge,

692
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,980
I know the Sword Alliance
is having a hard time,

693
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,580
but I must stick to my principles.

694
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,100
In the martial world,

695
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,500
reputation isn't everything.

696
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,260
Real ability is the foundation.

697
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,380
If you can solve it with your ability,

698
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,460
wouldn't that be better?

699
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,380
Help him,

700
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,500
or leave!

701
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,220
Why waste so much time?

702
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,260
What are you doing here?

703
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,980
Zhuge,

704
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,620
why are you asking him for help?

705
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,100
I'm a famous hero now.

706
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,740
It'll be better if I'm the spokesperson.

707
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,860
Tomorrow,

708
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,780
I'll ask Wang Zipeng

709
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,660
to write a few articles
for the Sword Alliance.

710
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,980
The effect

711
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,500
will be amazing.

712
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,700
Well, Senior.

713
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,340
That was rude and improper.

714
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,300
- Senior!
- Mr. Zhuge,

715
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,140
if nothing else,

716
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,220
I'll take my leave now.

717
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,460
Senior!

718
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,940
Senior!

719
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,620
Who's rude?

720
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,460
Hey, what are you doing?

721
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,860
I finally got an opportunity.

722
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,500
Zhuge, why don't you understand?

723
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,060
I'm now

724
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,580
very popular!

725
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,780
You're just wandering around

726
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,380
and acting crazy.

727
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,580
You know nothing.

728
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,300
(Huizhou City)
For Yang Wanli?

729
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,180
Move.

730
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,580
Next one.

731
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,140
Here.

732
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,620
Madam, who are you looking for?

733
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,580
It's written here.

734
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,300
- Is it him?
- Yes.

735
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,140
What's your plan?

736
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,500
It's written here.

737
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,340
You two.

738
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,030
Let me handle it.

739
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,980
Are you calling me?

740
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,580
You know me, right?

741
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,740
Gou Lingfeng
of the Martial Artists Association!

742
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,460
Okay.

743
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,220
Chairman Wu has issued an order.

744
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,060
From now on,
the heroes of the association

745
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,980
only need to show their hero tokens.

746
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,500
No need to verify their registration.

747
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,180
This...

748
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,940
Mr. Deng said

749
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,220
all city entrants,

750
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,740
whether heroes or not,

751
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,460
must show their registration.

752
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,500
Mr. Deng

753
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,740
is just our inspector.

754
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,500
Chairman Wu is the leader.

755
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,220
Can't you tell the difference?

756
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,660
Well...

757
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,660
Well, but...

758
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,100
But... But what?

759
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,180
- Here, this is ours.
- Let me see.

760
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,820
Heroes of the Martial Artists Association

761
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,620
can enter the city

762
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,580
without showing their

763
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,860
registration!

764
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,220
Well...

765
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,420
- How can you do this?
- Great.

766
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,100
We've waited for so long!

767
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,140
- Ridiculous!
- So long!

768
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,860
We've waited for so long!

769
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,620
- Now there's no need to wait?
- That's right.

770
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,780
You don't need to wait. Go ahead.

771
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,180
Loyalty Knight Gou Lingfeng

772
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,020
takes on Huizhou's management duties.

773
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,660
He's been working

774
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,580
tirelessly.

775
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,180
Chairman, what's wrong?

776
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,460
Zhuge, you're here.

777
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,300
Take a seat.

778
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,420
I know you asked

779
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,500
All-Around Knight for help.

780
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,140
I'll help you persuade him

781
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,220
to endorse the Sword Alliance.

782
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,660
You'll surely get through this.

783
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,500
Thank you, Chairman.

784
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,580
My master...

785
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,220
Since he became Loyalty Knight,

786
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,740
I've felt something is off.

787
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,260
He's been showing off.

788
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,340
I feel the same way.

789
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,740
I thought you told him to do it.

790
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,980
Why would I ask him to do that?

791
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,460
The Hero Gathering is coming.

792
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,900
You two must avoid any mistakes now.

793
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,460
By the way,

794
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,500
as for the Hero Gathering,

795
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,500
would you like to give it a try?

796
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,620
Me?

797
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,660
Since Gou Lingfeng and you joined us,

798
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,340
I've also paid attention to you.

799
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,340
You're young, talented,

800
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,420
and humble, and you've

801
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,580
made great contributions.

802
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,380
I also have high hopes for you.

803
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,580
I think this will be

804
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,180
a great opportunity for you.

805
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,700
I...

806
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,860
I don't think I'm powerful enough.

807
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,500
I'm not ready.

808
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,340
That's alright.

809
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,740
I won't force you.

810
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,140
However, please try

811
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,620
to persuade Lingfeng.

812
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,820
Tall trees catch the wind.

813
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,900
Our association is complicated.

814
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,380
Our enemy is hiding

815
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,620
in the dark.

816
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,660
Besides,

817
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,900
don't tell him

818
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,220
we talked.

819
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,500
Lingfeng is

820
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,500
sensitive.

821
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,620
He might overthink it.

822
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,380
Okay, Chairman.

823
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,220
Have some tea.

824
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,500
Oh, youth.

825
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,620
(The End of Episode 22)

826
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,420
Ling'er,

827
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,980
how do I look?

828
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,860
Do I look better than my master?

829
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,580
Mr. Zhuge, you look
elegant and handsome,

830
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,100
truly one of a kind.

831
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,180
What a sweet talker.

832
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,500
Do you think I can attend

833
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,980
the Hero Gathering in this outfit?

834
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,260
Are you going to the Hero Gathering?

835
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,500
I'm just saying.

836
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,020
But after all, I'm also a Tiger-rank hero.

837
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,220
It won't be a big deal

838
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,620
if I participate in it, right?

839
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,020
What's wrong, Ling'er?

840
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,740
Do you think it's inappropriate?

841
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,900
No, not at all.

842
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,980
I think it's great.

843
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,260
Ling'er, don't worry.

844
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,460
If one day,

845
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,500
I become as popular as my master,

846
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,860
I promise I won't be lost.

847
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,020
You're my one and only.

848
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,860
