00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:52,380
Walk.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,200
You slut.

16
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,000
I've told you

17
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:03,479
I have nothing to do with Chairman Xu.

18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,480
Su Xinyue.

19
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,420
It must be Su Xinyue.

20
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:10,379
She set me up.

21
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,640
I just planned to sleep with Shi'an.

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,620
How could it be Chairman Xu?

23
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,200
I know you're shameless.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,299
But I didn't expect you
to be so shameless.

25
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:30,180
You can't be with Shi'an.

26
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:31,519
You're siblings.

27
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,640
Siblings?

28
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,040
How could we be siblings?

29
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:42,840
Isn't Xu Shi'an the son of Xu Dawei?

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,060
You're lying to me, aren't you?

31
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,000
What makes you worth me lying to you?

32
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,000
Wu Hongjie is a useless man.

33
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,739
If I hadn't said

34
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,599
that Shi'an was Xu Dawei's son,

35
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,099
how could I get into the Xu family?

36
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,980
I'm warning you

37
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,379
to stay away from Shi'an and Dawei.

38
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,099
Otherwise,

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,240
what happened to Cheng Youran

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,439
will be your fate.

41
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,860
So you've been using me all along!

42
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,800
Let go of me!

43
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,259
Maybe you don't know

44
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,240
that I'm not Wu Hongjie's
biological daughter.

45
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,719
So what?

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,020
I'm not related to Xu Shi'an.

47
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,419
You slut.

48
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,819
You don't deserve Shi'an at all.

49
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,479
Go as far away from here as you can!

50
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,560
Help me.

51
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,960
Please.

52
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,460
- We...
- We...

53
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,620
We've been set up by Yang Feifei.

54
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,439
Last night,

55
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:35,479
I almost...

56
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:38,719
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,000
It's okay.

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,919
I'm your fiancée.

59
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,379
You're really not Youran?
Are you sure you're not lying to me?

60
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,259
Do you want me
to be Cheng Youran that badly?

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:14,979
Hello.

62
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,160
Hello, Mr. Xu.

63
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,839
Yang Feifei has died in a fall.

64
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,819
What did you say?

65
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Yang Feifei is dead?

66
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,699
Ms. Yang, former Design Director

67
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,459
of Nebula Group,
fell to her death last night.

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,220
The police rushed to the scene at once.

69
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,000
(According to Qiu Lifen's statement,)
Due to the lack of witnesses

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,860
(Yang Feifei attempted to murder her.)
and the destruction of CCTV,

71
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,140
the cause of the incident
is subject to further investigation.

72
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,279
I've just returned home,

73
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,680
and Qiu Lifen gives me
such a big present.

74
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,000
Last night,

75
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,620
Su Xinyue was also in that hotel.

76
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:07,579
Could it be

77
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,759
that what Yang Feifei said is true?

78
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,420
There's really something wrong
with Su Xinyue.

79
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:23,720
Mom.

80
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,079
Su Xinyue,

81
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,980
what is your purpose
in joining our family?

82
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,779
Mom, how can you slap her?

83
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,280
Ask her yourself!

84
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,879
Aunt,
I didn't know about Yang Feifei's death

85
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,279
until I watched the news.

86
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,579
I know you had nothing to do with it.
I trust you.

87
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:43,240
The police have already interrogated us.

88
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,459
What do you know?

89
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,800
I don't know anything.

90
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:48,680
Shi'an,

91
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,540
I really don't know anything.

92
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:51,720
Mom,

93
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,839
it was all
Yang Feifei's doing yesterday.

94
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,279
Xinyue's also a victim.

95
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,819
Shi'an,

96
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,000
stop blaming Aunt.

97
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,360
It's all my fault.

98
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,620
I know Aunt's mad,

99
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,220
but I was still talking
about Yang Feifei.

100
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,540
Xinyue.

101
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:17,819
Xinyue.

102
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,839
Su Xinyue

103
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,019
must know something.

104
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,100
My fiancé was a

105
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,240
real gentleman last night.

106
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:40,240
I told you

107
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,399
I'd protect you

108
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,819
no matter who you were.

109
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,579
Now, can you tell me

110
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,899
about Youran?

111
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,300
But she told me

112
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,860
she never thought of you
as her elder brother.

113
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,860
What did she tell you?

114
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,720
Where is she now?

115
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,759
She's in a very safe place.

116
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,079
She doesn't want to come back
to this sad place.

117
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,240
She doesn't want to see any of you.

118
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,879
She still hates me.

119
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,740
I hurt her.

120
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:50,059
So she told me

121
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,940
about your Achilles' heel.

122
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,679
It's your turn now.

123
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,580
What a slut.

124
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,820
You sent the text message to ask me
to go to the cemetery, didn't you?

125
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,480
What's your relationship with Cheng Yun?

126
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:25,620
What do you want?

127
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,039
What text message?

128
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,259
I have no idea.

129
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,059
You won't admit it, huh?
Let me find it and show it to you.

130
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,799
What's wrong?

131
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,020
Just leave the phone off.

132
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:45,980
Even if the phone is fixed,
you won't be able to find the message.

133
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,539
It's really you.

134
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:49,059
It's me.

135
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,679
But you don't have any evidence.

136
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,279
What do you know?

137
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,300
After all these years,
you still won't change your ways.

138
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:04,820
You're just like your mother.

139
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,700
Who are you really?

140
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:16,940
Aunt,

141
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:19,019
are you okay?

142
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,519
Stop pretending.

143
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:21,720
Go away!

144
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,039
Mom.

145
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:25,720
You...

146
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:27,799
Come on.

147
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,600
Are you okay?

148
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:33,779
Shi'an,

149
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:35,700
I just saw Aunt fall

150
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,519
and I wanted to help her, but...

151
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,460
You little vixen, you're pretty
good at pretending, aren't you?

152
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,100
Shi'an, she's the one
who pushed me! Look...

153
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,799
Shi'an,

154
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,820
Aunt has been in a bad mood lately.

155
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:47,659
She's not picking on me.

156
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,500
Mom,

157
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,100
even if you're in a bad mood,
you can't take it out on Xinyue.

158
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:54,320
The police have released
the case report.

159
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,360
You can't pick on her in every way.

160
00:10:58,419 --> 00:10:59,000
You...

161
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,420
Did you hurt yourself?

162
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,820
(Qiu Lifen,)

163
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:28,059
