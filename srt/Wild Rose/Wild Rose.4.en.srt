Mom.

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,700
Mom.

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,140
Mom.

17
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,188
Mom.

18
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,360
Mom.

19
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,108
I heard that Mr. Xu's fiancée

20
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:34,209
is a sickly girl
who came back from abroad.

21
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,319
She's been placed in our department.

22
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:37,808
So what if she's a fiancée?

23
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:40,028
Our design department
relies on creativity and technology.

24
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:41,620
Not just anyone can get in.

25
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,400
You

26
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,879
will have to watch what you say
from now on.

27
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,519
That's Mr. Xu's fiancée,

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,069
don't offend her.

29
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,968
Mr. Yang,

30
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:54,260
I wish you were our future boss's wife.

31
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,420
Yeah.

32
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,700
Come on, let me introduce her to you.

33
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,408
This is Mr. Xu's fiancée,

34
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:10,659
Su Xinyue,

35
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,580
as well as a newcomer
to our design department.

36
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,039
Let's welcome her.

37
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,500
Mr. Yang,

38
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:24,859
where is my seat?

39
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,520
You're Mr. Xu's fiancée.

40
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,139
You're here to be closer to your fiancé.

41
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:35,620
Why don't

42
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,400
you sit here?

43
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:49,389
This is where Ms. Yang used to sit.

44
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,080
Not everyone is qualified to sit here.

45
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:54,180
Liu, don't be like this.

46
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,369
Since you're so kind,

47
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,220
I'll have to accept your offer.

48
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,500
Mr. Xu.

49
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:25,140
It's a top quality opal.

50
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,969
Hand it over to Mr. Li
in the raw materials department

51
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:28,599
and don't make any mistakes.

52
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:33,568
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

53
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,769
Mr. Xu didn't even look at his fiancée.

54
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,769
This fiancée's title is purely for show.

55
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,588
Of course.

56
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:40,699
Mr. Xu only has eyes for Ms. Yang.

57
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:44,449
Mr. Xu is just in the habit

58
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,919
of leaving all the important things
to me.

59
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,180
Don't mind it.

60
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:51,960
Why should I mind?

61
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,099
I certainly don't mind

62
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,780
having subordinates run errands.

63
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,220
(Su Xinyue,)

64
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,159
(I'm going to get you out
of the company.)

65
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,630
(The Effects and Properties of BARRIX)

66
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,439
It's medicine to fix scars.

67
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,828
Why does Su Xinyue need this medicine?

68
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,999
Mr. Xu, Ms Yang asked Ms. Su to take the opal
to the raw materials department for her.

69
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:22,340
I'm afraid Ms. Su
can't deal with Mr. Li.

70
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,220
Let's go

71
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,640
and check on my fiancée.

72
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:33,208
Who are you?

73
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,248
can anyone touch

74
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:35,900
the company's top opal?

75
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,380
Who's responsible

76
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:38,460
for any damage?

77
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,619
Of course

78
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,380
I'm responsible.

79
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:45,748
You...

80
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:46,888
Ms. Su,

81
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:48,542
how could you put such a precious opal

82
00:04:48,543 --> 00:04:49,799
in the water?

83
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,099
It's my fault for giving
such an important task to a newcomer.

84
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:57,268
I've caused a big trouble
for the company.

85
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:58,179
Don't touch it.

86
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,448
This opal

87
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:03,328
has obviously just come out of the safe.

88
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:04,508
Now that it's dry in the room,

89
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:06,400
it's susceptible to damage.

90
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,799
Well said. Professionally done.

91
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,260
Ms. Yang, have you

92
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,419
forgotten the characteristics
of raw stones?

93
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:30,869
You're different

94
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,619
from the rumors.

95
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,140
The rumor is that I'm dying?

96
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,960
I've let you down.

97
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,159
You're just

98
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:46,780
impressive.

99
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,188
Speaking of rumors,

100
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,799
I heard that you're the best friend
in college

101
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:56,159
of Xu Shi'an's younger sister.

102
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:00,739
Yes.

103
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,308
Unfortunately, Youran's
whereabouts have been unknown

104
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:05,720
since her car accident years ago.

105
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,679
All these years,

106
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:10,880
I've been by Shi'an's side.

107
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,960
You haven't been able to get
into Xu Shi'an's bed for so many years.

108
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,659
I wonder where you get
your confidence from.

109
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,680
Even if you wish for something
that doesn't belong to you

110
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,239
all your life,

111
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:31,340
it's just a dream.

112
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,349
(Su Xinyue,)

113
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,820
(don't get cocky too soon.)

114
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:43,780
(Sooner or later,
Xu Shi'an will be mine.)

115
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,148
I didn't realise Ms. Su was so capable.

116
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:47,448
She could even handle Mr. Li.

117
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,320
After all, she is the daughter
of the second shareholder of the group.

118
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,229
She's definitely got
the vision and knowledge.

119
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,340
- Ms. Su.
- Ms. Su.

120
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:55,060
Ms. Su.

121
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,880
I've heard that you've been recovering
from an illness abroad for many years,

122
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,289
so you may know a little

123
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,589
about jewellery

124
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,119
but you don't have much experience
in designing jewellery, do you?

125
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,080
What are you trying to say?

126
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,708
This is the induction program
that we at Xingyun Group

127
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,700
prepare for every new employee.

128
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,109
Starting with the basics,

129
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,340
patience is honed.

130
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,619
You have to make the most
of the ingredients.

131
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,529
You have until the end of your working hours
to design and make a complete set

132
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,140
of jewellery.

133
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,099
That doesn't seem so hard.

134
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:31,299
Is that so?

135
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,960
It's good to have confidence.

136
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,539
Ms. Sue, demonstrate, please.

137
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,640
Okay.

138
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,090
(Xingyun Group)

139
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,859
Ms. Yang,

140
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,429
when did our company

141
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,039
have this basic training program?

142
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,640
Since today.

143
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,200
Ms. Su, you don't have much time.

144
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,659
How's the progress?

145
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:29,859
Bake it over a fire

146
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,720
to increase the stickiness.

147
00:08:40,749 --> 00:08:42,408
Ms. Yang, please help me.

148
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:43,660
I'm afraid I'll burn my hands.

149
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,639
It's more satisfying

150
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:50,099
if you do it yourself.

151
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,060
It's my first time.

152
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,519
You should help me.

153
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,619
Mom.

154
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,599
Mr. Xu, I...

155
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:06,759
Don't mess up my company.

156
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,759
(Why does Su Xinyue have scars
on her face?)

157
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:37,899
(What's her secret?)

158
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,259
Ms. Su, are you okay?

159
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:51,820
What to do?

160
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:54,080
It will take time for the
scars to fade completely.

161
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:56,019
(It's too late
for a delivery of medicine.)

162
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,580
