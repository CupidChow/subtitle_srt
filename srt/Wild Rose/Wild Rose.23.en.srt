=Episode 23=

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,659
The Guardian Series incurred
significant losses for the company.

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,060
In response,
the board unanimously decided

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,019
that the Su family should

17
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,019
cover these losses by relinquishing

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,579
all their shares.

19
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:10,980
Given your central roles

20
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:13,459
in managing the Guardian Series,

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,780
both of you must assume responsibility
and resign.

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,659
Xu Dawei.

23
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:20,400
Nebula Group was founded by both
the Cheng family and the Su family.

24
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,319
You're a Xu.
What right do you have to kick us out?

25
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,540
I suggest you sign the papers.

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,400
Chairman Xu.

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,180
The regulatory authorities are here.

28
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,520
Someone reported Mr. Su and Ms. Su
for embezzling public funds.

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,440
They will need to cooperate
with the investigation.

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,879
Reported? Who reported it?

31
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:50,640
Sorry, Chairman Xu.

32
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,400
We cannot sign any documents

33
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,640
during the investigation period.

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,879
I underestimated you.

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,000
As soon as Qiu Lifen went crazy,
trouble hit the group.

36
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,220
It's too much of a coincidence.

37
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:24,840
Do you think

38
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,660
Xu Dawei had something to do with it?

39
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,439
You think Xu Dawei might be behind

40
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,580
Qiu Lifen's breakdown?

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,840
I don't know.

42
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,080
It feels like I've never really known

43
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,319
this man I've called my father.

44
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,580
I'll go see Qiu Lifen again.

45
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:56,659
Maybe I can get some answers.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,539
All right.

47
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,140
I'll look into the issues
with the jewelry materials.

48
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,960
(Xu Dawei.)

49
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,879
(I don't know how involved)

50
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,099
(you were back then.)

51
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,500
(But I hope you had nothing
to do with it.)

52
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,140
What's bothering you?

53
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,919
You look tense.

54
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,819
Nothing.

55
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,879
How's your mother?

56
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,599
Cheng Yun! Cheng Yun!

57
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,360
You stupid woman!

58
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,379
Dawei never loved you!

59
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,280
You were just an obstacle!

60
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:53,940
You deserved to die!

61
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,419
You deserved to die!

62
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:58,780
Who are you to speak
of my mother like that?

63
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,300
Dawei always loved me.

64
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,340
He loved me.

65
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,419
He said

66
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,199
the one who isn't loved
is the homewrecker.

67
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,580
- I'm not the homewrecker!
- Mom, stop it

68
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,259
I'm not the homewrecker!

69
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:14,020
Qiu Lifen! What else did Xu Dawei say?

70
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,560
Was Xu Dawei the one behind the accident

71
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,379
- all those years ago? Answer me!
- Youran...

72
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:19,480
Was someone else responsible?

73
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,379
- Answer me!
- Youran...

74
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,360
- Answer me!
- Calm down!

75
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,860
- Answer me!
- Youran!

76
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,199
Was it him?

77
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,699
He really was like a father to me
when I was little.

78
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,019
I don't want to doubt him.

79
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,139
Am I too naive?

80
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,319
You're not.

81
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,519
You're just too kind.

82
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:09,759
I was still holding on to hope.

83
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,199
I hoped Qiu Lifen would say

84
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,680
it had nothing to do with him.

85
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,399
Youran,

86
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,420
no matter what happens,

87
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,579
I'll support you.

88
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,519
Just don't hurt yourself, okay?

89
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,779
Hurt?

90
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,160
I'm already covered in wounds.

91
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,339
How could I feel any more pain?

92
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:48,420
No matter how much you change,

93
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,700
you'll always be the girl
who has held a special place

94
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,579
in my heart for all these years.

95
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:33,339
Yes?

96
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,420
Wu Hongjie is awake?

97
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,160
All right.

98
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,779
You're Cheng Yun's daughter?

99
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,199
Yes.

100
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,379
I survived that accident,

101
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,800
but my face was ruined.

102
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,280
I had plastic surgery
to look like someone else.

103
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,759
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,300
I made so many mistakes

105
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,019
for Qiu Lifen.

106
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,259
In the end, I lost everything.

107
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,340
My daughter also went down
the wrong path.

108
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,019
I regret everything.

109
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:18,920
Xu Dawei sent people to kill you.

110
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,800
Why?

111
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,259
It may look like

112
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,360
Qiu Lifen caused the traffic accident,

113
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,560
but the truth is,

114
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,280
Xu Dawei was actually
pulling the strings behind the scenes.

115
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,420
Back then,

116
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:37,240
Xu Dawei and Qiu Lifen came to see me.

117
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,079
The car's dashcam recorded everything.

118
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,120
That's the proof.

119
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:44,600
Where's the evidence?

120
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,300
At my old house.

121
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,879
I hope it can help you.

122
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,780
Are you going to get it?

123
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:54,740
But I don't have enough time.

124
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,639
I can't leave now.

125
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,259
I can't let Xu Dawei get suspicious.

126
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,140
I'll have Junwen get the evidence.

127
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,800
I'm going to expose Xu Dawei's crimes

128
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,879
at the board meeting tomorrow.

129
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,200
It was found that the raw materials
for the Guardian Series were defective.

130
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,220
We just have to push a little harder,

131
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,980
and the Su family's shares will be ours.

132
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,540
When we succeed,

133
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,899
I won't disappoint
any of you sitting here.

134
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,560
(Nebula Group will finally be mine.)

135
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,680
(Cheng Yun.)

136
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,120
(I'll no longer be)

137
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,360
(the Cheng family's pathetic
son-in-law.)

138
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,740
I'm afraid I'll have
to disappoint you, Chairman Xu.

139
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,700
I, Cheng Youran, am back.

140
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,539
Cheng Youran?

141
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,139
Isn't she Su Xinyue?

142
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,659
What's going on?

143
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:01,200
You're not Su Xinyue?

144
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:02,820
Of course not.

145
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm your daughter.

146
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,500
Cheng Youran.

147
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,980
There's no way you're Cheng Youran!

148
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:11,700
Yes. That's impossible.

149
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,899
This is the Cheng family's heirloom,
the Blood Rose.

150
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,340
It can prove my identity.

151
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:23,820
It looks authentic.

152
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,779
It does.

153
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,220
In that accident years ago,

154
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,259
my mother Cheng Yun
and Uncle Su died at the scene.

155
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,279
I suspected foul play,

156
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,019
which is why I returned as Su Xinyue

157
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,419
to investigate the truth.

158
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,059
Recently,

159
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,840
I finally tracked down the driver
from that accident.

160
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,600
Wu Hongjie.

161
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,120
It was Xu Dawei

162
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,779
who orchestrated it all

163
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,480
with Qiu Lifen

164
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,460
to seize control of Nebula Group!

165
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,700
A gemstone alone

166
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,419
can't prove you're really Cheng Youran.

167
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,440
I can prove it!

168
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,659
I watched her grow up.
She is Cheng Youran!

169
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,980
Everyone, I have my
plastic surgery records from overseas.

170
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,540
They're all on file and can be verified.

171
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,919
So what?

172
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,100
Nebula Group was founded
by the Cheng family

173
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:30,299
and the Su family,

174
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:32,639
but I was the one

175
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,399
who built it to where it is today!

176
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,060
I hold the largest share

177
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,899
in the company.

178
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,120
What can you possibly use to beat me?

179
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,580
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
