I wouldn't be so sure.

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,359
Chairman Xu.

18
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,140
There's been a major shift
in the company's shares.

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,239
It seems like

20
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:21,799
you aren't aware of it?

21
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,379
What is going on?

22
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,439
I have no idea.

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,299
How is this possible?

24
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:41,579
Impossible!

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,040
You have yourself to thank.

26
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,439
If you hadn't tampered

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,420
with the Guardian Series raw materials

28
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,640
and created a scandal,

29
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,420
the shareholders wouldn't have panicked

30
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,060
and secretly sold off their shares.

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,159
You gave me the opportunity.

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,500
Xu Dawei, you leaked the scandal?

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,360
- You never discussed this with us!
- Yeah!

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,780
- Where's my money?
- Do you know how much we lost?!

35
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,240
- Pay up!
- Give us our money back!

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,840
We demand Xu Dawei
be removed as chairman!

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,200
- Give us an explanation!
- Pay up!

38
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,439
You planned this.

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,800
Of course.

40
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,199
To keep you off guard,

41
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,240
I exposed my own identity.

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,560
(So, he knew everything all along.)

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,199
(He's always protected me.)

44
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,960
(Yet, I still resented him.)

45
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:32,960
Youran.

46
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,680
I'm giving you all my shares,

47
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,160
plus the ones
that rightfully belonged to you.

48
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,819
You're now the largest shareholder.

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,699
Make your decision.

50
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,659
Alright.

51
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:47,780
Everyone.

52
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,520
As the majority shareholder
of Nebula Group,

53
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:52,940
I formally demand that Xu Dawei be sued

54
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:55,620
for embezzlement of company funds

55
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,380
and misappropriation
of corporate assets.

56
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:59,620
Effective immediately,
he is removed from his position.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,560
Do the shareholders agree?

58
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,020
- Agreed!
- Yes!

59
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,699
Those charges mean nothing.

60
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,500
I'll make a comeback soon enough!

61
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:14,800
No, you won't.

63
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,719
Xu Dawei,

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,319
the hitmen you hired
were pretty weak, huh?

65
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:27,979
I found the dashcam footage

66
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,900
along with proof

67
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,979
of the material tampering.

68
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,319
Chairman Xu!

69
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:34,360
Eat this!

70
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:35,979

71
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,060
- Don't let him get away!
- Stop right there!

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,180

- Junwen!

Xu Dawei,

160
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,100
Youran was once your daughter.

161
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:41,600
You watched her grow up.

162
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,580
How could you be so cruel?

163
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,639
Daughter?

164
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,840
She and her mother

165
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,600
are nothing but proof of my humiliation!

166
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,840
I was once a promising executive

167
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,340
with a bright future in the company.

168
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,279
But, because I married Cheng Yun,

169
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:04,240
everyone saw me
as a man living off his wife.

170
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,919
I have my pride too!

171
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,059
So, all these years,

172
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,399
you never saw me
as your daughter at all.

173
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,399
It was all just an act.

174
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,960
I've known from the get-go
you weren't my real daughter.

175
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,919
I've always hated you and your mother.

176
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,679
Even without Qiu Lifen,

177
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,440
I would've found a way
to get rid of you both anyway.

178
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:32,299
I want everyone to know

179
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,200
that I got to where I am today

180
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,039
through my own hard work!

181
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,659
How ridiculous.

182
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,320
Your ambition has always
outweighed your ability.

183
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,060
You're insecure.

184
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,700
Shut up!

185
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,220

into privilege?

Everything I have today

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,280
was earned through my own effort!

188
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,259
And what do you have?

189
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,100
Not a single child is truly yours.

190
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,460
You're destined to have nothing.

191
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:52,440
That's your karma.

192
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,480
Nonsense! Shut up!

193
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,600
Stop talking!

194
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:57,639
Dad.

195
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,320
Dad.

196
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,580
Even though you never

197
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,179
treated me like your real daughter,

198
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,820
I still felt a father's love from you.

199
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,019
Let it go.

200
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,559
Stop making more mistakes.

201
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,340
You can still turn back now.

202
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:24,519
It's too late.

203
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,700
It's too late for that!

204
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,379
Let go of me!

205
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,159
We called the police.

206
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,220
Let go of me! Curse you!

207
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,620
Stop resisting.

208
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,639
I made copies of the dashcam footage.

209
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:39,760
Are you alright?

210
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,779
Calm down.

211
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,080
It's over now.

212
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,500
(Xu Dawei was arrested
for kidnapping and assault.)

213
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,340
(Xu Dawei was sentenced to death
and fined 500,000 yuan.)

214
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,438
(Qiu Lifen received a death sentence
with a two-year reprieve.)

215
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:11,040
(Wu Hongjie was sentenced
to 15 years for murder.)

216
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,720
(Wang Qiang received five years
for attempted rape.)

217
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,370
(Li Yang received four years
for attempted murder.)

218
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,469
(After everything ended,
with Xu Shi'an by her side,)

219
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:18,370
(Cheng Youran returned
as Nebula Group's rightful heir.)
