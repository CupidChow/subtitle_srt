(This story is pure fiction.)

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,910
=Episode 22=

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,240
Madam.

15
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,019
You're looking for Shi'an?

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,420
My son won't see you.

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,140
Can't you tell

18
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:11,159
he is avoiding you?

19
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:16,219
You two will never meet again.

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,640
Don't be so sure.

21
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,180
I wonder where you get
all this confidence, Mrs. Xu.

22
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,040
Shi'an is my son,

23
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:33,340
and the Xu family belongs to me.

24
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:36,219
I drove your mother away.

25
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,079
I can do the same to you.

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,019
Is that so?

27
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:49,159
What if Shi'an finds out

28
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:52,620
that his dear mother
hired a hitman back then,

29
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,959
just to claim her place
as the Xu family's matriarch?

30
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:56,959
Tell me.

31
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,540
Will he still listen to you?

32
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,739
How will you tell him?

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,299
You have no proof.

34
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,819
Would this count as proof?

35
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,360
Wu Hongjie is awake.

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,419
He told everything to me and Shi'an,

37
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,500
including the car accident.

38
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,840
If you don't want
the evidence to go public,

39
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,639
I suggest you turn yourself in.

40
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,159
He...

41
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
He's really awake?

42
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,639
For Shi'an's sake,

43
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:54,120
I'll give you three days.

44
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,039
Otherwise,

45
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,819
I'll bring you to justice.

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,439
It can't go public...

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,840
No...

48
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:05,840
No...

49
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,280
Sorry, pal.

50
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,520
I couldn't get the car crash evidence,
so I'll have to take your life.

51
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,540
What are you doing?!

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,370
(Xu Dawei)

53
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,039
(You'll get the other half
after it's done.)

54
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,719
Was he behind the car crash back then?

55
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,780
Xinyue might not have much time left.

56
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,699
I want to use
the upcoming product launch

57
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,319
to expose everything
Qiu Lifen has done.

58
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,599
The forensic report and Wu Hongjie

59
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,819
are both in Xu Shi'an's hands.

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,120
What can you do?

61
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,139
Evidence or not,

62
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,599
this will drive an even deeper wedge
between Qiu Lifen and Xu Dawei.

63
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,219
I have to make sure

64
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,460
Xinyue lives to see justice served.

65
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,120
I lost the forensic report.
I'll take care of it.

66
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
How?

67
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,300
At Xu family's house,

68
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,580
I lied to Qiu Lifen about
Wu Hongjie waking up.

69
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,699
She must be panicking right now.

70
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:16,560
She's bound to make a move.

71
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:04,560
Everything that was rightfully yours

72
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,100
will be yours again.

73
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:11,339
Mr. Xu, what just happened?

74
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,420
Everyone.

75
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,660
There have been rumors

76
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,319
that I am the biological son of

77
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,760
Nebula Group's chairman, Xu Dawei.

78
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,420
Today, I will address this.

79
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:27,860
Xu Dawei and I share no blood relation.

80
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,180
What?

81
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,620
Move! Move!

82
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,980
Don't listen to him!

83
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,300
What are you talking about?!

84
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:33,920
Mom...

85
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:35,980
Let it go.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,019
Let what go?!

87
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,100
What did I do?

88
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,360
It's all her fault! She's behind this!

89
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,800
Qiu Lifen, you know what you did.

90
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,300
You just tried to kill me!

91
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,160
I'm calling the police right now!

92
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,100
You wretched woman!

93
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,720
Mom!

94
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,100
Stop making things worse.

95
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:52,879
Turn yourself in.

96
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,339
You ungrateful son!

97
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,220
What did I do to deserve this?

98
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:00,980
You'd betray your mother

99
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,699
for this cursed woman?

100
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,579
Mom, that's enough!

101
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,300
I know everything

102
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,620
that you've done.

103
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,540
Fine.

104
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:13,939
Even my own son is turning against me.
I don't want to live anymore!

105
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:15,879
Mom!

106
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:17,180
Mom!

107
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,439
Mrs. Xu!

108
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,040
- Mrs. Xu!
- Mrs. Xu!

109
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,879
Xu Shi'an!

110
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,500
Did you just let her go on purpose?

111
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,199
I actually believed you.

112
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,439
Is this what you wanted?

113
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,500
How do you expect me see you now?

114
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,600
You'll always be the son of my enemy.

115
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,019
Is hatred

116
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,480
all that's left between us?

117
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,360
Dawei, come save me!

118
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,379
Otherwise, we're both finished!

119
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,260
Chairman Xu sent me to pick you up.

120
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,939
Xu Shi'an.

121
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,699
What did you mean

122
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,920
by what you said earlier?

123
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,560
I raised you all these years.

124
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:06,279
Is this how you repay me?

125
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:08,180
Say something!

126
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,430
(Share Transfer Agreement)

127
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,180
Chairman Xu.

128
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,100
Here are all the shares you gave me,

129
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,699
along with everything I gained

130
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,800
as Nebula Group's heir.

131
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,240
I'm returning them.

132
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,920
I am grateful for
everything you've done for me,

133
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,300
but in the end,
I am not your biological son.

134
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,660
None of these belongs to me.

135
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,180
Since the heir was a sham,

136
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,020
the Su family must
call off the engagement.

137
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:45,360
Oh,

138
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,740
I almost forgot.

139
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,420
Thanks to our efforts,
the Guardian Series sells very well.

140
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:50,639
And in the end,

141
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,439
what belongs to the Su family
will return to the Su family.

142
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,439
It's all over now.

143
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,379
We are even now.

144
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,220
I am the only Mrs. Xu!

145
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,720
I am the wife
of Nebula Group's chairman!

146
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:28,800
How did you let her escape?!

147
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,100
Lifen...

148
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,039
I am the chairman's wife, Lifen!

149
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,139
Mom!

150
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,860
Doctor, how is she?

151
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,159
Dr. Tang?

152
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:45,659
Mr. Xu,

153
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,399
your wife has suffered
severe emotional trauma.

154
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,659
She has suffered a mental breakdown.

155
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:53,259
I strongly recommend hospitalization.

156
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,740
You may all leave now.

157
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,379
Understood.

158
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:03,159
I don't want Lifen to suffer any more.

159
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,100
I have a house in the countryside.

160
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,960
It's a better place for recovery.

161
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,019
Dad...

162
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:12,940
Chairman Xu...

163
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:15,980
I'd rather get my mom

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,019
a proper check-up.

165
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,379
For peace of mind.

166
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,940
If she needs long-term care,

167
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,259
I'll take care of my mom myself

168
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:24,539
now that I've resigned.

169
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,360
That works too.

170
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,020
Now that Qiu Lifen has gone mad,
and with insufficient evidence,

171
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,340
even if she's taken to the police,
she can't be convicted.

172
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,820
But the fact that she lost her mind

173
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,980
at this exact moment...

174
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:44,940
Tell me,

175
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,180
could it have been intentional?

176
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,259
It wasn't me.

177
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:54,980
Just like you,

178
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
I wanted her to face legal justice,

179
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,460
not go insane.

180
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,139
I just feel like her sudden breakdown

181
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:03,019
isn't that simple.

182
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:05,580
What do you mean?

183
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:09,440
Maybe what happened back then
was even more complicated?

184
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,159
This situation is getting tricky.

185
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,240
I have no idea how we can
make a breakthrough.

186
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,879
Hello?

187
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,299
