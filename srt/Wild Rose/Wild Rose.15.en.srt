=Episode 15=

14
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,299
All right, put your shirt back on.

15
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,299
Can you let me protect you?

16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,140
You can't do so forever.

17
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,900
Besides,
I have my own brother to protect me.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,340
Even if you see me as a brother,
I want to make you stay with me.

19
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,139
What?

20
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,080
They almost took Wu Hongjie away?

21
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,620
Who was it?

22
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,699
I have no idea either.
There were two of them.

23
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,099
And one of them was a woman.

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,159
A woman?

25
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,639
Got it.

26
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,259
Could it be Su Xinyue?

27
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,319
What is she trying to do?

28
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,199
Could it be that
she's trying to threaten Shi'an with it

29
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,080
and get a hold over him?

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,539
What?

31
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,780
Su Junwen has been
looking for Wu Hongjie?

32
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,659
Yes.

33
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,879
I wonder if he's hid Wu Hongjie
in the Su family.

34
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,039
He's hid him?

35
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,840
Look into Wu Hongjie

36
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:01,759
thoroughly.

37
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:02,879
Yes, Mr. Xu.

38
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,240
Su Junwen.

39
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,240
What are you using Youran for?

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,500
When did you get hurt?

41
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,379
Didn't you guess it right?

42
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,840
Not only did you spot me,

43
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,319
but I also spotted you

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,340
and Xu Shi'an.

45
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:37,199
You're alerting our enemy.

46
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:41,740
Is that so?
Or you've gone soft on our enemy?

47
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,719
Or

48
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,080
you still have feelings for Xu Shi'an?

49
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:51,759
Junwen, Youran.

50
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,860
Xu Shi'an is here.

51
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,199
Su Junwen.

52
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,180
Su Junwen!

53
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,879
What exactly are you doing?

54
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,580
Don't you hurt my brother!

55
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,259
I'd like to know what you've been up to.

56
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,379
You!

57
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,360
Youran...

58
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,019
I knew Su Junwen was up to no good.

59
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,459
(Xu Shi'an)

60
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,839
You're the one who's up to no good.

61
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,480
You barged into our place
just like that.

62
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,000
Come with me.

63
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,379
He's been using you.

64
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,300
No one is using me.

65
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,779
Do you trust him so much?

66
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:10,720
You're no longer yourself
because of him.

67
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,280
That's right.

68
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
In this world...

69
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,060
He's the only trustworthy one to me.

70
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:26,439
Mr. Xu.

71
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,300
Please leave.

72
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,259
Think about the hurt they've caused you

73
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,680
and our late parents.

74
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:28,060
They owe us.

75
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,160
Open it.

76
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,940
So this is the bracelet
of the Guardian Series?

77
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,300
How beautiful!

78
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,140
Because you designed it well.

79
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,319
It's nice.

80
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,180
How pretty.

81
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,120
When I was making it, I thought

82
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,860
it'd be my happiest moment

83
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,459
if I could put the jewelry I designed on

84
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,360
for the girl I adore.

85
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,420
Thank you, Junwen.

86
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,180
I'm sure you will find that girl.

87
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,560
She's done designing the bracelet.

88
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,100
It's time for me to have her back.

89
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,779
What did you bring me for?

90
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:24,759
Didn't you say you're busy?

91
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,560
How do you do you work here?

92
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,879
I prepared all this

93
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,919
for your 18th birthday.

94
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,379
But we're only doing it today.

95
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,779
I will fulfill
all of the promises I made.

96
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,080
Can you give me another chance?

97
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,679
Believe me.

98
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,059
What are you talking about,
my dear fiancé?

99
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,539
Today's not my birthday.
I'll let you get away with it.

100
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,580
If you get the date wrong again,
I will be mad.

101
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
You're still denying it?

102
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,120
If there's nothing else, I'm off.

103
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,880
I don't know why you had plastic surgery
to make yourself look like Su Xinyue.

104
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,740
I'll stop asking you that.

105
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,500
All I want is the old you.

106
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,799
What are you going on about?

107
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,279
I've never changed.

108
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:35,559
I'm leaving.

109
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,920
(Nebula Group's heir shares a sweet kiss
with his fiancée at a seaside restaurant)

110
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,779
I will arrange your wedding
as soon as possible.

111
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,039
No, I'm not doing it.

112
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,440
What did you just say?

113
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,220
