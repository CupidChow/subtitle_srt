1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,560
I have one last question.

2
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,480
I hope you can answer me honestly.

3
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,640
Tell me.

4
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,440
I'll tell you everything.

5
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,640
If I was found by the system,

6
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,800
then you too.

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,960
When I open my eyes,

8
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,160
I was the manager of this hotel.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,560
My mission is

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,360
to find the editor who deleted me.

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,120
What's your mission?

12
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,160
It's to modify

13
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,000
The plot of each president's article

14
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,400
is mainly about

15
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,520
the protagonist's love line.

16
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,000
So, let's do it. Okay.

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,880
every time

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,520
I will meet you.

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,400
I see.

20
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,200
What about this time?

21
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,080
Longqing.

22
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,920
The love line of the heroine

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,480
How are you going to change it?

24
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,920
You're the one who made me a mess.

25
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,440
But I

26
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,720
deeply in love with you.

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,079
Tell me

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,720
What is this?

29
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,800
A trash novel.

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,320
No.

31
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,079
No.

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't let me see you again.

33
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,160
Goodbye.

34
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,800
Yu Xian Xian.

35
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,520
Warning.

36
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,240
Long Qing, the male lead, has turned black.

37
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
The male lead, Long Qing has turned black.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,840
No.

39
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,960
I can't give up!

40
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,040
Don't underestimate me!

41
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,680
I'll pay you back

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,720
Here.

43
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,160
You're the heroine of this story, right?

44
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,399
In that case,

45
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,200
let's follow the plot.

46
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,080
I'll make you my favorite.

47
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,040
I didn't expect that the first time I saw Mr. Long,

48
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,600
is his official girlfriend.

49
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,680
Mr. Long is so handsome.

50
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,000
He announced to the world

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,800
his real girlfriend.

52
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
Miss Su

53
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,600
seems to be a girl from an ordinary family.

54
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,520
Isn't this the classic story of Cinderella and Prince?

55
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
I'm so jealous.

56
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,920
When they hug each other

57
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,520
It's really sweet.

58
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,680
I'm bumping.

59
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,240
What's there to kowtow

60
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,680
Poor thing.

61
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,960
Live well after leaving the hotel.

62
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,440
My condolences.

63
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,240
Summer solstice. What's going on?

64
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,840
Why is everyone saying I'm pitiful?

65
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,760
Manager 324.

66
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,840
You're fired.

67
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,400
Please leave this hotel immediately.

68
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,840
Fire him.

69
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,080
What? Why? Why?

70
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,400
Why?

71
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,240
Mr Long has exempted your debt.

72
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,840
It's a great deed to you.

73
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,960
Don't ask why. Just go.

74
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,080
We're colleagues.

75
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
Please don't make things difficult for me.

76
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,120
Long Qing has gone too far.

77
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,960
It's fine to break up, but you still fired him.

78
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,000
You don't even know how to leave a line.

79
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,840
And Su Bai Lian.

80
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
It's another trick to return money after falling down.

81
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,480
Normal women don't have so many wrestling tricks.

82
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,560
Ouch!

83
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
Woman.

84
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,600
I have feelings for you.

85
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,120
I know

86
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,640
very well.

87
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,240
Yu Xian Xian.

88
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
It's you.

89
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,200
It's me.

90
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,920
It's you.

91
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,480
Where have you been?

92
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,800
Don't let me see you again.

93
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,040
Goodbye.

94
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,680
Yu Xian Xian.

95
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,080
A friendly reminder.

96
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,200
You can use the tool card

97
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,080
to change Longqing's image.

98
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,760
and win the final victory.

99
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,720
I can't use the tool card anymore.

100
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,240
I returned his attributes to him.

101
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,800
I've never seen a player who ruins his own future.

102
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,440
You could have used a tool card

103
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,000
to win the game.

104
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,640
But you revealed your identity and purpose.

105
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,920
and used the precious three modification opportunities

106
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,240
on this kind of thing.

107
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,440
Three chances.

108
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,680
Yes, the tool card can be modified three times.

109
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,480
You've already lost a precious chance.

110
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,240
I suggest to change Long Qing's persona again.

111
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,440
and achieve the victory of the game.

112
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,760
I don't need you to teach me how to do things.

113
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,240
I don't understand.

114
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,600
why you told me

115
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,880
about everything?

116
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,240
Because we are lovers.

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,560
We must be honest.

118
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,360
He told me all the secrets.

119
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,880
How can I hide it?

120
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,120
Forget it. I can't explain

121
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,440
to explain to you.

122
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,679
Whatever the reason is,

123
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,679
A friendly reminder.

124
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,360
I suggest to use the tool card again

125
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,679
to change Long Qing's persona

126
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,080
and win the final victory.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,880
Impossible.

128
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,240
He has his own consciousness now.

129
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,480
I have no right to choose for him.

130
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,200
I will respect every decision he makes.

131
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,240
Even if

132
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,880
[he's with someone else.]

133
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
What are you doing?

134
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,120
I'm done. I'm done.

135
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,880
Let's go! Let's go!

136
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,000
Leave the hotel.

137
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,960
Warning. Players can’t leave the hotel.

138
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,320
Why?

139
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,360
If you fail the mission,

140
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,840
you can never return to your real world.

141
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,800
and wander around the virtual world forever.

142
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,240
and even lose themselves.

143
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,600
and become a non-player in the virtual world.

144
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,000
Anyway,

145
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,200
I don't want to be manipulated by you anymore.

146
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,840
I don't care.

147
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,200
Yu Xian Xian's mission is about to fail.

148
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,640
Yu Xian Xian's mission is about to fail.

149
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,680
There's a bus stop here.

150
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,400
Isn't this an island?

151
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,840
Excuse me.

152
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,840
The bus takes 30 minutes.

153
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,800
I want to ask

154
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,000
The bus takes 30 minutes.

155
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,920
Peanaut.

156
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,240
The bus takes 30 minutes.

157
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,520
The bus takes 30 minutes.

158
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,200
Are you a non-player?

159
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,760
The bus takes 30 minutes.

160
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,320
If I stay here for too long,

161
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,520
I won't become a non-player too, will I?
