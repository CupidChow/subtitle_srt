1
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,520
[You're the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one.] You're the one who's here.

2
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,920
I warn you

3
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,000
Don't you dare climb onto my bed!

4
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,640
It's not ordinary,

5
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,720
You're confident.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,920
What did you say?

7
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,600
I mean the mattress of our hotel

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,360
is high-tech nanometer technology.

9
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,200
You can run, dance and dance.

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,800
If you want to climb,

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,720
if you want to climb.

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,440
If I want to,

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
I want to be like this

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,600
A woman like you

15
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,800
like you.

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,640
I've seen many bosses like you.

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,440
Interesting.

18
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:34,640
How about this?

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,680
If you can let me sleep comfortably,

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,920
sleep comfortably,

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,840
And get rid of

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,160
those stupid women

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,200
Get rid of them.

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,720
I can give you a chance

25
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,800
to get close to me.

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,720
I can even knock through the air.

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
It's okay

28
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,720
It's my honor that you can check out successfully.

29
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,080
Get out.

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,320
I'm warning you.

31
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,360
You'd better not

32
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,640
the sound of a needle falling.

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,720
Otherwise,

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,520
I'll make you pay.

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,680
Perfect.

36
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,000
Tonight, I must arrive before that bitch.

37
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,720
That stupid woman Luo Fei

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,160
is no match for me.

39
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,400
Nightmare, wait for me!

40
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
The one who got Lord Li tonight

41
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,600
must be me.

42
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,400
I'm exhausted.

43
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,720
I know the plot.

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,720
Two women fight for one man

45
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,720
The old trick of getting promoted.

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,200
Now, I can sleep till dawn

47
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,240
I can complete the mission successfully.

48
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,560
It's simple.

49
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,320
It's a mission. It's a mission.

50
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,560
It's a mission. It's a mission.

51
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,680
Who are you?

52
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,320
It's really a love fragrance.

53
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,680
Tell me, did Gu Zhen send you here?

54
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,120
Actually,

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,240
I'm Mr. Li's secretary.

56
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,680
I'm here to deliver a message.

57
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Nighteye.

58
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,880
That's too much.

59
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,440
Let's go. Don't keep Nighteye waiting.

60
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,240
Open the door!

61
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,840
Open the door!

62
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,200
It's Gu Zhen's voice.

63
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,680
How is it possible?

64
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,320
Miss Luo, please wait a moment.

65
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,240
I'll report to Mr. Li.

66
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,480
I'll be right there.

67
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,640
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

68
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,280
Hey.

69
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,320
Hey, hey, hey.

70
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,240
Lafite in 1982.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
I gave it to Luo Fei.

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,640
Does she want to climb to my fiancé’s bed

73
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,360
with the wine I gave her?

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,159
Miss Gu,

75
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,120
It's a misunderstanding.

76
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,520
I'm Mr. Li's secretary.

77
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,200
I'm here to send a message.

78
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,640
It's a letter from Night Lord.

79
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,160
Okay.

80
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,560
Nightmare, I'm going to see you now.

81
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,400
That's even worse!

82
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,720
OK. OK.

83
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,400
It's the third one. It's the third one.

84
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,640
Get it straight.

85
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm his fiancee, okay?

86
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,040
I'm his childhood friend.

87
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,520
I'm his lucky friend.

88
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,000
Woman.

89
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,120
Be quiet! Be quiet!

90
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,560
Over there! Over there!

91
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,320
I’m here. I’m here.

92
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,120
[Hello, Mr. Li.] [I'm here.]

93
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,560
Yes.

94
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,880
I'm talking to them now.

95
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Nightmare!

96
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,440
It's here. It's here. It's here.

97
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,320
Yajah, where are you?

98
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,960
Can you hear me?

99
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,680
Yetsu! Yetsu!

100
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,760
Stop!

101
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,600
A female competition, right?

102
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,520
Since you like female competition so much,

103
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,480
I'll let you compete thoroughly.

104
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
I said, let's go! Let's go!

105
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,320
Ladies,

106
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,640
Mr. Li has prepared a battle for you.

107
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,159
If anyone wins before dawn,

108
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,440
will be able to

109
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,400
with Mr. Li.

110
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,760
I wonder if you're willing.

111
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
I do.

112
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,840
The battle today is

113
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,000
Enter Li Group.

114
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,960
What?

115
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,920
If you want to marry Mr. Li,

116
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,680
you must have a business mind

117
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,000
to help Mr. Li

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,440
more economic benefits.

119
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,640
and expand their company.

120
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,240
That's right. Let's go. Let's go.

121
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,240
Let's go. Let's go.

122
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,040
The more, the better. The better. The better. The better.

123
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,360
The one who wins. The one who wins. The one who wins.

124
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,320
The winner. The winner.

125
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,240
Find out who else

126
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,640
the shares of Li Group.

127
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,200
Hello?

128
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,000
Give me a list.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,600
Tell everyone in the company

130
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,880
I want to acquire Li's Group's shares.

131
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,960
Are you interested in working together?

132
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,800
Right away.

133
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,640
Okay, I'll wait for your good news.

134
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,680
How many shares do you have now?

135
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,800
Hello, the group, right?

136
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,360
I have a project. Are you interested in working with me?

137
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,480
Okay, I'll wait for your good news.

138
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,920
Work with us.

139
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,960
Here you are. Two.

140
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,520
Okay. Okay.

141
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,880
Okay. Okay.

142
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,360
Come to me now.

143
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,920
Yes, I'll be right there.

144
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,040
I'll be right there.

145
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,520
Mr. Li.

146
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,600
Are you looking for me?

147
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,880
A woman?

148
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,040
What's going on?

149
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,960
It's noisy.

150
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,880
Sorry, Mr. Li.

151
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,920
Just now, two ladies who adore you very much

152
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,240
almost got into a fight.

153
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,520
But I've invited them away.

154
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
You can continue to rest.

155
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,320
Mr. Li, you're here. I'm here. I'm here to see you. I'm here.

156
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,880
Here you are. Here you are.

157
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,440
The smell of alcohol.

158
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,400
You want to kick them out and come by yourself?

159
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,120
No, no.

160
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,480
I don't think so.

161
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,920
Mr. Li.

162
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,360
Your personal phone number

163
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,960
must be very important.

164
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,840
Listen.

165
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,560
What should we do, Mr. Li?

166
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Sorry, Mr. Li.

167
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,760
You came here just to have a good sleep.

168
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,320
I can't let work

169
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,360
affect your rest.

170
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,080
Don't let him find out

171
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,880
I'm letting his heroines

172
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,320
to his company.

173
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,520
Have a seat, Mr. Li.

174
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,200
Don't worry.

175
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,080
I'll keep it for you. Okay.
