1
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,680
Xian.

2
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,680
I didn't expect

3
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,360
meet again so soon.

4
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,080
I'll protect you.

5
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,560
But...

6
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,840
this mission

7
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,280
is to stop the relationship between Long Qing and Su Bai Lian.

8
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,600
It seems that

9
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,120
have no connection at all.

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,360
I don't know

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,800
I have no idea.

12
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,400
I have a bad feeling about this.

13
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,680
I know.

14
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,480
you'll have a lot of doubts.

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,600
But please trust me.

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,800
I've discovered

17
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,920
The secret of time traveling. The secret of time traveling.

18
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,120
Time travel! Time travel!

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,440
In fact,

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,960
doesn't belong to this world.

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,880
You don't belong to this world.

22
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,479
What do you mean?

23
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,840
Who is it?

24
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,520
[How dare you abduct me?] I'm sorry.

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,280
Congratulations.

26
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
As a scrap script,

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,000
[Satan Hunting: My Pure Pure Wife]

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,200
The male lead of the novel.

29
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,040
[You've received a chance to be reborn.]

30
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,960
You will travel

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,120
The bosses will all get off the bed.

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,079
The CEO of

33
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,560
to be the president, Longqing,

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,120
and get a second chance

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,920
to live as a president.

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,120
Who are you?

37
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,560
I'm warning you.

38
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,040
You can't afford

39
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,079
for kidnapping me.

40
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,640
[This is your novel.]

41
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,040
A novel?

42
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
What a joke.

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
I'm not a fictional person.

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
To be exact,

45
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,720
You're an abandoned novelist.

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,960
No way.

47
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,200
I'll be abandoned.

48
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,800
Come out!

49
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,240
You were abandoned by the editor of web fiction

50
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,680
by the editor of this novel.

51
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,600
The world where you and you were originally no longer existed.

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,240
The system has decided to give you a chance

53
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,920
to go to the center of the Universe.

54
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,960
Nebrand Hotel.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,360
As the boss of the boss,

56
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,400
and live a new life.

57
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,040
Hello. Hello.

58
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,800
Hotel.

59
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,079
The boss of the boss.

60
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,120
Special reminder.

61
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,320
The editor of web fiction

62
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,600
is also at the hotel.

63
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,800
If you have any questions,

64
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,600
find her,

65
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,000
Maybe we can find the answer.

66
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,960
What answer?

67
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,280
The system has been activated.

68
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Good luck.

69
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,400
Hello. Hello.

70
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,280
Mr Long.

71
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,240
This is the manager of No. 324 lobby.

72
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,960
Please have a look.

73
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,520
I know these things

74
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,480
are a bit ridiculous.

75
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
If you don't believe me,

76
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,600
I totally understand.

77
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,720
I don't know why

78
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,200
I have

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,880
the memories of Lord Li.

80
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,560
But I know

81
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,200
I don't want to be apart from you anymore.

82
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,200
So,

83
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,320
I have to confirm my identity

84
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,280
to be with you forever.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,600
It turns out

86
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,240
he's the male lead I deleted.

87
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,040
I can't even remember his previous name.

88
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,720
I have to find that.

89
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,440
and delete my editor.

90
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,720
She's in the hotel world too.

91
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,040
[Maybe...]

92
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,080
find her,

93
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,480
I can find the way I exist.

94
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,480
But before that,

95
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,600
I don't know.

96
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,120
[When will it disappear again?]

97
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,960
disappear again.

98
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
So...

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,760
Please allow me

100
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,400
propose to you.

101
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,120
This is the original me.

102
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,680
I cherish the most.

103
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,120
As long as you take it,

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,240
no matter who I become,

105
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,880
I will find you.

106
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,280
Marry me.

107
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,159
Yu Xian Xian.

108
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Actually,

109
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,800
I know.

110
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,880
It's a bit sudden.

111
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,360
But this is my real thought.

112
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,560
Actually, I...

113
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,640
If you haven't decided yet,

114
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,520
you can

115
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,640
Tell me the answer later.

116
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,720
You proposed to me.

117
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,120
I'm touched and happy.

118
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,200
Xian.

119
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,800
Tell me your secret.

120
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,160
I really...

121
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,120
If you think it's not suitable,

122
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,640
I totally understand.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,040
You don't have to do this.

124
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,440
Get up.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,520
Get up.

126
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,120
I'm the editor

127
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,480
who deleted you.

128
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,440
What did you say?

129
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,640
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,960
I just deleted your female editor.

131
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,480
Are you kidding me?

132
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,280
Yu Xian Xian.

133
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,480
How is this possible?

134
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
It's impossible.

135
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,520
The person I love the most

136
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,280
is someone who wants to destroy me.

137
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,240
Okay.

138
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,640
Go wash the sheets.

139
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,840
It's my fault.

140
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,120
Forgive me.

141
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,400
It's a ring. It's a ring. It's a ring.

142
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,520
This ring

143
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,840
from your grandma.

144
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,400
So that when you like girls in the future,

145
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,080
when you like a girl.

146
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,680
How did you know?

147
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Your grandma raised you.

148
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,240
After your grandma passed away,

149
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,400
This is especially important.

150
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,560
The last female lead

151
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,040
was also

152
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,480
accidentally found this ring

153
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,760
That's how you met.

154
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,880
It's really you.

155
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,080
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,920
Why did you delete me?

157
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,640
Because...

158
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,240
Because of the data.

159
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,360
I asked you why your data

160
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,080
this month?

161
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,720
Can't you understand the data?

162
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,400
Overbearing wind.

163
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,560
Is there such a president?

164
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,720
Is this your first day here?

165
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't you know the boss?

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,440
You've edited hundreds of books.

167
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,360
Help me revise the plan tonight.

168
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,440
Delete the one with bad data.

169
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,840
Don't waste time on it.

170
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,200
But I...

171
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Don't say "but".

172
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,440
Just give up.

173
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,560
Is that why my life is ruined?

174
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,360
Because of what?

175
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,040
The data.

176
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,560
Sorry.

177
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,320
I didn't protect you well.

178
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,000
It's just that

179
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,240
the number of views

180
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,440
has really

181
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
is too low.

182
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,640
I have to give up my manuscript.

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,040
I'm not saying

184
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,400
that book is not good.

185
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,360
Well...

186
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,560
It's called the Internet. It's called "The Network". It's "The Network". It's "The Network". It's "The Network".

187
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,280
It needs a lot of views

188
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,600
to determine whether this book is valuable.

189
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,200
So my existence

190
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,120
is worthless.

191
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,400
No.

192
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,000
Listen to me.

193
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,040
Yu Xian Xian.

194
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,760
I thought
