1
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,240
[It's a love story.] [It's a love story.]

2
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,960
our marriage

3
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,040
depends on you.

4
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,320
No.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,600
Editor Yu likes

6
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,239
dramas like this?

7
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,440
If I can increase the views of the novel,

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,640
you should be very happy.

9
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,120
Mr Long.

10
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,000
Are you done with the clothes? Sure.

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,480
If there's nothing else,

12
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
I'm leaving.

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,920
You haven't told me whether you'll be the witness or not.

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,640
will you be the witness or not?

15
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,479
I can't refute what happened before.

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,920
But from now on,

17
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,640
you decide how to write your story.

18
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,320
This card

19
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,800
can be changed at will.

20
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,800
and change the plot.

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,840
I've returned the attributes you erased before.

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,440
Although this is your persona,

23
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
I think

24
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,840
they are all additional to you.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,560
So what kind of person do you want to be?

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,720
or how to use this card,

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,120
You decide.

28
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,720
What about me?

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,240
I will live my own life.

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,120
No matter where I am,

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,680
Do you think I'm a three-year-old?

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,400
You want to lie to me with a stupid card?

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,120
I won't trust you anymore.

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,320
Mr. Long, I've tried on the clothes.

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,960
I'll get back to work.

36
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,560
What happened?

37
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,520
Someone is trying to stop me.

38
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,560
Pride.

39
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,440
So what she said is true.

40
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,240
She has the character of being proud.

41
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,120
Even if I want to find her,

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,960
you have to act the opposite way.

43
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
A friendly reminder.

44
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,440
Are you sure you're going to use a tool card against the system?

45
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm sure.

46
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,880
Attention, the tool card has only been modified three times.

47
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,800
Once used, it will not be reversed.

48
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,960
If you violate the system,

49
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,480
and refuses to marry Su Bailin,

50
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,920
The other player will complete the mission successfully

51
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,040
and return to the real world.

52
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,480
And you will disappear forever.

53
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,279
Are you sure you want to use the tool card?

54
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,040
Shut up.

55
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,920
Mr Long, how about this?

56
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Have you seen Yu Xian?

57
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,040
I think she went out.

58
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,920
No.

59
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,600
Your wedding...

60
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,000
Yu Xian Xian.

61
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,840
The one you gave me

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,720
can change my character and the plot.

63
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,000
What did you change?

64
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,840
I've cut off all the attributes.

65
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,120
domineering, arrogant, narcissistic, and evil.

66
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,720
Those words that bind me

67
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,480
Those words

68
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,159
were given to me by others.

69
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,159
I didn't do it willingly.

70
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,560
But from now on,

71
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,160
every decision I make

72
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,160
comes from my heart.

73
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,240
So,

74
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,720
when I cut them off,

75
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,240
I found that I still love you.

76
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,800
I think only in this way

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,280
can propose to you.

78
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,360
Marry me, Yu Xian Xian.

79
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,800
But...

80
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,560
If you love me,

81
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,480
put this ring on.

82
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
From now on,

83
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,400
no matter what kind of dramatic setting it is,

84
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,840
I want to face it with you.

85
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,280
As an editor,

86
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,920
I want a new novel

87
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,159
two people who love each other

88
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,960
can't be more than one chapter.

89
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,480
As the male lead,

90
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,640
I've decided to make up with the male lead

91
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,960
That one.

92
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,080
can change me.

93
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,720
So I wrote down

94
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,600
on it.

95
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,480
I think

96
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,799
the card you gave me

97
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,840
hoping that

98
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,200
lead my life.

99
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Guess what I wrote.

100
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,840
What is it?

101
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,480
Long Qing and Yu Xian

102
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,840
will be together forever.

103
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,480
This card can be like this?

104
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,240
I want to live on my own.

105
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,320
Okay, this card.

106
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,360
is useless to me.

107
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,320
Welcome to

108
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,720
to attend Mr. Long Qing's wedding.

109
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,680
In front of the only eight-star hotel

110
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,200
the only eight-star hotel in the world,

111
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,680
Let's witness

112
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,840
this romantic love.

113
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,320
Let's welcome the bride. Come on.
