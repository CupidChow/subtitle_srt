1
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,080
Excuse me. Is there a bus? Is there a bus?

2
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,080
The bus takes 30 minutes.

3
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,040
I want to ask

4
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,240
The bus takes 30 minutes.

5
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,200
Phanut.

6
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,520
The bus takes 30 minutes.

7
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,600
The bus takes 30 minutes.

8
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,480
Are you a non-player?

9
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,840
The bus takes 30 minutes.

10
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,520
If I stay here for too long,

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,760
Am I a non-player too?

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,000
The bus takes 30 minutes.

13
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,080
The bus takes 30 minutes.

14
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,240
What's wrong with me?

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,320
It's too scary.

16
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,320
Is this the edge of the world?

17
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,880
So many dresses

18
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,720
I'm so happy now.

19
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,760
Yeah

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy.

21
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,000
After all,

22
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,600
a man and a woman should live happily together.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Which one should I try first?

24
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
These wedding dresses

25
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,840
are not perfect enough.

26
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,800
I'll choose one for you.

27
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,440
the perfect wedding dress for you.

28
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,560
Mr. Yu.

29
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,880
Why are you here?

30
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,320
Mr. Cheon.

31
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,800
What a coincidence. I have something to ask you.

32
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,600
Mr. Yu.

33
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,960
Is something bothering you?

34
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,360
Nothing.

35
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,800
I just got dumped.

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,600
Hey.

37
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,440
There are many men in the world.

38
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
There's no need to cry for those men.

39
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,600
A woman's career is the most important.

40
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,520
and unemployment.

41
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,600
Your boss is really weird.

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,800
It's not your fault.

43
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,079
You...

44
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,000
Are you interested in being my assistant?

45
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,000
My assistant Bai

46
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,640
is getting married today.

47
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,360
I need an assistant.

48
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,360
What did you say?

49
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,000
I need an assistant.

50
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,280
The last line.

51
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,000
[I'm going to the hotel.] [I'm going to the hotel.]

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,760
I'm going to the hotel now.

53
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,360
to attend their wedding.

54
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,000
It's really sudden.

55
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,280
I didn't expect Xiao Bai to be with Long Qing.

56
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,840
This is Cinderella and Prince of the century.

57
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,560
Mr. Yu

58
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,560
to work here?

59
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,600
Why are you crying more?

60
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,560
No, I'm crying out of joy.

61
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,800
That's good. You can work today.

62
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,680
Because this wedding dress

63
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,000
the wedding dress.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,560
Please go to the hotel

65
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,000
to try on Mr. Long's dress.

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,400
Mr. Yu.

67
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,560
Thank you for helping me wear this dress.

68
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,560
You're welcome.

69
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,520
This is my job.

70
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Besides, I'm not Manager Yu anymore.

71
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,280
Can I call you Xian?

72
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,320
Sure.

73
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,600
You have no idea

74
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,280
I used to envy you.

75
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,240
to work with Long Qing.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,160
I didn't expect to marry him now.

77
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,400
This is like a dream.

78
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,159
I'm so happy.

79
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,600
By the way,

80
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,720
Ziqiao.

81
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,840
Dress.

82
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,000
Mr. Long.

83
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,120
We have informed everyone

84
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,680
They are rushing to the hotel

85
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,560
to your wedding.

86
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,560
What about the dress?

87
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,080
I've asked Mr. Cheon to deliver it.

88
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,600
the most splendid wedding dress and suit of Qian’s Group.

89
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,280
And according to your order,

90
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,080
Mr. Qian found Yu Xian

91
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,640
to hire her as her assistant.

92
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,920
She's downstairs at the Wedding Department

93
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,400
to help Miss Su try on her wedding dress.

94
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,120
Mr Long, you'll be fully responsible

95
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,520
for the wedding.

96
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,080
You don't have to report to me.

97
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,880
You've done a great job.

98
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,080
You're welcome.

99
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,120
Thank you.

100
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,080
It must be an illusion.

101
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,760
Yu Xian Xian.

102
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,840
Stop pretending to be cool.

103
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,080
Great.

104
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,840
You became a homeless man in the world of novels.

105
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,440
and married the man you love.

106
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,400
And you want to help your rival in love?

107
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,640
to wear a wedding gown.

108
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,440
Oh, my. Oh, my.

109
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,720
Can you save me?

110
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,200
There are two more chances.

111
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,280
Do you want to change it?

112
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,440
Change what?

113
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,840
You said you like me.

114
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,520
Marry someone else in a blink of an eye.

115
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,080
Marry me.

116
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,120
If an ordinary female lead wants to attract the president's attention,

117
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,520
to attract attention from the president.

118
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,440
Chief Editor Yu knows this well.

119
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,760
Get me changed.

120
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,480
Before this,

121
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,800
I hurt you.

122
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,040
I apologize again.

123
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,200
Are you done?

124
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,160
Put my tie on.

125
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,840
The wedding is about to begin.

126
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,280
What?

127
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,600
You don't want me to marry Su Baili? Yes.

128
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,560
I'm afraid

129
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,440
You'll ruin your mission.

130
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,440
There's no way

131
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,400
to get rid of an annoying boss like me.

132
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,600
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,800
No.

134
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
I'm not an annoying boss.

135
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,720
If not,

136
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,360
you can be our witness.

137
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,680
After all,

138
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,560
our marriage

139
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,520
depends on you.

140
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,800
No.

141
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,200
Isn't this what Editor Yu likes the most?

142
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,840
dramas like this?

143
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,920
If I can increase the views of the novel,

144
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,240
I'm sure you'd like it.
