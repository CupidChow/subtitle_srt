1
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,160
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,320
Let's go. Let's go.

3
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,880
let it

4
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,840
release it.

5
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,000
Come on.

6
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,320
Leng Ting Han, are you there?

7
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,080
[I'm here.]

8
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,360
I'm here.

9
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,360
Okay.

10
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,440
Ready for the devil training.

11
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,200
Have you regained the control of your body?

12
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,320
Nice.

13
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,000
Your knees.

14
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,520
Hold on. Hold on.

15
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,640
Come on.

16
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,000
Good job.

17
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,840
Okay. Okay. Okay.

18
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,520
Four, nine, seven. Okay.

19
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,440
Four, nine, eight.

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,600
499

21
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,320
5,000.

22
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,880
It's 5,000. It's good.

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,480
Drink some water.

24
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,720
Detoxicate. Okay.

25
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's continue later.

26
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,120
No need.

27
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,200
I think I'm much better now.

28
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,960
Mr. Yu is so enthusiastic.

29
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,840
to be a fitness coach?

30
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,200
Don't you have any feelings for me?

31
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,320
Well...

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,280
Mr. Leng.

33
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,920
Your medicine is quite strong.

34
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,640
Let's go to practice.

35
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,160
Really?

36
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,360
Right.

37
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,400
We just met today.

38
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,120
How could my heart flutter so quickly?

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,600
Don't worry, Mr. Yu.

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm fine now.

41
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,600
Yeah.

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,560
We met each other

43
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,640
Time flies.

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,040
It's the first time we met.

45
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,240
A woman?

46
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,840
You're lying. It's here. It's here.

47
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,000
The clothes are still there.

48
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,360
Follow the routine of the novel.

49
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,840
nothing must have happened.

50
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,160
Yu Xian Xian, what are you doing?

51
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,000
You're not the one who was drugged. Why did you kiss?

52
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,760
You're awake.

53
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,480
Morning.

54
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,320
After last night

55
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,880
Why are you so shy?

56
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,640
Last night...

57
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,840
We didn't do anything last night?

58
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,600
We didn't do anything.

59
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,280
You fell and fainted.

60
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,560
I fell.

61
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,040
Are you tempted now?

62
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,040
I...

63
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,440
Let's drink some water.

64
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,440
Yu Jianjian.

65
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,720
Yu Xian Xian.

66
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,440
Yu Xian, are you okay?

67
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,640
I'm fine.

68
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,880
I didn't expect your hotel

69
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,440
to evaluate the restaurant.

70
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,880
It's Manager Yu's trap.

71
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,880
Mr. Leng.

72
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,280
This is...

73
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,400
This is

74
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,320
a premeditated revenge against you.

75
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,280
This is not our hotel's problem.

76
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,280
Me too, because of that.

77
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,880
I didn't do it on purpose.

78
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,560
It doesn't matter.

79
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,600
What matters is you.

80
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,520
Don't worry.

81
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,280
I'll be responsible for you.

82
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,680
Be responsible for me.

83
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,440
I want to marry you.

84
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,200
I'll propose to you seriously.

85
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,560
Marry me.

86
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,440
This is too much.

87
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,520
It's not that serious.

88
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,120
Then...

89
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,520
[That kiss last night was a kiss.] [It was a kiss.]

90
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,280
That's...

91
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,960
That's the effect.

92
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,480
Just pretend nothing happened.

93
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,040
The door should be open.

94
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,360
I'll check out for you.

95
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,600
He got me.

96
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,320
Warning! Mission failed!

97
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,880
Why?

98
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,320
Although the process was complicated,

99
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,600
but I did stop it.

100
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,760
the one-night stand between men and women.

101
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,840
The task of this round is

102
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,760
to protect Leng Ting Han's food.

103
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,520
Leng Ting Han ate poisonous food.

104
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,320
So it's a failure.

105
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,120
So you failed last night?

106
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,880
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

107
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,680
I was kissed

108
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,000
[I'm kissed.] [I'm a writer.]

109
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,480
As an editor of a novel,

110
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,040
you should know what the plot is best.

111
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,480
So...

112
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,520
You did it on purpose.

113
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,440
Have you been watching us?

114
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,120
You will be punished for failing the mission.

115
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,440
What punishment?

116
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,280
You'll stay in Hotel Nerverand forever.

117
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,360
and never return to the real world.

118
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,200
It's over.

119
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
Oh no.

120
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,960
Have you heard

121
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,440
Chef ruined

122
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,760
of our restaurant.

123
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
He ran away overnight.

124
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,080
This is embarrassing.

125
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,400
As the eight-star hotel,

126
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,880
the restaurant is a disgrace.

127
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,520
But I heard

128
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,880
Chef found a beauty to spend the night with Mr. Leng

129
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,040
to bribe Mr. Leng.

130
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,000
Beauty, I remember yesterday

131
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,960
Mr. Yu went to eat with Mr. Leng.

132
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,960
Is the beauty that was kicked out by Mr. Leng...

133
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,040
Mr. Xia.

134
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Mr. Yu.

135
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,000
I've heard about it.

136
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,880
But it's not your fault.

137
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,960
And I've reported it to President Long.

138
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,440
President Long won't fire you.

139
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,000
Just fire me.

140
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,200
There's no point in staying here anyway.

141
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,120
Is the rumor true?

142
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,680
What rumor?

143
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,880
They said you were going to resign

144
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,680
and decided to resign and get married.

145
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,120
No.

146
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,480
Whatever.

147
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,760
I guess it's true.

148
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,600
Congratulations in advance.

149
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,200
About the Star evaluation at the restaurant,

150
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,960
can you say something nice?

151
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,000
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

152
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,280
Come in.

153
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,720
Mr. Leng, the check-out procedure is done for you.

154
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,880
Let me take you down.

155
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,160
Actually, last night I...

156
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,440
Don't worry, Mr. Yu.

157
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,320
I'll pretend nothing happened.

158
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,320
Don't tell me you're talking about the star review at the restaurant.

159
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,560
I didn’t expect

160
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,200
an expensive hotel would use a manager.

161
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,080
as a bait.

162
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,080
Mr. Leng,

163
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,400
Our hotel is not that low-class, is it?

164
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,000
What star?

165
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,720
As long as it's delicious, I don't care.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
Don't use your stupid rules to kidnap others.

167
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,800
Rules? Yes.
