1
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,920
No.

2
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,000
Who are you?

3
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,240
You are...

4
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,400
It's me.

5
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,280
It's really you.

6
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,800
Where have you been?

7
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,440
I couldn't find you anywhere.

8
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,200
I thought you were a girl.

9
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
I

10
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,840
I saw you being pulled away in the hotel.

11
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,520
I rushed up with an arrow.

12
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,000
and was thrown out by the security guard.

13
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,960
So I disguised myself

14
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,440
and got away.

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,759
I miss you so much.

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,479
Put me down.

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,479
Hurry up.

18
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,120
I'm going to faint.

19
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,680
So,

20
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,440
your name is Huo Chenxi,

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,000
not a CEO.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,920
He's just

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,000
an ordinary person.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,080
Would you mind that I'm not the president?

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Of course not.

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,280
It's better.

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,520
That's good.

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,400
What's going on?

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,920
Why does he look

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,079
look like

31
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,640
a non-player character in a novel?

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,040
He's just an ordinary big boy.

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,079
He's not a president,

34
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,960
nor a domineering and arrogant protagonist.

35
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,520
But

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,320
It's not bad.

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,720
It's broken.

38
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:40,920
What's wrong?

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,560
Let's go.

40
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,440
Follow me.

41
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,480
Our men are looking for him.

42
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,000
Not yet.

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,079
Mr. Cheon.

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,160
What should we do?

45
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,920
The press conference will be held soon.

46
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,880
That's our main style.

47
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,120
What matters is Manager Yu's safety.

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,920
We must catch that man.

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,440
About the dress...

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,520
about the dress.

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,840
You may leave.

52
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,040
Hello, Mr. Cheon.

53
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,040
I’m the clothing assistant of the Design Department.

54
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,120
Jiang Yunting.

55
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,520
I heard the main dress was lost.

56
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,880
I have a dress I designed.

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,320
to show you.

58
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,000
Who told you they lost the dress?

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,120
they ran away from me.

60
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,440
Even so,

61
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,320
my brand's main dress

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,480
I won't use

63
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,200
Costume assistant.

64
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,360
and design clothes.

65
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,079
Just do your job.

66
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,640
The dress I designed

67
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,480
is ordinary,

68
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,000
But I believe the CEO of Cheon Group

69
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,200
will be very shocking.

70
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,360
Right?

71
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,080
Ms. Cheon.

72
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,640
So we need to stop them from meeting each other.

73
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,680
In this way,

74
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,920
won’t know that Qiantou is a girl’s secret.

75
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,760
Then he won't be a threat to Chimcheol.

76
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,640
Then your mission will be completed.

77
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,800
Have you heard

78
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,280
The most handsome man in the CEO world is a woman?

79
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,400
Aren't you surprised?

80
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,560
Everyone can tell she's a girl.

81
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
Otherwise, if she treated you like that,

82
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,320
I would have beaten her up.

83
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,880
Besides,

84
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,960
Actually,

85
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,680
Her...

86
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,080
feminine characteristics.

87
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,320
It's quite obvious.

88
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,159
It is.

89
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,400
But it shouldn't be.

90
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,800
How can people in this world see it?

91
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,280
Is the system bug again?

92
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,480
So I think

93
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,240
Jiang Yunting

94
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,880
even if I didn’t see her in the changing room,

95
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,480
she should be like me.

96
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,000
like me.

97
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,800
You're right.

98
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,440
We can't send hope.

99
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,080
to separate them.

100
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,600
Maybe Jiang Yunting

101
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,600
knew Qiantou was a woman.

102
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,560
and threatened him at the press conference.

103
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,400
to make profit.

104
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,640
What are you doing?

105
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,080
It's a reward. It's a reward. It's a reward.

106
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,200
Reward.

107
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,200
Is the public persona

108
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
a puppy?

109
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,200
That's it.

110
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,720
I'll reward you

111
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,200
I'll reward you.

112
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,720
A reward?

113
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,720
Okay.

114
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,160
I’ll deal with Qiantou.

115
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,640
You deal with Jiang Yunting.

116
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,080
Don’t let him be threatened.

117
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,280
Got it?

118
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,120
Leave it to me.

119
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,760
Remember to reward me.

120
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
Why are you getting greasy?

121
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,440
Mr. Qian.

122
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,120
Mr. Yu.

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,960
You're back.

124
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,120
Is that man okay?

125
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
Are you hurt?

126
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,560
I'm fine.

127
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,120
Sorry.

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,600
I took your dress.

129
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,920
It's okay.

130
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,440
I've decided to use another dress.

131
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,200
I just saw

132
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,120
Someone from the clothing department

133
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,320
The dress is not bad.

134
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,920
I’ll use his.

135
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,080
Is that Jiang Yunting?

136
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,920
Did he threaten you with your gender?

137
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,840
With his design?

138
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,240
How did you know?

139
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,600
You told him I was a girl.

140
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,520
No.

141
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,120
It's not me.

142
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,760
How could I say that?

143
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,360
It turns out

144
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,080
all this.

145
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,360
I thought

146
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,120
you were the best model of this dress.

147
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,480
but you purposely wore it away.

148
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,080
You even threatened me

149
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,200
to threaten me.

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,000
Who sent you?

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,960
Mr. Qian, you misunderstood.

152
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,440
It's not you.

153
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,200
Please get out.

154
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,560
No, listen to me.

155
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,320
Get out.

156
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,880
Mr. Qian!

157
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,280
Mr. Qian! Mr. Qian!

158
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,800
Mr. Qian! Mr. Qian!

159
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,280
Mr. Qian.

160
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,680
Mr. Qian, let me explain.

161
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,760
Mr. Qian.

162
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,800
I know you won’t trust me anymore.

163
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,960
But I still want to say,

164
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,600
maybe you think disguising as a man

165
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,600
can make things easier.

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,520
But being yourself

167
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,040
to break the prejudice.

168
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,680
I hope you can see

169
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,960
girls are capable and powerful.

170
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
That dress

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,680
The most suitable model is not me.

172
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,320
but you.

173
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,600
I hope you can see your beauty.

174
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,440
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,320
Sorry for the trouble.

176
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,600
Mr. Cheon.

177
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,480
The press conference is in half an hour.

178
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,080
Our main dress.

179
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,200
Okay.

180
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
Who are you looking for?

181
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,680
Oh no.

182
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,520
She turned me down.

183
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,360
How is Jiang Yunting?

184
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,720
Don’t worry.

185
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,960
I've done

186
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,520
of course I did it for you.

187
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,320
Jiang Yunting will never threaten Qiantou again.

188
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,400
How?

189
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,760
Of course.

190
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,600
[It's a good thing to be able to understand.] [It's a good thing.]

191
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,720
It's touching. It's like this.

192
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,960
Jiang Yunting.

193
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,160
What’s up?

194
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,600
Come with me.

195
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,080
Who are you?

196
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,320
Ah.

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,960
Is this what you said?

198
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,200
I know the reason.

199
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,400
and touch her.

200
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,600
Is your boyfriend awesome?

201
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,520
Not at all.

202
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,760
Seriously.

203
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,520
He's the male lead of the novel.

204
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,920
What if he gets revenge?

205
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,320
What if he threatens Chimcheol?

206
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,080
Then...

207
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,080
beat him again.

208
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,840
This is not a puppy.

209
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,120
This is the character of a puppy.

210
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,800
Welcome to

211
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,480

212
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,360

213
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,520
