1
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,600
Mr. Leng.

2
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,920
Our hotel is not that low-class, is it?

3
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,520
What star?

4
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,240
As long as it's delicious, I don't care how many stars it is.

5
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,720
Don't use your stupid rules to kidnap others.

6
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,320
Bullshit.

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,360
Congratulations on triggering the hidden line.

8
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,280
Please choose to start.

9
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,920
The game is over.

10
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,280
There's a branch.

11
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,600
Because of your excellent performance in the romance chapter,

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,720
I'm giving you a chance to turn the tide.

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,200
You can return to the hotel after completing the supporting task.

14
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
and get a chance to turn the tide.

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,360
Is this another trap

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,520
for the plot?

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,400
What mission?

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,120
to convince Leng Ting Han to evaluate eight stars in the hotel restaurant.

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,759
I just said his rules are bullshit.

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,160
I'll give you some warm hints.

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,240
Please invite Leng Ting Han

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,440
to taste delicious food together.

23
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,720
As a gourmet,

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,920
if he is happy,

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,160
please say something nice.

26
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,720
you might be able to complete the mission through the love page.

27
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,360
Thank you.

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,960
Mr. Yu, this rule

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,080
It's really nice.

30
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,600
Mr Leng.

31
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,480
I want to invite you to dinner in my name.

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,760
I wonder if you have time.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,560
Sure.

34
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,639
Let's go. Let's go.

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,560
I've always wanted to go to.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,280
Bei, you're here. You're here. You're here? Yes.

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,440
It's like this. It's like this.

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,200
Do you really want to do this? Yes.

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,840
Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,760
I didn't expect that

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
A president like you

42
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,079
would also come to a shop like this.

43
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,200
Food is not only high and high,

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,840
but also small and beautiful

45
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,079
The chef of this restaurant is very interesting

46
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,160
Thank you.

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,640
Mr. Yu was angry with me just now.

48
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,280
Why do you suddenly want to buy me dinner?

49
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,000
Is it because

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,760
about the Star judgment in the restaurant?

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,960
No way.

52
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,840
Mr. Yu, are you that spineless?

53
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,480
Of course not.

54
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,120
I have a new idea about my morning proposal.

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,800
No.

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
I have no idea.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,760
Mr. Yu, this is not

58
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,800
What do you want me to do?

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,360
I can listen to you.

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,400
Bei Yunqiu.

61
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,000
Leng Ting Han.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,440
We can't eat here. Let's go.

63
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,280
Why?

64
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,160
Come on.

65
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,400
Sir

66
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,720
Here's your order

67
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,720
Try it.

68
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,920
This is the dessert I prepared for you.

69
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,800
The name is...

70
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,840
It's called "The Bloody Swords". It's "The Bloody Swords".

71
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,839
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

72
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,280
It's okay.

73
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,000
It's okay. Relax.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Mr. Yu, although I have a grudge against Leng Ting Han,

75
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,840
I won't kill him.

76
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,840
I promised him.

77
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,760
with dessert.

78
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
Leng Ting Han.

79
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,520
Let Uncle Wang go.

80
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,840
I planned all this.

81
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,880
It has nothing to do with him.

82
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,320
So it's Miss Bei.

83
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,480
If it's between you and me,

84
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,800
why would it involve her?

85
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,400
It was an accident.

86
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,080
I don't know why.

87
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,000
Manager Yu knew our plan.

88
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,200
She locked me in the studio, so...

89
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,720
Leng Ting Han.

90
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,840
Did you do something bad

91
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,120
to the manager?

92
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,800
You have no right to ask me questions.

93
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,200
If Yu Xian is in danger again,

94
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,920
I'll make you disappear.

95
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,480
If you want revenge,

96
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,000
if you want revenge.

97
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,080
But don't use such dirty tricks.

98
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,080
If you're a dessert chef,

99
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,560
then defeat me with dessert.

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
This is what I told you yesterday.

101
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,080
I told you yesterday.

102
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,159
The determination to revenge.

103
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,159
Leng Ting Han, I will defeat you.

104
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,560
I'm looking forward to it.

105
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
I see.

106
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,720
You did it on purpose.

107
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,120
You brought me here.

108
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,960
You know her cooking, right?

109
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,320
You want to test me?

110
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,840
It doesn't matter.

111
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,680
What matters is

112
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,400
the first thing you think of is to protect me.

113
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,760
I know.

114
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,080
you have feelings for me.

115
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,960
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,520
Here you go.

117
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,920
No.

118
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,080
My dear.

119
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,360
Paula.

120
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:29,800
Meat.

121
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,320
My dear.

122
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,240
You have achieved your goal.

123
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,040
Why are you following me?

124
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,240
You're always lying to me.

125
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,800
You lied to me from the beginning.

126
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
that you didn't know me.

127
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,280
You're still lying to me.

128
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,720
My dear.

129
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,560
Yao.

130
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,360
Yao.

131
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Listen to me.

132
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,600
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,920
I don't know why I'm like this.

134
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,400
But when I realized it,

135
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,120
I already lied to you.

136
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,360
You're a hypocrite.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,920
You don't even know

138
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,560
What is sincerity? It's the ultimate move.

139
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,920
I admit it.

140
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,640
I was moved when you confessed to me.

141
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,760
I do like you.

142
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,720
No matter you are Li Ye Ye or Lu Haotian,

143
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,960
or Leng Ting Han,

144
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,800
Me, too, my dear.

145
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,920
Whether I'm Lord Li,

146
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,960
Li Haotian: or Li Haotian,

147
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,760
or…

148
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,520
Leng Ting Han.

149
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,040
My heart flutters over and over again for you

150
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,159
You are me

151
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,680
I'm determined in this chaotic life.

152
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,000
I like you.

153
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,800
Yu Xian Xian.

154
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,680
I like you.

155
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,320
Mr. Yu really resigned?

156
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,280
Of course.

157
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,360
If you can be the wife of the CEO,

158
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,640
Why are you still the manager?

159
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,000
What? So the rumor is true.

160
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Mr. Yu, why are you here?

161
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,960
I'm going to work.

162
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,480
You're not leaving? I'm going to work. I'm going to work. I'm going to work. I'm going to work. I'm going to work.

163
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,720
Mr. Leng,

164
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,680
You don't want your career if you have love.

165
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,760
Who says that?

166
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,200
Women need to do business.

167
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,520
Work makes me happy.

168
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Mr. Yu is more prepared.

169
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes.

170
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,400
Let's get back to work.

171
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,560
Sorry.

172
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,520
I can't judge the stars for your restaurant.

173
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,920
Because in the current system,

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
it's unfair to other restaurants.

175
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,800
You don't have to feel sorry.

176
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,600
Although we're together,

177
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,640
we have to separate our private lives.

178
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,400
The hotel

179
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,800
won't fire me because of this.

180
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,200
Don't worry. I'm a talent.

181
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,920
I failed the branch mission.

182
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,160
We'll be trapped in this hotel.

183
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,840
But thanks to him,

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,200
Why did we break up?

185
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
That's what I thought.

186
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,200
a surprise gift for you.

187
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,120
a surprise gift for you.

188
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,960
What gift?

189
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,160

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,480
but from now on,

196
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,720
