1
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,760
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,200
is the day

3
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,560
officially enter the fashion industry.

4
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,080
Here,

5
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,800
I would like to show you

6
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,759
my biggest secret.

7
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,800
The biggest secret

8
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,960
As you can see,

9
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,600
I'm a woman. I'm a woman.

10
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,680
I'm a woman.

11
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,880
My real name is Chiyoo.

12
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,280
From now on,

13
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,479
I will no longer wear a male mask.

14
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,640
but as a woman

15
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,560
as a woman.

16
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,840
into fashion.

17
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,880
We think

18
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,920
fashion

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,760
Don't be defined by gender.

20
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,360
From now on,

21
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,360
I'm Chimcheol,

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,680
and Chiyoo.

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,320
So...

24
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Is this a success?

25
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,360
I'm not sure yet.

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,960
I hope so.

27
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,280
Mr. Yu.

28
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,440
Mr. Qian.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,120
Congratulations.

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,320
The press conference was a success.

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,320
Thank you.

32
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,079
If you hadn't encouraged me,

33
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,240
I probably

34
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,960
have the courage to take this step.

35
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,120
I was afraid of being looked down on.

36
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,720
and pretended to be a man.

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,560
This is actually

38
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,760
I'm not a woman. I'm a woman.

39
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,040
As a woman,

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,120
you can also achieve your own career.

41
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,120
and even

42
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,560
a different perspective

43
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,640
with men.

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,000
But I denied it.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm afraid that I'll get hurt

46
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,520
I'm afraid

47
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,400
by stereotypes.

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,680
I won't run away anymore.

49
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,560
I'm happy.

50
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,480
You can say it like this.

51
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,920
Thank you.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,240
for taking away my 100% girl.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,600
He ran to the backstage

54
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,560
Look at me. Look at me.

55
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
"Be careful, be careful." "Be careful."

56
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,200
Tell me.

57
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,640
you're his girlfriend.

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,760
Even if I'm a girl,

59
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,440
I can't flirt with you.

60
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,600
I was afraid that you would betray me.

61
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,840
you would betray me.

62
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,120
A silly man like him

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,120
can see my gender at a glance.

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,720
Why would I try so hard to cover it up?

65
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,320
Mr. Cheon.

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
I have something

67
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,800
need you.

68
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,120
Next time.

69
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,920
Let's eat together.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,120
I'll get back to work.

71
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,000
She even warned Mr. Cheon.

72
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,720
She was so close to you.

73
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,280
No.

74
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,640
Look at this. Look at this. Look at this.

75
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,720
Come on. Come on.

76
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,240
Congratulations.

77
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,320
You made it.

78
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,640
[Adapted]

79
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,320
[Adapted to]

80
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,200
she wore a suit and a long skirt.

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,360
This is

82
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,120
you got.

83
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,000
Congratulations.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,600
Synthesis Tool Card.

85
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,240
The last test is coming.

86
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,960
Can you answer me?

87
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
the previous question?

88
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,920
In fact, every time the male lead

89
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,040
is a clone of Long Qing, the president.

90
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,320
Every time he succeeds,

91
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,280
one of his attributes can be eliminated.

92
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,200
Could it be...

93
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,320
Is he the president?

94
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,760
Is it because

95
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,800
Is it because the property has disappeared?

96
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,600
We're still investigating

97
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,720
We're still investigating.

98
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,440
But

99
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,720
You don't have to worry.

100
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,800
The synthesized tool card

101
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,200
It can modify any persona

102
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,520
and adapting the plot.

103
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,480
It will help you a lot

104
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,960
will help you a lot.

105
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,920
Good luck.

106
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,280
When will we start the next test?

107
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,720
We can start it after the investigation.

108
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
The system

109
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
We've arranged an entertainment day for you.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,520
Please enjoy.

111
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,680
What's this?

112
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,480
It's nothing.

113
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,520
Where are we going now?

114
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,280
Come with me.

115
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,200
Let's check out. Okay.

116
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,960
Let's go. Let's go.

117
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,200
I want to sleep.

118
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,320
Let's take a nap.

119
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,120
No.

120
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,480
This is Chimcheol's room.

121
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,400
This is a presidential suite.

122
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,800
Don't be bothered by

123
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,680
by those worldly things.

124
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,880
What matters is we're together now.

125
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,200
At worst,

126
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,480
I can

127
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,600
for another day.

128
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,520
You're still

129
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,240
a rich man.

130
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,200
I'm used to it.

131
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,720
At worst, I'll be your boss. I'll be your boss.

132
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,280
I'll be your assistant.

133
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,160
assistant.

134
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,840
You're the manager. I'm the manager. I'm the manager. I'm the manager of the lobby.

135
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,840
I'm...

136
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,320
the manager's assistant.

137
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,720
Then we can

138
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,919
forever.

139
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,400
forever.

140
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,919
That depends on you.

141
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,840
Why are you looking at me?

142
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,720
Thank you, Xian.

143
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,640
I'm happy

144
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm happy.

145
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,440
Me too.

146
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,400
You are the determination in my confused life.

147
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,800
Every time

148
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,200
I don't know who I am,

149
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,680
I can still love you

150
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,200
I feel like

151
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,680
grasp the last bit of myself.

152
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,200
Every time I wake up,

153
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,040
a different life.

154
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,800
Different personality.

155
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,680
I don't even know who I am.

156
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,240
But...

157
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,320
my love and memory of you

158
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,120
Just like that lighthouse

159
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,720
Always guiding me

160
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,680
Otherwise,

161
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,480
I would have become

162
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,920
a chaotic soul.

163
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,520
I don't know how I can live without you.

164
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,640
So...

165
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,880
No matter how many times it takes,

166
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,360
I'll find you again.

167
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,680
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,640
It's me. It's me.

169
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,320
Your Quirk is eliminated.

170
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,320
I'm the one

171
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,640
who messed up your life.

172
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,520
I'm glad you like me.

173
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,520
But

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,320
you can't see me as

175
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,600
in your life.

176
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,480
Everyone has their own life.

177
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,400
But you are my whole life.
