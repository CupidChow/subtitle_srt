1
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,280
It's a kiss joke.

2
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,720
A woman.

3
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,480
You said no,

4
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,160
but your body is honest.

5
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,600
What's going on?

6
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,400
Is it because I invited his female lead

7
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,320
because I invited his female lead?

8
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,640
This is my first kiss.

9
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Darn it.

10
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,280
Why am I suddenly so sleepy?

11
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,200
Mr. Li.

12
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,520
Woman.

13
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,840
What did you do to me?

14
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,240
Tell me.

15
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,040
you can cure my insomnia.

16
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,760
I can't cure your insomnia.

17
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,120
But love can

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,520
"Love" means

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,280
It's written in books.

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,000
Mr. Li.

21
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,400
Wake up, Mr. Li.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,120
You're still cute

23
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,079
when you don't talk.

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,040
No.

25
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
Why is my heart fluttering?

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,840
What kind of gravity is this?

27
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,960
This place is so scary.

28
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,800
I have to get out of here.

29
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,280
Have a good rest.

30
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,640
There's a surprise waiting for you tomorrow.

31
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,720
Interesting woman.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,360
I can't believe she made me sleep all night.

33
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,120
Perfect.

34
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Woman.

35
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,600
You got my attention.

36
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,680
How did you

37
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,960
Why do you have it?

38
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,680
Hello, Mr. Li.

39
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,360
What's going on?

40
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
You’d better explain it to me.

41
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,200
According to the distribution of shares,

42
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,360
Miss Luo Fei

43
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,440
has 20% of Li’s Group’s shares

44
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,160
and win the final competition.

45
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,040
to spend the night with Mr. Li.

46
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,040
Luo Fei.

47
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,640
You win.

48
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,200
I'll ask my father to cancel the engagement later.

49
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,480
I wish you happiness.

50
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,320
Let's go! Let's go!

51
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,160
This match...

52
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,360
You win.

53
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,680
You win. You win. You win.

54
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,040
What?

55
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,560
Luo Fei, are you insulting me?

56
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,760
You have 20% of the company’s shares.

57
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,600
and I only have 19 percent.

58
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,560
Don't you know

59
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,880
19 and 20 are more?

60
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,280
One of you is 20 percent.

61
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,480
19 percent.

62
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,200
I still have

63
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,920
That's why you're the winner.

64
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,320
Because you love Nighteye more.

65
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,880
You can rely on capital operation

66
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,360
to kick him out of the board.

67
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,800
But in order to preserve the dignity of his founders,

68
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,320
to preserve the dignity of his founder.

69
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,960
Wait.

70
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,800
I must be dreaming.

71
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,040
What are you talking about?

72
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,640
How can you explain that?

73
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,240
You win in the end.

74
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,480
Nightmare is yours.

75
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,320
No, he's yours.

76
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,040
Woman.

77
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,680
What did you do?

78
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,920
that made you sleep all night?

79
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,600
Today,

80
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,680
check out successfully.

81
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,880
Now we're in Li's Group.

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,960
Why should I compete with you in the future?

83
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,640
I achieved this because I wanted to compete with you.

84
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,840
Then,

85
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,080
Let's see who's better in the future.

86
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,880
Li, I gave you your shares.

87
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,880
So, come to my department.

88
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll give you 100 projects if you join my department.

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,640
Yu Xian Xian, I remember you.

90
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,640
I'll make you pay.

91
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,680
See you, Mr. Li.

92
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,640
Congratulations. You made it.

93
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,360
[Breaking into the Heart: The Pride CEO has entered the wrong door.]

94
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,720
has been adapted to "My Genius Love rival".

95
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,520
Now unlock the second round.

96
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,800
In addition, considering your excellent performance,

97
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,160
a tool card as a reward.

98
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,520
Gather all the tool cards.

99
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,840
you can unlock the mysterious skill of the tool card.

100
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,680
and use it during the final mission.

101
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,240
Let me introduce to you, Manager Yu.

102
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,000
Yu Xian Xian is also No. 324.

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,080
and continue to be the manager of our hotel.

104
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,120
Thank you. Let's work hard together.

105
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,680
Come on.

106
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,120
Of course.

107
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,560
she will also be responsible for the reception of Mr. Lu's wine tasting party.

108
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,880
Let's cheer for her.

109
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,159
Come on. Come on.

110
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,040
It's a wine tasting party.

111
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,280
Why haven't I heard of it?

112
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,000
I heard that Mr. Lu is very grumpy and can hit people.

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,720
That's horrible.

114
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's pray for No. 324.

115
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,720
Mr. Lu Haotian.

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,200
He's a bit rigorous.

Come on! Come on! Come on!

121
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,960
Li Ye Ye, you really want me to pay the price?

122
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,880
Lu Haotian.

123
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,400
Isn't this "Love Seeking"? A domineering husband.

124
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,440
The male lead?

125
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,640
Congratulations on the second round, Love Page.

126
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,520
This task

127
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,480
to stop the heroine Chu Xiaowei from becoming Lu Haotian's mistress.

128
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,000
Isn't he Viscount Li?

129
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
This is the main character of the new chapter, Lu Haotian.

130
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,800
Li Ye Ye is over.

131
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,600
Why do they look so alike?

132
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,680
Since all bossy bosses look alike,

133
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
they are all handsome.

134
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,200
And the budget for the cover of web fiction is limited.

135
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,600
I can only modify some makeup.

136
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,920
Oh, it makes sense.

137
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,400
Mr. Lu,

138
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,640
This is the plan for this wine tasting party.

139
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,520
Please have a look.

140
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,720
I'm sorry. I'll contact your secretary.

141
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,240
Thank you.

142
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,320
Let's go. Let's go.

143
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,480
Let's take a break.

144
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,040
According to the original plot,

145
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,360
Tonight, the heroine Chu Xiaowei

146
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,680
of the heroine Chu Xiaowei.

147
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,360
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,400
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
