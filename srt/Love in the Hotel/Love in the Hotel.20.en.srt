1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,240
I want to marry Su Bai Lian.

2
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,280
and live happily together.

3
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,000
I want to marry Su Baili.

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,080
Enough, Su Bai Lian!

5
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,960
Tell me, why did you marry him?

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,080
Why did you marry him?

7
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,480
Who told you that?

8
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,880
Miss Yu.

9
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,000
Although I can't answer your question,

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,800
but I think you might be mistaken.

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,280
Today is my wedding.

12
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,840
Long Qing is my groom.

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,440
Miss Su.

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,000
Long Qing and I...

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,080
love each other sincerely.

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,840
In this hotel,

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,720
in this hotel.

18
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,800
He's domineering and arrogant.

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,759
and narcissistic.

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,560
He's kind and bright.

21
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,160
Sincerity and firm.

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,039
But what does that have to do with me?

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,160
Do you love him?

24
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,400
[Miss Yu, I love you.] [I love you.]

25
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,759
Although I don't know

26
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,240
what love means.

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,560
But it's written

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,479
there's a voice telling me

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,759
to marry me.

30
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,560
and write my wish on this card.

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,240
If I do this,

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,880
I'll be happy.

33
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:20,280
Long Qing and Yu Xian will be together forever.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
I don't know how you got this card.

35
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,440
but it really

36
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,000
can change my life.

37
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,920
But we shouldn't

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,720
He has the right to live on his own.

39
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
He shouldn't be controlled.

40
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,480
It's everyone

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,600
should not be controlled, including you.

42
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:54,880
Su Bai Lian.

43
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,000
Let me ask you again.

44
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,400
Do you love him?

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,600
I don't love him.

46
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,920
I want to pursue my own happiness.

47
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,560
Miss Su,

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,400
If you don't like Mr Long, think about me.

49
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,880
Long Qing.

50
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,440
Come here. Come here.

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,920
Come on. Let's go.

52
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,360
I'm fine.

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,040
I was brainwashed by that stupid system just now.

54
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Let me

55
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,880
the heroine.

56
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,400
Baby.

57
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,160
I'm so scared.

58
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm scared that I didn't confess to the girl I love

59
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,720
I missed the chance to confess to the girl I love.

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,000
I was scared too.

61
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,880
I'll marry someone else against my will.

62
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,280
And then,

63
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,400
I was controlled and lived my life.

64
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,040
That's why

65
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,160
Next,

66
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,120
will you be

67
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,600
in my life?

68
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,279
Say yes.

69
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,760
I'm a domineering CEO.

70
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,600
So domineering.

71
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
If you say no,

72
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,160
I'll make you pay.

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,200
I will.

74
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,120
From now on,

75
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,680
I won't run away anymore.

76
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,640
This is...

77
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,120
This time

78
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,880
I can finally marry the girl I love.

79
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,840
Yu Jianjian.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,360
I love you.

81
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,520
Congratulations, Yu Xian Xian.

82
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,320
You will return to the real world.

83
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,760
President's world is about to collapse. Please leave quickly.

84
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,520
The CEO's world is about to collapse.

85
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,960
Please leave quickly.

86
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Long Qing.

87
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,280
Listen to me.

88
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,440
I'm a virtual character.

89
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,760
I'm not afraid of disappearing.

90
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,760
is you.

91
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,080
made me who I am.

92
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,280
I've never lived freely like this.

93
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,200
Meeting you

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
to meet you.

95
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,760
I don't want you to leave me.

96
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Trust me.

97
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,840
No matter where you go,

98
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,080
we will meet again.

99
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,880
Yu Xian Xian.

100
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,760
I love you.

101
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,040
My dear.

102
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,680
Chief Editor.

103
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,920
You don't know?

104
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,840
The book you edited

105
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
is not only a hit on our website,

106
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,600
but also has been chosen by the film and television company

107
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,600
and bought the movie copyright.

108
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,360
Now,

109
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,720
become our star editor.

110
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,240
Don't just stand there.

111
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,720
The production company is waiting for you

112
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,040
are waiting for you in the meeting room.

113
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,480
They want to see you.

114
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,280
Okay.

115
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,680
Go ahead. I'll get back to work.

116
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Thank you, Chief Editor.

117
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,040
Yu Xian Xian.

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You are

119
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,040
the determination in my chaotic life.

120
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,120
Editor Yu.

121
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,320
I really like this line.
