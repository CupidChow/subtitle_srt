1
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,640
Hint.

2
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,040
As a non-player in the last round,

3
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,960
is about to disappear.

4
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,720
A non-player character.

5
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,000
He's not even an extra?

6
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,160
This is the result of your hard work.

7
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,400
Every time he succeeds,

8
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,760
he can weaken one of his main characters.

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,840
If he loses the main character,

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,640
and lost the chance to be the protagonist.

11
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,000
So,

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,520
He's so innocent.

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,360
Don't forget to use the tool card.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,920
It's very important to you.

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,680
This day is going to pass again.

16
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,039
You're going to disappear again.

17
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,680
It's okay.

18
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,640
Didn't I just say that

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
No matter how many times I start over,

20
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,039
I'll come back to you right away.

21
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,520
This is my destiny.

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,160
Ms. Yu Xian,

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,560
The total amount of

24
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,640
8.320,000 yuan.

25
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,240
What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,040
It's not like that.

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,040
Is it a mistake?

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,960
The bank sent me a message saying

29
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,840
that I owe 80,000 yuan.

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,280
I've never seen so much money in my life.

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,040
How could I spend so much?

32
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,600
Maybe

33
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,520
at the hotel today.

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,280
No.

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,079
The point is not whether it's expensive or not.

36
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,400
It's for today. It's for you.

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,079
It's on my phone.

38
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,440
Why is it on my phone? It's on my phone.

39
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,079
Because

40
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,120
I asked him to put it on your account.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,920
On my account?

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,200
You said

43
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,360
I don't need to worry about you.

44
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,400
Yes.

45
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,400
Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Okay.

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,520
Leave it to me.

47
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
I'll tell the waiter. Okay.

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,760
on your account.

49
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,840
So,

50
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,640
I really owe you 80,000 yuan.

51
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,600
8,000.

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,560
Over 80,000

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,720
I've never seen so much money in my life.

54
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,320
Money.

55
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,680
What should I do?

56
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,240
Sweetie.

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,120
Don't worry.

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,440
Are you invisible rich?

59
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,720
No, I'm not.

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,079
But it doesn't matter.

61
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,880
What matters is our love.

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,200
Oh, my.

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,320
If I'm guilty, I'll be punished. If I'm guilty, I'll be punished. I'll be punished. I'll be punished.

64
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,360
you can punish me

65
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,400
instead of losing money.

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,320
I won't accept a boyfriend who is in love anymore.

67
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,840
Huo Chenxi.

68
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,920
You're here. You're here.

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,440
[It's the first time you're here.] [The first time you're here,]

70
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,280
Summer solstice?

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,200
Did you see a boy?

72
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,160
What boy?

73
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,120
I've never seen him before. He's gone.

74
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,320
It's gone.

75
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,560
I've never seen a boy.

76
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,320
I've seen your bill

77
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,240
It's so long.

78
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
But don't panic.

79
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,519
The hotel has arranged a job for you to pay the money back.

80
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,160
What job?

81
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,200
Wash the bed sheets for the hotel.

82
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,400
Ten sheets per day.

83
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,440
Two yuan for each bed.

84
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,240
If you wash bed sheets for the hotel every day,

85
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,040
you don’t eat or sleep,

86
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,640
You have to pay off your debts.

87
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
[you'll be able to make a living.] [You'll be able to make a living.]

88
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,200
[It's been ten years.]

89
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,480
[It's like this.]

90
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,280
It's done. It's done.

91
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,760
I need to wash the sheets here.

92
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,640
I can't go back.

93
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,640
Bye-bye.

94
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,040
Here you go. Here you go.

95
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,320
Congratulations.

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,000
The final chapter is about to begin. The final chapter

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,120
Hotel chapter.

98
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,840
The male lead of this round

99
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,720
is the president of Nebrande Hotel.

100
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,640
Dragon Qing.

101
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,200
It's a new one. It's a new one.

102
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,920
But

103
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,720
This is not a complete novel.

104
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,040
There's even no plot.

105
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,160
It's my idea.

106
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,560
to deal with the leader.

107
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,520
This task

108
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,840
[Dragon and Su Bai Lian, stop them from getting married.] [Let's go.]

109
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,040
Su Bai Lian, you're here. You're here.

110
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,200
Ms. Qian's assistant?

111
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,520
I don't remember writing about her and Longqing.

112
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,720
Isn't she the character in the last round?

113
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,080
Why didn't she disappear?

114
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,800
Lotus Su.

115
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,320
[As a collection of hypocrites,]

116
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,720
with a new novel.

117
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,400
So in this novel,

118
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,840
in this new novel.

119
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,760
The next story

120
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,440
will be written by you.

121
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,840
Will we meet again?

122
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,880
[We must meet.]

123
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
No matter where it is,

124
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,440
I'll find it for you.

125
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,760
80,000 yuan.

126
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,200
Hello, ma'am.

127
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,520
Madam.

128
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,840
Mr. Yu has been assigned to wash the sheets in the laundry room.

129
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,680
Does she know she was wrong?

130
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,640
[She's not wrong.] [She's not wrong.]

131
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,840
She...

132
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,160
She...

133
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,280
She's here. She's here. She's here.

134
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,640
She's coming up.

135
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,360
She said

136
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
I'll teach you a lesson.

137
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,560
Calm down.

138
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,480
You used my card.

139
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,960
I owe 80,000 yuan.

140
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,520
Now you want me to wash the sheets and pay the debt?

141
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Are you mistaken?

142
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,000
Mr. Yu.

143
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,600
Mr. Long

144
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,120
would never use your card.

145
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,440
You must be mistaken.

146
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,480
You may leave now.

147
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,720
Okay. Okay.

148
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,800
Okay. Okay.

149
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,560
Okay. Okay.

150
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,000
I'll give you a chance

151
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,640
to forget the 80,000 debt.

152
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,160
Stay with me tonight.

153
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,800
I'll let go of the debt.

154
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,080
You lied to me and used my card.

155
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,120
It's getting interesting.

156
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,960
Woman.

157
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,680
Are you trying to deny it?

158
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,080
Wait.

159
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,840
Something's wrong.

160
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,720
Could Longqing's body

161
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,320
is no longer the previous soul?

162
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,040
but another one.

163
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,680
But they look

164
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,120
look the same.

165
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,800
What's going on?

166
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,800
You recognize me?

167
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
What do you think?

168
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Well...

169
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,240
Can we meet again? Yes.

170
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,760
We meet again.

171
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,000
Xian.

172
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,120
I miss you so much.

173
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,000
Who are you?

174
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,280
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,600
It's my fault to use your card.

176
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,560
I'll make up for it.

177
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,360
Did you...

178
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,880
Just kidding.

179
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,320
Stop joking.

180
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
Do you know how miserable this $80 is?

181
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,080
Okay.

182
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,200
I was wrong.

183
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,799
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,000
Mr. Long.

185
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,200
Well...

186
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,280
What is it?

187
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,960
Nothing.

188
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,640
Miss Su.

189
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,560
I'm sorry.

190
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,840
Mr. Long can't see you now.

191
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,080
Mr. Qian, if you have any instructions, you can tell him.

192
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,840
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

193
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
It's because

194
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,280
I have something personal

195
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,640
I want to talk to Mr. Long.

196
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,640
It's okay.

197
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,560
I can wait.

198
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,120
Okay. Okay.

199
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,040
Well,

200
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
I'll let you know when Mr Long is free. Okay.

201
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,280
Okay.

202
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,680
Xian.

203
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,600
I didn't expect

204
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,080
meet again so soon.

205
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,120
I'll protect you.

206
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,560
But...

207
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,000
this mission

208
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,200
is to stop the relationship between Long Qing and Su Bai Lian.

209
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
At present,

210
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,200
have no connection at all.

211
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,120
I don't know

212
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,680
I have no idea.

213
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,560
I have a bad feeling about this.

214
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,680
I know.

215
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,440
You have a lot of doubts.

216
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,600
But please believe me.

217
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,760
I've discovered

218
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,000
the secret of time travel.

219
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,920
Time travel?

220
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,520
I...

221
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,520
Actually,

222
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,000
doesn't belong to this world.
