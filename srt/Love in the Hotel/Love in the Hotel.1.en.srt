1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,280
On a mysterious island in the middle of the earth

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,400
the only eight-star hotel in the world.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,280
Nebrand Royal Hotel.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,400
No matter who you are,

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,120
If you want to book this hotel's presidential suite,

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,080
to book this hotel.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,960
except for a man.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,880
[He's a man.] [He's a man.]

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,160
It's the wind. It's the wind.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,920
seems to be a domineering wind.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,400
He has the holy light of money.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,400
He's full of extravagant charms.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,080
Everyone falls for him

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,480
This is

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,960
The ultimate boss of the universe!

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,720
Help!

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,840
It's here. It's here.

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,320
It's here.

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,360
It's here. It's here.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,160
324.

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,920
No. 324.

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,200
He's not dead yet.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,640
This is...

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,840


25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,759
Because you didn't show up

26
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,120
in three seconds,

27
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,560
and was fired by Mr. Long.

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,240
Thank you for

29
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,880
Please leave after handing over the personnel.

30
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,200
Neervand what?

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,320
Royeol. Royeol.

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,360
I'm in the office. I'm in the middle of the night. I'm in the middle of the night.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,480
Nebrande? Yes, I'm in the office. I'm in the middle of the night.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,479
The Royal Liquor! The Royal Liquor!

35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,760
I traveled to

36
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,160
in my own file.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,840
Excuse me.

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,520
Welcome to the Royal Hotel of Neervaland.

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,440
A hotel where all bosses come.

40
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,280
Here,

41
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,880
please start your adventure to destroy the boss.

42
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,200
Long Qing's office, the top floor of the destination.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,280
This elevator contains actual oxygen supply and stress reduction function.

44
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
Please call for help if you feel unwell.

45
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,640
This trip takes 20 minutes.

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,840
Have a good trip.

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,720
20 minutes.

48
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,360
Really?

49
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,000
There really are over 2,000 floors.

50
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,079
This is...

51
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,320
It's a paradise. It's a paradise.

52
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,080
Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my.

53
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,760
Long Qing.

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,880
How dare you!

55
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,680
How did you get up here?

56
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,440
This is Mr. Long's office.

57
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,320
I'm looking for President Long.

58
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,480
Boss.

59
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,240
I know I didn't do well before.

60
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,680
Please give me one more chance.

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,720
Manager 324.

62
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,840
Why do you deserve

63
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,480
give you another chance?

64
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,200
With my passion for work,

65
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,120
I'm not interested in the whole company. I'm sorry.

66
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,200
Wait.

67
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,720
He's a real boss.

68
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,480
the real boss.

69
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,080
You can't use this method to deal with a mortal leader.

70
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,160
No one knows the boss better than me.

71
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,640
That's how you deal with the boss.

72
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,240
First, I'm not the manager 324.

73
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,560
My name is Yu Xian.

74
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,640
Second,

75
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,120
Don't think you can do whatever you want with money.

76
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,720
Boss! Boss!

77
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,440
Calm down.

78
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,760
Give me another chance.

79
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,760
Maybe staying in this hotel

80
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,520
It's not bad.

81
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,360
This is...

82
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,240
What a gentleman!

83
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,400
Hey.

84
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,640
You didn't even say sorry, did you?

85
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,560
You have no manners.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,360
You can do whatever you want

87
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,880
you can do whatever you want.

88
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,520
Look at your handsome face.

89
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,680
Ah!

90
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,480
Stop!

91
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,880
Number 324.

92
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,680
Mr. Long has decided to give you a special chance.

93
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,159
to entertain Mr. Li.

94
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,360
you can stay in the hotel for No. 324.

95
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,040
Congratulations on completing the prologue.

96
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,840
The first adventure is about to be unlocked.

97
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,920
Come on.

98
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,400
[This is a novel.]

99
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,880
[Crush into the Heart: Charm President, Wrong Door]

100
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,600
This task

101
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,360
Stop the pursuers from approaching the male lead.

102
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Viscount Li.

103
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,920
Let Mr. Li check out.

104
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,840
Wait.

105
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,560
Mr. Yu.

106
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,080
Let me remind you.

107
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,400
Mr. Li likes quiet.

108
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,280
I’ve cleared all the people

109
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,240
on the floor.

110
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,080
I'm the only one here.

111
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,760
Okay. Okay.

112
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,520
We're counting on you. Okay. Okay.

113
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,120
Remember.

114
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't make a sound.

115
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,960
Thank you.

116
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,400
Perfect.

117
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,720
Mr. Li, I'm the manager of the lobby, Yu Xian Xian.

118
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,080
Let me show you the way.

119
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,320
Quiet! Quiet!

120
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,520
You're so loud. You're so loud. You're so loud.

121
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,120
You're so loud. You're so loud.

122
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,960
You're scaring me. You're scaring me. You're scaring me.

123
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,280
A woman?

124
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,520
Don't I have a name?

125
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,840
All online novels are the same.

126
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,160
Lead the way.

127
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,920
Let's go. Let's go.

128
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,880
Be careful. Be careful.

129
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,320
is like

130
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,440
The sound of the sound of the song

131
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,400
It's too noisy.

132
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,360
Anything else?

133
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,360
Hello, Mr. Li.

134
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,680
I'm sorry to disturb you.

135
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,240
Next, I will use my body language to introduce

136
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,640
the facilities of the presidential suite.

137
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,720
Okay, okay.

138
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,040
Let's go. Let's go.

139
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,160
Wait.

140
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,360
You're the woman in front of the hotel.

141
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,920
You fell on purpose.

142
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,200
Okay.

143
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,600
I give you the right to speak.

144
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,680
To be precise, you pushed me down on purpose.

145
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,200
I knew it.

146
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,600
I'm warning you.

147
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,680
Get on the bed! Get on the bed! Get on the bed!
