1
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,880
As the only eight-star hotel in the world,

2
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,360
the restaurant is not a Michelin 8-star hotel.

3
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,120
How can you call us the most luxurious hotel in the world?

4
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,680
I won't allow it.

5
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,640
my mistake

6
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,240
because of my mistake.

7
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,200
Wang, calm down.

8
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,440
Summer solstice.

9
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,360
It's okay.

10
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,479
Mr. Yu.

11
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,520
Please give us another chance

12
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,720
Mr. Leng, please give us another chance.

13
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,000
Let him try our specialty dish.

14
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,039
The future of our hotel

15
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,000
and the reputation of the chef.

16
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,560
I'm counting on you.

17
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,400
Let's go.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,479
It's okay.

19
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,360
Why would I be nervous?

20
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,200
So what if it's him or not?

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,880
He's just a character created by the writer.

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,480
System hint.

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,040
The mission of this Love Story

24
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,720
is to ensure the safety of Leng Ting Han's food.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,040
Food safety

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,600
Oh, right.

27
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,720
Leng Ting Han was drugged.

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,840
and fell into a beauty trap with the heroine, Bei Yunqiu.

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,800
What's the next story?

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,440
I don't like the idea of drugging.

31
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,840
I couldn't catch up.

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,200
Keep the star.

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,320
[Mission]

34
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,000
Mission?

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,040
What else?

36
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
Can you tell me what's bothering you?

37
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,320
Yu Xian Xian.

38
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,040
It's you.

39
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,320
It's you.

40
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
You still remember me.

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,920
That's great.

42
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
Where have you been?

43
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,200
I've been looking for you.

44
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,800
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,520
I was just worried about you.

46
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,079
I'm glad to see you again.

47
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,320
to see you again.

48
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,000
I didn't expect Mr. Yu to be so enthusiastic to customers.

49
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,600
I'm looking forward to

50
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,400
of your hotel service.

51
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,640
Why are you so polite?

52
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,120
Is it because

53
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,520
because of

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,079
I'm sorry, Mr. Yu.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,960
This is our first meeting.

56
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

57
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,720
It's our first meeting.

58
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,000
How did you know my name is Yu Xian?

59
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,120
So he has forgotten me.

60
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,400
He doesn't remember the past.

61
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,120
If there's nothing else,

62
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,440
I'm really sorry.

63
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,720
Have a rest.

64
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,400
What am I looking forward to?

65
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,920
How could you remember me?

66
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,040
Maybe it was just a system bug last time.

67
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,360
It won't appear again.

68
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,680
Leng Ting Han is just "doting on him overnight." who will never appear again.

69
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,680
I should focus on the mission.

70
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,640
But...

71
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,320
why do I feel so sad?

72
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,680
Mr. Yu, you're back. How is it?

73
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,080
Did Mr. Leng agree?

74
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,840
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,960
I forgot.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,800
Hello. Hello. Hello.

77
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,920
Mr Leng, could you please

78
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,440
try this dessert

79
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
before making a decision?

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,200
I'm sorry. I'll be right there.

81
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,040
I forgot something serious.

82
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,880
Bei.

83
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you for coming.

84
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,840
I believe after Leng Ting Han ate your dessert,

85
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,000
he will give me another chance.

86
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,480
Uncle Wang, you're too kind.

87
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,400
I added some strong news.

88
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,159
He will like it.

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,159
Okay.

90
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,480
Mr Leng.

91
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,960
Mr Leng.

92
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,400
Is the world of novels so insensitive?

93
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,600
Mr Leng.

94
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,480
I'm really sorry.

95
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,120
I made it hard for you

96
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
This is the dessert our chef prepared carefully.

97
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,720
I hope you can forgive our mistake

98
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,760
There's no need to apologize.

99
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,440
I just judge according to the rules.

100
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,720
I think

101
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,240
Mr. Yu is here

102
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,760
to let me give the restaurant another chance to judge the stars.

103
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,880
If possible, that's great.

104
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,640
Mr. Leng, you mean

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,440
give us another chance?

106
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,920
Since your chef

107
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,080
made such a delicate dessert,

108
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,480
Why don't I be the judge after eating it?

109
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,280
So easy to say.

110
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,480
Wait.

111
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,000
Something's wrong.

112
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,040
[The mission of Love]

113
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,920
is to ensure the safety of Leng Ting Han's food.

114
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,560
The food is safe.

115
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,000
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

116
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,120
That was close.

117
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,720
Almost failed.

118
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,320
I remember Leng Ting Han

119
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,920
had some desserts in this room.

120
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,680
in this room.

121
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,640
You can't eat this dessert.

122
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,240
Mr. Yu.

123
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,200
What do you mean?

124
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,840
Stop eating.

125
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,400
Why? It's not good.

126
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,159
It's not good. It's not good.

127
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,360
Yes, it's not good.

128
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Your hotel wants to get another chance to judge stars

129
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,240
but let the chef cook

130
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,240
It doesn't taste good Give it to me

131
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,160
It seems that

132
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
your hotel has a lot against me.

133
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,880
No, it’s because…

134
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,000
It's me.

135
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,680
I want to eat it too much.

136
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,000
In that case,

137
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,760
I might as well help you.

138
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,840
I can't be poisoned

139
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,200
for you.

140
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,280
Mr. Yu.

141
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,280
Please.

142
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,480
Mr. Leng.

143
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,920
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean it.

144
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,160
You didn't mean it.

145
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,120
Mr. Yu, you know what?

146
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,960
I hate people

147
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,160
is people who waste food.

148
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,120
If your hotel wants to get another chance to judge the stars,

149
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,920
Sure.

150
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
But Yu Xian,

151
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,360
you have to pay the price.

152
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,080
Come and eat with me tonight.

153
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,200
What are you doing?

154
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,960
Don't eat. Put it down.

155
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,760
Mr. Yu, you can take one if you want.

156
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,680
It's delicious.

157
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,040
Did you put any medicine? Yes.

158
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,400
Mr. Yu.

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,320
Let me introduce to you.

160
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,160
This is the new dessert chef

161
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,560
our new dessert chef.

162
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,760
Come on. Come on.
