1
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,200
[The person you have reached is not available.]

2
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,560
Please try again later.

3
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,200
Now let's move on to the next level.

4
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,440
Dressing up as a man.

5
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,440
Wait.

6
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,680
You haven't answered my question.

7
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,039
Where's Leng Ting Han?

8
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,560
As the main character of the last chapter,

9
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,000
he naturally disappeared.

10
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,960
Why?

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,120
every president

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,480
has the memory of the previous president.

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,840
If you don't give me a reasonable explanation,

14
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,920
I won't continue.

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,840
Excuse me.

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,880
It's a system bug.

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,000
Another loophole.

18
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,039
We're trying to fix it.

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,440
But here's a special reminder.

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,520
Don't get attached to your character.

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,400
I...

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,720
Congratulations.

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,240
The game has come to the fourth stage.

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,039
[I'm one step closer to passing the test.]

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,080
This is a novel.

26
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,479
The story of "Entangled Love, Mr. Cheon Don't get addicted."

27
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,320
This task

28
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,759
to stop the male lead Jiang Yunting.

29
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,680
and the heroine.

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,080
the female lead.

31
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,320
This is the female boss.

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,200
So does he

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,920
the former president?

34
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,120
and memory?

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,960
[It's time to go back to your room.] Okay.

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Good luck.

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,560
It's not you.

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,600
Why do you keep delaying me?

39
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,680
Anyway,

40
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,520
We'll meet again.

41
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,280
I guess.

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,480
The main character of this book is Chimcheol. It's a book. It's a book. It's a book. It's a book.

43
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,560
It's actually Chiyomi.

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,480
My real name is Chiyoo.

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,520
She has been pretending to be a man and being the president.

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,000
Because Jiang Yunting

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,480
broke himself and changed his clothes,

48
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,240
Then they fell in love.

49
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,880
If he dresses like a man,

50
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,040
he would be...

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,400
a man in women's clothes?

52
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,880
Sorry.

53
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,720
I bumped into you.

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,720
Are you okay?

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,640
You are

56
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,440
You are

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
I am you

58
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,079
[My love for you]

59
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,880
A boy.

60
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,880
He doesn't look like him at all.

61
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,440
And your behavior...

62
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,880
I know I'm handsome.

63
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,720
You love me too.

64
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,040
But don't worry.

65
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,400
The 100th girl I met

66
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,320
is mine.

67
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,680
100% girl

68
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,640
Love you

69
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,720
I'm 100% a girl.

70
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,440
Are you serious? I'm not.

71
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,720
Who is she? Who is she?

72
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,960
Who is she?

73
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,000
You slut!

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,840
Stop!

75
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,760
We're done.

76
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,560
We were fine yesterday.

77
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,240
Why did you break up today?

78
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,680
Because I've met

79
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,040
my 100% girl.

80
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,400
Where did the flowers come from?

81
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Baby.

82
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,560
This is for you.

83
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,120
I gave you.

84
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,600
For the rest of my life,

85
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,680
I'll give you

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,840
roses every day.

87
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,080
You saw it.

88
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,000
This is the woman I love the most.

89
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,320
Be sensible.

90
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,320
Let's go.

91
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,279
Scum.

92
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,800
You've changed. You've changed.

93
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,080
You've changed. You've changed.

94
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,520
I've changed.

95
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,960
I love you more.

96
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,040
Baby

97
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,920
Help!

98
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,840
What happened to him?

99
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,600
And it's her.

100
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,159
The one beside the character "woman".

101
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,640
The touch just now

102
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,720
It can't be wrong.

103
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,640
It's a girl! It's a girl!

104
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:49,920
And...

105
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,800
you can tell as long as you're not blind.

106
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,800
Do you remember what happened between us?

107
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,120
Don't tell me

108
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,880
like last time?

109
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,800
Lose your memory.

110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,400
Of course I remember you.

111
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,720
Memory loss

112
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,200
would never happen to me.

113
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,280
That's great.

114
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,720
I'm glad you remember.

115
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,520
I remember our past life.

116
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,160
Previous life?

117
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,200
Previous life

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,920
<i>Reincarnation</i>

119
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,840
Travel through time

120
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,000
Thousands of years of waiting

121
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,400
All I want is you

122
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,120
The brilliance of the world

123
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,120
Love you

124
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,520
Thousands of times.

125
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,800
Wait. Wait.

126
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,160
Thousands of times.

127
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,400
That's too much.

128
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,240
It's weird.

129
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,640
Why am I not happy at all?

130
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,600
I thought about him every day.

131
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,600
Now that I see him,

132
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,000
I feel nothing.

133
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,800
Is his love words too old-fashioned

134
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,680
or because

135
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,880
He's a girl. He's a girl.

136
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,720
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

137
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,280
There's something on your hair.

138
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,040
It's on your hair. It's on your hair.

139
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,200
When?

140
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,480
It's a leaf.

141
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,440
You're so good at it.

142
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,200
Maybe girls are better.

143
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
Get used to it.

144
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,680
My heart is beating.

145
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,680
It's going to beat again.

146
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,000
I have a bigger surprise for you.

147
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,680
for you.

148
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,720
Can I open it now?

149
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,720
No.

150
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,520
It's okay

151
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,280
Why is the upper half a man

152
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,720
The lower half is a woman

153
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,880
That's weird.

154
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,440
It's so pretty.

155
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,400
The moment I met you,

156
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,520
I knew

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,680
It's this dress.

158
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,760
the best owner.

159
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,680
This is the dress for the press conference tonight.

160
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,640
Would you like to try it?

161
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,240
You are

162
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,960
You want me to be the model? Yes.

163
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:34,920
Model.

164
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,440
This dress

165
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,520
It suits a girl better.

166
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,280
Mr. Cheon.

167
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
I don't remember there's a supporting character in this book.

168
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,120
Why does she have subtitles?

169
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
Is it a bug too? It's a bug.

170
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,160
Bring Miss Yu

171
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,520
to try on the clothes.

172
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,920
Miss Yu.

173
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,120
Please come in.

174
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,120
Wait.

175
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,480
Let me change your upper body size.

176
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,120
Okay.

177
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,280
I knew it.

178
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,680
You're the prettiest when you focus on work.

179
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,680
Love you

180
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,200
But

181
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,800
Something is missing.

182
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,960
Why don't I feel anything?

183
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,720
I know.

184
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,720
You've become a girl all of a sudden.

185
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,560
to suddenly become a woman.

186
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,080
But don't worry.

187
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,000
No matter what you become,

188
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,600
I can accept it.

189
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,560
Woman.

190
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,120
I'm a real man.

191
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,840
This is...

192
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,600
Three lives. Three lives.

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,360
A 100% girl.

194
