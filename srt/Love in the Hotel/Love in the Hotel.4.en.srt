1
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,480
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,440
Leave the rest to me.

3
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,720
Let's take a break.

4
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,320
According to the original plot,

5
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,599
Tonight, the heroine Chu Xiaowei

6
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,920
[Misfortune begins.]

7
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,600
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm really sorry.

9
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,479
A woman?

10
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,280
How are you going to compensate me?

11
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,759
You'll be in charge of the wine tasting tomorrow.

12
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,840
No, I don't want to.

13
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,080
You dare to reject me?

14
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,600
Let go of me!

15
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,640
I'll make you

16
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,400
You can't escape from me

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,480
Although

18
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,640
are full of joy and joy.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,160
But isn't this robbery?

20
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,600
Mr. Yu.

21
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,640
This is the list of waiters for this cocktail party.

22
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,400
Take a look. What else do you need to adjust?

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,480
The cocktail party hasn't started yet.

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,520
Then I can stop them from meeting tonight.

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,920
This guy...

26
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,800
It's open.

27
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,240
This kind of legal news joke

28
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,280
has been edited

29
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,640
Disappear.

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Mr. Lu, I...

31
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,960
Mr. Lu, I'm the lobby manager, Yu Xian Xian.

32
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,840
For the sake of your wine tasting,

33
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,120
I will be your personal housekeeper.

34
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,640
What did you just say?

35
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,400
I said

36
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm your supervisor.

37
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,400
The last line.

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm Yu Yinxian, the manager of the hotel lobby.

39
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,960
I seem to have heard it somewhere.

40
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,960
My name is too common.

41
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,079
Many people have the same name.

42
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,960
You must be mistaken.

43
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,800
You are doubting my judgment.

44
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,600
No.

45
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
Let's go. Let's go.

46
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,880
Let's go.

47
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
Okay. Let's go.

48
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,240
I feel like I've seen her somewhere.

49
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,720
Why do I feel so irritated?

50
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,240
Looks like this mission can be completed easily.

51
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Chu Xiaowei.

52
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
Lu Haotian.

53
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,840
Mr. Yu, I'm sorry.

54
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,320
It's okay.

55
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
I'm glad you're fine.

56
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,080
We finally made it.

57
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,760
Now Lu Haotian has no excuse

58
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,400
to let Chu Xiaowei stay with him.

59
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,520
Wait.

60
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,440
No.

61
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,040
It's all on you.

62
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,640
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

63
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,640
Again?

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,840
How about this?

65
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,640
You will be in charge of

66
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,120
will be in charge of tomorrow's tasting party.

67
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
Mr. Lu.

68
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,520
It's not a good idea.

69
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,160
Let's go. Let's go.

70
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,560
That's weird.

71
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,160
Why did I invite this girl?

72
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,880
No, you should say goodbye now.

73
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,960
Why did you meet?

74
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,440
The mission is going to fail.

75
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,400
No, I have to cheat.

76
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,680
What did you say?

77
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,680
You dare to threaten me? I promise. I won't.

78
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,200
I promise.

79
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,360
I won't tell anyone

80
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
about your alcohol allergy.

81
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,280
As long as you don't

82
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,200
You know me so well.

83
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,360
You should know what will happen

84
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,120
if you provoke me.

85
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,760
No matter what happens to you,

86
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,960
Anyway, stay away from her.

87
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,320
Okay.

88
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,080
Give me a reason.

89
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,120
Because...

90
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,240
I like you. I like you.

91
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,960
What did you say? I like you.

92
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,680
You can't be controlled

93
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,240
like last time.

94
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,920
Overbearing against the sick

95
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,760
Today, I'll let you experience

96
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,600
what forced love is.

97
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
A man.

98
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,400
You got my attention.

99
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,880
When you moved into the hotel,

100
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I fell in love with you.

101
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,600
When I saw you flirting with another woman,

102
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,320
I'm so jealous.

103
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,400
Jealous

104
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,000
You make me look totally different.

105
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,800
Don't talk to other women.

106
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,320
Otherwise,

107
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,720
I'll expose you.

108
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,000
the biggest chateau heir in the world.

109
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,200
Lu Haotian.

110
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,960
I'm allergic to alcohol.

111
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,360
Be gentle.

112
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,200
Yu Xian Xian,

113
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,760
no one will believe your rumors.

114
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,200
I will make you pay

115
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,920
for what you did.

116
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,280
You scared me.

117
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,560
It feels so familiar.

118
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,920
It seems that Lord Li said the same thing.

119
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,200
It's not Li Ye. It's Li Ye Ye Ye. It's Li Ye Ye Ye Ye. It's Li Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye. It's Li Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye.
