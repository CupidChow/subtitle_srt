1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,880
Is he my past life?

2
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,440
Mr. Lu.

3
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,280
Chu Xiaowei is missing.

4
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,400
She won't come.

5
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,280
I didn't invite her.

6
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,400
The person I want to invite

7
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,560
is you.

8
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,039
I...

9
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,400
Yu Xian Xian.

10
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,600
I told you

11
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,320
I'll make you pay.

12
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,880
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,360
I threatened you before.

14
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,720
I was wrong.

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,560
I'll try my best to make it up to you.

16
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,039
Then let my admirer employ my company.

17
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,640
How should I

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,600
What should we do?

19
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,120
You're Viscount Li?

20
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,479
I felt familiar when I first met you.

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,520
That kiss

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,680
It reminds me of

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,560
the past.

24
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,200
It's time to let it go.

25
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,600
I used to think

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,440
there is a certain track in my life.

27
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,960
Just follow the rules

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,079
and move forward.

29
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,760
It's not like that. It's not like that.

30
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,960
My life

31
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,480
has become a mess.

32
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,640
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,560
I'm confused too.

34
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,560
Why didn't I get it?

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,160
You said yesterday

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,840
people like domineering love

37
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,560
because they like firm feelings.

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,320
So the price

39
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
the price you have to pay

40
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,640
to become the determination in my confusing life.

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,440
Yu Xian Xian.

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,760
I like you.

43
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
What?

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,000
Whether I'm Lord Li,

45
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,400
or Lu Haotian,

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,600
Woman.

47
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,280
I have feelings for you.

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,440
I know

49
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,640
very well.

50
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,960
You do.

51
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,760
You're right. You're right.

52
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,079
Congratulations on your mission.

53
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,120
["Love Marriage, Overbearing Husband"]

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,960
into "Legend of the Hotel".

55
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,000
Mission completed.

56
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,320
Please accept the reward.

57
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,040
Lu Haotian.

58
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,360
Lu Haotian.

59
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,040
Lu Haotian is the protagonist of the last round.

60
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,400
You've passed the test, so he naturally disappeared.

61
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,160
Disappeared?

62
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,040
Why does Lu Haotian have Viscount Li's memory?

63
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,920
Aren't they the main characters of the two books?

64
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,959
Maybe it's all a coincidence.

65
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,800
Or maybe it's the fate of my previous life.

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,440
Marriage, my foot.

67
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,880
Maybe after the third chapter of love, will be revealed.

68
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,880
Can I

69
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,960
see him again?

70
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,320
Maybe not.

71
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,960
Hey, don't go.

72
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,840
Is there a bug in your system?

73
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,280
The characters look the same.

74
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,360
and their thoughts are on the same page.

75
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,480
What a stupid game!

76
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,240
Very clear.

77
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,560
Not at all.

78
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,160
I have feelings for you.

79
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,160
I know that very well.

80
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,320
why I was brainwashed by that.

81
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,640
I can't think about it.

82
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,040
We may never see each other again.

83
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,520
I heard another important president

84
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
to check in today.

85
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,880
I heard that the president is very low-key.

86
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,640
Maybe

87
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,840
he just checked in.

88
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,520
We didn't notice it.

89
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,960
An important president.

90
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,880
Congratulations on your third round of love.

91
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
This is a novel.

92
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,880
[One Night Love: President's husband, please control yourself.]

93
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,000
Is it him?

94
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,000
Hello.

95
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,800
Welcome.

96
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,960
How can I help you?

97
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,600
I want to reserve a presidential suite for my boss tonight.

98
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,880
Okay, just a moment.

99
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,520
It's full.

100
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,600
He's here. He's here. He's here. He's here. He's here.

101
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,000
Hello. Hello.

102
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Excuse me, ma'am.

103
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,960
Our presidential suite is fully booked today.

104
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,920
No reservation.

105
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,120
That is to say,

106
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,840
someone lives here today.

107
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,840
Yes.

108
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,680
We have other premium rooms.

109
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,720
Do you need to know?

110
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,840
No, thanks.

111
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,040
By the way,

112
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,760
Is your restaurant still 8-star?

113
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Of course.

114
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,880
We are 8-star Hotel.

115
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,600
Restaurant. It must be Michelin.

116
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,080
Hello.

117
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,160
What is it?

118
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
Chef!

119
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,400
Are you okay?

120
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,159
He said it was delicious.

121
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,000
He said it was delicious.

122
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,960
Mr. Leng.

123
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,080
Today,

124
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,640
this vegetarian steak

125
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,800
Do you like it?

126
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,080
Good.

127
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,920
I enjoyed it.

128
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,960
Thank you.

129
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,200
Thank you, Mr. Leng.

130
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,200
It's Leng Ting Han.

131
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,960
Will the new president be him?

132
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,600
I wonder if he still remembers me.

133
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,360
What's the use of saying that?

134
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,560
Just now,

135
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,680
someone took off the eight stars of our restaurant.

136
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,680
Am I right, Mr. Yu?

137
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,280
Mr. Yu.

138
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,160
What does he look like?

139
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,680
[He really deceived me.]

140
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,040
Don't cry. What does he look like, Chef?

141
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,440
Shame on you

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,360
As the only eight-star hotel in the world,

143
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,840
the restaurant is not a Michelin 8-star hotel.

144
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,600
We're the most luxurious hotel in the world.

145
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,160
I can't allow

146
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,120
Because of my mistake,

147
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,720
because of my mistake.
