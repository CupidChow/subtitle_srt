1
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,120
You scared me

2
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,400
That felt so familiar.

3
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,760
It seems that Lord Li said the same thing.

4
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,040
Is it really not Viscount Li?

5
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,000
Welcome to

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,800
of Lu's Group.

7
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,000
The wine in front of you

8
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,720
is the new wine we launched this year.

9
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,440
Please have a taste.

10
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,520
It tastes bad

11
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,200
The taste is rich and fragrant.

12
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,000
You're jealous of Mr. Lu's chateau.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,400
is more popular.

14
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,759
It's malicious slander

15
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,080
We'll know if the wine tastes good.

16
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,160
And Mr. Lu

17
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,920
has never seen him drink.

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,720
Why is that?

19
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,759
That's because

20
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,600
I've never seen Mr. Lu drink wine before.

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,040
Yes.

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,920
That's strange.

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,360
But his family does alcohol.

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,000
That's because he's allergic to alcohol.

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,000
I didn't say it.

26
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
Who bought his wine?

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,800
Mr. Lu,

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,360
You haven't drunk your own wine, have you?

29
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,560
Mr. Lu,

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,720
Why don't you drink this?

31
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,280
and tell everyone

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,480
if your wine is good or not.

33
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,520
Mr. Lu can't drink, can he?

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,079
This is big news.

35
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,720
The Young Master of the biggest chateau in the world

36
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,320
is allergic to alcohol.

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,560
It'll be on the headlines tomorrow.

38
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,200
It tastes hot and mellow.

39
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,800
Good wine.

40
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,000
It's none of your business.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Why not?

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,240
I'm Mr. Lu's personal butler in the hotel.

43
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,840
In the Lu family,

44
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,200
Only the best wine

45
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,480
can match Mr. Lu's taste.

46
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,440
I'm not talking about your wine.

47
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
But these wine

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,160
are not good enough for Mr. Lu.

49
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,320
Yu Xian Xian.

50
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,680
What are you doing?

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm helping you.

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,160
I don't need your help.

53
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,240
All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

54
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,640
Since Mr. Lu doesn't like it,

55
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,520
please ask his butler to taste it for us.

56
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,880
Such good wine.

57
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,320
Don't waste it.

58
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,240
Please.

59
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,240
I'll try it on behalf of everyone.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,880
You're dead.

61
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,800
Be careful.

62
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,320
Mind your own business.

63
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,040
Mr. Lu.

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,760
None of your business.

65
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,240
Hang in there.

66
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,960
Mr. Lu.

67
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,160
Lu Haotian.

68
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,520
Mr. Lu, are you okay?

69
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,520
Lu Haotian, wake up.

70
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,120
Mr. Lu.

71
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,480
Mr. Lu, wait for me.

72
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,520
I'll call the medical staff.

73
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,880
OK.

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,600
Mr. Lu.

75
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,560
Mr. Lu.

76
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,520
What should we do?

77
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,720
What should I do?

78
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
A sweet plot.

79
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,200
Artificial respiration.

80
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,720
It can cure all diseases.

81
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,040
Try it.

82
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,520
Hey.

83
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,960
I'm fine.

84
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,640
It works!

85
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,000
You saved me.

86
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,120
It's not me. It's the medical staff. They just left.

87
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,520
Really?

88
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,880
Mr. Lu,

89
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,520
You are allergic to alcohol.

90
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,520
You shouldn't have drunk that much.

91
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Actually, you didn't have to help me just now.

92
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,280
I think I...

93
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,880
I'm allergic to alcohol.

94
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,760
How did you know?

95
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,680
It's a company secret.

96
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,920
Because I...

97
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,200
I like you.

98
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,240
I like someone. I want to know everything about him.

99
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,880
So...

100
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,920
you really like me.

101
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
because you really like me.

102
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,720
the girls around me.

103
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,120
Always.

104
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
Mr. Lu.

105
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,960
Sorry.

106
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,600
I really don't know.

107
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,440
How did he know you were allergic to alcohol?

108
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,320
It really wasn't me.

109
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,120
I know it wasn't you.

110
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,120
Trust me.

111
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,040
If you want to threaten me with this,

112
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,080
you won't tell anyone so soon.

113
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,960
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,120
I shouldn't have used you for that.

115
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,520
Even in the name of liking you,

116
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,800
I shouldn't threaten you with your weakness.

117
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,120
That's too selfish.

118
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,800
When you like someone,

119
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,680
we should respect each other.

120
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,960
and be honest with each other.

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,760
Maybe

122
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,600
the love of the boss

123
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,040
like

124
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,920
that never changes.

125
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,120
Strong feelings

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,800
You can

127
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,240
about other girls?

128
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,400
I'm interested in other girls?

129
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,920
I don't have the right.

130
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Aren’t you jealous?

131
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,520
You will serve

132
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,880
tomorrow.

133
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,200
After all,

134
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,600
you are my personal butler in this hotel.

135
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,920
Any questions?

136
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,040
No.

137
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,040
[my past life?] [My past life is...]

138
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,600
[He's gone.] [He's gone.]

139
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,400
Chu Xiaowei is missing.

140
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,520
She...

141
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,800
She's here. She's here. She's here.
