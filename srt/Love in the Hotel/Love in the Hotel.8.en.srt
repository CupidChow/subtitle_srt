1
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,720
What are you doing?

2
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,480
Don't eat. Put it down.

3
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,280
Mr. Yu, you can take one if you want.

4
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,200
It's delicious.

5
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,560
Did you put any medicine? Yes.

6
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:04,920
Mr. Yu.

7
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,840
Let me introduce to you.

8
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,680
This is the new dessert chef

9
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,080
our new dessert chef.

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,280
Bei Yunqiu.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,520
Hello. Hello.

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,880
I knew it.

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,760
You're Bei Yunqiu? Yes, I am.

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,480
Yes.

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,280
That was a bluff. It's a bluff. It's a bluff. It's a bluff.

16
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:21,880
No

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,440
Don't let her stay in the kitchen. Let's go.

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,600
Mr. Yu.

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,840
Mr. Leng, what do you think?

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,640
It feels like

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,320
Our dessert

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,000
is very delicious.

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,680
He decided to give us another chance.

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
Come on, everyone.

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,840
Mr. Yu.

26
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,240
Don't worry. This time,

27
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,840
we will do our best.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,520
I'm not worried about the taste.

29
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,160
The safety of the food is the most important.

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,000
Bei, come with me.

31
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,039
Okay.

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,039
But Yu Xian,

33
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,240
you have to pay the price.

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,160
Come and have dinner with me tonight.

35
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,280
Mr. Yu.

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,160
Mr. Yu.

37
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,480
We don't have much time.

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,920
I'll make it short.

39
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,800
Ms. Bei Yunqiu,

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,200
According to our backtone,

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,760
you must be the dessert heir of the Bei family.

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,320
How did you know?

43
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,680
I changed your image by working overtime.

45
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,880
I kind of remember you.

46
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,280
A big company like us

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,720
is stricter.

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,840
Mr. Leng is very satisfied with your dessert.

49
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,440
A gourmet like him

50
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,280
is sensitive to good chefs.

51
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,840
So we consider

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,960
you're a member of the Peking family.

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,440
It's a dish. It's a dish. It's a dish. It's a dish. It's a dish.

54
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,760
You're the best. You're the best. You're the best.

55
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
He's not good enough. He's good.

56
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,880
He just wants to

57
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,440
to destroy all the stores

58
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,400
which didn't want to be bought by him.

59
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,000
Then your family went bankrupt because

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,760
That's right.

61
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,560
Grandfather didn't want to sell the store.

62
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,200
Leng Ting Han has been giving us a hard time.

63
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,600
He didn't even let anyone sell our raw materials.

64
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,320
Leng Ting Han is a bad guy.

65
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,840
He looks modest on the surface.

66
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,680
but he's playing tricks behind his back.

67
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,680
So,

68
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,120
you want revenge?

69
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,280
Business is like a battlefield.

70
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,240
My family lost.

71
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,160
I admit it.

72
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,160
But I just

73
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,800
continue to make my dessert.

74
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,079
Mr. Yu.

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,040
It's getting cold.

76
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,280
I'll make you a cup of coffee.

77
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,600
Okay.

78
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,280
Mr. Yu.

79
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,640
Mr. Yu.

80
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,560
Mr. Yu, what are you doing?

81
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,400
Mr. Yu, let me out.

82
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,560
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,840
You'll have to stay here tonight.

84
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,880
Unfortunately, I know your plan.

85
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
I'll let you out

86
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,040
I'll let you out.

87
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,000
Mr. Yu.

88
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,840
Tonight,

89
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,920
go to Leng Ting Han's room tonight.

90
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,320
Mr. Yu, did you hear that?

91
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,920
Don't go.

92
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,000
Mr. Leng! Mr. Leng!

93
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,480
Mr. Leng! Mr. Leng!

94
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,400
[Mr Leng, the door is locked.] It's locked. It's locked.

95
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,880
Mr Leng.

96
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,000
Mr Leng.

97
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,640
Mr Leng.

98
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,520
Mr Leng.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,120
Mr Leng.

100
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,840
Are you okay?

101
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,000
How do you explain that?

102
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,480
You planned all this.

103
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,040
No, no, no.

104
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,560
It's not me.

105
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,640
Are you okay?

106
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,800
Chef said he's not coming.

107
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,640
you wouldn't come.

108
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,800
Why?

109
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,960
They're together.

110
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,720
Mr. Leng, it really wasn't me.

111
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,240
Why can't I open it now?

112
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,120
Mr. Leng.

113
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,360
Are you okay?

114
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,080
I told you to leave.

115
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,640
I...

116
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,120
The door is locked.

117
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,440
Mr. Leng.

118
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,720
Yu Xian Xian.

119
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,159
How do you feel about me?

120
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,960
Mr. Leng, listen to me.

121
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,480
Don't worry. This drug

122
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,280
It's like a psychiatric.

123
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,840
It makes people excited.

124
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,760
It won't make it emotional.

125
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,160
As long as we go to science,

126
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,160
the environment is not very scientific.

127
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,360
What are you doing?

128
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,400
Wake yourself up.

129
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,520
Instead of suppressing your desire,

130
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:50,960
why don't

131
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
release it.
