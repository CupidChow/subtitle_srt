OGAWA LAUNDRY

2
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:50,860
JANUARY 2025

3
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:38,992
May I help you?

4
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,577
Oh, the noise…

5
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,246
- Noise?
- The sound leakage from your earphone.

6
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,040
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

7
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,254
You like Michelle?

8
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,382
- Yes.
- I like them too.

9
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,384
- Oh really?
- Yes.

10
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,512
I also own the poetry collection by Chiba.
Maybe it's not poetry…

11
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,306
A book with song lyrics in it.

12
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,933
There's such a thing, huh?

13
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,103
- You must be a diehard fan.
- Yes.

14
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,831
- Yes?
- Sorry to keep on bothering you.

15
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,875
- Is it still leaking sound?
- No, that's not it.

16
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,544
I noticed something
after your music stopped leaking.

17
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,462
Yes?

18
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,215
Laundromats have big background noise,

19
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,800
so if you turn down the volume,
other sounds get mixed in.

20
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,595
Like the sounds of the dryers
and washing machines.

21
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,098
So although

22
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,809
I told you there was sound leakage
from your earphones,

23
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,646
I realized it's only natural
that there would be.

24
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,734
I'm sorry.

25
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,325
- Um…
- Yes?

26
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,037
Please tell me if I'm wrong,

27
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,289
but I think I'm reading this correctly.

28
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,669
Would it be all right if I played it
without using earphones?

29
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,799
- Please do.
- I'm glad. I guessed right.

30
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,929
Oh, sorry, I wasn't hinting
for you to do that though.

31
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,183
What? Oh, so I guess I didn't
read the situation correctly after all.

32
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:33,022
I wanted to say that it's okay
to return the volume to a level

33
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,984
- where sound leaks out.
- Oh, I get it now.

34
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,029
Which do you prefer? Audio leakage
or having it at full blast?

35
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,742
Full blast? It's going to be full blast
if you play it on the speaker?

36
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,582
You're kind of extreme, and funny,
you know that?

37
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,294
If I'm going to play it,
I might as well make it full blast.

38
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,047
Yes, since the background noise is big.

39
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,719
But hold on, it's midnight already.

40
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,054
Actually, something's been
bothering me for a while now.

41
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,682
Volume is measured as "high" and "low."

42
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,394
It's not measured as "big" and "small,"
but "high" and "low."

43
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,023
You're right. I've been saying
big and small.

44
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,941
It's high and low, huh?

45
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,277
Do you work in the music industry
or something?

46
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,612
No, I don't. I'm a hairstylist.

47
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,614
- A hairstylist?
- Yes.

48
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,701
And the washing machine
at the shop broke down.

49
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,121
So I came here to wash
the mountain of towels.

50
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,206
I see.

51
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,501
Then are you going back to the shop
to hang them to dry?

52
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,627
Yes.

53
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,339
But I'm using the dryer, so I'll only
hang them to smooth out the wrinkles.

54
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,967
- That's a lot of work with so many towels.
- Yes.

55
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,428
But I'm used to it now.

56
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,805
I see.

57
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,391
It's a daily routine, huh?

58
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,603
Yeah, I guess it's a daily routine.

59
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,414
I'm going to play it now.

60
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,197
But why?

61
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,199
Why?

62
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,370
I guess I'm kind of curious.

63
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,714
- Here.
- Thanks.

64
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,287
It's right here.

65
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:31,010
- Come inside.
- Thanks.

66
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,604
- Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

67
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,462
Can I get you a drink?

68
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,798
Please don't worry about me.

69
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,509
- I have alcohol too.
- Really?

70
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,386
Why are you surprised?

71
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,640
- Do you enjoy drinking?
- Yes.

72
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,476
- Would beer be all right?
- I'd love that.

73
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,770
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

74
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,229
Is this entertaining to watch?

75
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,523
It's entertaining

76
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,151
because it's a view I don't usually
get to see.

77
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,695
A view, huh?

78
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,198
This is so ordinary to me

79
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,409
that I've never considered it a "view."

80
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,538
I see.

81
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,375
To some people, this is a "view," huh?

82
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:31,964
You know,

83
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:36,719
humans can only live for 100 years
at most.

84
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,432
That means

85
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,310
there are far more sceneries
we'll never see

86
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,104
and people we'll never meet, right?

87
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,315
And then we die.

88
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,193
Right.

89
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,905
But the truth is,

90
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,033
you don't need to travel anywhere special

91
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,244
to experience things out of the ordinary
right under our noses.

92
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,248
It's just a matter of whether
you notice them or not.

93
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,423
That's why I feel like I'm having
a really special moment right now.

94
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,428
Um…

95
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,098
‪Yeah?

96
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,474
Well…

97
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,851
Isn't it tiring?

98
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,606
Do you live your life constantly
thinking about things like that?

99
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,692
I'm not thinking about those things
all the time,

100
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,613
but maybe I tend to think about them
more than most people.

101
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,290
Do you always use the laundromat?

102
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,336
No washing machine at home?

103
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,880
I have one at home.

104
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,465
- Of course you do.
- Yes.

105
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,633
That was a dumb question.

106
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,720
Did the washing machine break
or something?

107
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,308
No. I just feel like
going there sometimes.

108
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,896
It's kind of like going

109
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,649
to a public bathhouse
even though you have a bathtub at home.

110
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,069
I just like that atmosphere.

111
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,988
‪I see.

112
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,951
It feels lonely…

113
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,623
And you won't find normal people there.

114
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,792
What do you mean?

115
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,419
Because most people have

116
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,171
washing machines at home, right?

117
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,422
Yeah, I guess.

118
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:40,176
So the laundromat is a place
most people don't find necessary.

119
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,181
I like places like that.

120
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:47,808
‪I see.

121
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,687
Do you have something similar to that?

122
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,026
I don't think I do.

123
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,944
You don't, huh?

124
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,659
That makes sense. You were there
because your washing machine broke.

125
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,876
By the way, what's your name?

126
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,628
I'm Yukio.

127
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,713
Yukio Saeki.

128
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,676
Mr. Saeki, you're one of those
who doesn't need a laundromat.

129
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,721
Well, yes, I suppose so.

130
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,141
But I needed it today.

131
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,487
Oh, do you need help?

132
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,032
I'm almost finished.

133
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,187
Would you like a drink?

134
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,273
May I?

135
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,571
- Here.
- Thank you.

136
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,572
Please sit.

137
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,408
Am I stalking you too much?

138
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,327
Yes, you're definitely
stalking me too much.

139
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,121
Then you're too much of an enabler.

140
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,790
So this is my fault?

141
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,668
There's a possibility I might kill you,
you know.

142
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,921
Whoa, you're scaring me.
Can you leave now?

143
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,930
You can dry your clothes on the balcony.

144
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,436
Although you might not want to
hang your underwear.

145
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,314
But your clothes might get wrinkled.

146
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,984
Thank you.

147
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,500
Does this mean

148
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,794
you're staying the night?

149
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,922
No, I'm going home.

150
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,340
Then why are you drying your clothes?

151
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,675
I'll be coming tomorrow to pick them up.

152
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,093
You're coming again tomorrow?

153
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:33,140
- You look annoyed.
- More than annoyed, I'm scared.

154
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,601
Scared? Why?

155
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,646
You've gotten so close to me
in such a short time.

156
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:41,815
Hey, do you like me?

157
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,527
Do you already have feelings for me?

158
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,739
- Why would I?
- I'm sorry.

159
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:54,328
I'm really sorry. I've honestly never
experienced something like this before.

160
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,081
That's understandable.

161
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,499
I never have either.

162
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,338
You can place it on the table.

163
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,007
Thank you.

164
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,143
Then can I ask you something?

165
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:19,895
Ask what?

166
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,315
May I ask you a few questions?

167
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,151
Because I don't know anything about you.

168
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,863
What will you do
with the information about me?

169
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,617
Once I find out more about you? I won't do
anything in particular with it…

170
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:37,413
But I guess it'll give me
some reassurance.

171
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,957
What will you do
once you've been reassured?

172
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,626
What will I do once I've been reassured?

173
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,880
I'll think about that
once I've been reassured.

174
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,552
What kind of questions
will give you reassurance?

175
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,637
Like, "Do you have a boyfriend?"

176
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,347
Well, I guess so.

177
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,517
But first of all, your name…

178
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,061
That's right. I don't even know your name.

179
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,858
If you find out that I don't have
a boyfriend, and what my name is,

180
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,651
you'll be reassured?

181
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,070
Yes, more so than now.

182
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,952
Then what are you going to do?
Once you're reassured, you want to kiss?

183
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:21,331
I don't know. But I don't think so.

184
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,334
Why? Because you don't know
anything about me?

185
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,670
That too,

186
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,840
but we met for the first time today,
and we're not even dating.

187
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,845
Then once you're reassured,
and it's no longer our first time meeting,

188
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,972
and we start dating, you'll kiss me?

189
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,266
I might.

190
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,062
You're really scary, after all.

191
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,649
Then I'm going to leave once.

192
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,027
What do you mean?

193
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,657
Really, what's going on?

194
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,700
Hey.

195
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,632
Yes?

196
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,425
<i>Hello.</i>

197
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,646
Thanks for letting me in.

198
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,197
My name is Ayana Tsuchida.
I don't have a boyfriend.

199
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,325
- Ms. Ayana Tsuchida.
- Yes.

200
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,577
This is no longer our first time
meeting each other.

201
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,454
This is the second time
I've visited this room.

202
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,042
Ms. Tsuchida.

203
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,129
What is it, Mr. Saeki?

204
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,132
I'm really sorry…

205
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,054
I think I like you already.

206
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,807
That's crazy.

207
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,018
If it was anyone else,
you would be dead by now.

208
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,645
I'm sorry.

209
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,647
I'm really sorry,

210
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,942
but I can't kiss you or anything.

211
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,360
You can stay the night,

212
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,238
but I want to take the proper steps.

213
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,909
Why are you assuming
that I'd even want to do those things?

214
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,786
Right.

215
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,746
You're absolutely right.

216
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,543
Wait, what is this? A nightmare?

217
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,175
Anyway, you can stay the night,

218
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,595
but absolutely no physical contact.

219
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,471
Okay?

220
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,849
That's A-okay with me.

221
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,882
<i>Thanks for yesterday.</i>
<i>It was a fun evening.</i>

222
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,594
<i>You can leave the door unlocked</i>
<i>when you leave.</i>

223
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,807
<i>Um…</i>

224
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,309
<i>will you really go out with me?</i>

225
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,980
<i>If yes,</i>

226
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,439
<i>let's start by going out to eat.</i>

227
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,068
<i>Accept. Decline.</i>

228
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,614
ACCEPT

229
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,117
<i>Yes, I accept.</i>

230
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,910
<i>Let's go out to eat.</i>

231
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,954
<i>Ayana Tsuchida.</i>

232
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,209
<i>090-1834…</i>

233
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:38,880
Whoa, that scared me.

234
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,364
- Would you like more water?
- Thank you.

235
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,745
- Would you like a refill of your coffee?
- Yes please.

236
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,955
I'll refill your water.

237
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,668
<i>Dear Ms. Ayana Tsuchida.</i>

238
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:21,173
<i>So much time has passed</i>
<i>since we first met,</i>

239
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,552
<i>and I know it might seem strange</i>
<i>to be writing a letter now,</i>

240
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,888
<i>but I'm writing this letter</i>

241
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,806
<i>because I learned</i>

242
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,768
<i>that you don't currently have a boyfriend.</i>

243
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,035
Welcome.

244
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,122
‪Oh.

245
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,834
What's with that lackluster response?

246
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,971
Ayana…

247
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,306
‪Yeah?

248
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,476
You don't have a boyfriend, right?

249
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,145
I do.

250
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:18,980
What?

251
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,983
Huh? What? You don't have one, right?

252
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,278
What? As of yesterday,
you didn't have a boyfriend.

253
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,990
- At least that's what you said.
- Yeah, I didn't yesterday.

254
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,201
And today?

255
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,245
I do.

256
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,123
So you didn't have one yesterday,

257
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,250
but you have one today.

258
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,043
Please explain.

259
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,337
Well,

260
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,506
I got myself a boyfriend last night.

261
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,260
What?

262
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,054
Is it someone you've known for a while?

263
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,268
No, we met yesterday, and it was like,
"Should we go out?"

264
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,816
How is that even possible?

265
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,319
Yeah, I'm surprised too.

266
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,282
Can I ask what he does for work?

267
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,244
I don't want to tell you.

268
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,082
Then I won't ask.

269
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,636
Didn't you come here to check out
our clothes?

270
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,056
Yes, I did.

271
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,064
But I'll come another day.

272
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,902
- Bye.
- Bye.

273
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,502
<i>Let's say you hang out with people</i>
<i>you don't know very well.</i>

274
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,422
<i>When you do that, you get to know them.</i>

275
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,300
<i>Once you get to know them,</i>

276
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,928
<i>you can't go back</i>
<i>to when you didn't know them.</i>

277
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,739
<i>There are things</i>
<i>you're better off knowing,</i>

278
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,492
<i>and things you're better off not knowing.</i>

279
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,787
<i>Everything that begins eventually ends.</i>

280
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,831
<i>Relationships begin and end.</i>

281
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,296
<i>That's why, deep down,</i>

282
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,883
<i>I don't really want to be</i>
<i>in a relationship with anyone anymore.</i>

283
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,436
<i>Is it possible to continue loving someone</i>

284
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,273
<i>even after knowing everything about them?</i>

285
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,902
<i>As that thought lingers in my mind,</i>

286
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,863
<i>I find myself falling in love again.</i>

287
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,659
<i>All the while fearing</i>
<i>the possibility of loss.</i>

288
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,414
<i>That's why</i>

289
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,542
<i>I try to fall in love with people</i>
<i>I won't fall too deeply in love with.</i>

290
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,809
Welcome.

291
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,894
- I'm meeting a friend.
- Okay.

292
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,321
ONE YEAR LATER
DECEMBER 2025

293
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,156
- Hey.
- Hi.

294
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:59,075
- Sorry I started without you.
- No worries.

295
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,831
Thank you. Lemon sour, please.

296
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,124
- Lemon sour?
- Yes.

297
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,879
I ordered some grilled chicken and stuff.

298
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,672
Thank you.

299
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,971
What were you doing today?

300
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,598
- Today?
- Yeah.

301
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,894
The weather was nice today,
so I was relaxing.

302
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,812
Relaxing?

303
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,524
I woke up in the afternoon,

304
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,109
did my laundry,

305
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,862
walked along the river,

306
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,781
and stared blankly at the boys

307
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,616
playing baseball on the riverbank.

308
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,953
Then I got home as the sun was setting,
and that's when I realized

309
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,789
I had forgotten to hang out the laundry.

310
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,875
That's the worst. Did you hang it?

311
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,544
I did, just a while ago. And now I'm here.

312
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,339
You're an idiot. You wasted the sunlight.

313
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:55,715
‪Not really,

314
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,717
since I soaked up the sun.

315
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,555
I also got barked at by a dog
that was taking a walk.

316
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,392
A dog barked at you before too.

317
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,852
I wonder why dogs keep barking at me.

318
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,564
Maybe they know…

319
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,649
Know what?

320
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,902
That I'm a bad person?

321
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:16,945
Hey now.

322
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,908
- Thank you for waiting.
- Thanks.

323
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,411
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

324
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,624
Maybe it's because I'm scared of them.

325
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:31,709
Of dogs?

326
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,880
You're scared of dogs?

327
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,674
Yeah.

328
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,051
Why?

329
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,886
- Why am I scared of dogs?
- Yeah.

330
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,556
I don't know why.

331
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,309
Is it childhood trauma?

332
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,186
No, it's not that.

333
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,734
I'm curious,

334
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,362
how do you handle trauma

335
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,030
when you're writing novels?

336
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,199
Do you use it quite a bit?
Do you consider it?

337
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,119
I wonder.

338
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,540
I don't think I avoid it.

339
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,875
Do you avoid it?

340
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,212
Yeah. I'm pretty skeptical about trauma.

341
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,090
Why do you say so?

342
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,050
Let's see…

343
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,598
It's true that the past
has led to the present…

344
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,773
I don't know.
Maybe I'm afraid it'll become too cliché.

345
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,733
- Cliché?
- Yeah.

346
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,528
Even people who have never
been chased by a dog

347
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,197
can still be afraid of dogs.

348
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,201
Even when parents
have a good relationship,

349
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,329
their kids might not be keen on
marriage or romantic relationships, right?

350
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,332
But writers depict them
as being from broken families.

351
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,501
Or from single-parent families.

352
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,378
You're right.

353
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,604
Mr. Yamada, did your parents
get along well?

354
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,439
Hey,

355
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,150
Ms. Tsuchida, did your parents
get along well?

356
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,236
‪Huh?

357
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,362
What do you mean?

358
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,447
Nothing in particular.

359
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,411
My parents got along very well.

360
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,956
Although my dad passed away already.

361
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,083
- I see.
- Yeah.

362
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,477
What're you doing tomorrow?

363
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,020
Tomorrow?

364
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,939
Nothing in particular.

365
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,652
Why?

366
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,362
‪Nothing.

367
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,298
<i>"Wrong" by Sen Yamada.</i>

368
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,677
<i>"I was asked,</i>

369
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,638
<i>'You know it's wrong,</i>
<i>so why do you meet up with me?'</i>

370
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,765
<i>"Then I realize</i>
<i>that what I'm doing is wrong."</i>

371
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:38,062
<i>"When I was asked,</i>
<i>'What are you thinking?'"</i>

372
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:41,274
<i>"I replied, 'Well, I was realizing</i>
<i>that this is wrong.'"</i>

373
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,902
"Then I was told, 'But you apologized,
didn't you?'"

374
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,195
"'When we were leaving the other day.'"

375
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,990
"And I realized, 'Ah, I did apologize.'"

376
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,161
"On the day it all started,

377
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,830
we talked about many things over drinks."

378
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,167
"But more than the words we exchanged,

379
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,127
there were many moments of silence,

380
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,754
and during each of those silences,

381
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,131
we would try to read
each other's expressions."

382
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,176
<i>Maybe it wasn't so much</i>
<i>trying to read each other,</i>

383
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,762
<i>but rather more like</i>
<i>gazing into each other's eyes.</i>

384
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,348
<i>A kind of playful exchange of glances.</i>

385
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,267
<i>There were many moments like that.</i>

386
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,479
<i>I hesitated over and over</i>

387
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,315
<i>whether to leave or not.</i>

388
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,903
<i>"I said, 'Moments like this,</i>
<i>are you know…'</i>

389
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,322
<i>Then I was asked, 'What do you mean?'</i>

390
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,825
<i>'You know' probably meant 'erotic,'</i>

391
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,620
<i>but it's too crude to say it outright,</i>

392
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,372
<i>so I just had fun by saying 'you know.'"</i>

393
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:42,502
Moments like this, are you know…

394
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,423
- "You know"?
- Yeah.

395
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,386
What do you mean?

396
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,764
‪No, nothing.

397
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,561
Can I order one more drink?

398
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,271
Of course.

399
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,066
Excuse me.

400
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,484
Yes?

401
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,903
- Lemon sour.
- Okay, one lemon sour.

402
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,373
What is it?

403
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,042
Nothing.

404
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,381
What is it? Quit that.

405
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,430
I'm being unfair, huh?

406
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,684
Yes, you are unfair.

407
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,311
Why are you speaking so formally?

408
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,899
Thank you for waiting.
Here's your lemon sour.

409
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:47,984
Thank you.

410
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,120
What is it?

411
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,625
You want me to express
my true feelings, right?

412
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,628
This is the place to express myself?

413
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,090
‪Uh-huh.

414
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,217
This is where I…

415
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,512
or rather we

416
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,350
take the opportunity to discuss
whether or not

417
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,436
I have feelings for you, right?

418
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,524
‪-Uh-huh.
‪-Is that what you want?

419
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,570
Then I'm going to say it.

420
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,197
‪Uh-huh.

421
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,326
You won't regret it? It's okay?

422
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,412
‪Uh-huh.

423
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:47,794
Well…

424
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,047
Then…

425
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,174
I'll say it.

426
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,261
I do.

427
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:58,930
I do.

428
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,266
Yes, I have feelings for you.

429
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,394
I am

430
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,731
attracted to you, Ms. Tsuchida.

431
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,864
I'm sure you knew it already.

432
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,325
‪Uh-huh.

433
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,286
But both of us

434
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,997
are already seeing someone else.

435
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,375
And you know,

436
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:32,630
there are some things
that just won't work out.

437
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,552
Besides,

438
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,847
you said before
that you didn't want anything

439
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,475
like a serious romantic relationship.

440
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:47,979
‪Uh-huh.

441
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,858
So yeah, that's why

442
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,902
I didn't say anything

443
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,864
about liking you or anything like that,

444
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,075
because it would be wrong.

445
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,118
Well,

446
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:05,329
meeting like this might be wrong too,

447
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:11,085
but I thought that meeting up for drinks
like this was just about right.

448
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,629
Like listening to stories
about your boyfriend,

449
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,883
and hearing about how you cheated again.

450
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,926
I thought keeping that kind of distance
would be best.

451
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,223
‪Uh-huh.

452
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:25,892
‪Yeah.

453
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,352
But…

454
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,898
I'm attracted to you.

455
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,817
That's the truth.

456
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,657
That's how I feel.

457
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,756
Hey, wait a minute. How about you?

458
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,636
I just talked about my feelings for you,

459
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,971
but what about you?

460
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,768
Ms. Tsuchida,

461
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,604
are you even slightly attracted to me?

462
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:17,860
‪Uh-huh.

463
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,739
Really?

464
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,282
‪Uh-huh.

465
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,745
I see.

466
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,668
That makes sense. Otherwise, you wouldn't
be seeing me this often.

467
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,461
‪Uh-huh.

468
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,381
Hey, by the way…

469
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,258
You've

470
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,761
only been saying "uh-huh" for a while now.

471
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:45,930
‪Uh-huh.

472
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,349
Come on.

473
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,692
This is not good.

474
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,487
Yes.

475
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,823
It's bad.

476
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,080
<i>"The numerous "uh-huhs"</i>

477
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,790
<i>that came from your mouth</i>

478
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:15,376
<i>felt like the most honest sounds</i>
<i>I'd ever heard."</i>

479
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,548
<i>"It felt like that word contained</i>

480
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,551
<i>far more beauty than the words</i>

481
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:27,096
<i>'I like you' or 'I'm attracted to you.'"</i>

482
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,516
"We both smiled shyly."

483
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,727
"'This is not good.'"

484
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,895
"'Yes, it's bad.'"

485
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,150
"I left the restaurant
without hardly touching

486
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,986
the lemon sour I'd ordered last,

487
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,488
and 15 minutes later
we were in my hotel room."

488
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,700
"But we didn't kiss

489
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,369
or touch each other."

490
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,997
"We simply talked about trivial things

491
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,832
while enjoying canned beer

492
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,543
and potato chips that we bought
at the convenience store

493
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,545
connected to the first floor
of the hotel."

494
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:11,974
That's a lie.

495
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:14,852
‪Uh-huh.

496
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,439
We kissed.

497
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,692
‪Uh-huh.

498
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,321
You're escaping reality.

499
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:26,655
‪Uh-huh.

500
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,617
Stop imitating my "uh-huh."

501
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,035
‪Uh-huh.

502
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,746
Ouch.

503
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:39,210
I'm not escaping anything.
Plus, this is all fiction.

504
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,878
All fiction?

505
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,047
Did you just say
that all of it is fiction?

506
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,757
No, I didn't.

507
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,967
Yes, you did.

508
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,344
You said it!

509
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,471
You're so scary. That hurts.

510
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,473
Ouch.

511
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,062
It's probably bruised by now.

512
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,356
Of course, because there's blood
flowing through you.

513
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,662
Ms. Tsuchida,

514
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,041
are you still seeing other people
besides your boyfriend and me?

515
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,043
‪Uh-huh.

516
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,753
I see.

517
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,840
You're sleeping with them too?

518
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,969
I am, or more accurately, I was.

519
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,888
There's not much of that lately.

520
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,057
I see.

521
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,477
Why do you ask?

522
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,938
No reason.

523
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,027
I tell you everything, Mr. Yamada.

524
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,155
‪Yeah.

525
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,040
- What is it?
- Nothing.

526
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,560
Oh,

527
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,228
you know…

528
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,190
- Yes?
- The other day,

529
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,066
we kissed.

530
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,198
We did.

531
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,116
And…

532
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,494
- Yeah?
- That time,

533
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,705
you were the one that instigated it,
not me.

534
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,415
‪Huh?

535
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,377
No one has ever done that before.

536
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,004
Everyone just waits to be kissed.

537
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,923
You know…

538
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,468
We get into these situations.

539
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,346
But they're so sly.

540
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,473
They don't initiate it themselves.

541
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,643
They might lean closer,

542
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,605
or close their eyes
as we sit next to each other like this.

543
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,484
But they will never make the first move.

544
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,611
They make me kiss them.

545
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,323
And when I do kiss them,

546
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:18,494
they say things like,
"Oh you kissed me. So sneaky."

547
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:19,870
That's what they'll say.

548
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,457
How cute.

549
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,169
But you kissed me.

550
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,506
That made me happy.

551
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,342
I thought, "Oh, she's not sly
like the others."

552
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,095
Why?

553
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:39,306
Because you essentially provided me
with an excuse to tell my girlfriend.

554
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,394
Even if she finds out, I can tell her
that you're the one who instigated it.

555
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,355
What're you talking about?

556
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:51,151
I thought you were so cool.

557
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,031
Those things never crossed my mind.

558
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,451
Maybe you're right.

559
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,246
I just kissed you because I wanted to.

560
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,163
‪Yeah.

561
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,041
But

562
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,462
it just made me happy.

563
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,926
Hey.

564
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,596
Now that you've said that, it'll be
awkward for me to wait for your kiss.

565
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,472
What? I'm not going to kiss you.

566
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,852
What? Were you planning to kiss? No way.

567
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:25,978
Ouch!

568
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:27,521
Ouch.

569
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,566
I think I broke a bone.
I know it's broken.

570
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,942
Let me kiss you.

571
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,237
- You're the worst. You ruined the mood.
- Let me kiss you!

572
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,156
- Hold on.
- Stop running away.

573
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,782
Stop running away.

574
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,409
Ouch. Stop it.

575
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,539
Wait a minute. What is it? That hurts.

576
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,374
That hurts.

577
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,127
- You little…
- You're ripping my face apart.

578
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,670
Ouch.

579
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,797
Stop it.

580
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,424
Ouch!

581
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,660
What are you thinking about?

582
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,412
Right now?

583
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,330
‪Uh-huh.

584
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,753
I wonder.

585
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,465
I was thinking of two things.

586
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,718
Two things?

587
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,514
- What and what?
- It's nothing.

588
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:45,974
Tell me.

589
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,560
No, it's okay.

590
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,732
It's okay, you can tell me.

591
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,614
Was it about your girlfriend?

592
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,205
Yeah, that's one.

593
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,961
Your guilt?

594
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,881
That too.

595
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,300
I see.

596
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,553
‪Yeah.

597
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,767
I'm just

598
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,645
having too much fun.

599
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:33,564
What?

600
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,733
That was really fun…

601
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,694
That strange battle we just had.

602
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,487
Yeah.

603
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,949
That was strange, but fun.

604
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,242
Strangely.

605
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:46,910
Yeah.

606
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,416
When I'm having too much fun,

607
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:54,751
it feels like

608
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,088
I'm doing something wrong.

609
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,513
It's not cheating if it's not fun?

610
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,602
I don't know.

611
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,937
But that's what it is, huh?

612
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,232
I guess so.

613
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,988
That didn't sound like you mean it.

614
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,199
How annoying.

615
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,874
What's the other thing?

616
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,668
The other thing?

617
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,586
‪Yeah.

618
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,506
One was your girlfriend.
What's the other thing?

619
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,050
What were you thinking of?

620
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,137
You can't lie.

621
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,098
I don't want you to lie
to make me feel better.

622
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,559
It's Spitz.

623
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,811
It's the opposite of Spitz's song.

624
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,396
I want the opposite of Spitz's song.

625
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,233
Well…

626
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,862
- The other thing is…
- Yeah?

627
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,575
I was wondering why someone like you

628
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,705
would choose to be with someone like me.

629
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,798
Now that you mention it…

630
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,759
Hey!

631
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,089
You want to go home soon?
You can't miss the last train.

632
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,466
Yeah.

633
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,053
You're okay with me leaving?

634
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,764
What? You're going to stay with me?

635
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,267
No, I'm leaving.

636
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,353
- What the heck?
- Yeah, I'm going home.

637
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,314
Yeah.

638
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,274
That's for the best.

639
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:50,177
- I'll be going now.
- Okay. Take care.

640
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,935
This is cool?

641
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,854
Yeah, it's cool.

642
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,861
- Later.
- Later.

643
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:22,959
<i>I wonder</i>

644
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:27,214
<i>if Mr. Yamada's laundry</i>
<i>ended up drying in the end.</i>

645
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,551
<i>I'm thinking about that,</i>

646
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,138
<i>as I hang Yukio's laundry.</i>

647
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:44,856
- Thanks for doing the laundry.
- Sure. Mine was mixed in too.

648
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,400
What're you doing tonight?

649
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,235
I'm going back to my place tonight.

650
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,405
- Then I'll be off.
- Bye.

651
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,041
<i>In the winter light,</i>

652
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,626
<i>I continue</i>

653
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,587
<i>to think about things</i>

654
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,590
<i>that I cannot understand.</i>

655
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,594
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL
