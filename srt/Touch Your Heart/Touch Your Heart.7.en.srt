00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,200
(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,133
I worry for you.

3
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,500
Just as much as

4
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,633
you worry and think about me,

5
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,700
I'd...

6
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:10,866
I'd now like to do the same.

7
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,233
Does that mean...

8
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:23,233
I'm now a bit more special to you
than before?

9
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:27,533
Yes.

10
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,733
Yes, this is Kwon Jung-rok.

11
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:43,266
Ah, yes. Your Honor.

12
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:47,233
No, I don't think there's a need
for a written judgment.

13
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:48,766
No.

14
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,686
Anyway,

15
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:02,553
thank you for assisting me

16
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:04,353
through this difficult trial.

17
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,333
Please get a good rest for
tomorrow, then.

18
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,033
Wait a second.

19
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:16,833
"For tomorrow?"

20
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,633
Why? Is tomorrow a special day?

21
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,966
Is he going to ask me out?

22
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,620
Then again, if it weren't for
that call from earlier,

23
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,166
he would've totally asked me out.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,633
Oh my goodness!

25
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:38,653
Oh my goodness!

26
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,266
He's going to ask me out tomorrow!

27
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:44,466
(Episode 7)

28
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,200
Good morning!

29
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:51,900
Good morning!

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,866
Ah, good morning!

31
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,386
Did something good
happen to Yoon-seo?

32
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:58,233
Who knows?

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Huh?

34
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,200
Did he go somewhere?

35
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:08,900
What are these flowers?

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,633
Don't tell me, he...

37
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,833
What's this?

38
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,200
"The unyielding chill has
finally subsided,

39
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,920
and now, the warmth of
spring has come to us."

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Gosh, Mr. Kwon is so poetic.

41
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:02,253
"This is just a small something

42
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,886
but with big appreciation.

43
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:08,186
So please, do accept them."

44
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:11,466
"Small something?"
No, they mean so much!

45
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,753
"We understand it was difficult,
but because you never gave up

46
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:20,853
an innocent woman,
she was able to…"

47
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,400
"Innocent woman?"

48
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:27,866
"Thank you for
representing Ms. Lim Yun-hee."

49
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,266
"From Lee Young-ok, Chief of
Korean Women's Association."

50
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,933
Ah you're here.

51
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:38,066
Oh.

52
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,253
- These...
- Oh, the flowers?

53
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,053
They're from
the women's association,

54
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,420
but I'm not really into flowers.

55
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,533
So I put them here for
you to enjoy instead.

56
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,466
Oh, I see.

57
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:54,953
Mr. Yeon wants everyone to
gather for a briefing.

58
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:56,200
Alright.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,366
Let's get ready and go.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,953
Alright, before
we start the briefing,

61
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:12,653
let's give a big hand to Kwon,

62
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:16,286
our hope and our treasure,

63
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:19,066
for his big win on the
Lim Yun-hee case!

64
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,453
Please, that's enough.
But thank you.

65
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,433
Being shy, are you?

66
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:28,353
But that's what's charming about
Kwon, don't you agree?

67
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,733
Alright, then.
Let's really get started.

68
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,186
You all know that our firm has
accepted the Sangji-dong case.

69
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:36,053
Because this is an important case,

70
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:37,686
I thought we should have
Kwon brief us

71
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:39,820
before we exchange our opinions.

72
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,900
Sure.

73
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:48,000
Before I begin, let me first
show you our defendant's photo.

74
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:52,120
What?

75
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,786
Why the picture of
our cosmic goddess, Yoon-seo?

76
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:58,586
Just what has Yoon-seo done?

77
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,833
The name of her crime?

78
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,233
It is...

79
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,000
Theft, for stealing my heart.

80
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,933
Crime of injury, for
blinding me with her beauty.

81
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:11,853
And attempted murder,

82
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:15,033
for making me unable to live
without seeing her every day!

83
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:18,286
I'm going to make sure
Ms. Oh is sentenced to life

84
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:21,233
so she is forever bound to me.

85
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:23,653
Ms. Oh Jin-shim!

86
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,633
Please accept my heart.

87
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:27,853
Please take me!

88
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:29,866
Take me away, right now!

89
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:31,666
Yoon-seo?

90
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,433
What are you doing?

91
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,666
What is this?

92
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:42,833
(Sangji-dong Familial Homicide)

93
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,233
That man...

94
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:52,720
That man is going to be
arrested like this.

95
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,866
Yep, he is!

96
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:58,600
Because Mr. Kwon will
make sure of it!

97
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:01,366
Whoa!

98
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:06,420
You're really unpredictable.

99
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,653
But that's what makes her
so charming, isn't it?

100
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:10,053
Perfect visuals,

101
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:12,433
but you know where
she'll bounce off to next.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,366
Thank you for
your high opinion of me.

103
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,386
Gosh, that terrible man...

104
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:19,466
Terrible...

105
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,633
I'll start the briefing, then.

106
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:30,953
Are you crazy?

107
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,166
What's wrong with you?

108
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:40,620
Get a grip, Oh Yoon-seo!

109
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,886
Be reserved and wait,
like the actress you are.

110
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:45,133
Yes, be reserved.

111
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:01,033
Huh? It's six o'clock already.

112
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:09,800
Goodness. What's with that heart?

113
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,966
Is that meant for me?

114
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,966
Is it like one of those simple
gestures of love?

115
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:29,420
Oh what?

116
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,966
He was only wiping off the dust?

117
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,353
I've been too busy to
check my surroundings,

118
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,353
and the cleaners have been slack.

119
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:45,353
We'll have to file a complaint
with the cleaning agency.

120
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:47,353
Oh, I'll do that myself,

121
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:50,453
so you don't need to mind it.
Then…

122
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:51,666
Wait!

123
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:58,086
That's it? You...

124
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,566
You don’t have
anything else to say to me?

125
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,853
- Pardon?
- Forget it.

126
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:04,700
It's nothing.

127
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,366
I'm heading off first, then.

128
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,033
What?

129
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:42,333
Why did I even bother
dressing up today?

130
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,120
There you go again.

131
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,233
We promised we'll be reserved
about this.

132
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,666
Come on, let's switch back to
the chic actress mode.

133
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's be reserved, and wait.

134
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,600
Be reserved.

135
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,866
(Secretary Oh Jin-sim)

136
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,700
- Yes, Ms. Oh...
- I can't wait any longer.

137
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,486
- Pardon?
- I just can't

138
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:49,653
wait any longer.

139
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,520
I'm not going to be reserved.

140
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,100
I'm just going to say
all that’s on my mind.

141
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
I...

142
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:00,253
I'm going crazy, because

143
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,966
I want to hear you ask me out.

144
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:06,153
- Just what...
- What, you don't want to?

145
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,820
Fine, then!

146
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,966
Then I'll say it first.

147
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:16,153
Actually, now that
I'm about to say it...

148
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,933
Wait. Give me one second.

149
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,966
I like you, Mr. Kwon.

150
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:36,000
Mr. Kwon. You remember, right?

151
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:42,186
I said there's something
I want to tell you,

152
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:44,220
but that I can't
quite say it right now.

153
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,233
But I promised to
tell you someday.

154
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,400
Well...

155
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:55,166
What that is, is...

156
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,453
I love you!

157
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:58,666
It's...

158
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:05,986
Into my heart, you...

159
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:07,920
Well, what I mean is...

160
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,466
Into my pure, untouched heart,
you just...

161
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,966
Swoosh!

162
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:19,833
...flew in like that.

163
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:25,220
That's why,

164
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,986
when you told me

165
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:32,520
I'd become a little more
special to you,

166
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,900
I was really happy.

167
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:40,733
So I'd been waiting for
your next words all day.

168
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:46,520
And you dare make fun of me?

169
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,300
Me, Oh Yoon-seo?

170
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:52,866
- You're so bad!
- Ms. Oh Jin-shim?

171
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,066
Ms. Oh Jin-shim?

172
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,166
Oh what?

173
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,553
What is it? Did something happen?

174
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:20,100
Why, is your next case
a headache, too?

175
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Forget it.

176
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,800
What's wrong with him this time?

177
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,286
I'll just state the facts,
so give me your verdict.

178
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:35,720
There's this man who came to
develop feelings for this woman.

179
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,220
So he told her,

180
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,066
"You've become
someone special to me."

181
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,520
Because the man thought
that was enough for now.

182
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,553
He knew they were both interested
in each other,

183
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:49,020
so he thought they should now
get to know each other slowly.

184
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,200
But apparently, that's not
what the woman wanted.

185
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,453
She was waiting for his next move,

186
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:56,666
but when there was nothing,
she became extremely mad.

187
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,700
So, is the man at fault?

188
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,720
Are you sure this is a case?
And not about you?

189
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,253
About me? No!

190
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,486
This is about my client.

191
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:09,700
Whatever.

192
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:13,653
Like you're a love counselor now.

193
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:14,933
Ha!

194
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,233
Fine, just forget what I said.

195
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:21,686
The man's not at fault.

196
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:23,500
Because what he said isn't
completely wrong.

197
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,220
- Right?
- Still,

198
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,200
I'd like to take the
woman's side on this one.

199
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:34,453
Who gets so logical
in a relationship

200
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:36,653
and only tries to start something
after knowing everything?

201
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:38,886
A relationship is about
getting to know each other.

202
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:40,220
I mean, the guy's already
lead her on.

203
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,153
He even told her that
she's special to him,

204
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:45,086
only to cut off there!

205
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,566
Now who on earth would
welcome that situation?

206
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,520
You still don't get it?

207
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,853
Alright, listen.
You're in the courtroom.

208
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:56,720
Your Honor,

209
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,253
from the circumstantial
evidence discussed earlier,

210
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,853
my client's actions cannot be
seen as intentional.

211
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,986
Moreover, she has a clear alibi.

212
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:05,100
Therefore, I...

213
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:09,886
What if the trial ended here?

214
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:10,953
It'd be frustrating!

215
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,020
Right?

216
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,420
After all the important stuff,
there's no conclusion.

217
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,633
And that's what you...!

218
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:22,220
I mean, your client... did.

219
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,200
To that woman. Okay?

220
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:42,253
Ms. Oh Jin-shim, I'm sorry.

221
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,933
I thought we were at the stage of
getting to know each other...

222
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,453
Ms. Oh Jin-shim,
I should've known.

223
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:57,433
Please forgive me, and let's...

224
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,866
Ms. Oh Jin-shim, let's meet
and talk about this tomorrow.

225
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:17,686
What? What is it?

226
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:20,520
Well, I remembered something
I think you should

227
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,120
relay to your client.

228
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,753
Tell him to ask her out
as soon as possible,

229
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,786
and remember to take flowers
or something small and shiny,

230
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:30,300
or just anything that
this woman might like.

231
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,453
- What?
- Asking her out empty-handed

232
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:38,453
is no different to going to
Court without evidence.

233
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:39,786
You know,

234
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,820
I never met this client of yours,

235
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,753
but I'm gladly offering my advice

236
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,266
because I have a feeling
he's not so smart in this area.

237
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:48,220
Take care, then.

238
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,933
Alright. I'll pass that on.

239
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,266
(Ms. Oh Jin-sim, let's meet
and talk about this tomorrow)

240
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:14,400
(HEIGHTS MANSION)

241
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Oh what?

242
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:43,300
Did I fall asleep here?

243
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,266
(Mr. Kwon Jung-rok)

244
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:52,266
He wants to meet and talk?

245
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,333
About what?

246
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,433
Wait a minute.
Did I say something ag...

247
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,653
I'm going crazy, because

248
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:04,833
I want to hear you ask me out.

249
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:08,086
I like you, Mr. Kwon.

250
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,053
I was really happy, and...

251
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,333
Did you faint,
because you're so happy?

252
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,220
You're so bad, Mr. Kwon!

253
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,366
I hate you!

254
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:17,300
I love you!

255
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,820
What does he want to say to me
when he sees me?

256
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,986
That I'm the worst kind of woman?

257
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:26,933
Let's make sure
we never meet again?

258
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:34,100
Yoon-seo, are you still asleep?

259
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,533
Oh what? So you're up already.

260
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,353
Hyuk-jun.

261
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,520
Can you get me a white envelope?

262
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,086
White envelope?

263
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,700
What, for gift money?

264
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,786
No, it's not for gift money.

265
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:54,120
- Then what's it for?
- My letter of resignation…

266
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,120
What? Resignation?

267
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,533
I'm not going to
work there anymore.

268
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:01,633
Actually, no. I can't.

269
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,653
Good morning.

270
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,066
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

271
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:14,820
Ah, Kwon!

272
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,153
Great timing.

273
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,153
I just had a call from my cousin,

274
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:20,466
and Yoon-seo can't
come into work today.

275
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,753
- What?
- Why?

276
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,120
Is she sick?

277
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,453
No, I don't think so.

278
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:28,220
I said I'll come visit her

279
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,753
with flowers and porridge,

280
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:30,920
but she said she's not sick.

281
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,720
It's due to personal
circumstances, she said.

282
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,086
But I'm sure she has her reasons.

283
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,720
Maybe she just wanted to
take a day off!

284
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,886
No way.

285
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:41,420
I don't think Yoon-seo is
all that irresponsible.

286
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,986
Hey, what's gotten into you?

287
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:45,853
Who knew you'd be
taking Yoon-seo's side?

288
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,286
But I have to admit it.

289
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:49,520
Yoon-seo's been working
so hard until now.

290
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,553
Right.

291
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:54,020
I held a prejudice at first
because she's a celebrity,

292
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,053
but after I saw what she did
for Yun-ha

293
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:58,253
and for Ms. Lim Yun-hee too,

294
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,220
I started to think
she's pretty amazing.

295
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,720
How should I put it?
Yoon-seo's like that scarecrow

296
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,066
standing in the autumn field,
quietly doing its job.

297
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:10,500
What's that about the
scarecrow again?

298
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:12,820
Anyway.

299
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,633
I wonder what's up.

300
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,686
Kwon.

301
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:18,800
What's with that look?

302
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,866
Did something happen
between you two?

303
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:23,786
No, there was nothing.

304
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:25,320
Nothing you say?

305
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,566
But that look on your face
just told me there's something.

306
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,420
Maybe you overworked her

307
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,186
and Yoon-seo burned herself out?

308
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:33,486
Please.

309
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,166
- It's not like that.
- It's not?

310
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,586
If it's not about work...

311
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,920
Then is it something personal?

312
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,553
What if it turned out that
there's actually

313
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:42,066
something going on between them?

314
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:46,786
Hey, I was only joking.
Can't you at least smile?

315
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:50,820
You may be a competent lawyer,
but with a bad sense of humor.

316
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,133
Terrible, in fact.

317
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,100
Your call cannot be
connected at this time...

318
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:28,533
Oh man...

00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:24,620
honest conversations
with our stars

330
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,786
over a drink,
at their favorite bar!

331
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:27,753
The guest we'll be
joined by today is...

332
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,520
Hold onto your hearts, everyone!

333
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,520
It's Ms. Oh Yoon-seo,
the cosmic goddess!

334
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,166
- Hello.
- Yay, hello!

335
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:37,753
It really is an honor.

336
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,686
But you know,
this is really unexpected.

337
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:41,353
I thought you would be into

338
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:43,253
high-end dining, but...

339
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,286
Chicken feet?

340
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:48,886
I really love the
chicken feet that they serve here.

341
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:52,020
My place is just nearby,
so I have them to go sometimes.

342
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,986
They're especially best
when you're feeling down.

343
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:57,020
- Chicken feet...
- So, Yoon-seo!

344
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,753
What type of guys are you into?

345
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,620
I would say that you're into

346
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,966
someone who's competent,
and super-handsome.

347
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,020
Actually, no.
Looks aren't important to me.

348
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,986
I, uh...

349
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:14,986
I'd like him to be someone
who can touch my heart.

350
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:18,053
Like with a handwritten letter,
for example.

351
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:19,620
A handwritten letter?

352
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,420
If he asks me out through a letter,
I'd really love that.

353
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,620
But... But how could I...

354
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,633
Isn't that just so romantic?

355
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:34,866
You're here.

356
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:38,953
Oh man, I'm going crazy here!

357
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:40,420
Why won't she go to work?

358
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,520
- What's the reason?
- I'm not so sure.

359
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,320
She won't say.

360
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,220
And she refuses to
come out of her room.

361
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,353
What should I do?

362
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:48,986
The writer said she won't
give her a chance

363
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:50,886
unless she holds out for
at least 3 months at a law firm.

364
00:23:50,966 --> 00:23:52,220
From how I see it,

365
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,320
I don't think she'll ever give in.

366
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,620
And at the same time,
I don’t think we'll find another

367
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,053
law firm who'll keep this
confidential as well as them.

368
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,586
Don't worry.

369
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,186
I'm here, aren't I?

370
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:04,920
I'll do whatever it takes to
send her back there.

371
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,086
Well, I doubt if you can.

372
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,186
Hey, I'm Yeon Jun-seok.

373
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:11,153
Yeon Jun-seok,
the CEO of Yeon Entertainment!

374
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,353
Have you ever seen anyone else who
handles Yoon-seo better than I do?

375
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:14,686
No.

376
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:15,766
Then just trust me.

377
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,086
It's this way.

378
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,333
This way? Alright.

379
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,100
Yoon-seo?

380
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,600
Yoon-seo, Mr. Yeon is here.

381
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,053
I heard the story.

382
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:41,153
So you won't be going to
work at the law firm anymore.

383
00:24:41,233 --> 00:24:42,233
No.

384
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,700
I'm not doing it anymore.

385
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:46,900
Actually, no.

386
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,866
It's more like I can't.

387
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:52,366
Right. Good thinking.

388
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:54,833
Don't go.

389
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:57,286
- What?
- Mr. Yeon!

390
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:58,953
Why do you look so surprised?

391
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:00,653
Hey, if you don't want to,
then don't!

392
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,086
I mean, I know this is
all for your acting,

393
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:07,253
but it's not easy for
cosmic goddess Oh Yoon-seo to

394
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,520
last three months at
a law firm, huh?

395
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,486
To be honest with you,
ever since I put you in there,

396
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:13,520
I haven't had
a good night's sleep.

397
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,153
I was always thinking about
how hard it must be for you.

398
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:19,500
So don't go, and
just quit altogether.

399
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,786
But if she quits now,

400
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:23,786
she won't get that attorney role
in Lee Se-jin's new drama.

401
00:25:23,866 --> 00:25:25,586
What, is that so important?

402
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:26,953
Let her just bum around
until she's forty,

403
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:28,453
and then she can play
a real bum in some drama.

404
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:30,786
Right? Because if you
quit the law firm now

405
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,586
and can't make a comeback
with that new drama,

406
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,986
you'll be rotting at home for
a few years anyway.

407
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,120
Then just imagine! You'll pull off the
bum character so well,

408
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,153
with your realistic portrayal of
her mundane, boring life.

409
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:42,386
You'll literally have the word
"bored" written on your face!

410
00:25:42,466 --> 00:25:43,600
Right, Yoon-seo?

411
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,220
- Mr. Yeon.
- Yes, what is it?

412
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,286
You want to go back to
the law firm  now?

413
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:53,786
No, I just...

414
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:56,133
I just want to send you out.

415
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,720
You know, I'm really
frustrated right now,

416
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,986
so do you really have to
threaten me now?

417
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:04,233
What? Did you think
I can't even take a hint?

418
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,753
Yoon-seo!

419
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,286
All that time in the office has
taught you something!

420
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:12,920
It's taught me anger, too!

421
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,033
Anger, and rage!

422
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:16,533
Please...

423
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:19,986
- Please!
- Yoon-seo, where are you going?

424
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:22,266
To go and get fresh air!

425
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,953
Wait for me! I'll drive you.

426
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:26,520
Hey, don't you know
Yoon-seo already?

427
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,920
Once she starts acting stubborn,

428
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
there's no helping her.

429
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:32,253
Let's just watch her in quiet.

430
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,200
Hey, bring me some beer
from that fridge.

431
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:37,000
Ugh! Damnit!

432
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:47,066
Teddy bear.

433
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:02,800
She likes pink, so...

434
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,920
"Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

435
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,786
I, Kwon Jung-rok,
first saw you, Ms. Oh Jin-shim,

436
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:13,053
on February 6th, 2019,

437
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,253
in my secretary's office at Always,

438
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,000
which is located in
Seocho-gu, Seoul."

439
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,186
"After our many exchanges at work

440
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:28,486
including our six or so
lunches and dinners together,

441
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:31,686
I came to realize that
your feelings for me are

442
00:27:31,766 --> 00:27:34,186
genuine and true,
and not fraudulent.

443
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:37,386
Therefore, I, Kwon Jung-rok,

444
00:27:37,466 --> 00:27:40,453
would like to officially ask you,
Ms. Oh Jin-shim,

445
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,366
out on a date.
I hope you will accept it."

446
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,433
At this rate, it'll be
"Your Honor" next.

447
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
Oh man...

448
00:27:58,633 --> 00:27:59,700
Ugh.

Prosecutor Yu, let's go to lunch.

455
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:54,100
I don't have the appetite.

456
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:59,720
Then we'll just go on without you.

457
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
Sure.

458
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:29,586
Ah, enjoy your lunch.

459
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:30,586
We will.

460
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:31,920

461
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yes.

462
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:36,586
So... Where's Prosecutor Yu?

463
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:37,666
Does she have a lunch appointment?

464
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,653
No, she's in her office.

465
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:40,953
She said she has no appetite.

466
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:44,053
Maybe it's the stress from
the Lim Yun-hee case,

467
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:45,933
but she hasn't been eating
much these days.

468

00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:23,333
Why did you run away from me?

490
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,920
And why didn't you
come to work today?

491
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,866
Because I was too
embarrassed to face you.

492
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:33,133
Embarrassed?

493
00:31:34,466 --> 00:31:36,420
What, you think I won't be?

494
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,566
After confessing to you drunk,
in the worst way possible?

495
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:45,100
It was me who confessed to you
in the worst of ways.

496
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:47,166
Pardon?

497
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,720
Because of my vague
choice of words,

498
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,053
I made you wait,

499
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:56,720
and now, I even made you
feel embarrassed.

500
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,533
So it's my confession
that's the worst.

501
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:01,466
Mr. Kwon...

502
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,486
So though it's late,

503
00:32:04,566 --> 00:32:07,400
I'd like to ask you out
properly this time.

504
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:21,853
What's this?

505
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:23,720
I didn't know what you liked,

506
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,553
so I did some research.

507
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:28,633
There was an interview
at your favorite chicken feet place.

508
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,633
You said you like the
chicken feet there,

509
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,866
and that you'd like to receive
a handwritten letter.

510
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,866
Then this is...

511
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:40,053
Though I wasn't able to
bring you chicken feet,

512
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:42,066
I hope you'll accept this instead.

513
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:47,153
What, you're going to
read that in front of me?

514
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,220
Yes, of course!

515
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,453
I'm dying of curiosity.

516
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:50,733
Still...!

517
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,133
Then let me go and
wait inside the car.

518
00:32:58,966 --> 00:33:01,533
(Go out with me)

519
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,253
Yes!

520
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:16,553
It's a big yes!

521
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:18,166
Let's start dating!

522
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,286
Thank you,

523
00:33:27,366 --> 00:33:28,820
for accepting my heart.

524
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,953
Thank you,

525
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:31,633
for asking me.
Even if it was a little late.

526
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,020
You've been staring at it
all this time.

527
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,600
I'm going to keep staring
and staring at it.

528
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:55,386
Wait here just a minute.

529
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,566
I'll go and get changed.

530
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,933
After that, let's go back to
the office.

531
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:03,286
Why don't you just
take the day off?

532
00:34:03,366 --> 00:34:04,886
But why?

533
00:34:04,966 --> 00:34:07,520
You must be super busy
with all the cases that

534
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,933
you put off because of
Ms. Lim Yun-hee's case.

535
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,720
And you'll have a harder time
without me.

536
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,200
You knew that much,
and you didn't come to work?

537
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,320
I appreciate what you said,

538
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,753
but you already asked for
a day off today,

539
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,233
so just take today off.

540
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,253
I won't be at my office
in the afternoon anyway.

541
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:26,333
Why not?

542
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,986
I have to go to Court,
go to the Prosecution Service,

543
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:31,633
and meet a client after that.

544
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,166
By the time I'm done,
it should be around seven.

545
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:37,586
How does that sound?

546
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:38,666
Huh?

547
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:40,166
What?

548
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:43,366
We need to go on a date.

549
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,800
After all, it's day one for us.

550
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,500
What was that laugh?

551
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:54,066
Just...

552
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,720
You said "date,"

553
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,566
and "day 1."

554
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,333
They're just such lovely words!

555
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,666
Then I'll pick you up
around seven.

556
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
Then...

557
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,200
See you later!

558
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:32,520
Our once-defendant-in-Court has
now become the victim!

559
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,086
Everyone is demanding an
investigation to see that

560
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,400
there was no coercion.
What do you have to say to that?

561
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,966
There was no coercion.

562
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,633
This is all because you just
assumed her confession was true!

563
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:46,766
I'm sorry, sir.

564
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:48,200
Get out.

565
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,733
I should've left it to
Prosecutor Lim in the first place.

566
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,886
So I heard.

567
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:23,900
A new suspect turned up, and...

568
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:26,666
I must say, what a drama!

569
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:28,153
That's enough.

570
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:29,233
But then again,

571
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,186
the twist wasn’t just
in the trial outcome,

572
00:36:32,266 --> 00:36:34,586
but you turned out to be one, too.

573
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:37,186
After all your cockiness
belittling me,

574
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:39,533
I thought you were
some hot-shot.

575
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,433
But ha! Turns out that
you're not, after all.

576
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:47,633
Hey.

577
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,833
Why'd you target Lim Yun-hee
when she's innocent?

578
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:52,620
Innocent?

579
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,286
Even if she didn't
murder him with her own hands,

580
00:36:55,366 --> 00:36:57,953
she still is an aid,
or an accomplice.

581
00:36:58,033 --> 00:37:00,486
After all, she was the one
who erased Park's traces.

582
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:01,566
Oh.

583
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:04,800
So after tainting our reputation,

584
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:08,233
you still have
something to say, do you?

585
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,586
I think it's best

586
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,966
I'm present during the
questioning.

587
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,420
Yes.

588
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,286
As for the date, I'll talk to
the Prosecution Service first

589
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:20,866
and get back to you later.

590
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:22,466
Alright.

591
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
Yeo-reum.

592
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,166
Hey.

593
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:33,866
Are you alright?

594
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,266
You don’t look too good.

595
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,853
How did you know that

596
00:37:40,933 --> 00:37:42,233
Park Su-myung was
present at the scene?

597
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:48,666
You caught on,

598
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,266
but why didn't I?

599
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:57,620
I know I shouldn't be blaming you.

600
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,166
But let's talk later.

601
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:07,200
Yeo-reum!

602
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,733
(Hanguk Hospital)

603
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:11,353
It's acute gastritis
brought on by stress,

604
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:13,420
plus fatigue from
pushing herself too hard.

605
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,786
She'll be fine as soon as
her fever goes down,

606
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:16,066
so don't worry too much.

607
00:38:31,366 --> 00:38:32,466
Apgujeong...

608
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,733
(Kwon Jung-rok)

609
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:35,153
Give me the files.

610
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:37,120
And when's the date for the
Daechi-dong one?

611
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,286
Tomorrow. Here you are.

612
00:38:39,366 --> 00:38:42,400
Your call cannot be
connected at this time...

613
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,500
(Mr. Kwon Jung-rok)

614
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,300
Yes, Mr. Kwon. Are you here?

615
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:06,453
How should I say this?

616
00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:09,066
I don't think I will be
able to see you after all.

617
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:11,500
Oh. Why not?

618
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:15,386
Prosecutor Yu collapsed,

619
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:17,420
and I'm at the ER with her.

620
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,386
What... How?

621
00:39:19,466 --> 00:39:22,420
Apparently it's stomach spasms
and fatigue.

622
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,653
I did call another friend,

623
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:26,186
but even if he does come,

624
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:27,420
I'll have to go see my client

625
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,100
whom I promised to meet.

626
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:33,720
So I won't be able to
see you after all.

627
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,300
I see. I guess it can't be helped.

628
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:37,933
Alright.

629
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:39,900
Bye.

630
00:39:56,233 --> 00:39:57,586
What happened?

631
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:59,566
You collapsed after
bumping into Jung-rok.

632
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,333
You don't remember?

633
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,100
So...

634
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,566
Why are you here?

635
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,733
You're all done with the IV drip.

636
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,653
The doctor said you can go
once you are awake.

637
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:24,253
I said, why are you here?

638
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:25,433
Is that so important to you?

639
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,300
Then what are you doing here
in the first place?

640
00:40:40,533 --> 00:40:42,200
How are you going to survive
with such a fragile mentality?

641
00:40:43,466 --> 00:40:45,186
We have trials every other day.

642
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:46,953
Sometimes we win,
sometimes we lose.

643
00:40:47,033 --> 00:40:49,433
You can't be obsessed about
every little thing!

644
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,966
I'm just like this.
How can I help that?

645
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:01,166
I hate this.

646
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:06,466
I really hate how I'm crumbling

647
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,300
after that one defeat,

648
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,033
and I hate that

649
00:41:15,466 --> 00:41:16,633
you had to see this.

650
00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:19,766
I hate it, too.

651
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,400
That this is how we are now.

652
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:29,866
In the past, you...

653
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
You used to show your honest
feelings only in front of me.

654
00:41:35,433 --> 00:41:37,200
You'd laugh when you want to,

655
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,500
and you'd cry when you want to.

656
00:42:26,533 --> 00:42:28,400
Is he still busy?

657
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:31,300
Still, is one phone call so hard?

658
00:42:33,966 --> 00:42:35,586
Ah, it's him!

659
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:36,700
He's calling!

660
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:40,853
Yes, Mr. Kwon.

661
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,720
Did I wake you up?

662
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,320
No.

663
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,920
Are you on your way home now?

664
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,466
Yes. The meeting went
longer than I expected.

665
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:52,520
I guess you probably had
dinner by now.

666
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,500
How about tea instead, then?

667
00:42:54,733 --> 00:42:55,733
Tea?

668
00:42:56,966 --> 00:42:57,966
Actually...

669
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,220
It's alright.

670
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,386
You're probably tired from
all that happened today,

671
00:43:03,466 --> 00:43:05,086
so get a good rest

672
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,366
and I'll see you tomorrow.

673
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:10,886
By the way, Mr. Kwon.

674
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:12,833
Yes, go on.

675
00:43:14,033 --> 00:43:16,553
Let's not call today
our first day together.

676
00:43:16,633 --> 00:43:18,453
- What?
- Well,

677
00:43:18,533 --> 00:43:21,533
what couple spends their
first day together like this?

678
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,500
So let's...

679
00:43:24,233 --> 00:43:26,133
Let's call it day one,
starting tomorrow.

680
00:43:28,466 --> 00:43:29,786
Alright, then.

681
00:43:29,866 --> 00:43:32,166
It's day one from tomorrow.

682
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:36,453
I'm sorry
I couldn't keep my promise.

683
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,053
It's alright.

684
00:43:38,133 --> 00:43:40,320
Then drive safe,

685
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,666
and I'll see you tomorrow.

686
00:43:43,233 --> 00:43:44,233
Bye.

687
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:50,466
Ha...

688
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:55,400
Well, at least
we talked on the phone.

689
00:44:02,133 --> 00:44:04,100
(Go out with me)

690
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:08,700
Yep, let's really
call it day one tomorrow.

691
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,233
"Go out with me."

692
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,966
What? You want me to
move to Mr. Choi's office?

693
00:44:18,766 --> 00:44:20,286
You see, uh...

694
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,533
Can we ask you to,
just for a few days?

695
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:27,186
You see, the divorce rate goes up

696
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:29,453
around about this time of
the year, after the holidays.

697
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,220
Should I say, it's the
peak season for divorce?

698
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,553
That's why Mr. Choi has
tens of cases to work on,

699
00:44:35,633 --> 00:44:37,186
and unfortunately,

700
00:44:37,266 --> 00:44:40,086
because of that pharmaceutical
company case that

701
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:42,300
Dan is working on,
Ms. Yang has just no time...

702
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,266
But uh...

703
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:49,266
Mr. Kwon may have a hard time
without me.

704
00:44:49,366 --> 00:44:50,420
But now that the
Lim Yun-hee case is over,

705
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,433
there's nothing more
urgent, is there?

706
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,600
No, there's nothing urgent.

707
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,753
It's fine with me.

708
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:02,233
Thank you for your understanding.

709
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,186
You're our ace attorney,

710
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:05,733
so you can manage fine
on your own, right?

711
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:09,320
If that's all you have to say,
please excuse me.

712
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,466
Thanks!

713
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,366
Then please excuse me too.

714
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:21,353
Aw, thanks for your
understanding, everyone.

715
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:23,566
I'm really blessed.

716
00:45:24,033 --> 00:45:25,166
I really am.

717
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,500
Hey, Jun-seok.

718
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:34,520
I separated Kwon and Yoon-seo

719
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,220
like you asked me to.

720
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,466
Thanks, cousin.

721
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,120
I think that lawyer is to blame for

722
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,886
why Yoon-seo refused to
go to work yesterday.

723
00:45:43,966 --> 00:45:45,020
From what I heard from
her manager,

724
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,620
there's been a lot of
conflict between those two.

725
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,253
Apparently, Yoon-seo even said
she'll ruin Kwon Jung-rok

726
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,920
and gladly go to hell.

727
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,753
What, that's how bad it is
between them?

728
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,520
Anyway, it's not too late.

729
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,633
Handle those two...

730
00:45:56,966 --> 00:45:57,886
...separately.

731
00:45:57,966 --> 00:46:00,453
I mean, don't put them together.

732
00:46:00,533 --> 00:46:01,786
Don't you worry.

733
00:46:01,866 --> 00:46:04,620
To guard Yoon-seo's happiness,

734
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,786
I'll make sure they don't even
have a chance to talk.

735
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:10,066
Honey, it's me.

736
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:12,086
Well, uh...

737
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:14,900
I thought maybe
I should come see you for lunch.

738
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:18,833
Oh, I see. You're busy.

739
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:21,586
No, no. I understand.

740
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:22,833
Bye, then.

741
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:26,800
Ms. Dan.

742
00:46:27,433 --> 00:46:29,086
You got a boyfriend?

743
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:30,166
Yes.

744
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:33,366
I did get a boyfriend, but...

745
00:46:34,766 --> 00:46:37,786
Then why the big sigh?

746
00:46:37,866 --> 00:46:39,000
- Well...
- Yes?

747
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,453
Forget it. Don't you remember

748
00:46:43,533 --> 00:46:47,086
how you advised me to
go for it with that delivery guy

749
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:48,920
and so I did, only to receive
the biggest rejection?

750
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,620
That's when I decided,

751
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,986
I'll never, ever come to you for

752
00:46:53,066 --> 00:46:54,233
advice on love.

753
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,900
I am sorry about that one.

754
00:46:57,366 --> 00:46:59,386
But you know, there are way more
couples who managed to work it out

755
00:46:59,466 --> 00:47:01,600
after they took my advice.

756
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,120
And besides, while I was
hosting that show,

757
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,553
there were even couples
who got married

758
00:47:05,633 --> 00:47:08,366
after taking the first steps
like I encouraged them to.

759
00:47:09,233 --> 00:47:10,400
Married...

760
00:47:11,233 --> 00:47:12,766
- Married?
- Yes.

761
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:14,586
This is a secret, but...

762
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:18,120
My boyfriend's actually the owner
of the cafe just across the road.

763
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,686
- Oh.
- As for what he looks like,

764
00:47:19,766 --> 00:47:21,453
He's chic like Americano,

765
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:23,453
but with a velvety smooth voice
like Cafe Latte.

766
00:47:23,533 --> 00:47:26,753
And when he confessed to me
he's had a crush on me,

767
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:29,166
he was sweet as Caramel Macchiato.

768
00:47:31,466 --> 00:47:32,833
That's so romantic!

769
00:47:33,566 --> 00:47:35,720
So why the deep sigh?

770
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,320
The problem is...

771
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,886
I feel like I'm the only one
who likes him.

772
00:47:39,966 --> 00:47:42,920
I mean, I'm ready to put him first

773
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,800
and just be with him all day,

774
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,220
but I guess
it's not the same with him.

775
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,433
Is that so?

776
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,653
See, we were supposed to
go on a date last night.

777
00:47:51,733 --> 00:47:53,953
But then he suddenly says,
the coffee beans just arrived

778
00:47:54,033 --> 00:47:55,853
and he needed to roast them!

779
00:47:55,933 --> 00:47:57,453
So he said he couldn't see me.

780
00:47:57,533 --> 00:48:01,120
And same with just now.
I said I'll drop by during lunch,

781
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,486
and orange...!

782
00:48:02,566 --> 00:48:04,320
He said he needs to
squeeze oranges,

783
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,466
so he's busy.

784
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:07,120
You know,

785
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,753
I understand he's busy,

786
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:10,720
but I feel like I'm being clingy
because he's my first boyfriend.

787
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,053
And I'm sad because I feel like
I'm the only one

788
00:48:13,133 --> 00:48:14,166
who wants to meet up.

789
00:48:16,366 --> 00:48:17,433
Same here.

790
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:20,633
- Pardon?
- Huh?

791
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:23,366
Oh!

792
00:48:24,533 --> 00:48:26,553
What I mean is,
I would feel the same

793
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:29,100
if I were in your shoes.

794
00:48:29,766 --> 00:48:31,733
Yoon-seo...

795
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,066
Is it because you're an actress?
But you're so understanding!

796
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:38,420
For a second, I thought that
you meant you were disappointed

797
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,233
with your new boyfriend as well.

798
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,433
Please, that's just nonsense!

799
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,700
Ms. Oh Jin-shim,
about last night...

800
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,966
Yoon-seo, it's such an honor to
have you to assist me.

801
00:49:15,233 --> 00:49:16,753
Because of my high win rate,

802
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:19,800
clients are flocking to me.

803
00:49:21,933 --> 00:49:24,866
Ah, that's right.
This is my schedule.

804
00:49:25,566 --> 00:49:28,853
Please call the clients and
notify them about their times.

805
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:30,466
Alright.

806
00:49:30,966 --> 00:49:32,566
Huh? Wait a second.

807
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,486
Ms. Hwang Yeon-du here,
who's booked for 2 o'clock...

808
00:49:37,566 --> 00:49:39,820
She's not the Hwang Yeon-du
I know, is she?

809
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:40,820
She probably is.

810
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,586
If you're talking about the
actress who was

811
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:45,466
once your rival.

812
00:49:46,933 --> 00:49:47,966
Oh, that's right!

813
00:49:48,566 --> 00:49:50,586
You working here is
supposed to be a secret!

814
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:53,733
Then how about you just
step out for a while?

815
00:49:54,233 --> 00:49:56,866
Sure, I can do that, but uh...

816
00:49:57,966 --> 00:50:02,066
So... She's getting a divorce?

817
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,620
From how she wants to
consult with me,

818
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,786
probably, yes.

819
00:50:06,866 --> 00:50:08,553
Why? Why's she getting a divorce?

820
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:10,420
Article 26 of the Attorneys-at-Law:

821
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,120
"Any person who is or was
a legal consultant shall not

822
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,753
disclose any confidential matters
that he or she has

823
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:16,353
learned in the course of
performing his or her duties."

824
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:17,433
Oh.

825
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,453
Well...

826
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:21,386
I just don't know what to say.

827
00:50:21,466 --> 00:50:23,500
I thought she had
a happy marriage.

828
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:26,633
Were you two very close?

829
00:50:27,933 --> 00:50:29,033
Close...

830
00:50:30,533 --> 00:50:31,866
Close? Not at all.

831
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:36,566
Ha! We were the biggest enemies.

832
00:50:37,266 --> 00:50:40,300
Ah! Ah! Ah!

833
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:41,833
Oh Yoon-seo!

834
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:45,253
Oh what?

835
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,166
Why do you look so tall today?

836
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,066
How high are those heels?

837
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:51,633
- 7 cm.
- Stylist!

838
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,086
- Yes.
- Bring me a 10 cm.

839
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:57,853
No, a pair of 20 cm!

840
00:50:57,933 --> 00:50:58,933
Alright.

841
00:51:02,233 --> 00:51:04,300
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

842
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:18,166
Director?

843
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,200
Can I have more lighting
than Yoon-seo?

844
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,000
I want twice as more,
no, threefold!

845
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,720
That's how she was like.

846
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,486
She just always had to be better,

847
00:51:41,566 --> 00:51:43,120
and she just always had to
receive better treatment.

848
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,286
From the moment she debuted
and until she retired,

849
00:51:46,366 --> 00:51:48,353
she just bullied me to death!

850
00:51:48,433 --> 00:51:51,686
Man, I've now lost the will to
take on this case.

851
00:51:51,766 --> 00:51:53,920
Should I turn her down, then?

852
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Hmmm?

853
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,953
Oh, no.

854
00:51:58,033 --> 00:51:59,933
This is work,

855
00:52:00,266 --> 00:52:02,520
and you're a professional.

856
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,933
Then, uh...

857
00:52:04,266 --> 00:52:05,920
I'll just be soul-less,

858
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,933
and be like a machine.

859
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,520
Are you here to consult with me?

860
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,200
I understand these are
difficult times for you.

861
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:19,453
Even in Court, too.

862
00:52:19,533 --> 00:52:21,953
I'll defend her like Alpha-Go.

863
00:52:22,033 --> 00:52:23,033
Watch me.

864
00:52:24,566 --> 00:52:27,000
Ms. Hwang Yeon-du is

865
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,686
not at fault,

866
00:52:29,766 --> 00:52:31,633
and not to blame.

867
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,700
Oh.

868
00:52:38,633 --> 00:52:40,053
Oh no, it's 1:30 already.

869
00:52:40,133 --> 00:52:41,220
I'll bump into her at this rate.

870
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,453
We can't have that, no!

871
00:52:42,533 --> 00:52:43,553
You should step out.

872
00:52:43,633 --> 00:52:45,320
I'll call you once we're done.

873
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,353
Please.

874
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:47,433
Alright.

875
00:52:48,433 --> 00:52:49,653
I'm here to meet Mr. Choi.

876
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,120
Do you have an appointment
with him?

877
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,200
Sure.

878
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,720
What... What are you doing?

879
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,920
A former actress I know
is outside!

880
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,853
You know that I can't be busted

881
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:11,366
about working here.

882
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,733
Thank you.

883
00:53:15,533 --> 00:53:17,720
Then, uh... I'll shut the blinds,

884
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,633
so how about
you stay in my office?

885
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,486
Um...

886
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:24,586
Actually, no. She has the
eyes of a hawk,

887
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:26,600
so maybe it's better
I leave the building altogether.

888
00:53:30,733 --> 00:53:31,833
Hello.

889
00:53:32,266 --> 00:53:34,320
I'm Hwang Yeon-du.

890
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,366
Ah, hello. I'm Choi Yun-hyuk.

891
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,166
- Please, have a seat.
- Sure.

892
00:53:40,566 --> 00:53:42,053
My face is basically
my business card,

893
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:43,366
so you don’t need one
from me, right?

894
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Oh my!

895
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,320
I must've left my branded
wallet full of cash and cards

896
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,000
in the restroom!

897
00:53:51,466 --> 00:53:52,620
Please wait right here.

898
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,700
Oh, sure.

899
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,300
Oh Yoon-seo?

900
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,120
I'm not Oh Yoon-seo.

901
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,986
Oh, I must've got the wrong
person. I'm sorry.

902
00:54:10,066 --> 00:54:11,066
Sure.

903
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:18,600
Oh what? What are you doing?

904
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,853
See, you are Oh Yoon-seo!

905
00:54:21,933 --> 00:54:23,053
How dare you!

906
00:54:23,133 --> 00:54:24,600
How dare you lie to me?

907
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,966
So Yoon-seo, what brings you
here at a law firm?

908
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:29,633
Well, uh...

909
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:30,966
Um...

910
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,553
I had to see a lawyer.

911
00:54:34,633 --> 00:54:35,720
Oh my goodness!

912
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,800
Oh my!

913
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,653
So another fight for you
in Court, is it?

914
00:54:39,733 --> 00:54:41,066
My goodness!

915
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:44,800
And you turned the world
upside down only just yesterday!

916
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:46,853
Tsk, tsk, tsk...

917
00:54:46,933 --> 00:54:49,886
I really do pity your
turbulent life.

918
00:54:49,966 --> 00:54:52,453
Maybe you should go
consult with a shaman.

919
00:54:52,533 --> 00:54:54,153
Should I give you
some money for that?

920
00:54:54,233 --> 00:54:55,353
Then what about you?

921
00:54:55,433 --> 00:54:57,153
Why are you here?

922
00:54:57,233 --> 00:54:59,520
Aren't you here to
see a lawyer as well?

923
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,600
Huh?

924
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:05,020
Why would I ever need to
see a lawyer?

925
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,020
As you already know,

926
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,886
I'm being so loved by
my rich husband.

927
00:55:09,966 --> 00:55:11,066
I just...

928
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,320
I just came to take a look around,
because I might buy this building.

929
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,266
That's my recent
interest these days.

930
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:24,200
Oops, sorry. I guess
I was showing off too much!

931
00:55:24,733 --> 00:55:27,120
Anyway. It looks like
you won't ever be coming back

932
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,486
so life must be tough, huh?

933
00:55:29,566 --> 00:55:32,153
And now you're involved in
another lawsuit...

934
00:55:32,233 --> 00:55:34,686
I guess I was too harsh on you

935
00:55:34,766 --> 00:55:37,133
when you just hit
rock bottom, huh?

936
00:55:38,133 --> 00:55:39,133
Here, Yoon-seo.

937
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:42,286
Take care of yourself.

938
00:55:42,366 --> 00:55:45,300
And watch out for the paparazzi.

939
00:55:46,933 --> 00:55:49,286
Oh, maybe they're not so
interested in you anymore?

940
00:55:49,366 --> 00:55:50,366
Hey!

941
00:55:50,933 --> 00:55:51,920
Please.

942
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,086
I think she was born into
this world to bully me.

943
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:57,186
One time, there was this dress

944
00:55:57,266 --> 00:55:58,653
I'd picked out for
an award ceremony.

945
00:55:58,733 --> 00:56:01,700
But she went and
took it for herself!

946
00:56:02,266 --> 00:56:03,286
Then another time,

947
00:56:03,366 --> 00:56:06,486
there was this drama where
I was cast as the heroine,

948
00:56:06,566 --> 00:56:08,120
but she went to the director
and told him that

949
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,686
she can do it better,
and for a lower sum, too!

950
00:56:10,766 --> 00:56:13,220
So in the end, she replaced me!

951
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,353
Ha!

952
00:56:14,433 --> 00:56:17,386
Gosh, that drama incident

953
00:56:17,466 --> 00:56:19,120
still makes me mad.

954
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,120
Mr. Kwon.

955
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:24,086
Can I sue her about that?

956
00:56:24,166 --> 00:56:26,320
No, you can't.

957
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,620
Pardon?

958
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,853
In order for it to be viewed as
obstruction of business,

959
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:32,720
you need to prove there was
spreading of false information.

960
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,020
But Ms. Hwang Yeon-du's
offer of a lower guarantee is

961
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,720
simply a negotiation
with a better deal.

962
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,966
There was no fraudulent
act involved.

963
00:56:45,366 --> 00:56:48,333
Well, you're so logical.

964
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,100
Pardon?

965
00:56:52,966 --> 00:56:55,666
I just wanted my boyfriend to
hear me out, you know.

966
00:56:57,366 --> 00:57:00,866
Just then, I thought I was
talking to my lawyer.

967
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,886
See, because if you told me
someone's bullying you,

968
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:08,853
instead of picking faults
like you did,

969
00:57:08,933 --> 00:57:10,786
I would just take your side!

970
00:57:10,866 --> 00:57:13,733
And I would get mad at him
with you.

971
00:57:15,233 --> 00:57:17,400
But I guess it's not the
case for you.

972
00:57:22,633 --> 00:57:23,833
Well, that's not...

973
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:25,900
Oh, and one more thing!

974
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,800
Actually, no.

975
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,366
I'll get going, then.

976
00:57:56,833 --> 00:58:00,286
And I'm really sorry,

977
00:58:00,366 --> 00:58:02,900
but I'm not going to call today
day one either.

978
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,186
How should I say this?

979
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:26,320
I don't think I will be
able to see you after all.

980
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,253
I guess it can't be helped.

981
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:29,986
Alright, then.

982
00:58:30,066 --> 00:58:33,700
There was disappointment
in her voice, I think.

983
00:58:34,733 --> 00:58:37,353
You want me to
move to Mr. Choi's office?

984
00:58:37,433 --> 00:58:39,233
I've nothing urgent.

985
00:58:39,633 --> 00:58:40,766
It's alright.

986
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,833
She seemed disappointed
back then, too.

987
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:50,786
But that was all for her.

988
00:58:50,866 --> 00:58:53,066
Because it'll be nice to
experience something else.

989
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,200
Does he even like me?

990
00:59:21,566 --> 00:59:22,566
Oh my gosh!

991
00:59:23,566 --> 00:59:24,486
Mr. Kwon?

992
00:59:24,566 --> 00:59:26,020
Why did you...

993
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,866
Your phone was switched off, so...

994
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:30,400
What? It is?

995
00:59:33,433 --> 00:59:35,620
So you came?

996
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,920
To tell me that?

997
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,920
No, that's not the reason.

998
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,233
Let's go on a date.

999
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:41,733
What?

1000
00:59:42,433 --> 00:59:43,600
A date?

1001
00:59:50,633 --> 00:59:51,920
Oh what?

1002
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,286
This is all too sudden.

1003
00:59:53,366 --> 00:59:56,466
I thought we shouldn't postpone it
any more than this.

1004
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,686
And I don't want to, either.

1005
00:59:59,766 --> 01:00:01,700
Let's call it day one today.

1006
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,000
I'd really like that.

1007
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,800
- No?
- Yes, yes!

1008
01:00:14,933 --> 01:00:16,766
Then let's go.

1009
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,266
But where are we going?

1010
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,553
It's my first time
at an observatory!

1011
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:37,520
How did you think of
bringing me here?

1012
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,486
It's late, and there was
nowhere else to go.

1013
01:00:39,566 --> 01:00:42,886
But we can't have our first date
in a 24-hour restaurant.

1014
01:00:42,966 --> 01:00:44,120
It needed to be somewhere special,

1015
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,953
and somewhere not too crowded.

1016
01:00:46,033 --> 01:00:48,020
After narrowing down the list,

1017
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,720
I thought of this place,

1018
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,586
which is open until late.

1019
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:52,820
So, do you like it?

1020
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,253
I love it.

1021
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:55,833
It's the most romantic place!

1022
01:00:58,066 --> 01:01:00,786
We can probably see the stars
much better from there.

1023
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:02,220
Let's go over there.

1024
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:03,300
Hmmm?

1025
01:01:13,966 --> 01:01:15,100
It's a shooting star!

1026
01:01:17,233 --> 01:01:18,233
Did you see that?

1027
01:01:19,366 --> 01:01:20,400
No, I didn't.

1028
01:01:21,566 --> 01:01:22,933
Oh no!

1029
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:26,186
That's why you should've
followed me sooner.

1030
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,833
Why are you so slow?

1031
01:01:32,733 --> 01:01:34,120
Why...

1032
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,653
Why are you looking at me
like that?

1033
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:38,533
I just feel so bad.

1034
01:01:38,766 --> 01:01:40,386
Pardon?

1035
01:01:40,466 --> 01:01:44,153
I'm sorry that I'm slow,

1036
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:46,886
compared to your pace.

1037
01:01:46,966 --> 01:01:49,420
Why are you apologizing about
such a thing?

1038
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:54,486
I was thinking about
today earlier,

1039
01:01:54,566 --> 01:01:56,686
and I guess I was too ignorant.

1040
01:01:56,766 --> 01:01:58,353
My belated confession,

1041
01:01:58,433 --> 01:02:00,620
our first ruined date,

1042
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,500
and me letting you down
over and over again...

1043
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:09,520
I felt bad that

1044
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,333
all this happened because

1045
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:13,733
I'm not so good at
expressing myself.

1046
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,986
I'm a slow person,

1047
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:21,766
and you might find me
too slow for you pace.

1048
01:02:23,133 --> 01:02:26,220
But still, let me take my steps

1049
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,366
at my own pace.

1050
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,200
Slowly, but continuously.

1051
01:02:52,633 --> 01:02:54,733
Um, Mr. Kwon?

1052
01:02:56,566 --> 01:02:59,633
May I ask you something?

1053
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,600
Do you like me?

1054
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,500
Pardon?

1055
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:20,586
Actually, no.

1056
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:23,466
Pretend you didn't hear that.

1057
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,133
I do like you,

1058
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,033
Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

1059
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:53,533
I like you,

1060
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:55,666
a lot.

1061
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:22,533
(Thank you to Hwang Bo-ra, for
her special cameo appearance)

1062
01:04:56,966 --> 01:04:58,833
(Touch Your Heart)

1063
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:01,986
You'll probably have a lot of
rivals if it's Ms. Oh Yoon-seo,

1064
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:03,520
so get it right
if you don't want to lose her.

1065
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,953
Just go back to work.

1066
01:05:05,033 --> 01:05:07,653
So... Is it jealousy I sense?

1067
01:05:07,733 --> 01:05:08,586
No way.

1068
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:10,620
Yoon-seo was so popular!

1069
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,453
Just turn on the TV,
and she'll be on!

1070
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:15,200
A goddess is a goddess, alright.

1071
01:05:16,766 --> 01:05:18,486
It's because we're graced
by your presence.

1072
01:05:18,566 --> 01:05:21,200
What kind of guys do you think
Yoon-seo would date?

1073
01:05:21,566 --> 01:05:23,133
If there's one thing I'm sure
about, it's not Kwon.

1074
01:05:24,666 --> 01:05:27,820
I wish it was me
who was making you smile.

1075
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:31,620
Mr. Kwon,

1076
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,200
may I kiss you?

1077
01:05:34,033 --> 01:05:35,033
What, now?
