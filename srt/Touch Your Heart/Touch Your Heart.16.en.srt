(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,933
(Final Episode)

3
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,800
Mr. Kwon.

4
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,286
What are you doing?

5
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,253
Well, you always make
breakfast for me,

6
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,153
so today, I wanted to
do the same for you.

7
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,320
Hence this French toast.

8
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,900
Wow, that looks delicious.

9
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:27,020
How did you know where to
find the ingredients?

10
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,520
I just took a look in the fridge
and used what's in there.

11
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,053
But that shouldn't become
a problem, legally.

12
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:36,320
Article 329 of the Criminal Act:
A person who steals another's

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,786
property shall be punished by
imprisonment for not more than

14
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:39,920
six years, or by a fine
not exceeding 10,000 dollars.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,466
But you're not just someone else.

16
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:44,886
Right.

17
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:48,386
We're a couple,
so there's no problem.

18
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:51,033
- So, would you like to try one?
- Sure.

19
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,120
Thank goodness.

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,253
If you were a good cook too,

21
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,766
you would've been too perfect and
that would've been too much.

22
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,953
- You don’t have to force yourself.
- Please,

23
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:07,600
I'm just kidding.

24
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,366
Mmm, it's really good.

25
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:12,386
You have one too, Mr. Kwon.

26
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,466
Say ah!

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,900
Goodness, what was that?

28
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:28,420
Eh?

29
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,686
You're only back now?

30
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:32,533
I thought you were out
playing soccer with your club.

31
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,186
You worked all night?

32
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:36,266
Um…

33
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,233
Wait.

34
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:42,053
Hello?

35
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:44,653
Yes, the warrant review is
tomorrow.

36
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,786
You need to be there by
11 a.m. Yes, yes.

37
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:52,100
Right. It's tough. I know.

38
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:55,300
I know.

39
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,820
It's been more than a month
since he broke up with Yoon-seo,

40
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,933
and I guess
it's still hard for him.

41
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:05,320
Because he can't stop
thinking about her,

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,986
he'd been overworking himself,
trying to forget her.

43
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,020
And finally yesterday,
he spent the night in the office.

44
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,100
Really?

45
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,153
And recently, he even joined
a morning soccer club.

46
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:18,686
What about the soccer club?

47
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:22,920
When guys break up, they look for
something to take their mind off.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,153
I think Jung-rok's also trying to
exhaust himself physically by

49
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:27,386
working out and sweating.

50
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:29,400
But it's so pitiful to watch.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,420
And is it because he feels
emptiness in his heart?

52
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,020
His appetite's increased, too.

53
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,453
One time, he even bought two packs
of sushi for himself.

54
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:38,700
It's that bad?

55
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:42,786
I hope he moves on, soon.

56
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:43,966
That's not good.

57
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:46,166
I'm worried, too.

58
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:49,653
I was so shocked, you know.

59
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:52,686
Who knew such a good-looking
couple will be born from our firm?

60
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,220
Don't you think
they look so great together?

61
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,120
Yes, yes. Thank you for
your compliments.

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,686
I also think Ms. Dan and I
make a fine…

63
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:04,653
No, I meant Mr. Kwon
and Yoon-seo.

64
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:06,900
I was referring to those two.

65
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:11,300
Why did they have to come out
at the same time?

66
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,020
This is what I think,
to be honest.

67
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,186
We're equally good-looking
as they are,

68
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:20,620
but in terms of popularity, we…

69
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,800
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

70
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,053
- Good morning.
- Oh my,

71
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:27,420
did you burn your hand after
picking up that meat

72
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,520
from the grill with
your bare hands?

73
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,953
Oh, this? It's not that serious.

74
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:33,220
I went to the hospital last night
because it stung bad,

75
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,320
and they told me
it's a minor burn.

76
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,186
I'll be alright in a few days
with some ointment.

77
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:40,586
But you must've been so shocked to
do what you did.

78
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,220
I was shocked, yes.

79
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,466
Why wouldn't I be?

80
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,386
To me, Yoon-seo was
literally like a star to me.

81
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:53,066
An existence so far away,
just like those stars in the sky.

82
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:55,186
So I'd never imagined that

83
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:59,020
she'd date an ordinary guy.

84
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,753
I actually find that admirable.

85
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,020
It's like she's down to earth.

86
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,720
Sure, that's nice. Yes.

87
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,186
But then why couldn't she have
picked me instead?

88
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,733
Now that would really make her
look down to earth.

89
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:15,686
So why do you think she chose
Kwon over me?

90
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:18,520
Let's be honest, there's not a lot
where Kwon's better than me.

91
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Don't you agree?

92
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:20,986
So I was thinking,

93
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:22,486
it would be less painful for me

94
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:24,866
if I could have a reason
that's convincing.

95
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,053
So tell me a reason why she chose
Kwon, and not me.

96
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:31,453
I understand it might be hard,
very hard in fact,

97
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:34,186
but if you can think of
even the tiniest reason,

98
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:36,653
can you please tell me?

99
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,086
Though it may be
very, very hard to find one?

100
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,520
Looks, age, figure,
and appearance.

101
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,820
Oh, that's right.

102
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,453
Didn't you say you had a debt of
at least 700 grand?

103
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:47,620
Then include wealth on the list,

104
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,086
because I'm sure Kwon at least

105
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,566
isn't in debt.

106
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:01,800
Um… What time's
my first client coming in?

107
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,066
Hey, it's the boyfriend of
a celebrity!

108
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,033
Ah, Kwon.
Can I see you for a minute?

109
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,033
Sure.

110
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:14,953
Kwon, did you submit
your opinions on that

111
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:16,786
new case I assigned to you?

112
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:19,766
Yes, I already finished it
and submitted it to the court.

113
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:21,653
Are you sure?

114
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:24,386
Even your opinions on
the evidence?

115
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:26,920
- What?
- I mean,

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,100
you're so good at
deceiving people, right?

117
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:33,486
For example, you'd been pretending
that you and Yoon-seo are nothing,

118
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:35,520
but suddenly you say
you're actually dating!

119
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,066
How can you be so sly?

120
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:41,600
Ms. Oh Jin-sim is a public figure,
so I couldn't help it.

121
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:49,200
I just got here. Miss you already.

122
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,833
You're smiling.

123
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,966
It must be Yoon-seo, then.

124
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,953
So, what did she say for you to
smile like that?

125
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:58,420
- It's nothing.
- How's it nothing?

126
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,120
This is why I said you're sly,

127
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,186
because you're always
lying like this, you liar!

128
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:04,186
Fine.

129
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:06,300
She said she misses me.

130
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:12,066
And?

131
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,920
And… What are you going to
reply her?

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,220
I don't know why I should
tell you this,

133
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,653
but I'm planning to reply her that
I miss her more.

134
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:20,653
Here.

135
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:27,366
"I miss you even more."
Heart, heart.

136
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:29,600
Heart, heart…?

137
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:33,186
Kwon, are you really the
Kwon I know?

138
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:34,986
Why do I find you so unfamiliar?

139
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:37,753
I know this is all new to you,

140
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,520
but now that you know about us,

141
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,586
I plan on expressing
all my love for her,

142
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,486
instead of being "sly,"
like you said.

143
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:44,566
Right.

144
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,520
I also agree that you should

145
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,700
express your honest feelings
in any relationship.

146
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,420
Kwon, is it because my legs are
longer than most people?

147
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,020
But this sofa table is bugging me.

148
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,620
It's just too close.

149
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,086
Can you move it a bit to
that side for me?

150
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,033
I'd do it myself,
but my hand's like this.

151
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Sure.

152
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,900
Jeez, thanks.

153
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:10,633
A little more.

154
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:15,086
Actually, there's too much of
a space here now.

155
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,733
Move it back to where it was.

156
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,600
A little more.

157
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,633
A little more to this side,
that's where it was.

158
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,453
Now this sofa…
This is actually quite light.

159
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:26,520
I was planning to
move it over there,

160
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,053
so while you're up,
can you move it for me?

161
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:31,486
Mr. Yeon, why are you
doing this to me?

162
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:33,053
Why, what did I do?

163
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:34,186
Why?

164
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:35,386
Is it because
you got dust on your hands?

165
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:37,186
Or did a little moving
hurt your shoulders?

166
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,386
Fine, alright. Fine!

167
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,033
Wipe your hands, and have a seat.

168
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,020
Ouch… Owww!

169
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,020
Ugh, Mr. Yeon!

170
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,220
I'm just giving you a massage.

171
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,186
If you move, you'll get hurt.

172
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:51,000
Look, my hand's all better!

173
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:57,653
Let's set Jung-rok up
on a blind date.

174
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:59,453
What? A blind date?

175
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:00,986
They say new love is the cure for

176
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:03,386
a broken heart.

177
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:05,220
Though it's kind of cliched,

178
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,153
it's also the truth.

179
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:08,266
Still…

180
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:13,686
Do you think he'll even be
ready to see anyone now?

181
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,120
Exactly.

182
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,986
We need to call him out without
telling him it's a blind date.

183
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,066
What?

184
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,786
No, that's a bit…

185
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:24,253
You said Jung-rok's been
taking it really badly.

186
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,820
With a personality like that,
unless someone steps up to help,

187
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,553
he'll just continue to
have a hard time.

188
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:32,166
I had a look around me, and
I know this really nice girl.

189
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:37,066
Coffee?

190
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,066
Why, all of a sudden?

191
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:41,520
Sure, alright.

192
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Bye.

193
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,766
(Princess Oh Jin-sim)

194
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,686
Yes, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

195
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:56,353
What are you up to, Mr. Kwon?

196
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:58,453
I was working.

197
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,453
Same here.

198
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,920
I think I'll be done early.

199
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,253
What shall we do tonight?

200
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,653
Oh.

201
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:06,653
Uh…

202
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:08,586
I actually need to see someone.

203
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,853
Se-won invited me out for coffee.

204
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,220
What? Coffee?

205
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,286
But you see each other
day and night. So why?

206
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,086
Yes, so I asked him why myself,

207
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,553
and he said he's just bored.

208
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,766
Oh, he's bored?

209
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:28,120
Then should I join you?

210
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,920
- What?
- Well,

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,453
it's a little suffocating
only seeing you at home,

212
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,353
and I wanted to see
Prosecutor Kim in a long while.

213
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:40,720
Besides, if it's the three of us,

214
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
I don't think anyone will
suspect anything.

215
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:44,966
Shall we do that, then?

216
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:50,620
Hey, Se-won. I'm here.

217
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,853
When are you coming?

218
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,220
I won't be there, to be honest.

219
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,420
I set you up on a blind date.

220
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,420
What? Blind date?

221
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,086
I already gave your photo to
your date,

222
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,186
so she should recognize you.

223
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:04,720
I wish you happiness, my friend.

224
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,133
- Have a great time, then.
- Hey, hey! You…

225
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,153
Hello?

226
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,600
Mr. Kwon Jung-rok?

227
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:13,433
Yes?

228
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:19,633
Your photo doesn't do you justice.

229
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:24,053
Um, this situation is a bit…

230
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:27,653
Yeo-reum told me to
just go and meet you,

231
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,786
so she had me in a panic, but…

232
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:32,553
I didn't expect to see someone
so fine like you here.

233
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,986
I'm glad I came on
this blind date.

234
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:36,400
What do you mean, blind date?

235
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:40,966
Well, uh… What happened is…

236
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:46,020
I'm sorry,

237
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,566
but this guy is mine.

238
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,800
Then please excuse us.

239
00:11:58,833 --> 00:11:59,833
Really?

240
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:02,053
Some woman who looks like
Oh Yoon-seo came and

241
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:03,620
took Jung-rok away?

242
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,120
Then do you think
they got back together?

243
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,653
Looks like we made
a big mistake, huh?

244
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:12,766
Yes.

245
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,433
I hope they don't have
a huge fight because of us.

246
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,786
I honestly didn't know

247
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:22,720
they'd set me up on a blind date.

248
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,553
If I'd known, I wouldn't have
invited you there, too!

249
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:28,020
Yes, I'm sorry I didn't tell
Se-won yet that

250
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,886
we got back together,

251
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:32,966
but I was planning to
tell him that today.

252
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,386
I'm really, really angry.

253
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,920
Because you're so…

254
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,186
…so perfect!

255
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:42,966
I'm sorry I'm so perfect.

256
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:45,753
Huh? What do you…

257
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,120
You heard her, right?

258
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,420
She said the photo
doesn't do you justice.

259
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,320
She probably came today because
she liked your picture,

260
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,186
and now she says your photo
doesn't do you justice!

261
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:57,020
That makes me so anxious,

262
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,920
because what if you continue to
steal other women's hearts

263
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,200
with that good-looking
face of yours?

264
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,866
Steal hearts? What do you…

265
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,520
Why do you have to be so tall?

266
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,833
And why do you have to be so
unnecessarily handsome?

267
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,353
It's not like you want to be
a celebrity.

268
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:15,720
What a waste of
good looks and height.

269
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,166
Really, what a waste!

270
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:21,033
That's why you're mad?

271
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:23,133
Yes!

272
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,853
Or… Should I have another
reason to be mad?

273
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,986
No, uh… I thought you were mad
because of the blind date.

274
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:32,866
Oh, like that's anything.

275
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:37,466
Like you said, you had
no idea, right?

276
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:42,533
What are we going to do if
we can't even trust each other?

277
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:45,266
This is making me real happy.

278
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:49,220
- Pardon?
- I'm the one

279
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,320
who should be anxious,
because you're so amazing.

280
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,153
Today, Mr. Yeon bullied me a lot

281
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,886
just because I was dating you.

282
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:57,320
Really? He bullied you?

283
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,853
Yes, so I'm starting to fear
for my future.

284
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:02,620
From now on, any man
who knows about us will

285
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,053
hate me to death.

286
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:07,033
What if I become the most
hated man in Korea?

287
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,153
So Ms. Oh, it should be me
who's anxious,

288
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,533
not you.

289
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:18,700
Thank you.

290
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:21,953
For what?

291
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:24,353
I feel like from now on,

292
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:26,020
we can overcome

293
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,733
what may come our way.

294
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,800
(Recording Team)

295
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:45,120
What? We'll be going abroad
earlier than expected?

296
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,053
What do you mean?
There's still two weeks to go.

297
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:52,420
Well, the drama's to air earlier
than expected, right?

298
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,820
- Yes.
- So,

299
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,686
I think that's why everything's
been put forward.

300
00:14:56,766 --> 00:15:00,020
Oh no…

301
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,953
But Yoon-seo, I still have
some good news.

302
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:05,586
We were meant to be away for
3 months initially, right?

303
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,153
But because we now have
a tight deadline to meet,

304
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:09,086
they can't afford to spend
too much time abroad.

305
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,753
So they want to go for
a hardcore one-month instead.

306
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,920
One month is still too long.

307
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,220
Right, it's long.

308
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,766
So when do we leave?

309
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,300
Your flight's tomorrow morning.

310
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:23,286
What?

311
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:24,666
Tomorrow morning?

312
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:27,253
What?

313
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,100
Your flight's at 10 a.m. tomorrow?

314
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,120
But that means
we have just 20 hours left.

315
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,853
I'll go and ask for
an early leave today.

316
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:38,386
We'll have to be apart for
a whole month,

317
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:40,766
so let's try to make the best of
our 20 hours together.

318
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,986
Mr. Yeon, I'd like
this afternoon off, please.

319
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,520
- Please say yes.
- Oh what?

320
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,853
You're all ready to go,
so why do you even ask?

321
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:57,920
I'll take that as a yes, then.

322
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,753
You never ask for an early leave,

323
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,186
so what could be so urg…

324
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:02,366
Wait right there, Kwon!

325
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:06,086
Don't tell me, are you off to
see Yoon-seo?

326
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,600
Yes, I am.

327
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,953
You can't have the
afternoon off.

328
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,753
I can't allow it.

329
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:15,153
What… Why can't you allow it,
all of a sudden?

330
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:16,933
Because I can't stand
watching you two…!

331
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:21,853
I mean, how many cases
are you currently on, huh?

332
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:23,786
I don't care if you're off to
see Yoon-seo.

333
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,886
I'm not doing this to you
because I'm jealous,

334
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:28,120
but because work is priority!

335
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,620
I can't stand watching
people slack off.

336
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,620
So don't go, Kwon.

337
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,620
You won’t have to worry about me
slacking off.

338
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,286
Most of my work's done,

339
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:36,753
and if there's anything
I've missed,

340
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,253
I'll make sure it's all done,

341
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,733
even if it means many all-nighters
starting tomorrow.

342
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,420
Fine.

343
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,566
Go. Just go!

344
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,553
Go! Tsk, you've become
one of those male leads in

345
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:55,786
rom-coms, now that you're dating
an actress, huh?

346
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:56,866
You may go.

347
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,720
But don’t rush, and
have a safe drive…

348
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Where did he go?

349
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,120
- Yes, one minute.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

350
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Mr. Kwon.

351
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:09,620
I just had a call from
Mr. Kwon Min-jun's family,

352
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,453
your client.

353
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:14,366
Apparently, the police just
arrested him.

354
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,320
Then tell them I'll be on my way,

355
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,520
but until I'm there,
tell him to remain silent.

356
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,833
Alright, I'll do that.

357
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:31,966
Oh, really?

358
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:34,886
I guess it can't be helped.

359
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:36,633
Alright, Mr. Kwon.

360
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,333
Bye.

361
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:40,753
What? What is it?

362
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,200
He can't see you, because of work?

363
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:45,553
No. His client's been arrested,

364
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:47,566
so he needs to go
and sort that out.

365
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,633
The time we have
left together now is…

366
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,220
…just 19 hours. Gosh…

367
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,333
That's too bad.

368
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm sad that the time we have
left together's running out,

369
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:07,320
and I also feel bad when I think
about how Mr. Kwon will have to

370
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,766
deal with all that
without a secretary…

371
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,100
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

372
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,453
So… Did you meet with your client?

373
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:26,100
Yes, I did see him.

374
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,353
I'd like some help
putting everything together.

375
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:31,153
Mr. Kim, would you be free?

376
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:32,900
Well, uh…

377
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:37,720
Today there's another secretary
who's here to help you.

378
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,186
- What?
- Your one-day secretary is

379
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:41,486
waiting for you in your office.

380
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:43,633
One-day secretary?

381
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:45,933
Yes.

382
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,786
Welcome back, Mr. Kwon.

383
00:18:58,866 --> 00:18:59,933
Ms. Oh Jin-sim!

384
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:02,686
Why are you…

385
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,066
Why else? I'm here to see you.

386
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:08,120
We now just have…

387
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,920
…18 hours left together.

388
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,753
Each second is precious

389
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,320
and we can't afford to waste it.

390
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,520
So I thought, why not return to
being your secretary

391
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,653
just for today, so I can be with
you while helping you out?

392
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:22,733
Sure.

393
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,020
So… Where should I start?

394
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,320
Order away!

395
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,020
I guess you forgot because
it's been a while,

396
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,266
but that's my seat.

397
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,153
You should really be resting
since you're leaving tomorrow.

398
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:43,186
I'm really sorry to
give you so much work.

399
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,766
Don't say that.
It's absolutely fine with me.

400
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:53,853
Let me go and
see my client briefly.

401
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:56,920
Alright, I'll have this finished
by the time you're back.

402
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Alright.

403
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,933
My charger…

404
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,353
Charger…

405
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:03,866
Oh, hold on.

406
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
Here.

407
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,320
How's this? It's just like me,

408
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,620
who recharges you
at any time and place, huh?

409
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,820
Yes, this is amazing.

410
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,020
Let me recharge you then.

411
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
Thanks.

412
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,386
Jung-rok really didn't say
anything about the blind date?

413
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:31,353
I was a little scared myself,

414
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:33,920
expecting to
blow his head off at me.

415
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,933
But he didn't say much about it.

416
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:39,566
I thought he was going to
tell me to get out again.

417
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,186
He uses the fact that
it's his place I'm staying at

418
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,533
to his advantage sometimes.

419
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,453
Then just move out.

420
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:52,353
It's alright.

421
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:55,020
The case I'm on is
quite a headache,

422
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,520
so I won't have time to
look for a new place.

423
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,920
And I can't go back home now, so…

424
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,686
Anyway, until I clear all the
urgent matters,

425
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:05,020
I'll just leech off him
a little longer.

426
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,666
What are friends for, right?

427
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,553
Still, it pains me to
see you like this.

428
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:14,220
It sounds like he's only
feeding you cold rice.

429
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,786
Have warm rice, if you can.

430
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:18,386
There's plenty at my place.

431
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:21,633
I see, so there's plenty of
rice at your place.

432
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,886
Wait a second.

433
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:28,986
You mean…

434
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:30,820
If you didn't get it, it's fine.

435
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,020
No, I got you.

436
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,553
You just asked me to
move in with you, right?

437
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:37,986
Well…

438
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:40,220
You told me to take responsibility

439
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,100
now that you can't go home
because of me.

440
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:45,886
You're really amazing!

441
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:48,486
I love women
with a sense of responsibility.

442
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:50,753
Oh what? What's with you?

443
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm really happy.

444
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,020
You look like you can
die from happiness now.

445
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,186
Yes, we're that happy.

446
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:08,186
But we don't plan on
dying just yet.

447
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:12,566
We plan to enjoy a long,
happy life together.

448
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:23,720
He's been a bit quiet these days

449
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,920
after he got done by Jung-rok
on that Lim Yun-hee case.

450
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,900
Well, I'm glad to hear that!

451
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:32,886
I'm really moving into
your place then, alright?

452
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:34,153
Alright.

453
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:37,353
After you're done with that case,
move into my place.

454
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:38,466
Okay!

455
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:43,086
Yes, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

456
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,020
The meeting went well.

457
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,420
I'm thinking of getting a sandwich
in case you're hungry.

458
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,666
What would you like?

459
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:50,366
Alright.

460
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:52,053
Oh, one moment.

461
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:54,686
Can I get a shrimp sandwich
with avocado?

462
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:55,766
Thanks.

463
00:22:56,933 --> 00:22:57,933
Yes.

464
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,700
Yes, I miss you, too.

465
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:06,666
I'll be there ASAP.

466
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:13,353
I should be the one getting these
as your secretary…

467
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,466
I'm sorry.

468
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:19,333
Mmm, it's so good!

469
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,233
I can tell by the look
on your face already.

470
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:24,653
What about it?

471
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:26,986
Anyway, thanks for the sandwich.

472
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:29,686
So, how long do you plan on
keeping this up?

473
00:23:29,766 --> 00:23:32,420
- This secretary role-play.
- What, role-play?

474
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,053
I'm working so hard here!

475
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:36,953
That's not what I meant…

476
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:39,153
Give it. I'm confiscating
your sandwich.

477
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:40,420
But I'm the one who got them.

478
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,533
Oh what? Yours is nicer.

479
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,233
Fine. You're being so greedy.

480
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,620
I completed my opinions thanks to

481
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,120
the data you put together for me,
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

482
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,120
Now I just need to take this

483
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,153
for the warrant review tomorrow.

484
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,686
Good work.

485
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:05,666
Good work to you too, Mr. Kwon.

486
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:08,520
We finished it much earlier
than we expected to.

487
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,100
Yes. So should we now
go on a date?

488
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:16,186
It's 8 p.m. now,
so we have exactly 14 hours

489
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:19,020
until 10 a.m. tomorrow.

490
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,886
Alright, then let's really
enjoy ourselves for

491
00:24:20,966 --> 00:24:23,200
the next 14 hours.

492
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,966
Please excuse me.

493
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,200
Ugh…

494
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:32,266
Yes, Hyuk-jun.

495
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,633
What?

496
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:38,433
An online live stream show?

497
00:24:39,966 --> 00:24:42,266
What? 10 p.m., tonight?

498
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:48,020
What… Why are you so spontaneous
with accepting work?

499
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,386
I wasn't being spontaneous,

500
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:53,300
it's been arranged a long time back
but I'd forgotten about it.

501
00:24:54,266 --> 00:24:56,353
Yoon-seo, I'm really sorry,

502
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:58,553
but we need to get going now.

503
00:24:58,633 --> 00:24:59,666
What, now…?

504
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:03,800
Alright.

505
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:07,653
What do I do, Mr. Kwon?

506
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:09,586
I hate this.

507
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:12,600
I have work,
so I need to get going…

508
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,420
This is a live show,

509
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,186
and I can't not do it because
I promised my fans…

510
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:21,653
I understand. You need to
keep your promise.

511
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:23,266
Then let's get ready to go.

512
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,653
There's just 12 hours left,

513
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:38,866
and I'm missing her terribly.

514
00:25:46,966 --> 00:25:48,533
(tvM Live Talk)

515
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:53,286
Hello, I'm Oh Yoon-seo.

516
00:25:53,366 --> 00:25:55,320
With my new drama,
"Love Is Bound to Hurt,"

517
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,820
scheduled to air soon
after my long hiatus,

518
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,620
I wanted to sit down for
a casual chat with you,

519
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,853
so here I am now.

520
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:04,333
Welcome everyone!

521
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,186
Then, please send me
your questions,

522
00:26:10,266 --> 00:26:12,653
they can be about the drama
or about me.

523
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:14,686
Alright!

524
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:18,020
"Twinkle Twinkle
Little Yoon-seo" just asked me,

525
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,620
"When do you leave for
your overseas shooting?"

526
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,020
Well, to be honest, everything's
been put forward and

527
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,066
I'm actually leaving tomorrow.

528
00:26:30,233 --> 00:26:32,920
Yes, I know. I'm sorry, too.

529
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,033
Me, too.

530
00:26:35,366 --> 00:26:36,253
Alright.

531
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:39,753
I'll take the advice from
"Gave My Heart to Yoon-seo,"

532
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:44,086
and make sure to take
a first-aid kit with me.

533
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,620
"Gave My Heart to Yoon-seo?"

534
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,620
Then now…

535
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,920
Don't tell me that's
Mr. Yeon Jun-gyu.

536
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,653
…we're going to have
a quiz session.

537
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:55,386
If you're the first one to
get it right,

538
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:59,086
I, Oh Yoon-seo, will
personally call you.

539
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,953
Alright, here it goes!

540
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:05,853
What's "Love Is
Bound to Hurt" about?

541
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:07,886
"Love Is Bound to Hurt" is
a new romantic comedy by tvM,

542
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:09,986
telling the story of
an M&A corporate lawyer

543
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:11,420
who falls in love with
a judicial officer

544
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,453
while on vacation in the
Middle East.

545
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:14,786
Directed by Han Sang-cheol,

546
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,620
written by Lee Se-jin,

547
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,786
and featuring Oh Yoon-seo
and Moon Ji-hoo,

548
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:20,853
the first episode will air at
9 p.m. on May 22nd.

549
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:21,966
Make sure to tune in!

550
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:27,633
Wow, we just had someone
tell us about it in great detail,

551
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:32,233
and at such lightning speed, too.

552
00:27:32,866 --> 00:27:35,186
- Mr. Bangbae-dong Hedgehog.
- Yes!

553
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:36,386
Mr. Bangbae-dong Hedgehog,

554
00:27:36,466 --> 00:27:38,486
- If you'll leave your number…
- That's me, yes!

555
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:39,953
…through a private chat,

556
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,786
then one of our staff will
call you right away.

557
00:27:42,866 --> 00:27:43,866
Alright.

558
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:47,400
Are you ready?

559
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:52,120
Alright, here we go.

560
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,333
Hello?

561
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:56,486
Yes, hello.

562
00:27:56,566 --> 00:27:58,686
Hello, Mr. Bangbae-dong Hedgehog.

563
00:27:58,766 --> 00:28:00,686
Could I ask you to
introduce yourself?

564
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:04,686
I'm a bit shy about
revealing my real name,

565
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,586
but my nickname's hedgehog,
just like my ID.

566
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:10,520
And I live in Bangbae-dong,
and I'm a lawyer.

567
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,800
So Mr. Hedgehog,
you live in Bangbae-dong, and…

568
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,120
…you're a lawyer.

569
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,886
Yes, and I'm your great fan.

570
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:25,186
It just so happens that
my girlfriend will be

571
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:27,986
going away somewhere far for
a month, too.

572
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:31,120
She's going away for
something she always

573
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,920
wanted to do,

574
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,986
so I'd like to take
this chance to tell her,

575
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:39,886
have a great trip and
take care of yourself,

576
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:41,853
because I'll be waiting
right here for her.

577
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:43,986
I see.

578
00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:47,786
I'm sure your girlfriend will know

579
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:51,320
exactly how you feel,
Mr. Bangbae-dong Hedgehog.

580
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,866
Thank you. And good luck
on your trip too, Ms. Oh.

581
00:28:57,366 --> 00:29:00,700
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo,
the cosmic goddess!

582
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:04,286
I love you.

583
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:06,820
Yes, me too.

584
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,100
I love you.

585
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:12,053
Oh, and all my fans, too.

586
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:13,266
I love you all.

587
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:15,700
(Even her heart is so pretty
She's so pretty)

588
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,720
Yes, Mr. Kwon.

589
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,933
I just got back from shooting.

590
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,253
I'm about to take a shower
and go to bed.

591
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,420
Good work today.

592
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,920
As for me, I'm getting
ready to go to work.

593
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,486
Think of me heaps today,
as always.

594
00:29:39,566 --> 00:29:40,786
Um…

595
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:44,133
That might hold up work.

596
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:47,086
Does the food suit your palate?

597
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:49,053
You're not too tired from
filming all day?

598
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:52,020
Everything's delicious here,

599
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,753
and yes, I'm a bit tired.

600
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,053
But you're like my vitamin,

601
00:29:55,133 --> 00:29:58,286
and a phone call from you
takes all that stress away,

602
00:29:58,366 --> 00:29:59,753
so I'm fine.

603
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,320
You're off to the Middle East
tomorrow, right?

604
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,553
- Yes.
- When you're in the Middle East,

605
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:06,320
you need to learn
this phrase in Arabic.

606
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,720
Sure, what is it?

607
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,320
Alright, repeat after me.

608
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,266
- Ladaya sadiq.
- Ladaya sadiq.

609
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,453
What does it mean?

610
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:20,220
It means, "I have a boyfriend."

611
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,520
So even if those oil giants
try to approach you,

612
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,100
use that phrase I taught you to
ward them off.

613
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:35,900
Ms. Oh Jin-sim!

614
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:39,033
I'm at the Court right now.

615
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:43,120
The Court. Do you see it?

616
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,553
Yes, I do.

617
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:47,320
By the way, the case
I was working on…

618
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,353
I won the trial!

619
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:49,353
What's that guy doing?

620
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:52,186
Remember how all the
other firms had refused it,

621
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:54,986
but I accepted it because
the client begged me to?

622
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:57,953
Well, not only did I score
a major win,

623
00:30:58,033 --> 00:31:00,386
the judge referenced my statement

624
00:31:00,466 --> 00:31:03,000
without even changing
a single word!

625
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:05,953
Isn't that amazing?

626
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:08,133
Ah, yes. Thanks.

627
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:46,866
Is that everything?

628
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,720
Yes.

629
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,153
I came like this, remember?

630
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:53,086
Yeo-reum's going to have
a hard time now.

631
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:54,433
She has to put up with you.

632
00:31:55,566 --> 00:31:57,420
Well, thanks for
everything so far.

633
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,953
I'm only temporarily
staying at Yeo-reum's place,

634
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:00,320
until I finally have time to

635
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,786
get my own place.

636
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:03,853
I'll invite you over for
a housewarming party then.

637
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:05,053
Whatever.

638
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,886
Don't start crying because
you're lonely.

639
00:32:07,966 --> 00:32:09,000
Get lost.

640
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,833
I'm off.

641
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,020
No need to see me off,
Yeo-reum should be there.

642
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,920
I'm going out to
say hello to Yeo-reum.

643
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Alright.

644
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:29,153
Oh, you were home, Jung-rok.

645
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:30,153
Yeah.

646
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:31,420
I wanted to get some rest
on the weekend.

647
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,633
Right, you should.

648
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,886
Is that all?

649
00:32:35,966 --> 00:32:37,453
Don't you know that minimalism
is trending these days?

650
00:32:37,533 --> 00:32:39,866
Sure, just put it in the trunk.

651
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,620
Good luck to you now,
from now on.

652
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,766
Thanks. It must've been
hard for you.

653
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:51,133
Go back in.

654
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,686
I'm about to tear up.

655
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,720
Go ahead, then.

656
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,320
- And have a safe drive.
- Alright.

657
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,820
We'll get going, then. See you.

658
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,900
Bye!

659
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:04,166
See you!

660
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,900
I hope Ms. Oh Jin-sim
comes back soon…

661
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,900
There's still 5 days to go.

662
00:34:03,066 --> 00:34:05,420
Yes, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

663
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,153
I was just writing
my defense statement.

664
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:09,253
It's morning there, is it?

665
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,700
Did you have a good sleep?
Did you have a good dream?

666
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:15,286
Oh…

667
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:17,786
But why do you sound so down?

668
00:34:17,866 --> 00:34:19,520
Is something wrong?

669
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,386
Um… Mr. Kwon,
please don't get me wrong.

670
00:34:24,466 --> 00:34:25,586
What do you mean?

671
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:28,820
Well, there's this article
that was out today,

672
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,820
and even I don't know what to say.

673
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,186
But I was worried about that you
might misunderstand me,

674
00:34:34,266 --> 00:34:36,366
but it's really not, alright?

675
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:39,486
I'm really sorry, Mr. Kwon,

676
00:34:39,566 --> 00:34:41,453
but I'm getting so many calls
from reporters and

677
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:43,353
I think I should
switch my phone off.

678
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:45,320
I'll explain everything
once I'm back,

679
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,586
so don't get any
wrong ideas, alright?

680
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:51,200
Sure. Hello… Ms. Oh Jin-sim?

681
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,233
Article?

682
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,400
(Oh Yoon-seo and Moon Ji-hoo,
On a Secret Date?)

683
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,920
She said she's been eating well,

684
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,820
but she lost weight.

685
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,486
Maybe the food there
isn't to her taste?

686
00:35:31,566 --> 00:35:33,700
She looks a bit tired, too.

687
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,100
I'll get going first, then.

688
00:35:57,566 --> 00:35:58,553
Did you all hear about it?
Did you?

689
00:35:58,633 --> 00:36:00,120
The scandal?

690
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,220
Of course I did.

691
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,320
What do you think happened?

692
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,453
They looked like they were
more than friends in the photo.

693
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:08,386
But Ms. Oh's not
someone like that…

694
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,186
Still, I must admit
the photo was too convincing.

695
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:12,186
Right, they looked
so close together.

696
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:14,466
- Yeah.
- I'm so disappointed.

697
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,353
She never went shopping with me.

698
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:18,966
- What are you saying?
- What?

699
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:23,220
I mean, what's this all about?
That's what I meant to say.

700
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,353
I don't think what the
article said is true.

701
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,686
Even just a few days ago,

702
00:36:26,766 --> 00:36:28,920
I heard Mr. Kwon on
the phone with Yoon-seo.

703
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,153
And it sounded like Yoon-seo was
much in love with him.

704
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:35,020
There's no way she'll have
a change of heart so quick.

705
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,053
Well, I don't know.

706
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:38,853
You can't really measure love,

707
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:41,320
or even human feelings,
to be exact.

708
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,753
There's even a saying,
love is always on the move.

709
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:47,386
It could be that
Yoon-seo's heart went from

710
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:51,486
Kwon to that male lead.

711
00:36:51,566 --> 00:36:52,820
Choi.

712
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,953
You just focus on Dan, alright?

713
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:57,420
Because I've never seen anyone
who's so quick to

714
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,053
move on, like Dan.

715
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,720
In fact, I even once caught her

716
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,886
falling in love
three times in one day.

717
00:37:03,966 --> 00:37:05,000
Or should I say, morning?

718
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,253
That's all in the past.

719
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,853
Now that she has me,

720
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:13,333
something like that will
never happen.

721
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,420
Anyway, whether this is
the truth or not,

722
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,986
imagine how Kwon must feel

723
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:22,486
with all this scandal
about his girlfriend.

724
00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:26,353
For the time being,
let's pretend we know nothing.

725
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:28,266
- Alright?
- Alright.

726
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:36,620
What are you doing, Mr. Yeon?

727
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,586
Come here, and take a look!

728
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,053
I mean, look at Kwon.

729
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,086
He's about to rip
those papers out.

730
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:45,786
Do you think it's because
he's angry about the scandal?

731
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:48,086
Well… I think it's because

732
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,320
the papers are stuck.

733
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,553
No, no. You could always try

734
00:37:51,633 --> 00:37:54,020
flipping the pages over smoothly.

735
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,420
There's no way a smart guy
like him doesn't know that.

736
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,586
He's clearly

737
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:00,453
taking his anger out
on the poor file

738
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:02,486
when it's Yoon-seo that
he's mad at.

739
00:38:02,566 --> 00:38:04,820
- Right?
- I thought you said to pretend…

740
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,933
Right, that's right.

741
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:20,366
Hey, sit down! Sit down!

742
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,220
Did you just see that, huh?

743
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,620
Did you?

744
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,386
He's taking it out on that
poor photocopier

745
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:30,153
instead of the male lead
who's next to Yoon-seo

746
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:32,186
that he wants to beat to death!

747
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:33,853
You still don't think he's angry?

748
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:35,353
Please, Mr. Yeon.

749
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:36,886
You said let's pretend
we haven't heard anything.

750
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:39,120
I would like to do that too.

751
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,833
But I just feel so sorry for
the poor guy.

752
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:42,520
You know me.

753
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,220
I wished them happiness
more than anyone else.

754
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,486
Did you?

755
00:38:46,566 --> 00:38:47,686
I never knew that.

756
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:48,766
Really?

757
00:38:52,433 --> 00:38:53,466
There he goes!

758
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,886
Is he really alright?
Or is he mad?

759
00:38:57,966 --> 00:38:59,320
Jeez, I really can't tell.

760
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,186
Not what that Mr. Bangbae-dong
Hedgehog is thinking.

761
00:39:02,266 --> 00:39:03,966
Mr. Bangbae-dong Hedgehog?

762
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,333
Yes, it's something
you don't know.

763
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,053
What do you feel like, Ms. Dan?

764
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:15,000
Let's get something
you want today.

765
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:17,253
Hello, are you two together?

766
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,586
I want udon. Udon!

767
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,553
- Udon…
- Just press the button,

768
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:23,453
and order inside.

769
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:25,053
That place must do good udon.

770
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:26,653
In fact, I even once caught her

771
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:29,753
falling in love
three times in one day.

772
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:31,753
Or should I say, morning?

773
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:32,820
Not udon.

774
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,266
Let's get something else, okay?

775
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Why?

776
00:39:40,366 --> 00:39:41,366
Yes?

777
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:47,200
Old ladies. Old ladies…

778
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:50,300
(Granny's Sausage Soup)

779
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,753
Are you ready to order?

780
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,753
…falling in love
three times in one day…

781
00:39:57,833 --> 00:40:00,166
What should I have?

782
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,866
Hold on. Let me get this call.

783
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,033
Here.

784
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,986
That's my number.

785
00:40:14,066 --> 00:40:15,300
I see. Thanks.

786
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,466
Dan, who's so quick to
fall in love…

787
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,953
Why did you say you weren't
hungry all of a sudden?

788
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:25,720
What's this about?

789
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,820
Ms. Dan,

790
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,486
how could you do this to me?

791
00:40:28,566 --> 00:40:30,420
I know your habit of
falling in love,

792
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,753
but how could you give your
number to another man

793
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:34,686
when your boyfriend is right here?

794
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:35,886
Sorry?

795
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,433
What do you…

796
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:42,153
Are you talking about
how I gave my number to

797
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:43,286
that waiter in the restaurant?

798
00:40:43,366 --> 00:40:44,686
Yes!

799
00:40:44,766 --> 00:40:46,186
Oh, and here I thought…

800
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:50,186
I gave him my number and
my address because

801
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:52,853
they told me their soup comes
available in packages.

802
00:40:52,933 --> 00:40:55,486
I thought you like
sausage soup, so…

803
00:40:55,566 --> 00:40:57,433
I wanted to buy some for you
as a present.

804
00:40:59,466 --> 00:41:00,900
What?

805
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:06,453
You really don't trust me, do you?

806
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:07,886
But then again,

807
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,566
I guess you know my past…

808
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,220
Ms. Dan,

809
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,220
that's not what I…

810
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,820
But you know what?

811
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,720
You don't need to
worry about that anymore.

812
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,686
I admit I'm quick to fall in love,

813
00:41:22,766 --> 00:41:26,453
but these days, I've only been
falling in love with

814
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:29,153
just one person.

815
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:31,066
What do you…

816
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:36,786
I fall in love with you,

817
00:41:36,866 --> 00:41:40,253
when you smile
so sweetly at me,

818
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:43,653
and I fall in love with you
because you're so sexy,

819
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:47,053
coming into the office with
your hair still wet.

820
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:50,686
Just like that, I've been
falling in love with you

821
00:41:50,766 --> 00:41:53,353
twelve times a day,

822
00:41:53,433 --> 00:41:55,886
so I've no time to fall for
anyone else.

823
00:41:55,966 --> 00:41:57,000
I…

824
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:02,520
Ms. Dan… I mean,

825
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,186
Mun-hee.

826
00:42:04,266 --> 00:42:06,120
Mr. Choi…

827
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,486
I mean,

828
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,266
Yun-hyuk.

829
00:42:09,633 --> 00:42:10,700
Mun-hee!

830
00:42:20,266 --> 00:42:22,120
Look at those two.
What are they doing at a park?

831
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,600
Whoa, whoa!

832
00:42:26,366 --> 00:42:27,766
Right, we were at the park.

833
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,286
Should I transfer?

834
00:42:46,366 --> 00:42:48,020
Why?

835
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,420
Did your boss say something?

836
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,353
No, just…

837
00:42:52,433 --> 00:42:55,420
I'm thinking of transferring to
somewhere that's less competitive.

838
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,500
Huh?

839
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,500
But why, all of a sudden?

840
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,320
Just…

841
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,420
You're busy, I'm busy,

842
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,566
so it's hard to spend
time together, right?

843
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:10,966
Besides, what's the point of
climbing that ladder?

844
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:14,633
When my happiness is right here.

845
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:17,786
Besides, I'm thinking,

846
00:43:17,866 --> 00:43:20,566
I'm pretty much satisfied
with my life right now.

847
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,986
Tomorrow's the weekend,
so how about we go watch a movie?

848
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:26,533
Is there something
you want to watch?

849
00:43:29,933 --> 00:43:31,053
Actually, no.

850
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:32,486
I have to go view some rooms.

851
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:34,266
My contract here is almost up.

852
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:45,120
Hey, I guess the reporters had
no clue you were coming.

853
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,633
This is the first time we got out
from the airport so quick.

854
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,720
Hey what? Who are you
calling again?

855
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,233
Is it Mr. Kwon?

856
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,686
What do I do?
Mr. Kwon won't pick up.

857
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:00,520
He must be really angry
about that scandal.

858
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,253
Come on, no!

859
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:05,586
But just the photo alone is
just too convincing.

860
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:08,700
We all went together, so how did
they get a photo with just us?

861
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:11,453
You know what?

862
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:13,320
I need to go and see
Mr. Kwon right now.

863
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,120
No, Yoon-seo. You can't!

864
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,420
Who knows where the
paparazzi are waiting?

865
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,020
Don't act rash,

866
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,600
but go straight home tonight.

867
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,733
Always giving me a lecture…

868
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:47,833
Ta-da!

869
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,953
Mr. Kwon.

870
00:44:51,033 --> 00:44:52,786
Why are you…

871
00:44:52,866 --> 00:44:56,253
This is what they call
a surprise party, right?

872
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,720
I heard from your manager that
you'll be coming back early,

873
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,053
so I wanted to surprise you.

874
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:03,100
He really knows how to keep
a secret, by the way.

875
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:07,553
That's why Hyuk-jun kept
telling me to go home.

876
00:45:07,633 --> 00:45:09,120
Oh what? I had no clue,

877
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,933
and I thought you were mad at me.

878
00:45:12,766 --> 00:45:13,986
Why would I be?

879
00:45:14,066 --> 00:45:16,033
Are you doubting the faith
we have for each other?

880
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,720
Oh, that's right.

881
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,200
I bought you a present.

882
00:45:24,366 --> 00:45:25,366
Here.

883
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:27,120
Open it.

884
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,566
It's my favorite fragrance,
so I wanted to give it to you.

885
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,833
- Should I try it now?
- Yes.

886
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,166
What do you think?
Doesn't that smell nice?

887
00:45:50,966 --> 00:45:53,220
Then shall we go and do
what we haven't been able to,

888
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,400
for a whole month?

889
00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:00,100
What do you…

890
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,453
I mean your acting practice.

891
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:06,066
What were you thinking?

892
00:46:07,733 --> 00:46:08,733
What?

893
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,586
Just kidding.

894
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:14,200
Oh what? Don't tease me.

895
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,320
I missed you so, so much.

896
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,886
Me too.

897
00:46:20,966 --> 00:46:22,753
I missed you so much.

898
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:23,966
So, so much.

899
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,453
What? Don't deny the scandal?

900
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:31,686
But why?

901
00:46:31,766 --> 00:46:32,753
Really, why?

902
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,786
But Yoon-seo, think about it.

903
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:36,920
There's just a week to go
until your drama starts.

904
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,220
If you were to say now that
you two are nothing,

905
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,486
do you think the viewers will then
be able to focus on the drama?

906
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,153
It's all about chemistry
between the two leads.

907
00:46:44,233 --> 00:46:45,586
We want the viewers
asking themselves,

908
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:46,286
"Is this just a drama,
or is it for real?"

909
00:46:46,366 --> 00:46:48,853
That's the way to get
great ratings.

910
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:50,886
You know that, too.

911
00:46:50,966 --> 00:46:52,953
But still…

912
00:46:53,033 --> 00:46:53,953
I don't care what you think,

913
00:46:54,033 --> 00:46:56,966
it's all been talked out with
Moon Ji-hoo's agency.

914
00:46:57,566 --> 00:46:59,053
Though I'm a little unsure about
this scandal when

915
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:01,186
you've only just come back,

916
00:47:01,266 --> 00:47:03,020
they say in every crisis is
opportunity.

917
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,320
We managed to attract
all attention at least,

918
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,853
so let's neither deny or
admit to it

919
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:09,620
until the final episode airs.
Alright?

920
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,720
But Mr. Yeon!

921
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,320
I understand the situation myself,

922
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,453
but if there's not one article
that denies our relationship,

923
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:18,020
the whole world will think that

924
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,286
there's something between me
and Moon Ji-hoo!

925
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:24,753
Imagine how hurt
my real boyfriend must be.

926
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:27,020
Sure, your friend. Wait, what friend?

927
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,853
- Boyfriend.
- Right, boyfriend.

928
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:30,786
It's not like I don't understand
how your friend…

929
00:47:30,866 --> 00:47:32,620
- Wait, what friend?
- My boyfriend!

930
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,186
Right, your boyfriend. I'm sorry.

931
00:47:34,266 --> 00:47:35,466
Your boy…

932
00:47:36,066 --> 00:47:37,333
You have a boyfriend?

933
00:47:39,466 --> 00:47:40,533
- Yes.
- "Yes?"

934
00:47:42,966 --> 00:47:43,986
Ms. Yang, Ms. Yang!

935
00:47:44,066 --> 00:47:45,186
Can you check that this is right?

936
00:47:45,266 --> 00:47:46,833
This is your address, right?

937
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,086
Yes, but why do you want to know?

938
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:51,920
Yeon Entertainment is having
a party to celebrate their

939
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,453
10th anniversary,

940
00:47:53,533 --> 00:47:55,620
and as their partner law firm,
they're going to send

941
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,386
invitations to all of us!

942
00:47:57,466 --> 00:48:00,886
Wow, I guess we have to thank
Yoon-seo for this chance.

943
00:48:00,966 --> 00:48:03,720
Right. All the stars at Yeon
Entertainment should be there,

944
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,920
so I'm really excited.

945
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,886
Huh? I think Mr. Lee's
address here is wrong.

946
00:48:09,966 --> 00:48:12,020
He lives in Jangchung-dong,
not Singil-dong.

947
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,686
Mr. Lee moved to Singil-dong.

948
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,853
It's been about 3-4 months,
from what I know.

949
00:48:17,933 --> 00:48:18,966
What?

950
00:48:19,666 --> 00:48:20,953
Hello, Mr. Yeon.

951
00:48:21,033 --> 00:48:22,820
Is Jun-gyu inside?

952
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,020
Yes, he's inside.

953
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,686
Oh, that's right.
The list of addresses…

954
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:28,520
Let's save that for later.

955
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,633
Later…

956
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:35,886
What, so you knew that
this Kwon Jung-rok and

957
00:48:35,966 --> 00:48:37,320
Yoon-seo were dating?

958
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,320
Yes.

959
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,453
But Yoon-seo asked me to
keep it a secret,

960
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:45,420
so I had no choice.

961
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,986
Then I take it that
scandal's really nothing?

962
00:48:49,066 --> 00:48:51,653
Thank goodness.
I'd been really worried.

963
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:53,620
What, is that
what's important here?

964
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,253
God, I really…

965
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:58,320
Hey, I sent Yoon-seo to
your law firm,

966
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,653
because I thought you'd take
good care of her for me.

967
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,220
What I wanted for her was to
get field experience,

968
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,120
not experience in romance!

969
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,020
Do you think I'm happy about this?

970
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,253
You know me. I'm Yoon-seo's fan!

971
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:10,553
And am I just a fan? No?

972
00:49:10,633 --> 00:49:12,320
When I first heard the news,

973
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,220
I couldn't fall asleep for
many nights.

974
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,120
Because I was so mad.
So angry. So frustrated!

975
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,320
But what can I do?

976
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,886
Yoon-seo's human,

977
00:49:19,966 --> 00:49:21,120
and even she can't help

978
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,986
falling for someone.

979
00:49:23,066 --> 00:49:24,586
Besides, even if you are
the head of her agency,

980
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:26,820
it's not like you can control
her feelings, is it?

981
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,153
Then what should we do?

982
00:49:28,233 --> 00:49:30,086
We should just coolly accept it,

983
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:31,620
and wish them happiness.

984
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,386
Fine, let's say
I decide to be generous

985
00:49:33,466 --> 00:49:35,020
and approve of her dating someone.

986
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,920
But I still don't like
who she's dating.

987
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,953
That Kwon Jung-rok, or whatever.

988
00:49:38,033 --> 00:49:40,320
You told me yourself.
That he's a prick!

989
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,853
Right, he is a bit of a prick.

990
00:49:41,933 --> 00:49:43,420
That sly beast…

991
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,386
How dare he blind my
innocent Yoon-seo

992
00:49:45,466 --> 00:49:47,786
with sugary words of love?

993
00:49:47,866 --> 00:49:49,353
That cunning fox…

994
00:49:49,433 --> 00:49:51,253
I guess you haven't heard,

995
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:53,720
but "innocent" is a description

996
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,220
that better fits Kwon Jung-rok.

997
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,053
Ever since he was in school,
books were all he knew,

998
00:49:57,133 --> 00:49:58,786
so you can pretty much say
he never held a girl's hand,

999
00:49:58,866 --> 00:50:00,320
or even date one.

1000
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,920
Now I hate him even more!

1001
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,786
His parents probably did
everything for that brat,

1002
00:50:03,866 --> 00:50:05,886
so he can concentrate
on his studies!

1003
00:50:05,966 --> 00:50:07,186
Whereas Yoon-seo, she…

1004
00:50:07,266 --> 00:50:09,420
She survived some tough
competition, alright?

1005
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,253
She survived with that
strong mentality of hers,

1006
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:12,720
despite all those criticisms
and personal attacks!

1007
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,520
Kwon Jung-rok is the
living description of

1008
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,120
"Survivor of criticisms
and personal attacks."

1009
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,853
Don't you remember?
The Park Su-myung case?

1010
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:20,820
He became the most hated guy
in the country for that,

1011
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,720
and boy, all those nasty comments…

1012
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,920
Count all of them,

1013
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,020
and I say he's on par with
Yoon-seo.

1014
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,653
Ha! Well, Yoon-seo, she…

1015
00:50:28,733 --> 00:50:31,486
She practically won gold for
all those criticisms about

1016
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:33,486
her bad acting, her attitude,
scandals, and so on!

1017
00:50:33,566 --> 00:50:34,653
What's that about
Yuna Kim's triple axel?

1018
00:50:34,733 --> 00:50:35,953
Because Yoon-seo landed
triple the nasty comments.

1019
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,120
Besides, Yoon-seo's a star.

1020
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,120
And she's not just a star,
but she's an A-list celeb!

1021
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,620
Kwon Jung-rok's also
our top lawyer here!

1022
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,120
Hey, Yoon-seo's a goddess.
She's just damn beautiful!

1023
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,386
Well, Kwon's also good-looking,

1024
00:50:46,466 --> 00:50:48,120
even if not as handsome as I am.

1025
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,600
If he's not, then can you
even say that he's handsome?

1026
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:53,253
You wanna die?

1027
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:54,353
Oh, now you're going to hit me?

1028
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:57,386
I don't have to, because
Kwon will come to my defense.

1029
00:50:57,466 --> 00:50:58,653
But go on, you can hit me.

1030
00:50:58,733 --> 00:50:59,720
Because Kwon will take care of
everything for me.

1031
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,200
There's a security camera
in here, right?

1032
00:51:01,766 --> 00:51:02,766
Here, slap me.

1033
00:51:03,133 --> 00:51:05,953
- Come on!
- What's that? A crop top?

1034
00:51:06,033 --> 00:51:08,020
It's Winnie the Pooh,
limited edition.

1035
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,433
- Pooh… What?
- Pooh.

1036
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,020
He moved? No way.

1037
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,866
But we met on the bus today,
and yesterday.

1038
00:51:24,433 --> 00:51:25,986
Um, Ms. Yang.

1039
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:29,866
You remember our dinner date
tomorrow, right?

1040
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:32,586
But then again,
I guess you can't forget.

1041
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,933
I've been asking you
so many times a day.

1042
00:51:37,066 --> 00:51:38,986
Um, Mr. Lee?

1043
00:51:39,066 --> 00:51:40,653
May I ask you something?

1044
00:51:40,733 --> 00:51:43,320
Sure, anything.

1045
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,986
I was told you moved
three months ago.

1046
00:51:46,066 --> 00:51:48,220
So how is it that we keep
bumping to each other

1047
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,200
on the bus every day?

1048
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,066
Well, uh…

1049
00:52:05,066 --> 00:52:06,986
Um, Ms. Yang.

1050
00:52:07,066 --> 00:52:08,800
- You're here.
- Goodness.

1051
00:52:09,866 --> 00:52:12,153
- You're here.
- Gosh, already?

1052
00:52:12,233 --> 00:52:14,020
Thank you so much, every time.

1053
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,833
I thought you'd have no one to
wake you up, if I'm not there.

1054
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:20,153
I wanted you to

1055
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:23,566
have a good rest
at least while on the bus.

1056
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:44,520
Is this the place
you were talking about?

1057
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,353
Yep. What do you think?

1058
00:52:47,433 --> 00:52:49,053
It's too big.

1059
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:51,033
This place is way above my budget.

1060
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,920
But I already signed the contract.

1061
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,120
What?

1062
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,953
Let's get married.

1063
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:01,700
Marry me, and
let's live here together.

1064
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:07,053
You like the sun, so I picked
a place with a huge window.

1065
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:08,553
Let's put the sofa over there,

1066
00:53:08,633 --> 00:53:10,333
and the TV over there.

1067
00:53:11,366 --> 00:53:14,466
I'm going to lie down next to you
and watch movies on the weekend.

1068
00:53:17,566 --> 00:53:20,320
And we'll put
a huge dining table over there.

1069
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,466
Because we're going to be
a huge family.

1070
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,820
We'll have a son who looks
just like you,

1071
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,433
and a daughter who also looks
just like you.

1072
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,766
Se-won!

1073
00:53:47,866 --> 00:53:50,286
The only answer you can give me is

1074
00:53:50,366 --> 00:53:52,800
"Yes, I'll marry you."

1075
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,633
Because I won't take
anything else for an answer.

1076
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:05,266
Yes, I'll marry you.

1077
00:54:22,066 --> 00:54:23,700
My happiness is right here, too.

1078
00:54:25,066 --> 00:54:26,166
It's you.

1079
00:54:45,233 --> 00:54:47,233
Hello, are you two together?

1080
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,486
Hello.

1081
00:55:00,566 --> 00:55:02,266
A party of two?

1082
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:09,466
Hello.

1083
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,100
What pretty flowers.

1084
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:34,720
I think love is like
those flowers.

1085
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,353
They're so beautiful,

1086
00:55:37,433 --> 00:55:38,853
but wilt so quickly.

1087
00:55:38,933 --> 00:55:41,420
In other words, love is like
a flower that comes with

1088
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,800
more burden than joy.

1089
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,920
I always told myself,

1090
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,286
if love should ever
come to me again,

1091
00:55:51,366 --> 00:55:55,133
let's just ignore it
and pass it by.

1092
00:55:59,233 --> 00:56:01,000
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

1093
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,933
Please don't love me.

1094
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:10,520
I came here to
tell you that tonight.

1095
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:16,220
I wanted to tell you to

1096
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,733
find someone else
who's much better than me.

1097
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,866
Thank you for all you've done
for me until now.

1098
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:54,053
I got chicken.

1099
00:56:54,133 --> 00:56:55,953
Your drama premieres today,

1100
00:56:56,033 --> 00:56:58,300
so I thought we should watch it
together with chicken and beer.

1101
00:57:01,033 --> 00:57:02,700
Sure, alright.

1102
00:57:04,633 --> 00:57:06,000
- Come in, then.
- Sure.

1103
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,986
What have you learned
from going to the gallery?

1104
00:57:10,066 --> 00:57:13,200
Do you know what happens
when you reveal that you're an otaku?

1105
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,886
What if they learn
you're an otaku?

1106
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:17,366
- I…
- Here.

1107
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,800
Are you nervous?

1108
00:57:27,033 --> 00:57:28,820
Not really.

1109
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,366
I've been in this business for
15 years, you know.

1110
00:57:45,966 --> 00:57:46,886
I understand.

1111
00:57:46,966 --> 00:57:49,520
That you've been waiting for
this moment all this time.

1112
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:54,520
And thank you for choosing me to
share this precious moment.

1113
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,666
Same here, thanks.

1114
00:57:56,966 --> 00:57:58,000
It's on!

1115
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:04,566
Wow, you look beautiful.

1116
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,853
"The Queen of Rom-Coms is Back!
Oh Yoon-Seo's Successful Return."

1117
00:58:11,933 --> 00:58:14,220
I really like the title.

1118
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,633
But the real response is
all in the comments section.

1119
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:19,686
What do I do, Mr. Kwon?

1120
00:58:19,766 --> 00:58:21,886
I'm so nervous.
Should I not just read them?

1121
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:23,253
Or should I?

1122
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,400
Shouldn't I?

1123
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:31,486
Actually, no. As the lead actress,
I should humbly accept

1124
00:58:31,566 --> 00:58:33,600
our viewers' honest opinions.

1125
00:58:37,366 --> 00:58:38,553
I can't do it, after all!

1126
00:58:38,633 --> 00:58:40,153
Then I'll take a look first,

1127
00:58:40,233 --> 00:58:43,600
and tell you whether you should
or should not read them.

1128
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,120
What…

1129
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,120
What is it?

1130
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,553
Is it that bad?

1131
00:58:50,633 --> 00:58:52,420
Do you want to, like,
report all of them?

1132
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,720
All the comments are…

1133
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,866
…really supportive!

1134
00:58:57,266 --> 00:58:58,653
"Oh Yoon-seo's acting has
improved."

1135
00:58:58,733 --> 00:59:00,553
"I'm so glad to see her
back on TV."

1136
00:59:00,633 --> 00:59:03,186
"My goddess is still
beautiful as always."

1137
00:59:03,266 --> 00:59:05,266
"Say goodbye to bad acting."

1138
00:59:06,733 --> 00:59:08,220
"Crazy chemistry between
the two actors.

1139
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,666
They must be dating for real."

1140
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,153
Good job, everyone.

1141
00:59:15,233 --> 00:59:16,286
Let's all say cheers!

1142
00:59:16,366 --> 00:59:17,353
Here's to us!

1143
00:59:17,433 --> 00:59:18,853
- To us!
- To us!

1144
00:59:18,933 --> 00:59:20,753
- Good job.
- Good job, everyone.

1145
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:22,786
Good job, everyone!

1146
00:59:22,866 --> 00:59:25,333
Yoon-seo, thank you for
your hard work!

1147
00:59:27,633 --> 00:59:29,366
One, two, three!

1148
00:59:34,966 --> 00:59:36,033
Alright, everyone.

1149
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,720
As our lead actress,

1150
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,286
we should hear a word from
Yoon-seo, shouldn't we?

1151
00:59:40,366 --> 00:59:41,620
- Yes!
- Give her a big hand!

1152
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:45,520
Oh Yoon-seo! Oh Yoon-seo!

1153
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,933
Oh Yoon-seo! Oh Yoon-seo!

1154
00:59:49,233 --> 00:59:51,320
Thank you so much for

1155
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:56,153
welcoming back so warmly.

1156
00:59:56,233 --> 01:00:01,020
During the time while I was
preparing for my comeback,

1157
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:05,820
I've always thought
I wished my heart would

1158
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,286
go out and reach
may people out there.

1159
01:00:08,366 --> 01:00:12,220
And now, I'm really happy
and honored to see that

1160
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,286
my wish has come true, somewhat.

1161
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:17,700
Thank you so much.

1162
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,733
Here.

1163
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,253
Yoon-seo,

1164
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:34,866
when you were
giving your speech just now…

1165
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:37,600
Don't cry. Don't cry!

1166
01:00:38,566 --> 01:00:39,866
It really touched me.

1167
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,866
Good job hanging in there.

1168
01:00:50,633 --> 01:00:52,453
So I was thinking, Mr. Yeon.

1169
01:00:52,533 --> 01:00:53,953
Yeah?

1170
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:58,853
From now on, I'm going to do
what I want to do.

1171
01:00:58,933 --> 01:00:59,966
Like what?

1172
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,320
The drama's finished,

1173
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,720
so I want to do
as my heart's telling me to.

1174
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,833
Huh?

1175
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:11,820
I'm off, then.

1176
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,986
Uh… Yoon-seo?

1177
01:01:13,066 --> 01:01:14,220
Is she up to trouble…?

1178
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,153
Yoon-seo! Hey!

1179
01:01:16,233 --> 01:01:17,486
- Mr. Yeon.
- Oh, hey.

1180
01:01:17,566 --> 01:01:20,066
- Let's have a drink.
- Sure, let's do that.

1181
01:01:21,166 --> 01:01:22,266
Man, she…

1182
01:01:23,533 --> 01:01:25,266
- What are you…
- I'm sorry.

1183
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,333
- Hey!
- I'm sorry.

1184
01:01:28,266 --> 01:01:29,786
- Ugh, please.
- I'm sorry.

1185
01:01:29,866 --> 01:01:32,253
Hey, you should be looking after
Yoon-seo as her manager!

1186
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:33,653
What do you think you're doing?

1187
01:01:33,733 --> 01:01:35,286
Back when I was a manager…

1188
01:01:35,366 --> 01:01:37,386
This after-party? I wasn't even
allowed in!

1189
01:01:37,466 --> 01:01:39,900
I'd just grab a noodle and
wait for everyone to finish!

1190
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,753
You're so cold-hearted.

1191
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:46,286
I went to so much effort
looking after Yoon-seo,

1192
01:01:46,366 --> 01:01:49,320
and you're saying
I can't even have a drink?

1193
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,986
- I had the noodles, too.
- Sure.

1194
01:01:52,066 --> 01:01:53,486
And besides, Mr. Yeon.

1195
01:01:53,566 --> 01:01:56,086
Let's be honest. Who was it that
made Yoon-seo into a star?

1196
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:57,653
You, Mr. Yeon? No, no.

1197
01:01:57,733 --> 01:01:59,653
It was me, Gong Hyuk-jun!

1198
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:03,253
I'd pick her up every day and night
be it rain or snow,

1199
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:07,486
and be her emotional trash can,

1200
01:02:07,566 --> 01:02:12,586
or literally a trash can if she
needed to throw away anything!

1201
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:13,686
Right, good work.

1202
01:02:13,766 --> 01:02:15,120
Why did you accept so much of it?

1203
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,420
Don't take anymore,
and just lower your voice.

1204
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,500
Why?

1205
01:02:22,033 --> 01:02:23,486
- You're not happy about that?
- Well, uh…

1206
01:02:23,566 --> 01:02:24,720
Oh, you're not happy?

1207
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,553
- It's not like that.
- Come here for a second.

1208
01:02:26,633 --> 01:02:28,053
Why? What is it this time?

1209
01:02:28,133 --> 01:02:30,833
Are you not happy about that?

1210
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,986
I'm happy, alright?

1211
01:02:34,066 --> 01:02:35,586
Hey, good work to you, too.

1212
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:37,753
- Good work.
- Thank you…

1213
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:39,953
You're so dead once you're sober!

1214
01:02:40,033 --> 01:02:41,853
Good job.

1215
01:02:41,933 --> 01:02:43,866
Just go to sleep.
That's much better.

1216
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:46,566
I'm surrounded by enemies…

1217
01:02:47,666 --> 01:02:53,453
Mr. Kwon. You're coming to our
agency's party tomorrow, right?

1218
01:02:53,533 --> 01:02:56,386
Then can I see you briefly
before that?

1219
01:02:56,466 --> 01:02:57,933
I've something to say.

1220
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:01,453
The wind's still chilly.

1221
01:03:01,533 --> 01:03:03,086
Still, isn't it nice being out?

1222
01:03:03,166 --> 01:03:04,166
Yes.

1223
01:03:05,633 --> 01:03:07,953
By the way, didn't you say
you had something to say?

1224
01:03:08,033 --> 01:03:11,066
Um… Why don't we
sit down over there first?

1225
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,633
- One moment.
- Sure.

1226
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:23,786
Take this red ginseng first,

1227
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:27,033
because you're in for
a difficult journey.

1228
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,986
- Here.
- Difficult journey?

1229
01:03:30,066 --> 01:03:32,586
Don't ask questions,
but just take it.

1230
01:03:32,666 --> 01:03:33,666
Alright.

1231
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:39,686
Well done.

1232
01:03:39,766 --> 01:03:41,286
So? Do you feel much better?

1233
01:03:41,366 --> 01:03:42,553
Yes.

1234
01:03:42,633 --> 01:03:45,320
Alright, then. Carry me!

1235
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,553
What?

1236
01:03:46,633 --> 01:03:47,686
Just kidding.

1237
01:03:47,766 --> 01:03:49,653
Hold my hand, and let's go!

1238
01:03:49,733 --> 01:03:50,786
Let's go.

1239
01:03:50,866 --> 01:03:51,966
Alright.

1240
01:03:58,333 --> 01:03:59,786
Why are we here?

1241
01:03:59,866 --> 01:04:01,286
I have plenty of suits.

1242
01:04:01,366 --> 01:04:03,920
But they're all for work.

1243
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,986
Let me pick one out for you,
for the party.

1244
01:04:07,066 --> 01:04:08,300
For the party?

1245
01:04:09,233 --> 01:04:11,820
But isn't this too flashy,

1246
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,933
when I'm only going there
as your corporate lawyer?

1247
01:04:15,933 --> 01:04:19,466
You're not going there as
our lawyer today.

1248
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,933
You're going as my boyfriend.

1249
01:04:26,266 --> 01:04:27,266
What?

1250
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,020
I don’t want to deny it anymore.

1251
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,320
I want to tell the whole world
about us.

1252
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,466
Is that alright with you?

1253
01:04:38,966 --> 01:04:40,033
Yes.

1254
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:42,700
Long time no see.

1255
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,620
This is our new lawyer.

1256
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,900
- Let me introduce him.
- Nice to meet you.

1257
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,253
Here's to us.

1258
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:53,333
To us!

1259
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:02,153
Hey, it's Oh Yoon-seo.

1260
01:06:02,233 --> 01:06:03,233
Yoon-seo! Hey!

1261
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:06,833
Let's go over to her.

1262
01:06:38,033 --> 01:06:40,620
My heart should reach out to

1263
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:42,853
everyone, right?

1264
01:06:42,933 --> 01:06:46,553
I'm sure it will, to everyone.

1265
01:06:46,633 --> 01:06:49,466
Just like how your heart
touched mine.

1266
01:07:00,633 --> 01:07:01,553

the future of law firms,)
