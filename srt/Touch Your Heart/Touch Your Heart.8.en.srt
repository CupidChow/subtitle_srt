1
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,200
(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,466
What is it that you wanted to
talk to me about?

3
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:47,186
It's been so hard,
hasn't it, Yoon-seo?

4
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:48,186
Pardon?

5
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:49,533
You can cry if you want to.

6
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:52,600
Cry all your heart out
and wipe your tears with this.

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,853
Yoon-seo, you're so foolish...

8
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:59,533
If it was so tough for you,
you should've just said so.

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,766
Tears?

10
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:07,920
Foolish? I'm not quite sure
what you mean.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,553
I heard everything from Jun-seok.

12
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,753
That Kwon's been harassing you
all this time!

13
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,333
Verbal abuse,
forcing you to stay until late...

14
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:16,720
I know your recent
absence was because

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,600
you couldn't stand
Kwon's tyranny anymore.

16
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:22,333
What... Just what is all this?

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,586
While I would really like to

18
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,186
fire Kwon right this minute...

19
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:28,053
Though he's like that,

20
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:30,286
he's not so bad as a lawyer.

21
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:32,986
Plus he's currently taken on
a lot of cases, so...

22
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:35,186
That's why I'd like to suggest,

23
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:38,820
how about you work with Choi for
the remainder of your time here?

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,966
No!

25
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:41,886
Eh?

26
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:43,886
Mr. Kwon's never harassed me.

27
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:48,086
My absence was purely due to
my personal circumstances,

28
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,986
and Mr. Kwon is not to blame.

29
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:52,220
It's all a misunderstanding!

30
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,586
Then what is this about
you saying,

31
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,620
you'll destroy him and
gladly go to hell?

32
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,053
Oh my. Mr. Yeon
even mentioned that?

33
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:01,120
Yes.

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,186
Well, uh...

35
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:04,153
That was way back
when I first started.

36
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:06,020
All's fine between us now.

37
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,986
He's been a great mentor,
and he's so considerate.

38
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:09,766
I couldn't thank him enough.

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,720
Then will you continue to
work as his secretary?

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes, of course.

41
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:17,720
Thank goodness. Thank God!

42
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,053
I was so worried that

43
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:21,486
you might really opt for
the hell option, Yoon-seo.

44
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,466
Well, uh... No.

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Ha... Thank goodness.

46
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:29,653
Jeez.

47
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,166
Why did Mr. Yeon have to
mention something like that?

48
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,200
(Kwon Jung-rok)

49
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,300
Because now, a life without
Mr. Kwon is a hell.

50
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:43,733
Wait a second.

51
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm sure he's free tonight.

52
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,720
Hey!

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,500
Should I ask if
he wants to go on a date?

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,766
Restaurant...

55
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:02,066
Please, I really shouldn't...

56
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,100
Not so crowded, and private...

57
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,200
(Not so crowded restaurant for
a perfect date with privacy)

58
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,966
Let's see.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,266
So pretty.

60
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:24,020
Then I'll keep in touch.

61
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,186
Alright, see you.

62
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:26,266
Alright, bye.

63
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,700
How are you feeling?

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Are you feeling better?

65
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,100
Yes.

66
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,700
Thanks to you.

67
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:47,666
Thank you for taking me to
the ER the other day.

68
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:49,500
Don't mention it.

69
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,433
Take care of yourself, then.

70
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:00,000
Kwon Jung-rok!

71
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:03,833
It's...

72
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,333
It's about time
we make up, isn't it?

73
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,600
How about a beer tonight?

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,733
(One Loving Star)

75
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:20,766
I'm back.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,466
- Welcome back.
- Mr. Kwon.

77
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,286
Do you, uh...

78
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:30,686
Do you also have
a loving star in your heart?

79
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:31,933
Yes, well...

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
A star...

81
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,220
I'm back.

82
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,886
Welcome back.

83
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:47,486
How did the trial go?

84
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:48,853
We won.

85
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,033
That's great!

86
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:54,753
So, about tonight...

87
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,320
Oh, I was about to tell you.

88
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,386
I need to go out for
a drink tonight.

89
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,320
What? Even a drink, too?
That sounds great.

90
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,033
- Pardon?
- Huh?

91
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Pardon?

92
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:07,053
- Huh?
- Oh. What I meant was,

93
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:09,266
I need to have a drink with
Prosecutor Yu Yeo-reum.

94
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:12,553
With Prosecutor Yu?

95
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:13,586
Yes.

96
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,320
Things haven't been
so nice between us

97
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,820
because of the recent
Lim Yun-hee case.

98
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,053
And it's also true that I put
Yeo-reum in a difficult situation.

99
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,853
I can't not see her forever,

100
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:24,300
so it's time we make up.

101
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,500
Or... You don't want me to go?

102
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,786
No, of course not!

103
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:34,633
A drink with a friend...
Like that's anything.

104
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:38,186
I knew you would say that.

105
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:40,000
So, about the case examples
I asked you to research...

106
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,553
Here you are. Here.

107
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,633
Thank you.

108
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:48,633
(Reservation complete)

109
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,720
Do you have plans tonight?

110
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,133
Well, uh...

111
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:53,486
Who are you going with?

112
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:54,866
Well, uh...

113
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,453
Oh! With Ms. Dan.

114
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:01,686
I wanted to go here with Ms. Dan,

115
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:03,686
so I made a reservation.

116
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:05,120
Are you two close?

117
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,386
Of course! We're very close.

118
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,500
We're each others' confidantes!

119
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,620
It's nice to see that
you have a friend here.

120
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,086
I'll be rooting for
your friendship.

121
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,166
Then...

122
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:20,733
Sure.

123
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,466
Yes.

124
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:36,453
It's my first time
at a place like this!

125
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:38,000
This is really nice.

126
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,520
It's my first time here too,

127
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,120
and yes, it is nice.

128
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,120
So, uh...

129
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,520
Did you really reserve this place
for me?

130
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,653
Because no matter how you see it,
this is a place for couples!

131
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:55,466
Couples? No.

132
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:57,653
I really mean it,
I reserved this place

133
00:06:57,733 --> 00:06:59,233
because I wanted to
come here with you.

134
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,366
Here's your romantic couple
course meal. Enjoy your time.

135
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:14,620
Not only you brought me here,

136
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,253
but you reserved the
romantic couple course meal?

137
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,900
Yoon-seo...

138
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,466
You want a boyfriend, don’t you?

139
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,953
You should find a guy, quick.

140
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,100
Yes, well...

141
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:34,853
I'm sorry I acted like a loser.

142
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,786
You see, I wanted to win this case

143
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:39,766
and move to the
special department.

144
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,586
So I guess I ended up
thinking that

145
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,766
this was my ticket to there.

146
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,986
My mind was somewhere else,

147
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,500
and I ended up missing
what's truly important.

148
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:52,920
And I'm sorry I was
a brat to you, too.

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,033
It's alright.

150
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:58,253
I'm also sorry I called a witness
from the audience without warning.

151
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,800
Right? You do feel
bad about that, huh?

152
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:03,520
You were unbelievable.

153
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,620
How could you stab
my back like that?

154
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,553
How could you expose the
real culprit right then and there?

155
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:09,333
What've you got to say to that?

156
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:11,220
Yoon-seo,

157
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,120
you took time off
a few days ago, right?

158
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,520
Did something happen?

159
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,520
Oh. I was just feeling unwell.

160
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,820
Oh.

161
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,186
I see.

162
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:25,586
I thought you had a fight
with Mr. Kwon.

163
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,386
Why would I fight with Mr. Kwon?

164
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,086
Why not? I can see
a ton of reasons.

165
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,433
Mr. Kwon's so callous, isn't he?

166
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,920
And to be honest with you,

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,186
I was a bit surprised
when I saw how he was

168
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,266
at that Lim Yun-hee trial.

169
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,886
I knew he was cold-hearted,

170
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:43,386
but I really didn't know
he'd be like that to

171
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:45,233
Prosecutor Yu as well.

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,253
How could he do that to
his first love?

173
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,366
Eh?

174
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:53,586
First love?

175
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,420
Oh. I guess you don't know.

176
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,953
This is a secret, but one of
my friends from the academy

177
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:03,253
went to the same university as
Mr. Kwon.

178
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,186
And this friend says

179
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:07,333
Mr. Kwon had a crush on
Prosecutor Yu!

180
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,666
Oh.

181
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:14,933
So... They used to date?

182
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:18,053
Oh no.

183
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:21,586
Because she dated
Prosecutor Kim Se-won.

184
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,286
Who's this Prosecutor Kim?

185
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:24,400
Well...

186
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,053
Alright. This is Kwon Jung-rok,
this is Yu Yeo-reum,

187
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,386
and this is Kim Se-won.

188
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:32,453
These three were best of friends,

189
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,053
but Kwon Jung-rok had
a crush on Yu Yeo-reum,

190
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:36,053
and Yu Yeo-reum had
a crush on Kim Se-won.

191
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:38,020
Then these two ended up dating,

192
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,633
so Mr. Kwon has ended up
having a heartbreak.

193
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,553
Hey, we should have
dinner sometime.

194
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:46,620
Sure, anytime's fine for me.

195
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,200
I'm going to be touched again.

196
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,353
If you're alright for time,
how about we go for lunch?

197
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:52,566
How does pasta sound?

198
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:56,853
I'm very sorry,

199
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:58,333
but please go ahead first.

200
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,520
So he had a crush on her?

201
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,286
That's why...

202
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:04,433
But you know,

203
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,586
this is just my personal opinion,

204
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,900
but I think...

205
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,533
Mr. Kwon still has feelings left
for Prosecutor Yu.

206
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,020
I can see it in his eyes

207
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,833
when he looks at her.

208
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:25,986
Yoon-seo,

209
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:27,066
what is it?

210
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Oh.

211
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:34,253
The macaroons were too small.

212
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,486
I mean,

213
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:38,353
shouldn't they be at least
the size of your hand?

214
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:40,100
Gosh, I'm so mad!

215
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,500
You can have all of these.

216
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,166
I don’t want this one.

217
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,300
Yes, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

218
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,486
I was about to call you
as soon as I got home.

219
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:59,720
Mr. Kwon, can I see you now?

220
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,753
What?

221
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:01,853
Now?

222
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:05,986
Yes. There's something
I need to talk to you about now.

223
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,853
I'll come over. Where are you?

224
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,733
I'm almost home, but...

225
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:15,033
Then I'll send you my address.

226
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:22,386
Is something wrong?

227
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:24,420
You've come all this way.

228
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,086
I could've just come over
to you instead.

229
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,400
Mr. Kwon.

230
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,820
I heard you had
a crush on Prosecutor Yu.

231
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,653
That it was a love triangle
with one more friend.

232
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:39,053
Is this true?

233
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,966
Yes, it's true.

234
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,566
How can you be so
confident about it?

235
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:47,520
Then should I be
embarrassed about it?

236
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,253
When it's all in the past already?

237
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,886
Still! Even if it's in the past,

238
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:53,520
how can you drink with
the girl you used to like,

239
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,353
just the two of you?

240
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:58,253
That's not... You know!

241
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,553
What girlfriend would
understand that?

242
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:03,386
But we're really just friends now.

243
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:05,566
That's what you think!

244
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:08,786
If you're still nice to her

245
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:11,753
and continue to see her,
just the two of you...

246
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,853
Then other people might think

247
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:17,400
you still have feelings for her.

248
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,166
Kwon Jung-rok!

249
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,366
What are you doing here?

250
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,933
And who's this?

251
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,886
Are you...

252
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:34,786
Jung-rok's girlfriend?

253
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:37,020
Ah, yes.

254
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,020
Hello.

255
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,820
Why, hello!

256
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,800
I'm Kim Se-won,
Jung-rok's roommate.

257
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:45,320
Kim Se-won?

258
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,720
It's so nice to meet you.

259
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,466
I've always wanted to
meet his girlfriend.

260
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:52,886
Actually, why don't you come in?

261
00:12:52,966 --> 00:12:54,453
Let's order some chicken
and have a beer.

262
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,753
- Well, that's...
- Next time.

263
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,420
I'll officially
invite her next time.

264
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,986
Why next time?

265
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,386
When she's here already.

266
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:03,786
Don't think so hard about it.

267
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,786
it's just beer. We won't bite.

268
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:07,853
Come on!

269
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:08,853
Hey, let's go in.

270
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:09,886
- Come on!
- But she's busy…

271
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:11,000
Come on!

272
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,386
Come on, invite her in.

273
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:15,633
Come on in!

274
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
Hurry up!

275
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:33,886
Alright, chicken's here!

276
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:35,020
This way. Please.

277
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,120
What are you doing?
Have a seat.

278
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Sure.

279
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:44,220
Though it's not much,
please go ahead.

280
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,320
Sure, uh...

281
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,153
Anyway, it's really nice to meet you.

282
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:48,120
Whenever Jung-rok
talked about you,

283
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,286
I was so curious what kind of
person you are.

284
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:53,320
He talked about me?
Mr. Kwon did?

285
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,953
Of course!

286
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:57,820
You had dinner with just him
some time ago, right?

287
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,253
And watched a movie, too.

288
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,253
After he came back,

289
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,720
he was staring at the
ticket like this,

290
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,253
and that's when I knew!

291
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,066
Ah! It's love.

292
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:09,353
Love is here.

293
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,600
Just shut your mouth
with some chicken.

294
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,786
Why? Embarrassed?

295
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:16,900
Embarrassed, are you?

296
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:21,086
By the way,

297
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,253
doesn't it bother you?

298
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,386
Why are you wearing
sunglasses indoors?

299
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:26,266
Well, uh...

300
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:32,900
Well, we may be seeing each
other often from now on, so...

301
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:42,266
Wow, you look just like
Oh Yoon-seo.

302
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:49,633
I am Oh Yoon-seo.

303
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,133
Really? You're the Oh Yoon-seo?

304
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:56,286
As in, "my goddess,
your goddess,

305
00:14:56,366 --> 00:14:57,920
our goddess, the cosmic goddess,
Oh Yoon-seo?"

306
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,153
You know that slogan, too?

307
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,153
Of course! Don't you know
how popular she was?

308
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,500
Just turn on the TV,
and she would be on!

309
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:09,300
Weren't you also
a model for this brand?

310
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:13,220
Moracana Chicken is here!

311
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,553
Yummy, yummy chicken is here!

312
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:18,120
- Mora mora!
- Mora mora...

313
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,953
- Moracana!
- Moracana...

314
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:23,300
Moracana Chicken is here!

315
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:26,400
Whoa, this is unbelievable.

316
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,733
Unbelievable!

317
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:33,966
I thought Jung-rok was
dating his secretary.

318
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:38,966
Then does that mean
this secretary is you?

319
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,420
Well, uh...

320
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,833
What happened is...

321
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:47,053
Due to personal circumstances,
I'll be working 3 months there.

322
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,900
Oh, I see.

323
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:51,753
Hey, you!

324
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,453
If you're dating the cosmic
goddess Oh Yoon-seo,

325
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,720
you should've treated her
like a queen.

326
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,120
Why did you upset her, huh?

327
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,386
What?

328
00:15:59,466 --> 00:16:01,533
Huh? How did you...

329
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:06,353
Well, I saw you two
being all serious,

330
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,253
so I interrupted you guys to
help you make up.

331
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,166
See, this guy's an idiot
when it comes to love.

332
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:12,786
So, Yoon-seo.

333
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:15,086
What's this guy done wrong?

334
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,253
Well, uh...

335
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,753
You can be honest with me.

336
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,320
I think I overheard,

337
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,266
"still have feelings for" someone?

338
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,553
She found out that I used to
have a crush on Yeo-reum.

339
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,766
And how there was a love
triangle between us three.

340
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:31,200
Oh, that?

341
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,953
If it's about that,
there's no need to worry.

342
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:37,953
It was just a temporary thing
back in college,

343
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,220
and it was the
smallest crush ever that

344
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,753
you can't even call it a crush!

345
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,386
If it was anything serious,
we would've ended up enemies.

346
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:47,920
How would we be
roomies now, right?

347
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,320
- Am I not right?
- That's true, but...

348
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,253
And from how I see it,

349
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,586
you're the only one

350
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,620
whom he's let into his heart.

351
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,520
I mean, it's my first time
seeing him

352
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,500
open his heart up to anyone.

353
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:03,900
- Really?
- Yes, I mean it.

354
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:11,453
So let's clear up the
understandings,

355
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:12,533
and uh...

356
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,853
Though Jung-rok's a bit cold
and needs training,

357
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,186
please take good care of him.

358
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:19,053
What's this about me being cold?

359
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:20,686
What, you really don't
know yourself?

360
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:22,433
Then I'm going to tell
Yoon-seo everything.

361
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:24,353
Back in college,

362
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:26,153
I forgot to do this
important assignment.

363
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,553
So I asked him if I could
copy his answers down,

364
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:30,920
and he was like, "I'm never
going to show you my answers,

365
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,520
so you do your own assignment.
But if you really must,

366
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,166
it's 50 cents per page."
That's the guy he was!

367
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,286
Still, that can't compare to
my first day with him.

368
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:42,320
On my first day as his secretary,

369
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,720
I tidied his desk for him, and...

370
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,586
He went into a rage,

371
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,220
asking me why I touched
his desk without permission...

372
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,620
Ha! He really made me
feel embarrassed back then.

373
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,166
I can picture it already.

374
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:00,700
"Why did you touch my desk
without my permission?"

375
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:02,353
That's how he was, was it?

376
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:03,433
No.

377
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:06,920
It needs to be a deeper frown.

378
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,220
"Why did you touch my desk
without my permission?"

379
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,320
That's how he was.

380
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,953
- Oh, like this?
- Yes.

381
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:16,866
"Why did you touch my desk
without my permission?"

382
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:19,486
Right?

383
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,520
I never said it like that.

384
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,820
"Why did you touch my desk
without my permission?"

385
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,386
I said it nicely like that.

386
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:29,153
This is all a misunderstanding.

387
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,120
When did I ever say it like,

388
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,486
"Why did you touch my desk
without my permission?"

389
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:33,286
- Yes, like that.
- Right?

390
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:34,833
So now you remember, huh?

391
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:45,120
Prosecutor Kim is really funny.

392
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,020
Yes, he's a likeable guy.

393
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,953
So he was pretty popular
among the girls.

394
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:50,886
Aha!

395
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:54,600
That's why you lost
Prosecutor Yu to him.

396
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,300
Just kidding.

397
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:06,066
You're not mad anymore, then?

398
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:09,266
Well...

399
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:11,820
When I first heard it,

400
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,520
I got really jealous,
to be honest.

401
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,633
But uh...

402
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,200
As you said, it's all in the past.

403
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:21,720
And besides,

404
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,353
as Prosecutor Kim said,

405
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:27,220
I'm the only one

406
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,933
you ever
let into your heart, so...

407
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:35,133
I'm glad you think of it
like that.

408
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:37,986
To be honest with you,
I think jealousy is

409
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:40,453
the most unnecessary emotion.

410
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:42,453
As long as our feelings for
each other are solid,

411
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:45,253
the past shouldn't matter.

412
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,053
So let's not waste our time
on something like this,

413
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,300
but focus on what we have now.

414
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,300
Ah! Welcome back, Mr. Thief.

415
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:01,320
What? Thief?

416
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,653
You're officially one of
the top 3 thieves of Korea.

417
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:05,020
There's marinated crabs,

418
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,453
then Rain, who married
Kim Tae-hee,

419
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:08,666
and now you,
who's dating Oh Yoon-seo.

420
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,820
You need to get your act
together from now on.

421
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,153
If it's Oh Yoon-seo, you'll have
a ton of rivals,

422
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:16,933
so be good to her if
you don't want to lose her.

423
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,120
How do I do that?

424
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Do what?

425
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,153
Being good to her.

426
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:27,220
How do I do that?

427
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,653
Do you need to ask?

428
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,020
If she wants something,
do it for her,

429
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,120
if she needs something,
make sure she's taken care of,

430
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,886
and just love her and
treasure her.

431
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,586
That's how you do it, I guess.

432
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,086
But it's not as easy as it sounds.

433
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,920
Even just now. If it weren't for
you, I would've been in trouble.

434
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,100
Thanks for that.

435
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,100
Good grief…

436
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:51,886
I never expected to hear
those words from him.

437
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:54,966
It's love, alright.

438
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,033
This is moist.

439
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:35,653
Oh what?

440
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:38,086
Why the sudden lip care?

441
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,220
What could it be?

442
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,986
What could you be up to?

443
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,420
If you have time to tease me,

444
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,266
why don't you find a place?

445
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,053
When are you going to
leave my place?

446
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:49,833
Jeez, you're always
pulling that card.

447
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:54,386
How's it going with Yeo-reum?

448
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:55,386
Do you need to ask?

449
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:58,486
I'm still clinging onto her.

450
00:21:58,566 --> 00:22:00,386
Then I'll leave you to it.

451
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:02,366
Do a good job with that.
So your lips are hydrated.

452
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,100
Right, hydrated.

453
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,720
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.
Why are you here?

454
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,653
Why else? Because I wanted to
commute with you today.

455
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:33,233
Wouldn't you say this is the
thrill of office love?

456
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:39,133
Huh?

457
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:40,500
Where did it go?

458
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,053
You must've left something
important behind.

459
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:44,133
Yes.

460
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:47,000
Jealousy.

461
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,486
I left my jealousy behind!

462
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:54,120
Something unnecessary
like that will

463
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,420
only drive us apart,

464
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,233
so I decided not to carry
something like that with me.

465
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,220
Shall we get going, then?

466
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,333
Um...

467
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:08,386
Give me your car key.

468
00:23:08,466 --> 00:23:10,720
Huh? Why?

469
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,620
You're a bad driver,

470
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,920
and you always have
a hard time driving.

471
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,500
I can't let you
have a hard time again.

472
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,520
Goodness.

473
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,420
So he's worrying about me again?

474
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,366
Just what to do!

475
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,366
That mirror's really small.

476
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,400
Isn't it cute?

477
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:45,720
This is my lucky charm.

478
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,920
I was cast on the street
the day I bought it.

479
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,320
So I believe

480
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,533
this brings me luck.

481
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,386
But you wouldn’t need
something like this.

482
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:01,986
Why? Because the Goddess of
Luck with her lucky charm

483
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,566
just happens to be
your girlfriend.

484
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,500
You really have a knack for
embarrassing people.

485
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:14,366
May I hold your hand?

486
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:18,066
Pardon?

487
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:21,600
Why are you asking me
such a thing all of a sudden?

488
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,786
As you've been informed,

489
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:39,720
we've some law students

490
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,086
starting their internship here
from today.

491
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:43,400
Say hello.

492
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,233
Hello.

493
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:46,353
Hello.

494
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:49,153
Why don't you
introduce yourselves?

495
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:50,320
You go first.

496
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,653
No, no. You go first.

497
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:52,800
Sure, alright.

498
00:24:55,566 --> 00:24:57,253
Hello, I'm Lee Jong-hwa.

499
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,853
Hello! I'm the man who's ready to

500
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:01,220
write down every one of
your invaluable advice

501
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,753
and engrave it on my heart.

502
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,433
I'm Kim Pil-ki.

503
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:12,933
Jong-hwa...
That's a feminine name.

504
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:15,253
But his looks say otherwise.

505
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,400
You're really manly and handsome.

506
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,653
Right. I'll have to agree,

507
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:23,420
though he's still
far from my level.

508
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,520
We'll be in your care, then!

509
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,153
Mr. Yeon Jun-kyu,

510
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:28,286
Mr. Kwon Jung-rok,

511
00:25:28,366 --> 00:25:29,553
Mr. Choi Yun-hyuk,

512
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:31,200
and Ms. Dan Mun-hee.

513
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:34,733
How'd you learn our names so fast?

514
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,820
You got us.

515
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,220
We visited the website to
learn your names.

516
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,820
As an intern, we are expected to

517
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,786
learn our mentors' names
before we start out.

518
00:25:45,866 --> 00:25:47,820
Right? Yes.

519
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,720
Once again, it's an honor to

520
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,420
have the noble names of

521
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,153
our venerable mentors

522
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:57,833
engraved on my left and
right cerebella.

523
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:03,253
By the way, we have
a workshop this weekend.

524
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:05,120
So Jong-hwa, and...

525
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,386
- Pil-se?
- Pil-ki.

526
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:09,186
- Kim.
- Mr. Kim Pil-ki, uh...

527
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:12,033
If you can attend, please join us.

528
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:14,433
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

529
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,833
Sorry, I was on a call
with a client.

530
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:42,653
Um, are they aware that
Ms. Oh Jin-sim works here?

531
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:43,953
Of course, I told them.

532
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:46,366
I even had them sign
a confidentiality contract.

533
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,220
They've completely
snapped out of it.

534
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,086
Yoon-seo, I'll ask you to
take good care of them.

535
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:57,120
They're going to learn at
Kwon's office, you see.

536
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,786
What? My office?

537
00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:01,120
Yes, they'll be on rotation,

538
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,800
and you're the first one up.

539
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,853
Kwon, can I talk to you?

540
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:11,933
Sure.

541
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,953
That's too bad, isn't it?

542
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:18,786
I bet you were so eager to

543
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:20,486
teach everything you know to
that intern, Lee Jong-hwa.

544
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:22,853
You're all about guys
with good looks, right?

545
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,520
No, thank you!
Because I have a boyfriend now.

546
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,020
Oops! This is
meant to be a secret.

547
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,053
Oh, really?

548
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:31,686
By any chance,
does your boyfriend...

549
00:27:31,766 --> 00:27:34,300
...volunteer, for a living?

550
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,900
My boyfriend's the owner of the
cafe just across the street.

551
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
Here.

552
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,486
He's handsome too, isn't he?

553
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:45,953
I'd drink Americano here
every day, and...

554
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:47,020
Oh, I'm sorry.

555
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,286
I got so bored.

556
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,853
Hey, apologize!

557
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:51,266
Apologize to me!

558
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:02,220
Alright, then.

559
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:07,186
Let's begin the orientation.

560
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:09,953
In order to work with Mr. Kwon,

561
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:13,253
there are a few rules.

562
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,253
Rule number one.

563
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:17,086
Come to work on time.

564
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:19,820
Mr. Kwon detests people
who are late.

565
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,253
Rule number two,

566
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,320
Leave work on time.

567
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,453
Mr. Kwon also detests people

568
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:28,053
who cannot finish their work
within the given time.

569
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:30,086
And rule number three,
this is really important.

570
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,820
Mr. Kwon also detests people
who touch his belongings

571
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,033
without his permission.

572
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,553
He has a ton of other stuff
that he detests,

573
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:42,286
but let's get onto that later.

574
00:28:42,366 --> 00:28:45,753
But for now,

575
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:47,753
make sure you keep these
three rules.

576
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:48,986
- Yes!
- Yes!

577
00:28:49,066 --> 00:28:50,066
Then...

578
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:54,886
Um... Ms. Goddess Oh Yoon-seo?

579
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:58,920
You can just call me Ms. Oh.

580
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,053
Oh, sure. Ms. Oh.

581
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:03,953
Excuse me for asking this,

582
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,820
but may I have your autograph?

583
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,886
- Autograph?
- Yes, yes.

584
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:10,153
I'm a big fan of yours.

585
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:11,820
Then...

586
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,133
May I have a picture with you?

587
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:16,420
Then may I shake your hand?

588
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,386
Then can you say for me,
"Cheers, Jong-hwa!"

589
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:19,653
- Then for me, please say...
- Just get on with work.

590
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:21,400
…"Just get on with work."

591
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,186
What do we do?

592
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:32,886
It seems Mr. Kwon is really mad.

593
00:29:32,966 --> 00:29:34,000
I think...

594
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,020
I think he detests me now.

595
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,386
This won't do. I'll go and
beg for his forgiveness.

596
00:29:40,466 --> 00:29:41,720
Wait!

597
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,953
No misunderstandings.

598
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,000
That's his default expression.

599
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:52,586
Here are the files you asked for.

600
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,186
Thank you.

601
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:56,233
You must be delighted.

602
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,766
To have your fans here.

603
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:02,053
To be honest, while working here,

604
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,920
I've come to forget that
I'm a celebrity.

605
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,766
So it's nice to have them
coo over me like that.

606
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,153
By the way, could it be...

607
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:15,553
...that you're jealous?

608
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:16,753
There's no way.

609
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:17,986
Didn't I tell you earlier?

610
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,953
That jealousy is the most
unnecessary emotion.

611
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:22,266
I also left mine at home.

612
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:25,433
But I'm okay with you
being jealous.

613
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:27,486
Pardon?

614
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:29,266
Oh, no. It's nothing.

615
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,933
Then I'll leave you to it.

616
00:30:47,966 --> 00:30:49,720
After the examination,

617
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,700
I think the Court is now
leaning toward not guilty.

618
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:55,686
What if I get another lecture from

619
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:57,786
Chief on this one?

620
00:30:57,866 --> 00:31:00,420
You never know until the
Judge's ruling is out.

621
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,986
Don't lose your confidence, but
go through the records again.

622
00:31:04,066 --> 00:31:05,620
If there's anything missing,
you can also bring it up

623
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,486
and submit evidence to
support your claims.

624
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,453
And don't worry too much.

625
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:10,686
Thank you, Prosecutor Yu.

626
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:12,553
I'll see you again, then.

627
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:13,633
Sure.

628
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:24,786
What are you staring at?

629
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:27,053
Now you've finally returned to
your old self.

630
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:28,486
It wasn't like you,

631
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:30,920
being so down and lifeless.

632
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,286
Whatever. Make some time for me.

633
00:31:33,366 --> 00:31:34,953
Let's have lunch or dinner.

634
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:36,453
I still owe you, so...

635
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:38,200
You wouldn't even
look at me in the eye.

636
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,433
So now you'll eat with me?

637
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,686
I told you, didn't I?

638
00:31:44,766 --> 00:31:46,253
This is just to pay you back.

639
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:47,386
If you don’t want to, then fine.

640
00:31:47,466 --> 00:31:50,353
No, wait. Sure, pay me back.

641
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:51,600
Pay me back real good.

642
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:54,620
How about tonight, then?

643
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,820
I've a lot of files to go through.

644
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,900
Then please excuse me.

645
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,086
Then let's decide on a date
real soon.

646
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:01,533
As soon as possible, alright?

647
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:14,520
One Espresso, please.

648
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,000
- That's an Espresso.
- Sure.

649
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:20,220
Yes, I'll submit the opinion
by Wednesday, then.

650
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,766
You can decide after that.

651
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:25,620
Alright then.

652
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,566
I'll call you back.

653
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:38,986
My boyfriend's the owner of the
cafe just across the street.

654
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:40,733
He's handsome too, isn't he?

655
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:50,866
Here's your Espresso.

656
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,500
Ah yes. Thank you.

657
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,400
- I kept you waiting, huh?
- Yes.

658
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,433
- Thanks for the coffee.
- No worries.

659
00:32:58,066 --> 00:32:59,653
That's right!

660
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:01,186
I heard you got a girlfriend.

661
00:33:01,266 --> 00:33:02,500
Girlfriend? Nah.

662
00:33:02,966 --> 00:33:04,453
Still considering it, because
she's all over me.

663
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:07,653
But why? I heard she's good to you
and that she has a good job.

664
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:09,720
- Isn't she a lawyer?
- What if she is?

665
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,286
- I don't find her attractive.
- Then don't date her.

666
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,353
You know how the landlord sued me.

667
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:16,620
Do you know how much
that's going to cost?

668
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,020
Not only that,
she pays for the dinner,

669
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,286
buys me gifts...

670
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:21,033
So she might be worth keeping.

671
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:26,066
Ms. Dan.

672
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:33,066
Ms. Dan!

673
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,700
Ms. Dan!

674
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,100
Ms. Dan?

675
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:41,933
Ms. Dan!

676
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,966
Are you alright?

677
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:49,566
I'm not alright.

678
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:52,666
I'm not alright!

679
00:34:01,466 --> 00:34:02,466
I...

680
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,200
I knew he wasn't interested in me.

681
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,220
He'd always say he's busy
when I ask him out,

682
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,453
and he'd look bothered
whenever I came to see him.

683
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:10,700
If he truly liked me,

684
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:13,500
he wouldn't be like that, right?

685
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:16,153
Still, I...

686
00:34:16,233 --> 00:34:19,366
I thought it'll work out
if I tried harder.

687
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,953
Little did I know,
that's what he was thinking.

688
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:26,300
I'm so stupid.

689
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
I...

690
00:34:35,233 --> 00:34:36,800
I can't end it like this.

691
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:39,700
I'm going to go and curse at him!

692
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:43,233
Ms. Dan!

693
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,533
Hey, she's here.

694
00:34:51,033 --> 00:34:53,686
There's a limit to
playing with someone's heart.

695
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:55,733
How could you do this to me? How?

696
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,500
Oh, please.

697
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,566
Hey, did I ever ask you out?

698
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:02,800
Did I ever say I like you?

699
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:05,120
Or did you really think
I was seeing you

700
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,153
because I was interested?

701
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:07,400
What are you doing?

702
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:16,586
I was wondering what kind of
a guy you were dating,

703
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:19,466
after turning me down, and...

704
00:35:20,366 --> 00:35:22,400
You rejected me,

705
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:24,753
to date a trash like this?

706
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:25,933
What? Trash?

707
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,766
- Are you done?
- You know,

708
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,220
I'm never going to
let you have her.

709
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,500
Because she's too good for
the likes of you.

710
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,266
Let's go.

711
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:06,866
Ms. Dan,

712
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,866
I know this is not the
right time for advice,

713
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,253
but from now on,
when choosing a guy,

714
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,886
don't choose him
based on his looks,

715
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:15,300
but based on his character.

716
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:17,620
Pardon?

717
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,753
There are plenty of
good guys in this world.

718
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:21,900
Why waste your time
crying over a bastard like him?

719
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:28,433
Take care of yourself, then.

720
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,733
Um...!

721
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:35,133
Thanks.

722
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:41,900
(HEIGHTS MANSION)

723
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:47,153
Yoon-seo, must you
go to this workshop?

724
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:48,486
This isn't even
your real workplace,

725
00:36:48,566 --> 00:36:50,286
so do you really have to?

726
00:36:50,366 --> 00:36:52,220
Well, who knows!

727
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,486
What if there's a workshop
scene in the drama as well?

728
00:36:54,566 --> 00:36:56,786
I need to experience it
for myself,

729
00:36:56,866 --> 00:36:57,753
so that if something like this
comes up in the script,

730
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,786
I'll portray it realistically.

731
00:36:59,866 --> 00:37:01,253
But haven't you packed
too much stuff

732
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,666
when you're off for
an "authentic" experience?

733
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:05,333
What, are you going to Europe?

734
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:07,966
What's all this, when it's just
a one-night trip?

735
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:09,086
What...

736
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,786
Hey, why are you
packing bath salts?

737
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:12,486
It's to help with my insomnia.

738
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:14,586
I'm going to take a bubble bath
before I go to bed.

739
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,786
Yoon-seo, if you take a bubble bath
while at the workshop,

740
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:18,886
people'll think you're a brat!

741
00:37:18,966 --> 00:37:20,520
You'll be sharing the bathroom,

742
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,653
so showers, brushing your teeth...

743
00:37:21,733 --> 00:37:24,153
You have to rush it and
be done in 3 minutes.

744
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:25,233
3 minutes?

745
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,666
That's what it's going to be like?

746
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,520
How can I send you off
to the workshop

747
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,220
when you know nothing?

748
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,800
I'm going to be worried sick.

749
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,153
Let me cut this all down to
just one bag.

750
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:37,486
Gosh, you have too much clothes!

751
00:37:37,566 --> 00:37:38,520
No, not that!

752
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,586
Hey, there's just too much stuff!

753
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:42,566
Ah, yes. You should take
something like this.

754
00:37:42,766 --> 00:37:43,766
That's right.

755
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:46,986
There's something you must
absolutely take with you.

756
00:37:47,066 --> 00:37:49,166
- What is that?
- Your dignity, as an actress.

757
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,920
Please don't get drunk and
do something stupid again.

758
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,033
Please, think of your dignity!

759
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:56,766
Oh, alright.

760
00:37:57,433 --> 00:37:58,886
Alright. Workshops are
important too,

761
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:00,253
but what's most important is
your health. Okay?

762
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:01,520
I'm almost there.

763
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,086
One for you too, Kwon.

764
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,086
Ah, sure.

765
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,220
So, Kwon!

766
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,300
How do I look?

767
00:38:06,433 --> 00:38:07,920
Workshop fashion!

768
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,586
Don't I look refined and
trendy at the same time?

769
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:11,586
I think you failed to catch

770
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,120
both of those subjectives.

771
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,853
You don't even know
the F in "fashion."

772
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:17,386
I mean, just take one look, and...

773
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:18,420
Fashionista!

774
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,586
See? Fashionista, she said.

775
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,486
It's the young ones
who know better!

776
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:22,953
That wasn't meant for you.

777
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:24,053
I mean Yoon-seo, over there.

778
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:25,133
Huh?

779
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:45,753
You look more radiant
outside the office, Yoon-seo.

780
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:48,220
I'd forgotten too, after
seeing her every day,

781
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,833
but a goddess is
a goddess, alright.

782
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,353
I know, right?

783
00:38:52,433 --> 00:38:55,766
I want to scold myself for
forgetting about that.

784
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,386
Oops, sorry.

785
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,986
I guess I'm the last to arrive.

786
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:07,986
What if you are? As long as
you're here in one piece.

787
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:09,686
Ah, Yoon-seo. For your health.

788
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:10,966
You can have two,
because you're special.

789
00:39:11,466 --> 00:39:12,853
Thank you for coming.

790
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,133
No, I should thank you.

791
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:17,566
This is my first group trip.

792
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:18,733
Really?

793
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,686
You didn't even go on
a school trip?

794
00:39:20,766 --> 00:39:22,286
When I was in middle school,

795
00:39:22,366 --> 00:39:25,620
I had appendicitis the day
before the school trip,

796
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,653
and as for high school...

797
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:29,286
I debuted before the school trip.

798
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:32,500
So I've never been
on a group trip before.

799
00:39:32,966 --> 00:39:34,553
That's why I'm looking
so much forward to

800
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,166
this workshop!

801
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,133
If you're all ready, let's go.

802
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:41,933
Let me help you with that.

803
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,166
Let's go!

804
00:39:49,366 --> 00:39:51,400
(Rest Stop)

805
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,420
You're not coming with us,
Ms. Oh Jin-sim?

806
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,100
Well, uh...

807
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,133
There are just
too many people, so...

808
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:06,986
Oh, right.

809
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:09,400
There's too many people and
you'd feel uncomfortable.

810
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,786
Though I'm desperate to
go to the toilet,

811
00:40:12,866 --> 00:40:14,733
I'll try to hold it and
stay here with you.

812
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,353
Same here.

813
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:19,433
I'll stay in the car with Yoon-seo.

814
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,720
No, no.

815
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,653
Go grab a snack and

816
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:24,986
get some fresh air.

817
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:26,800
Then I'll just pee
and be right back.

818
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,153
I'll be back sooner.

819
00:40:29,233 --> 00:40:30,220
I will be back!

820
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,733
Take care, then.

821
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,466
Gosh, the fish cake sounds nice.

822
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
(Corn dog/Fish cake/Sausages)

823
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,233
- Can I have one fish cake?
- Sure.

824
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:05,966
Fish cake, fish cake, fish cake!

825
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:24,700
I guess you like fish cakes.

826
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,120
Yoon-seo, please
accept my fish cake!

827
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,586
Here's a little something for you.

828
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,053
A bouquet of...

829
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:45,133
...fish cakes.

830
00:41:45,466 --> 00:41:46,686
His one doesn't even
have ketchup.

831
00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:48,220
Whereas mine does.

832
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,653
I went and got ketchup for
you separately,

833
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:51,820
so you can have it to your taste.

834
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,686
I put mustard on mine!

835
00:41:53,766 --> 00:41:55,420
I didn't put it on mine,

836
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,520
because I heard
you're allergic to mustard.

837
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,133
Oh. Then... Let me take that off.

838
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:02,633
Yoon-seo doesn't like
unhygienic things.

839
00:42:23,433 --> 00:42:25,266
You heard I replaced you for
the Lim Yun-hee case, right?

840
00:42:26,766 --> 00:42:29,366
If I'd taken it from the start,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

841
00:42:32,966 --> 00:42:34,953
But we just had to
take the long way around,

842
00:42:35,033 --> 00:42:37,500
because of someone who's
overly ambitious.

843
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:41,933
Se-won!

844
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,333
and Ju-young.

845
00:42:46,933 --> 00:42:47,933
Come here.

846
00:42:54,733 --> 00:42:56,900
Have some more meat.

847
00:42:57,566 --> 00:42:59,166
What's with you? It's alright.

848
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:03,486
What a team, huh?

849
00:43:03,566 --> 00:43:05,366
But someone might think
you're trying to flirt with him.

850
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:08,633
What, can't I?
When we're both single?

851
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:13,120
Oh, fine.

852
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,020
You guys look great together.
You should date, then.

853
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,766
I'll try my best.

854
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,466
May I, Prosecutor Yu?

855
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:21,933
Hey, Ju-young!

856
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:23,420
Why? Do you need my permission?

857
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,720
No.

858
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,853
But still,

859
00:43:25,933 --> 00:43:29,266
I thought it's a good manner to ask.

860
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:31,886
Then don't.

861
00:43:31,966 --> 00:43:33,000
Don't even try.

862
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:35,920
- Why not?
- Because no matter how

863
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,933
hard you try, you won't get
what you want.

864
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,133
I don't want you to be
disappointed.

865
00:43:50,533 --> 00:43:52,500
(Seounsan Recreational Forest)

866
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,133
Wow.

867
00:43:57,966 --> 00:43:59,766
Gosh, this is great.

868
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:03,086
Whenever I had to travel
out of Seoul for filming,

869
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,853
I'd always be lonely in
my big hotel room...

870
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,820
But this is so nice,
being surrounded by people

871
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,753
makes it feel like
I'm on a school trip.

872
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:11,053
It's really nice, huh?
But you know,

873
00:44:11,133 --> 00:44:12,186
if you go around the back,

874
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:13,986
you can get a better view!

875
00:44:14,066 --> 00:44:16,320
That's right. There's
a nice path for a walk.

876
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,986
Why don't we all go for
a walk together?

877
00:44:18,066 --> 00:44:19,186
- That sounds good.
- Great!

878
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:22,020
Alright, then. Let's unpack
our stuff and go for a walk!

879
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,020
This way, everyone!

880
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,053
It's these two cottages.

881
00:44:24,133 --> 00:44:25,533
Left and right.

882
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:29,400
Do you like her that much?

883
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,986
- Pardon?
- You like her, don't you?

884
00:44:31,066 --> 00:44:32,066
Ms. Yang, I mean.

885
00:44:32,966 --> 00:44:33,966
Me?

886
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,000
N-no...

887
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:42,586
Out of breath already?

888
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:44,200
This is why you should work out.

889
00:44:44,466 --> 00:44:45,920
Yoon-seo, aren't you tired?

890
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,320
Tired?

891
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,600
No, this is fun!

892
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:52,253
I'm having a great time

893
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:53,400
because this is my first time
going for a walk in a group!

894
00:44:53,933 --> 00:44:54,886
Yoon-seo,

895
00:44:54,966 --> 00:44:57,053
you're like Princess Ann from
Roman Holiday.

896
00:44:57,133 --> 00:44:58,986
You know, discovering happiness
in the little, everyday things

897
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:01,353
after running away from
the palace.

898
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:03,953
Oh, that's an honor.

899
00:45:04,033 --> 00:45:06,833
I really like Audrey Hepburn...

900
00:45:12,866 --> 00:45:14,053
You must've caught a cold.

901
00:45:14,133 --> 00:45:16,253
Oh, did I?

902
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:18,633
It is quite chilly out here.

903
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:20,986
Ms. Oh, take this.

904
00:45:21,066 --> 00:45:22,953
This is an electric hand warmer,

905
00:45:23,033 --> 00:45:24,553
and those disposable hand warmers

906
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:27,620
can't compare against it.

907
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,220
Oh, it's warm.

908
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,300
You can have it.

909
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:36,153
I think you need
another layer as well.

910
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,253
You look too cold.

911
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:38,386
Oh, no. It's alright.

912
00:45:38,466 --> 00:45:39,720
You'll get cold, Mr. Yeon.

913
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,166
No, I'm fine with
just my thin down jacket.

914
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:48,300
Ms. Oh, your throat must be dry.

915
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,600
Yoon-seo.

916
00:45:52,466 --> 00:45:53,553
How about some mulled wine?

917
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:56,000
It's perfect for warming up.

918
00:45:57,066 --> 00:45:58,253
This morning,

919
00:45:58,333 --> 00:46:00,120
I just remembered that time

920
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,186
when I was sipping on mulled wine

921
00:46:01,266 --> 00:46:03,053
while looking over the Seine
in the cold.

922
00:46:03,133 --> 00:46:04,286
So I brought some,

923
00:46:04,366 --> 00:46:05,433
and I'm glad I did. Haha!

924
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:07,653
Mmm, delicious.

925
00:46:07,733 --> 00:46:10,433
- Right?
- It's really warming me up.

926
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:12,886
Tsk, tsk...

927
00:46:12,966 --> 00:46:15,586
Everyone's worried that
Yoon-seo's feeling cold,

928
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:17,420
yet how can you just stand there
doing nothing,

929
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,566
except with your hands
in your pockets like this?

930
00:46:21,233 --> 00:46:23,533
Don't you care for Yoon-seo at all?

931
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,386
Right?

932
00:46:25,466 --> 00:46:27,686
Everyone went to get
fish cakes for Yoon-seo,

933
00:46:27,766 --> 00:46:29,566
all except for him.
He came back empty-handed!

934
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:30,586
If I were you,

935
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:32,733
I would take better care
since she's your secretary.

936
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:35,000
Mr. Kwon... You're so heartless!

937
00:46:36,133 --> 00:46:37,286
It looks like Yoon-seo's
getting too cold,

938
00:46:37,366 --> 00:46:39,053
so let's turn back and head down.

939
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:41,200
Why don't we go and
get ready for the barbecue?

940
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,366
Come on, let's go.

941
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,233
Everyone! Let's turn back!

942
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,786
- This way?
- No, come down!

943
00:46:47,866 --> 00:46:49,420
- Keep going?
- No!

944
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,486
You're shivering.

945
00:46:50,566 --> 00:46:52,266
No, I'm fine.
We're heading down first, then.

946
00:46:56,133 --> 00:46:58,366
Goodness, we brought
a lot of drinks, didn't we?

947
00:47:00,366 --> 00:47:01,286
I don't see Yoon-seo anywhere.

948
00:47:01,366 --> 00:47:02,500
Where'd she go?

949
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,200
I think she went to her room to
get ready for the barbecue party.

950
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,486
What... Huh?

951
00:47:17,566 --> 00:47:19,133
Why, that... Uh...

952
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,886
Why are you wearing a dress?

953
00:47:24,966 --> 00:47:28,720
Oh. But you said there's
a barbecue party at night.

954
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,853
Maybe it hasn't started yet?

955
00:47:30,933 --> 00:47:32,086
Why are you all just standing there?

956
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:34,720
Aren't you going to
get changed into your

957
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,986
dresses and tuxedos?

958
00:47:36,066 --> 00:47:37,100
Well, uh...

959
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,600
A barbecue party at a workshop
isn't really a party...

960
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,120
It's just...

961
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,120
Beer and soju

962
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,653
over some grilled pork.

963
00:47:44,733 --> 00:47:46,666
You can wear whatever
you find comfortable.

964
00:47:47,133 --> 00:47:48,133
Oh.

965
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:50,433
Oh, so that's what it is.

966
00:47:51,466 --> 00:47:52,600
I didn't know.

967
00:47:53,066 --> 00:47:54,686
I'll go get changed, then.

968
00:47:54,766 --> 00:47:55,766
Into something else.

969
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,386
Isn't Yoon-seo so lovable?

970
00:48:01,466 --> 00:48:03,820
Right, she's such an innocent soul.

971
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,320
Yes, yes! At first I thought

972
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,086
she'd be all chic and
hard to get along,

973
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:08,566
but she's really cute.

974
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:11,833
Who knew she'd wear a dress?

975
00:48:12,433 --> 00:48:13,966
Oh what? Why are you smiling?

976
00:48:14,633 --> 00:48:16,720
- It's scary.
- How is it scary?

977
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,953
And who bought so many snacks?

978
00:48:19,033 --> 00:48:20,820
Are we here to eat snacks?

979
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,133
Why's he getting mad at me?

980
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:32,520
Whoa, whoa!

981
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,966
Careful, careful.

982
00:48:34,866 --> 00:48:35,933
Let me take that.

983
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:38,220
This may not seem like nothing,

984
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,700
but there's a bit of
a know-how to it.

985
00:48:39,966 --> 00:48:41,086
First off,

986
00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:43,020
the wind's blowing from...

987
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,086
Ah, that way.

988
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:45,320
Stand facing the
opposite direction, and...

989
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,033
Ah, you did a great job
picking out firewood.

990
00:48:48,533 --> 00:48:50,820
And then, just three seconds!

991
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,433
Three seconds is all you need.

992
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,700
One,

993
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:56,533
two,

994
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:00,166
three!

995
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:04,000
Hey, what's wrong with this?

996
00:49:05,366 --> 00:49:06,666
Let me try again.

997
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,186
Can I try?

998
00:49:08,266 --> 00:49:09,633
It looks like so much fun.

999
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,566
What, Yoon-seo?

1000
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,620
You can have a try then,
just for fun.

1001
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,233
But you'll find it's hard.

1002
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:20,633
One,

1003
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,100
two,

1004
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:25,666
three!

1005
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,820
Do we have a Ms. Girl Scout here?

1006
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,266
This is like making a campfire!

1007
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,833
You see, this is my first time
having an outdoor barbecue.

1008
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:44,120
Alright, fill your glasses

1009
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,300
and let's all say cheers.

1010
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,586
Eat up. This is Korean pork.

1011
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:50,786
The best one there is.

1012
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:52,686
Here's to Always,

1013
00:49:52,766 --> 00:49:54,653
The rising giants in law,

1014
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:56,320
and leading the change!

1015
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,466
Cheers!

1016
00:49:59,133 --> 00:50:00,120
Enjoy yourselves, then.

1017
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,433
- It's really A-grade pork?
- Of course.

1018
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,120
Well, everyone's getting fired up,

1019
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:11,366
so let's start our Always Awards!

1020
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,653
Huh?

1021
00:50:12,733 --> 00:50:14,720
"Always Award?" What is that?

1022
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,753
Oh, we have a little
awards ceremony

1023
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:18,066
at every one of our workshops.

1024
00:50:18,233 --> 00:50:19,353
Really?

1025
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,186
- Wow.
- It's nothing, really.

1026
00:50:21,266 --> 00:50:24,186
Since everyone's doing
so much for Always,

1027
00:50:24,266 --> 00:50:25,186
so I thought
it'd make everyone happy if

1028
00:50:25,266 --> 00:50:27,553
they went home from the workshop
with an award.

1029
00:50:27,633 --> 00:50:30,686
Just your representative
lawyer being thoughtful.

1030
00:50:30,766 --> 00:50:33,133
Then let's get started!

1031
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,600
The first award goes to...

1032
00:50:37,066 --> 00:50:38,853
Kwon Jung-rok!

1033
00:50:38,933 --> 00:50:39,933
Please give him a big hand.

1034
00:50:41,966 --> 00:50:43,566
Alright, the name of the award is,

1035
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,633
"Top Salesman of the Year
Once Again" award!

1036
00:50:48,366 --> 00:50:50,586
What, are we in insurance?
What's with the "salesman?"

1037
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:52,133
Why? Isn't it witty?

1038
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,653
As your prize, here are two books.

1039
00:50:54,733 --> 00:50:56,533
"Humor Heaven!"

1040
00:50:57,866 --> 00:50:58,866
Please give him a hand once again.

1041
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,866
Next up is,

1042
00:51:04,566 --> 00:51:06,500
Mr. Choi Yun-hyuk.

1043
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:09,620
The title of the award is,

1044
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,200
"Tomorrow's Winner."

1045
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,753
Hope you'll work harder this year,

1046
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:15,320
so you'll finally beat Kwon.

1047
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,900
Please give him a hand!

1048
00:51:19,766 --> 00:51:21,753
Yes, I must say it will be tough,

1049
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:26,020
but I'll try to prioritize
my sales record over

1050
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,466
my sense of justice or duty.

1051
00:51:32,366 --> 00:51:33,486
Alright, next up!

1052
00:51:33,566 --> 00:51:34,666
Ms. Dan Mun-hee!

1053
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,400
The title of the award is,
"Don't be such a chicken."

1054
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:45,453
Ms. Yang Eun-ji!

1055
00:51:45,533 --> 00:51:47,586
The "Always Consistent" award.

1056
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:48,666
The title of the award is,

1057
00:51:49,366 --> 00:51:51,033
"Scary, Only on the Surface"

1058
00:51:51,466 --> 00:51:52,853
Though he's got a scary face,

1059
00:51:52,933 --> 00:51:54,853
he can't be gentler
with his work. Well done!

1060
00:51:54,933 --> 00:51:56,653
And finally,

1061
00:51:56,733 --> 00:51:59,486
the "Idol Receptionist" award.

1062
00:51:59,566 --> 00:52:00,600
Give her a big hand!

1063
00:52:01,133 --> 00:52:02,920
As your prize, two concert tickets!

1064
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,033
Give her another big hand.

1065
00:52:06,066 --> 00:52:07,286
Alright, with that,

1066
00:52:07,366 --> 00:52:11,286
the Always Award Ceremony...
would have been over,

1067
00:52:11,366 --> 00:52:13,820
but today I have a special prize
ready, especially.

1068
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,020
Alright, special prize!

1069
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,100
Today's special prize

1070
00:52:18,433 --> 00:52:19,433
goes to...

1071
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:22,500
Oh Yoon-seo!

1072
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Hey!

1073
00:52:24,733 --> 00:52:26,120
What, really?

1074
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,386
You're giving me an award, too?

1075
00:52:27,466 --> 00:52:28,466
Please come on up!

1076
00:52:30,733 --> 00:52:33,286
As your prize, slippers for you to

1077
00:52:33,366 --> 00:52:34,820
wear in the office.

1078
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,586
"The Human Vitamin of Always,"
Oh Yoon-seo!

1079
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:38,100
Please give her another hand!

1080
00:52:40,233 --> 00:52:41,853
Since there's such a rave response
from the crowd,

1081
00:52:41,933 --> 00:52:44,986
let me read out what it says
on the plaque.

1082
00:52:45,066 --> 00:52:46,820
"The Human Vitamin of Always,"

1083
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,820
Oh Yoon-seo.

1084
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,953
This award has been
presented to you

1085
00:52:51,033 --> 00:52:52,786
for being an irreplaceable,
vitamin-like existence at Always

1086
00:52:52,866 --> 00:52:57,653
with your lovely smile
and your hardworking spirit,

1087
00:52:57,733 --> 00:52:59,820
despite the many barriers
you faced as

1088
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,466
a former cosmic goddess.

1089
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,233
Thank you!

1090
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,720
To be honest with you,

1091
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,520
I'm not sure if I really
deserve this award.

1092
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,686
But I will happily accept it,

1093
00:53:16,766 --> 00:53:18,753
as your words of encouragement to
work even harder.

1094
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:19,933
Thank you so much!

1095
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,886
After hearing Yoon-seo's speech,

1096
00:53:24,966 --> 00:53:28,353
this feels like the
awards ceremony on TV!

1097
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:30,800
You should've just come
in that dress, then.

1098
00:53:32,133 --> 00:53:33,753
Alright, let's dig in!

1099
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:34,833
Let's put the awards away now.

1100
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,620
Yes.

1101
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,086
I will discuss the dates
with the Prosecution,

1102
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:43,386
and call you back.

1103
00:53:43,466 --> 00:53:44,466
Alright.

1104
00:53:46,633 --> 00:53:49,220
We were running out of beer,
so I went to get some more.

1105
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,133
You look like you're
enjoying yourself today.

1106
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,553
Yes, I am.

1107
00:53:53,633 --> 00:53:55,800
This is all new,
so I'm having so much fun!

1108
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,453
And they're all such nice people.

1109
00:53:58,533 --> 00:54:00,133
Everyone's been so kind to me.

1110
00:54:02,566 --> 00:54:04,533
- I've also...
- What are you two doing?

1111
00:54:05,766 --> 00:54:07,186
Huh? Why are you all out here?

1112
00:54:07,266 --> 00:54:08,620
It was kind of getting cold,

1113
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,120
and everyone looked tired, so...

1114
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,153
Oh, I see. So we're calling it
a night, then.

1115
00:54:12,233 --> 00:54:13,286
Good night, Yoon-seo.

1116
00:54:13,366 --> 00:54:14,386
Ugh, do I have
something in my eye?

1117
00:54:14,466 --> 00:54:15,886
- Anyone have a mirror?
- I don't.

1118
00:54:15,966 --> 00:54:17,153
I do!

1119
00:54:17,233 --> 00:54:18,233
Hey, really?

1120
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:27,753
Does your mirror
take after its owner?

1121
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:29,133
Because it's so beautiful.

1122
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:31,153
I'll take good care of it

1123
00:54:31,233 --> 00:54:32,300
and return it to you later.

1124
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,400
Let's go.

1125
00:54:36,433 --> 00:54:37,433
We should go, too.

1126
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:47,453
Are we just going to
go to bed like this?

1127
00:54:47,533 --> 00:54:49,053
I don't want to
go to bed just yet...

1128
00:54:49,133 --> 00:54:51,466
Then let's have a chat
before we do.

1129
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,586
By the way,

1130
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:54,953
don't you feel like
something spicy?

1131
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:57,386
I think it's because of
all the meat I ate.

1132
00:54:57,466 --> 00:54:59,866
Then shall we go make some
spicy noodles?

1133
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,820
I bought the ingredients
while we were out shopping

1134
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,586
in case we were  going to have
some late-night snacks.

1135
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,433
I knew we could count on you!

1136
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:07,386
A competent secretary also has

1137
00:55:07,466 --> 00:55:09,400
the workshop covered, huh?

1138
00:55:09,933 --> 00:55:11,466
Wait here, then.

1139
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:22,720
Ms. Dan.

1140
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,253
Why aren't you eating?

1141
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:25,986
You look kind of down, too.

1142
00:55:26,066 --> 00:55:27,266
Did something happen?

1143
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,566
I think she broke up
with her boyfriend.

1144
00:55:31,233 --> 00:55:33,233
How did you know that, Hae-young?

1145
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,953
How do you think?

1146
00:55:35,033 --> 00:55:36,320
You used to stare at the
phone all day,

1147
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,386
waiting for a reply from
your boyfriend.

1148
00:55:38,466 --> 00:55:40,186
But now you're just
staring into space,

1149
00:55:40,266 --> 00:55:41,986
sighing away.

1150
00:55:42,066 --> 00:55:44,853
That means you no longer have
a boyfriend to hear from.

1151
00:55:44,933 --> 00:55:46,486
But...

1152
00:55:46,566 --> 00:55:48,900
But you were so much in love.

1153
00:55:51,133 --> 00:55:52,253
Um, you see...

1154
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:55,686
It turned out that he wasn't so
interested in me after all.

1155
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:58,420
He was only trying to use me
because he was being sued

1156
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,220
- by his landlord.
- What the...

1157
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,753
that crazy little...

1158
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:05,400
How can you say that?
You're an actress.

1159
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:07,386
But...

1160
00:56:07,466 --> 00:56:09,186
But it makes me so angry!

1161
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:10,553
I mean, you really
liked him, didn't you?

1162
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:11,666
Right?

1163
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,820
How could anyone dare try to

1164
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,300
try take advantage of
such pure, innocent feelings?

1165
00:56:16,866 --> 00:56:17,866
I...

1166
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,020
I'm not going to
fall in love again.

1167
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,466
As of this moment, my heart...

1168
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,733
...is temporarily locked down.

1169
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:33,566
There were no towels
in the bathroom.

1170
00:56:34,566 --> 00:56:35,700
This is the last one.

1171
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,820
Tsk, Jong-hwa!

1172
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,820
Tsk, tsk.

1173
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,153
Then instead of using that towel,

1174
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:42,600
you should've dried yourself
with your clothes or something.

1175
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:45,320
How are our venerable mentors
going to dry themselves?

1176
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,066
Jeez, you're taking it too far.

1177
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:49,120
The girls said they had
plenty of towels,

1178
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,700
so go and ask them for some.

1179
00:56:51,266 --> 00:56:53,820
Yes, sir! Then I'll call them
right away.

1180
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,166
Yes, do that.

1181
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:56,720
By the way,

1182
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,253
what are you looking at?

1183
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:59,686
You've been staring
and smiling at it.

1184
00:56:59,766 --> 00:57:00,686
Oh, this?

1185
00:57:00,766 --> 00:57:02,766
It's the group photo from before.

1186
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:05,233
Isn't Yoon-seo just so beautiful?

1187
00:57:06,733 --> 00:57:07,720
Man,

1188
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,086
she really is beautiful.

1189
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:10,566
Not only that, she's nice,

1190
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,953
and so pure.

1191
00:57:12,033 --> 00:57:14,253
I used to be a fan, but
I'm a bigger fan now!

1192
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:15,820
Right?

1193
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,186
I wonder what kind of guys

1194
00:57:18,266 --> 00:57:19,766
Yoon-seo would date.

1195
00:57:20,533 --> 00:57:21,486
Exactly, right?

1196
00:57:21,566 --> 00:57:22,753
Which is why,

1197
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:26,266
I did a little research on
what guys she was into, and...

1198
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:28,700
And...!

1199
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,753
It says someone who can
touch her heart.

1200
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:35,153
Hey, that's... That’s...!

1201
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:36,700
That's so me.

1202
00:57:38,066 --> 00:57:40,620
I mean, I bought her
a fish cake at the rest stop,

1203
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,986
and even gave her some
mulled mine.

1204
00:57:42,066 --> 00:57:43,753
She must've been
so touched by that.

1205
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:45,020
Oh what?

1206
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,086
It was just one fish cake,

1207
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:48,720
and what was it... Mulled wine?

1208
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,353
You brought it for yourself and

1209
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:52,500
just gave her a taste. Right?

1210
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:56,720
It's probably me whom
she was touched by.

1211
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,720
I mean, how many fish cakes
did I buy for her again?

1212
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,720
A whole bunch!

1213
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,720
Not only that, I took off
my down coat for her,

1214
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,720
in case she really catches a cold.

1215
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,053
Then there was that
Always Vitamin award.

1216
00:58:04,133 --> 00:58:05,053
There goes the 3-combo,

1217
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:06,833
pow, pow, pow!

1218
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:09,720
You really are admirable.

1219
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,253
All I did for her was to
give her a fish cake and

1220
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:12,553
that electric hand warmer.

1221
00:58:12,633 --> 00:58:15,186
I managed to catch on that
her throat was dry,

1222
00:58:15,266 --> 00:58:16,353
but that's not quite enough, huh?

1223
00:58:16,433 --> 00:58:17,520
Of course not.

1224
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,753
It's not quite enough.

1225
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:19,833
You should've done more.

1226
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,953
Anyway, I'm pretty sure
I have the best chance,

1227
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:25,920
but if there's something
I'm 100% sure about,

1228
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,300
it's that it's not Kwon.

1229
00:58:27,866 --> 00:58:29,333
- What?
- But you agree, right?

1230
00:58:29,433 --> 00:58:30,620
Out of all the people here,

1231
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,986
who's done the least to
touch her heart?

1232
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:34,820
Kwon, isn't it?

1233
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,020
No need to mention
how badly you've treated her.

1234
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,853
Just think about today,
for example.

1235
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:40,786
Did you do anything for her today?

1236
00:58:40,866 --> 00:58:41,820
Nope!

1237
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,566
Kwon, you're out!

1238
00:58:43,733 --> 00:58:45,320
Kwon, you're out!

1239
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,266
Out from the candidate list!

1240
00:58:47,766 --> 00:58:49,820
Since you're out,
bring the blankets for us.

1241
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,353
Let's go to bed now.
Put that away.

1242
00:58:51,433 --> 00:58:52,420
Oh, this.

1243
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:56,153
May the eliminated
lay the blankets, then?

1244
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:57,720
You know, Kwon's actually
pretty handsome,

1245
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,920
but he's just too chic and cold.

1246
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,486
I agree. By the way,
take a look at this.

1247
00:59:00,566 --> 00:59:01,853
There's no filter,
but she has no pores!

1248
00:59:01,933 --> 00:59:03,920
By the way, you should get ready
for bed. Or these your pajamas?

1249
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,400
No, I was going to
wash up first...

1250
00:59:08,433 --> 00:59:09,433
What's wrong with you?

1251
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:12,153
- What are you doing?
- You asked for the blankets,

1252
00:59:12,233 --> 00:59:13,466
so I was just trying to
deliver them fast.

1253
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:14,886
But I guess it was too fast.

1254
00:59:14,966 --> 00:59:16,186
Yes, it was too fast.

1255
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:17,353
You ruined my hair...

1256
00:59:17,433 --> 00:59:18,933
- He knows no respect!
- What was that?

1257
00:59:19,366 --> 00:59:21,033
Can I borrow your mirror?
Actually, wait.

1258
00:59:21,733 --> 00:59:25,233
I have that mirror that
Yoon-seo lent me, which I...

1259
00:59:27,366 --> 00:59:28,533
Which I put in...

1260
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,666
I'm sure I took it from her
and put it in here.

1261
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,353
Oh man, I must've dropped it!

1262
00:59:33,433 --> 00:59:35,300
This is making me crazy.

1263
00:59:36,133 --> 00:59:38,633
But really, where did it go?

1264
00:59:38,766 --> 00:59:42,253
Don't you have anyone, Ms. Yang?

1265
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:44,286
Please!

1266
00:59:44,366 --> 00:59:46,786
I'm so busy with work and family

1267
00:59:46,866 --> 00:59:48,486
that I'm always on the run.

1268
00:59:48,566 --> 00:59:49,520
Besides, if I did have time
for a date,

1269
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,766
I would focus on
my daughter instead.

1270
00:59:52,366 --> 00:59:53,486
Still...

1271
00:59:53,566 --> 00:59:57,220
If there was someone
who knew your circumstances

1272
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,320
and understood the situation
you were in,

1273
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,286
wouldn't it be okay to
open up your heart?

1274
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:03,553
Well...

1275
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:07,200
I'm just not sure about
dating anyone ever again.

1276
01:00:12,766 --> 01:00:14,553
Actually,

1277
01:00:14,633 --> 01:00:16,866
why don't we have a drink?

1278
01:00:21,633 --> 01:00:23,986
- Oh what?
- Ta-da!

1279
01:00:24,066 --> 01:00:26,253
Hey, what's this?
Where'd we get this wine?

1280
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:27,586
It looks expensive.

1281
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,020
Well, uh...

1282
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:33,186
You said there will be a party,
so I brought it.

1283
01:00:33,266 --> 01:00:35,066
And I think now is the
perfect time to open it.

1284
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,366
Even if not now,

1285
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:45,086
I hope you'll meet someone
nice someday, Ms. Yang.

1286
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:48,120
Oh, and Ms. Dan. Cheer up.

1287
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,033
As soon as we're back in Seoul,
let's get your revenge.

1288
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,020
Revenge?

1289
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,933
Yes, we need to do something.

1290
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,020
Should we put up a sign that says,

1291
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,133
"bastard" on his cafe?

1292
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,786
Thank you, Yoon-seo.

1293
01:01:02,866 --> 01:01:05,620
Hearing that an actress wants to
help me get revenge,

1294
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,700
and with everyone saying
he's bad, I...

1295
01:01:08,633 --> 01:01:10,920
I feel a bit better.

1296
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,566
Anyway, it's nice to get that
off my chest.

1297
01:01:15,533 --> 01:01:17,566
I appreciate
something like this, too.

1298
01:01:19,433 --> 01:01:22,086
I've been in the entertainment
industry for a long time,

1299
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:24,886
and to be honest,
I've been really lonely

1300
01:01:24,966 --> 01:01:25,886
because I've no friend to
confide in.

1301
01:01:25,966 --> 01:01:27,953
But on TV, you...

1302
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:31,053
Kim Min-ji, was it?
And Yang Su-jin?

1303
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:33,386
You and those actresses
looked really close.

1304
01:01:33,466 --> 01:01:34,386
So you're actually not?

1305
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:36,453
That was all for show.

1306
01:01:36,533 --> 01:01:37,933
In reality, I don't even
know their numbers.

1307
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,020
Can you give me
your phone, Yoon-seo?

1308
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,100
Huh?

1309
01:01:50,633 --> 01:01:52,920
This is my number.

1310
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,386
Though I'm not so good with words

1311
01:01:55,466 --> 01:01:57,033
and there's not much
I can do for you, I guess...

1312
01:01:57,733 --> 01:01:59,586
Call me anytime
when you want noodles,

1313
01:01:59,666 --> 01:02:01,300
and I can do at least
that much for you.

1314
01:02:05,366 --> 01:02:07,820
Then let's say cheers!

1315
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:08,786
Cheers!

1316
01:02:08,866 --> 01:02:10,020
- Sure.
- Cheers!

1317
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,100
Cheers!

1318
01:02:12,966 --> 01:02:14,100
Bottoms up!

1319
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:22,586
Yes.

1320
01:02:22,666 --> 01:02:24,253
The best revenge is

1321
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:26,220
getting over him and moving on.

1322
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,186
I'll just find a better guy that

1323
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:30,333
he can't even compare against.

1324
01:02:51,133 --> 01:02:52,853
Oh, sorry.

1325
01:02:52,933 --> 01:02:54,620
I thought no one was here.

1326
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:58,553
No, no. I wasn't so happy about
re-using my old towel.

1327
01:02:58,633 --> 01:02:59,700
Nice timing!

1328
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,400
Watch yourself.

1329
01:03:30,133 --> 01:03:32,653
What are you up to, Mr. Kwon?

1330
01:03:32,733 --> 01:03:33,933
Are you sleeping?

1331
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:35,833
Yoon-seo.

1332
01:03:37,566 --> 01:03:39,353
Mr. Yeon, you're still up?

1333
01:03:39,433 --> 01:03:41,386
What do I do...

1334
01:03:41,466 --> 01:03:42,753
I'm so sorry, Yoon-seo.

1335
01:03:42,833 --> 01:03:44,320
- Why, what is it?
- Yoon-seo,

1336
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,853
I think I lost your mirror.

1337
01:03:46,933 --> 01:03:50,386
I... I'm sure I put it in here,

1338
01:03:50,466 --> 01:03:51,920
but it's not here and
I've looked everywhere.

1339
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,553
I must've dropped it somewhere.
What do I do?

1340
01:03:55,633 --> 01:03:56,520
It's alright.

1341
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,500
It's nothing. Don't mind it.

1342
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:01,986
I can always buy another mirror.

1343
01:04:02,066 --> 01:04:03,500
- Really?
- Sure.

1344
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,453
I got worried about nothing, then.

1345
01:04:05,533 --> 01:04:07,486
Anyway, I'm really sorry.
I really am sorry.

1346
01:04:07,566 --> 01:04:08,986
No, no. Good night, then.

1347
01:04:09,066 --> 01:04:10,486
Alright, good night.

1348
01:04:10,566 --> 01:04:11,566
Bye.

1349
01:04:31,233 --> 01:04:34,453
Yes, it's just a mirror.

1350
01:04:34,533 --> 01:04:36,866
I had fun today.
As long as I did, yes.

1351
01:04:54,233 --> 01:04:56,566
(What are you up to, Mr. Kwon?
Are you sleeping?)

1352
01:05:14,466 --> 01:05:15,500
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

1353
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:18,266
Huh? Mr. Kwon.

1354
01:05:21,366 --> 01:05:23,253
Why are you out here
at this hour?

1355
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:25,386
I thought you'd be in bed.

1356
01:05:25,466 --> 01:05:27,520
I have insomnia,

1357
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,486
and I have trouble sleeping.

1358
01:05:29,566 --> 01:05:32,133
So I came out to
get some fresh air.

1359
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:34,520
There's also something
I'm looking for.

1360
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,653
How about you, why are you
out here so late?

1361
01:05:38,733 --> 01:05:39,800
Well...

1362
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,486
Oh my!

1363
01:05:47,566 --> 01:05:48,566
How did this...

1364
01:05:49,433 --> 01:05:52,520
I overheard Mr. Yeon saying
he lost it,

1365
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,120
then remembered
this was your lucky charm.

1366
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,353
So I wanted to find it for you.

1367
01:05:57,433 --> 01:06:01,200
Then... You were out here,
looking for this?

1368
01:06:03,933 --> 01:06:05,766
Thank you, Mr. Kwon.

1369
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:12,366
Now I've finally managed to
do something for you.

1370
01:06:13,566 --> 01:06:14,566
Pardon?

1371
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:16,486
To be honest,

1372
01:06:16,566 --> 01:06:19,266
I wanted to do something for you,

1373
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:22,986
and make sure that

1374
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:26,566
your needs and wants
were satisfied, but...

1375
01:06:28,466 --> 01:06:30,800
I would have the chance
stolen from me, every time.

1376
01:06:32,533 --> 01:06:35,853
I wanted it to be me,
making you smile.

1377
01:06:35,933 --> 01:06:39,053
But someone else would
always get there first.

1378
01:06:39,133 --> 01:06:40,633
So today, I felt a bit...

1379
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:47,953
Mr. Kwon.

1380
01:06:48,033 --> 01:06:50,153
Are you perhaps...

1381
01:06:50,233 --> 01:06:51,233
Jealous?

1382
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:55,920
Yes, you're right. I was jealous.

1383
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,586
I thought jealousy was

1384
01:06:57,666 --> 01:07:00,266
something that's unnecessary,
but...

1385
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,053
Once you like someone,

1386
01:07:03,133 --> 01:07:05,600
I guess you can't
control your heart anymore.

1387
01:07:13,733 --> 01:07:15,133
Why are you looking at me
like that?

1388
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,366
Was that too childish?

1389
01:07:18,633 --> 01:07:20,020
No.

1390
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,200
Because it made me so happy.

1391
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,853
Because it sounded like

1392
01:07:25,933 --> 01:07:28,220
you like me so much
beyond your own control,

1393
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,633
and so I'm really happy.

1394
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,866
Um, Mr. Kwon?

1395
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,333
Can I...

1396
01:07:47,066 --> 01:07:50,300
Can I kiss you right now?

1397
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:53,700
What?

1398
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,100
Now?

1399
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:01,233
But... Do you have to ask?

1400
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:10,353
Well... You were just so
cute right now, so...

1401
01:08:10,433 --> 01:08:13,120
You can kiss me later,

1402
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,966
without asking me.

1403
01:08:16,566 --> 01:08:18,000
If you're ever going to.

1404
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:21,133
Well, it's cold.
So let's go back in.

1405
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,366
You said don't ask, so...

1406
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,033
(Touch Your Heart)

1407
01:09:43,266 --> 01:09:45,353
Ms. Oh Jin-sim. Jin-sim.

1408
01:09:45,433 --> 01:09:47,420
You're so beautiful.

1409
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,420
Who are you?

1410
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,686
Mr. Kwon isn't capable of
saying something sweet like that.

1411
01:09:50,766 --> 01:09:53,220
Our colleagues might suspect
there's something between us,

1412
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,720
so we should watch it.

1413
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,386
What got into you? Why did you
bring her home today?

1414
01:09:57,466 --> 01:09:58,586
Please, what's wrong with you?

1415
01:09:58,666 --> 01:10:01,053
Why can't you eat by yourself?

1416
01:10:01,133 --> 01:10:04,086
I'll help you, so let's practice.

1417
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:07,153
There's less than a month to go
before your contract ends...

1418
01:10:07,233 --> 01:10:08,586
I wonder if Kwon will feel sad

1419
01:10:08,666 --> 01:10:10,753
once Yoon-seo leaves.

1420
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:13,286
I thought there shouldn't be
any secrets between

1421
01:10:13,366 --> 01:10:15,353
two people who should be
closer than anyone else.

1422
01:10:15,433 --> 01:10:17,186
Where did you say
Lee Kang Joon was?

1423
01:10:17,266 --> 01:10:19,300
How did he know where to find me?

1424
01:10:21,366 --> 01:10:23,933
From now on, your affairs
are my own affairs.
