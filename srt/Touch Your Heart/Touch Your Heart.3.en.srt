1
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,400
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

2
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,953
Yes?

3
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:50,786
Until now, I never once

4
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:54,100
thought of you as my secretary.

5
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,586
I thought of you as
an annoying burden,

6
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,600
because you'll be here
only temporarily.

7
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:06,433
But I decided to have
a change of mind.

8
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:10,153
- Pardon?
- I'd like to give you

9
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:12,700
the chance to work
as my official secretary.

10
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,900
Let's start again from
the very beginning.

11
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,333
Really?

12
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,953
Thank you, Mr. Kwon.

13
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:35,100
I'm really going to do my best!

14
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,333
I...

15
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:11,400
I didn't dodge this time.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Anyway,

17
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,386
I'll be in your care, then.

18
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:24,753
I will look forward to
working with you, too.

19
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,553
Then please excuse me.

20
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:27,633
Sure.

21
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,666
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

22
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,253
- Yes?
- It's this way.

23
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,886
This is the way out.

24
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:43,066
Oops, that's right.

25
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:11,186
Well, from how he caught me
when I tripped,

26
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:12,853
he's caring.

27
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:14,666
Maybe he's not
so much of a prick.

28
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:19,966
(Episode 3)

29
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,186
Ms. Lim, who has been accused of
stabbing her husband to death

30
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:26,520
has been indicted by
the prosecution this evening.

31
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,486
Her husband's body was
found severely damaged

32
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:31,120
with two stab wounds,

33
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,266
while Ms. Lim suffered injuries
that will...

34
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,620
You're late.

35
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,700
Yeah.

36
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,620
What?

37
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,820
Did you miss me?

38
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,553
No way.

39
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:53,133
I was just reviewing
some case files.

40
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,100
Have you been out drinking?

41
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,553
- Yep.
- Work's been busy?

42
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,620
It wasn't for work.

43
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,733
Then were you on a date?

44
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,466
It wasn't a date, either.

45
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,953
Something's up.

46
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,486
Nothing's up.

47
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:14,286
I just had a drink with
my new secretary, that's all.

48
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:16,553
Just the two of you?

49
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,953
I thought you didn't like
this secretary.

50
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,086
I didn't, no.

51
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,920
"I didn't," huh?

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,353
Does that mean
you find her alright now?

53
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:25,433
What?

54
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,200
Is she hot?

55
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,166
- You lunatic...
- You said she's alright.

56
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,786
I meant, she's alright
as a secretary.

57
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:34,866
Oh.

58
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:36,533
As a secretary, huh?

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,166
Tsk, you...

60
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:43,466
Go wash up! You're all dusty.

61
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:51,320
Now that I've earned
his recognition,

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,233
I'm really going to
take this seriously.

63
00:04:57,266 --> 00:05:00,053
But that means I'll need
more "secretary" outfits.

64
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,800
Should I go shopping
on the weekend?

65
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,300
Hey, Hyuk-jun.
Are you here already?

66
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,153
What? You're hurt? Where?

67
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:15,286
Well, uh...

68
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:17,986
I twisted my ankle
during the drill yesterday.

69
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:19,120
What do we do?

70
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,453
I don't think I'll be able to
pick you up for a few days.

71
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,253
That's not what's important here.

72
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,720
You're not hurt badly, are you?

73
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,520
Oh, no.

74
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,686
But I found someone else to
drive you to work,

75
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:30,453
so don't worry too much,

76
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,086
and call me when
anything comes up.

77
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,220
By the way, if that prick
tortures you again,

78
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,553
tell me right away.

79
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:37,586
Alright?

80
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,233
That won't be happening anymore.

81
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:43,153
I think he's finally
realized my worth,

82
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,820
because he pleaded me to

83
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,320
work as his secretary.

84
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,033
Over beef tripes, too!

85
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:54,520
So don’t you worry about me,

86
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,086
but take good care of yourself.

87
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,166
Alright?

88
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,966
(Life)

89
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:15,520
Good morning.

90
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,953
- Good morning.
- Ah, you're here.

91
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:19,833
Have a good one, everyone! Cheers!

92
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,553
Yoon-seo's in a good mood today.

93
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,433
Is it because
she bumped into me so early?

94
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:37,533
Yes.

95
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,033
Good morning, Mr. Kwon.

96
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,520
You must be tired after
going home so late last night,

97
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,220
but you came in so early.

98
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,986
Yes, well...

99
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:54,686
Mr. Kwon, that tie...

100
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,666
It looks great on you.

101
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:00,353
You have great taste,
and I was wondering...

102
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:02,686
Do you do your own shopping?

103
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:03,833
Ms. Oh Jin-sim?

104
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:05,933
Please take this.

105
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:11,953
I've compiled a list of
your duties and responsibilities.

106
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,086
My duties and responsibilities?

107
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,520
Besides connecting calls,

108
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
a legal secretary has
many duties and responsibilities.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,853
This is the diary of
your predecessor,

110
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:23,266
and you'll find the
details inside.

111
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:27,500
I'll be in your care, then.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Sure.

113
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,086
Ha...

114
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,186
Oh what?

115
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:37,100
I thought we'd gotten closer.

116
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:44,253
Notify the client after
confirming the trial date.

117
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,953
Spell check, and... what?

118
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,900
Convert to pdf file and
submit it online?

119
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,600
Why's there so much?

120
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,086
You need to sort each case
by its code,

121
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:58,000
and also on its status.

122
00:07:58,566 --> 00:07:59,900
(Case name/Case number/Fraud)

123
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:05,820
Documents for the trial
must be sorted depending on

124
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,820
whether they're for the client,
the court, or for storage,

125
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,133
and stored.

126
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,053
I'd like to send this through
certified mail.

127
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:17,486
Is that through regular or
express registered mail?

128
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:20,486
Well... I guess express is better.

129
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:21,600
Sure.

130
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:23,500
All done, finally.

131
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:28,653
Ten of these, ten of these,

132
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,286
and 15 of these.

133
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:31,386
Please copy them for me.

134
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:33,466
I'm off to see a client, and
will go straight home from there.

135
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,653
What... He said he'll give me
a chance to work for him,

136
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,133
and he's really enslaving me!

137
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:44,500
I shouldn't have
gone for those tripes yesterday.

138
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,800
(Love is bound to hurt)

139
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:02,400
I really want to do this drama.

140
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,853
Especially this scene.

141
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:08,866
Where the heroine's charisma
just explodes!

142
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,700
She seems so awesome here.

143
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:16,453
Bujin Construction, which
I understand is where you're at,

144
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:19,320
was subcontracted demolition work
from the defendant,

145
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,753
which was carried out.
Am I correct?

146
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:22,833
Yes.

147
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,753
But although the defendant
completed the project

148
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,233
through Bujin Construction,

149
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:32,620
he failed to make his payment

150
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,666
due to insufficient funds, no?

151
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:43,620
Your Honor,

152
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,300
the statement made by our witness
just now is false.

153
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:50,866
I love you!

154
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,333
I bet he'll work me to death
again tomorrow.

155
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:01,533
But this won't help, unless I can
see the lawyers in action...

156
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:06,286
What? Really?

157
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:08,553
Can I really come with you?

158
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:11,153
To meet your senior colleagues?

159
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:12,853
He's actually not just
my senior from college,

160
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:15,220
but the attorney for the
opposing party of

161
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,453
the case I'm currently
working on right now.

162
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,533
Oh.

163
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,386
But if he's representing
the opposing party...

164
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:25,120
Doesn't that mean you'll be
sounding each other out

165
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,220
while keeping your guard,
like in a psychological war?

166
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,686
Can I really join you when
it's that important?

167
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:33,820
We're just going to have
lunch together, to say hello.

168
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,386
But if you're not so keen,
you don't have to come.

169
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:38,586
I just thought
this may help you with your work

170
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,686
as my secretary.

171
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,553
Of course it'll help. It'll totally!

172
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,720
I'm going no matter what.

173
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,320
But, uh... Me working here is
supposed to be a secret,

174
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,786
so I think I need
a bit of disguise.

175
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:51,833
How about I just draw a mole here?

176
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,200
Do you really think
a mole will do the trick?

177
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:00,820
I've a plan, so leave it to me.

178
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,100
Really?

179
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:04,700
You're so prepared!

180
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,753
What do you think?

181
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,900
No one will ever suspect that
it's you, right?

182
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,633
(2016 Always Law Firm Sports Day)

183
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,753
Of course.

184
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,900
How can anyone,
when I look like this?

185
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,720
Oh, jeez.

186
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,786
Do I really have to do this?

187
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:24,486
I mean, a legal secretary
going around like this

188
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:27,220
just doesn't feel real.

189
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,453
Not many people
recognize me anyway

190
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,266
when I'm wearing my sunglasses.

191
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:32,986
Well, he's not just anyone.

192
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:34,453
Sorry?

193
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,786
He's your die-hard fan.

194
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:38,300
Still, that doesn't mean...

195
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:41,886
What?

196
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:43,420
He's a fan of mine?

197
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,486
Yes.

198
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:46,853
He's watched every TV series
you've been in.

199
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:49,620
Oh my goodness!

200
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,953
This friend of yours has
a discerning eye, doesn't he?

201
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,886
Why don't you just lose to him?

202
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,620
Do you really have to win against
someone so nice?

203
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,766
What?

204
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,466
Just kidding.

205
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:06,153
Anyway, if he realizes
I brought you today with me,

206
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:08,620
he'll probably start showing
his overwhelming interest

207
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,520
which will make you
feel uncomfortable.

208
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,420
I also hate these
kinds of scenarios, so...

209
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,253
If it's for that reason,
I'll pop these back on.

210
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,133
Right away.

211
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,820
Oh, and I have
one more favor to ask.

212
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,253
What is it?

213
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,453
Don't ever speak, not even a word.

214
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:26,166
Why not?

215
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:29,653
In case he recognizes my voice?

216
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:32,166
Alright. Don't worry about that.

217
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,286
Hello, sir.

218
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:42,053
- Ah, it's been a while.
- Yes.

219
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:44,166
- You look like you're doing well.
- Thank you.

220
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,920
This is Ms. Oh, my secretary.

221
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,086
She's still on training
at the moment,

222
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,086
so she's accompanying me for
most of my meetings to

223
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,100
learn her duties.

224
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,653
But why in that outfit?

225
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:59,753
Her clothes were soiled
on her way to work,

226
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,866
and as for the mask...

227
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:03,866
...breakouts.

228
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,486
Ms. Oh.

229
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:24,586
Why not take off
your mask briefly?

230
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,253
You need to eat, at least.

231
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,553
Do you still play golf these days?

232
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:30,820
When would I have time to,

233
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,186
when work's pouring in like this?

234
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:36,853
Plus the recent case I'm on is
quite a headache, and...

235
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:39,220
Oh, how about you
join me for a round next time?

236
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,520
Shall I?

237
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,820
Yes, after a game of golf,
let's go treat ourselves.

238
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,153
I know a place that does
great grilled eels.

239
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,686
Sounds good.

240
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:50,666
Anyway, uh... I'm sorry that
you can't join us.

241
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,420
She says she's on a diet,
so don't mind her.

242
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,353
She told me she gained
3 kg in weight,

243
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:59,100
so nothing fits her anymore.

244
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:17,153
What? Breakouts?

245
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:21,020
I gained 3 kg and nothing fits me?

246
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,553
I thought it'll be a nerve war

247
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:24,286
when he told me he's meeting
the opposing attorney, but...

248
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:26,700
They're just wasting time on
useless chit-chat!

249
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,853
If I knew this wasn't going to
help me, I wouldn't have come.

250
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:32,600
I mean, what's with this?

251
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,500
Ms. Oh, was it?

252
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:46,086
You didn't eat at all.

253
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,300
Aren't you hungry?

254
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:51,220
So... I was just
curious about one thing.

255
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,620
Mr. Kwon is competent,

256
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,520
but he scores zero on
personality, right?

257
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,400
Isn't it hard working under
someone like him?

258
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,420
If you think you can't take it
anymore, come to me.

259
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,820
One of our secretaries
quit recently,

260
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,166
so we're recruiting.

261
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,233
Go on, take it.

262
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,453
For some reason, your fingers...

263
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,520
They're strangely familiar.

264
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,253
And your face, too.

265
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,853
Where have I seen you before?

266
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:25,686
Can you take off that
mask for me, briefly?

267
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:26,886
Or maybe just the sunglasses?

268
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:28,453
I know I'm being rude,

269
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:31,220
but you just seem
strangely familiar.

270
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,720
Don't get me wrong though,
this isn't sexual harassment.

271
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,886
It's just that I'm sure
I've seen you somewhere.

272
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:37,986
So... Can you just
take it off for me?

273
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,986
I really can't hold
my curiosity, so...

274
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,500
What are you doing here?

275
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:46,620
Did you... hear us?

276
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,886
Yes.

277
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:49,900
Please don't be any more
disrespectful than this,

278
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,066
to my secretary.

279
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:57,733
Let's go.

280
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:16,353
Are you alright?

281
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,066
Huh? Oh.

282
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:20,486
Sure, yes.

283
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:22,433
Though he was quite rude...

284
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,686
Why are you looking at me
like that?

285
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:33,220
Because I suddenly remembered
someone else who's rude.

286
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,820
I've no breakouts, you know.

287
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,086
My skin's silky-smooth,

288
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,720
and I never gained 3 kg!

289
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,386
My weight's a constant 48 kg.

290
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:42,820
I'm sorry, but that was
the most convincing excuse

291
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,153
I could give back there.

292
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:47,386
I know.

293
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:50,586
I know, but I'm still frustrated.

294
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,653
Let's go eat.

295
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:53,953
You must be hungry after
not being able to eat.

296
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,353
I'll treat you.

297
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:57,900
No thank you,
I'm not hungry at all.

298
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,366
Then let's go to the
nearest restaurant.

299
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:11,133
(Yeon Entertainment)

300
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:13,086
Yoon-seo's doing well, right?

301
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,953
Of course!
She's doing so well that

302
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,786
she's welcome to stay 30 years,
not 3 months!

303
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:22,120
She's beautiful, nice,
and competent...

304
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,853
She also gets along with
our employees, too!

305
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:26,420
But from what I heard,

306
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,053
she doesn't have a good
relationship with her boss.

307
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,920
Apparently, their
personalities collide.

308
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,186
What was his name again?

309
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,786
That's right, Kwon Jung-rok.

310
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:35,253
I hear he's a real prick.

311
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,920
Prick?

312
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,786
Well, you could say that.

313
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:42,153
Then why did you assign
Yoon-seo to him?

314
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,786
He's damn good at what he does.

315
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:46,753
Number 1 in win rate,
and number 1 in client's choice.

316
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,333
He's our ace attorney.

317
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,920
That's why you can't
control him, can you?

318
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,886
Hey, do you know how much
money he earns me?

319
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:55,720
God, I pity you.

320
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,386
I really do!

321
00:17:57,466 --> 00:18:00,320
As representing lawyer,
you need charisma!

322
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,753
If he's hurting your pride
and dignity even just a bit,

323
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,153
forget about ace attorney,
you need to cut him off!

324
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,486
That way,

325
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:11,066
he'll learn to respect you
and fear you.

326
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:12,700
Tsk.

327
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:16,253
Why? Did I upset you?

328
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,333
Just a bit.

329
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,520
But after hearing that,
you may be right.

330
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,253
After all, I am the
representing lawyer of Always,

331
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,420
so I can't let my pride
and dignity be treaded on

332
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,266
by a puny little
bastard like him. Nope!

333
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,186
You know, I should call
Kwon in here and

334
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:30,420
teach him a good lesson!

335
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,533
I'm ready for blood
and discipline, too!

336
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:35,166
Exactly.

337
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Oh what?

338
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,953
Ah, Min-ji.

339
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:44,453
Min-ji? As in Min-ji?

340
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:47,220
- Korea's sweetheart?
- What's up?

341
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,486
Why? What about the filming?

342
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:49,686
What?

343
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:51,653
It's folded again?

344
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,533
Do you think
this is origami, or what?

345
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,800
Hey, when did I get mad at you?

346
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,820
What, you won't
renew your contract?

347
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,420
Min-ji, what's this about?

348
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,786
Hello?

349
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:09,720
Min-ji, now that I think about it,

350
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,853
you have the right to be mad. Yep!

351
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,086
You're really upset, huh?

352
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,120
I'll call the director in my office

353
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,953
and give him a good lecture!

354
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:18,586
So let's... Please let's
take this quietly, alright?

355
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,053
What? Tripes?
Sure, let's have them.

356
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,486
By the way, I never
shouted at you.

357
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:25,953
I had something stuck
in my throat, that's all.

358
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:28,020
So, uh.... That Kahhh!
It was just my throat.

359
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,020
Don't get me wrong.

360
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,386
Sure, Min-ji. You can do it!

361
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:34,233
Alright, bye.

362
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,566
My throat, hmpf.

363
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:47,533
Talk about dignity.

364
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,720
Mention dignity again,

365
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,900
and you'll be on your knees
when she calls next time.

366
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:56,466
- Why, did I upset you?
- No, well...

367
00:19:57,366 --> 00:19:59,120
I guess it's not easy.

368
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,186
I was only dropping by to
update you on

369
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,886
how Yoon-seo is doing,

370
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:04,920
but I'll only embarrass myself
if I stay any longer.

371
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,486
- So bye.
- Sure, cousin.

372
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:07,666
Take care.

373
00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:11,766
What?

374
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,986
Why can't I still get used to you

375
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:17,586
calling me "cousin?"

376
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,086
I don't mind when
it's just the two of us.

377
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,320
You can call me
"cousin" at any time!

378
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,753
But imagine how I feel,
when you call me "cousin"

379
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,333
in a room full of people,
with that face of yours!

380
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:29,620
Cousin, I went to see a dermatologist
the other day,

381
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,186
and do you know what the
doctor said to me?

382
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:32,853
She said I can go back to
wearing a school uniform!

383
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:34,720
Look. Silky-smooth skin.

384
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,700
It's almost ironed out.

385
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:39,586
I just imagined you back in
your school outfit,

386
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,220
and now I have the goosebumps!

387
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,986
I say go see an ear doctor,
not a dermatologist.

388
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:46,233
You might be hearing things.
Anyway, I'm off.

389
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,653
Sure, cousin. Hey, wait!
Wait just a second.

390
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:50,653
What were they again?
That's right, macaroons.

391
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,053
They came as a gift,

392
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:54,120
so share them around
with your employees.

393
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,766
Or just throw them away somewhere.

394
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,586
This is unexpected.

395
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,033
- See you.
- Alright.

396
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:05,866
Enjoy your meal.

397
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,133
Looks delicious!

398
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:23,886
Are you really going to
eat all this?

399
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:26,986
I'll have to, even if I can't.
After all, you're paying.

400
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:28,686
This is the least I could do to
get my revenge on you for

401
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:30,700
those rude statements
you made about me.

402
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:33,600
Action!

403
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,953
By the way,

404
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:45,920
you did that on purpose,
didn't you?

405
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,653
- Do what?
- Dressing me up

406
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:48,686
in that outfit.

407
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,500
You did that on purpose, right?

408
00:21:52,466 --> 00:21:54,620
I'm not too sure what you mean.

409
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,086
As I explained before,

410
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,453
he's your ardent fan,
so in case he found you out...

411
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:00,786
If you were worried about that,

412
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:03,786
you shouldn't have taken me
there in the first place.

413
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,853
I thought about it,
and something wasn't right.

414
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:07,320
You could've not taken me
in the first place,

415
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,286
so why bring me along to
play such a role?

416
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:13,586
It was all to
distract him, wasn't it?

417
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,633
Just what are you scheming?

418
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:19,820
To be honest, he...

419
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,886
He has quite a reputation
in this industry.

420
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,220
He pretends to be friendly,

421
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,053
and uses his
outgoing personality to

422
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:27,720
charm his opponents into
giving him information.

423
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,920
Many lawyers have been
done by him.

424
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,653
I knew it. So he's bad!

425
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:36,520
But he's easily distracted.

426
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,020
He's strong at
one-on-one meetings,

427
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,020
but if it's in a group, or if
there's a distraction,

428
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,353
he says things
he usually wouldn't.

429
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:45,053
Is that why you took me?

430
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,600
To get his attention?

431
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:52,486
It was also to help you
adjust to your work.

432
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:54,253
Yes, there was that reason, too.

433
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,220
I'm sorry I didn't inform you
beforehand.

434
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,220
I thought about telling you,

435
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,800
but decided against it in case
you try your awkward acting.

436
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:03,086
What was that?

437
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,486
"Awkward acting?"

438
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:06,120
That's what people say.

439
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,953
That your acting's awkward.

440
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,420
Ha! God.

441
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,220
This is unbelievable.

442
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,653
You know, this is the
first time I'm hearing this.

443
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:17,033
Can I sue you for defamation?

444
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,466
You can, but...

445
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,753
Does that mean you want to
sue the whole nation?

446
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:26,966
What?

447
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,133
Oh, forget it.

448
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,986
This is my schedule for this week.

449
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:40,020
- Can I see it?
- Sure.

450
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,586
Everyone, gather up!

451
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:45,086
Your blood sugar must all be
running low, huh?

452
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,053
How about macaroons for
dessert, then?

453
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:51,220
Hey, that's my favorite dessert!

454
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,933
My favorite... Strawberry!

455
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,086
No thanks for me.

456
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,420
Why not?

457
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,486
I thought you'd be
delighted the most.

458
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:02,053
Right. Why are you so down
these days?

459
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:05,166
She was rejected by that guy
at the sandwich store.

460
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,586
Oh, that's it?

461
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,620
You were rejected by that guy
at the beef soup place,

462
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,953
and that chef at
that Italian restaurant,

463
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,553
and that owner of that butchery.

464
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:15,853
You were rejected countless times
already, weren't you?

465
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:20,066
But you were always so fast to
move on, each time.

466
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:22,520
Not this time.

467
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,666
This time, it was true love!

468
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,453
I...

469
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,200
I don't think I can
fall in love again.

470
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:31,153
Oh, sorry.

471
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:33,153
I guess I said something
I shouldn't have.

472
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:34,966
Ms. Dan Mun-hee?

473
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:52,620
- That's me.
- Oh, I see.

474
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,700
Here you go.

475
00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:55,366
Sure.

476
00:24:56,766 --> 00:25:00,033
Can you sign here, please?

477
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:04,066
- Yes, right here.
- Sure.

478
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:08,453
Have a good day.

479
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:10,286
Thank you.

480
00:25:10,366 --> 00:25:11,633
Wait!

481
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,520
You must be low on sugar since
you have to move like lightning.

482
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,500
Here, have one of these.

483
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:24,320
Well, she was quick to fall for
that quick delivery guy.

484
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,986
Don't you think
that was too quick, though?

485
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:28,353
Well, let's eat.

486
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:30,853
Ah, Jung-rok! Here.

487
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:32,100
Ah, sure.

488
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,953
Didn't you take Yoon-seo with you?

489
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,120
Where is she?

490
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,353
She's at the Prosecutor's Office.

491
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:39,920
What?

492
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,153
Was she indicted again?

493
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:44,653
No, she went to transcribe
case records.

494
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,253
Oh, goodness.

495
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,100
Then you should've said so!

496
00:25:49,866 --> 00:25:51,786
Wait a second. You mean

497
00:25:51,866 --> 00:25:53,653
Yoon-seo's already onto
transcribing case records?

498
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:54,766
Sure.

499
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:58,153
She became a professional
in that short time?

500
00:25:58,233 --> 00:26:01,886
Goodness, she's one of us now,
isn't she?

501
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:03,186
I'm so touched. I truly am!

502
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:04,586
Aren't you guys?

503
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:06,966
At this rate, she could just
practice law next year.

504
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:13,086
That beef soup we had
wasn't bad.

505
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:15,153
No, it was perfect for
a cold day like this.

506
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:16,853
- Let's go there again next time.
- Sure.

507
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:20,553
- She's a DV victim!
- She's a DV victim!

508
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:24,186
- So why was she arrested?
- Why was she arrested?

509
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,086
It was for self-defense!

510
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,253
Sir, I've asked you this before,

511
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:30,586
but could you
give this case to me?

512
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:33,220
But why? The media has been
butchering this case.

513
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,820
Are you hungry for all the
attention from the media?

514
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,486
No, it's not like that.

515
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:39,553
It's just that her ex-husband
also died,

516
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:41,186
and something smells fishy.

517
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,686
Fishy? How?

518
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:44,286
Just hurry up back in.

519
00:26:44,366 --> 00:26:48,286
- She's a DV victim!
- She's a DV victim!

520
00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:52,053
- So why was she arrested?
- Why was she arrested?

521
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:56,053
- It was for self-defense!
- It was for self-defense!

522
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:57,053
Mr. Kwon?

523
00:26:57,133 --> 00:27:00,420
I found the records as per request
and e-mailed them to you.

524
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,886
All done perfectly.

525
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:03,353
Thank you.

526
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:07,153
You had a long day today,
so you can go home.

527
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:09,600
- Go home?
- Yes. Goodbye, then.

528
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:13,653
But it's only 3 p.m.

529
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,500
Can I really go home?

530
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:18,353
Well, since I'm here,

531
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:20,333
it'd be nice to see a trial.

532
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:22,786
Then you should.

533
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:23,933
Gosh, you scared me!

534
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:27,786
Yoon-seo, when there's a fire,
who should you seek?

535
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:28,820
Huh?

536
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,420
Well, I guess... The firefighter?

537
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,886
- And if you're mugged?
- The police?

538
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:35,486
And if you find there's
something you want?

539
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:36,700
Well, I...

540
00:27:37,266 --> 00:27:39,153
- Sorry?
- I'm the man to come to!

541
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:41,053
Me, Choi Yun-hyuk.

542
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:43,253
See, I happen to
have a trial right now.

543
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:44,320
It's pro bono.

544
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,553
In other words,
I'm a public defender today.

545
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:47,900
Bono... bono?

546
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:51,153
No, pro bono.

547
00:27:51,233 --> 00:27:52,553
It's kind of like volunteer work,

548
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:54,320
defending the disadvantaged
who cannot afford a lawyer,

549
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,433
for free.

550
00:27:58,733 --> 00:27:59,833
I say it's...

551
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:02,700
Noblesse oblige.

552
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:15,020
Excuse me, sunglasses aren't
allowed in Court.

553
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,186
Oh, sure.

554
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:18,186
Oh, that's right.

555
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:20,900
It's illegal to cover up
your face in Court.

556
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:25,486
Strict rules, huh?

557
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:28,686
Many tend to tense up
when they come to Court.

558
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:31,800
I'm more excited, than nervous.

559
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:34,666
Excited?

560
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:39,733
Is it because you're with me?

561
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,986
No, it's not like that.

562
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:46,686
See, I saw this
legal drama yesterday,

563
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,220
and it was so awesome.

564
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,433
So now I'm so excited to
see this for real!

565
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,733
All rise.

566
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:08,486
Our defendant, enraged over
an argument with our victim,

567
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:10,220
used his right fist to assault
the victim's face

568
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,886
and chest many times,

569
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:16,720
inflicting injuries that require
8 weeks for a full recovery.

570
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,886
What is your position on
the charges against you?

571
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,520
I'm telling you, I'm innocent!

572
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,820
He was the one
who punched me first.

573
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,120
Even if he did,
if you inflict injures that

574
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,120
require more than 8 weeks for
a full recovery,

575
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,766
you will be punished.

576
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,086
First punch?

577
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:32,233
Please.

578
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,053
The defendant, Ms. Kim Yun-ha,
claimed she's an acquaintance of

579
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:40,153
Ji-yong, from the popular
idol group Xteen,

580
00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:41,986
deceiving the victims,
Ms. Park Bo-ram and Ms. Son Min-ah,

581
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:43,586
into paying her $530

582
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:46,553
in exchange for his autograph.

583
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,786
Do you admit to the
charges brought against you?

584
00:29:48,866 --> 00:29:51,053
Yes, I do.

585
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:52,720
If you don't settle this
privately with the victims,

586
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,886
you may not escape punishment.

587
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:56,286
I already have.

588
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:57,466
Really?

589
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:59,733
But I don't see anything here.

590
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:02,053
It says here,

591
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:05,420
the victims refuses to settle
and wants you punished

592
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,686
since you're yet to
liquidate the debt.

593
00:30:06,766 --> 00:30:10,320
Oh. I did pay them back,
but not the whole amount.

594
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,353
So you claim
you paid them back partially.

595
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:15,553
How much did you pay back,
and to whom?

596
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:18,066
Well. I don't really remember.

597
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,420
Oh what?

598
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,853
Is she lying to the judge?

599
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:24,453
I know, right?

600
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:27,233
Tsk, talk about the
quality of the trial.

601
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:30,053
You should focus on the
next trial,

602
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:32,900
because the attorney with
insight and sharpness...

603
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,966
...is next, and that's me.

604
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,620
Your Honor.

605
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,186
The defendant is a single mother
of two children...

606
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:48,566
Hold on.

607
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:52,586
It says here that
she has no children.

608
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:53,733
What?

609
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:56,500
You told me you have kids!

610
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,020
Oh, I meant my cats.

611
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,666
They're really like my own!

612
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,120
Anyway,

613
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,220
Your Honor.

614
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:19,820
The defendant is a single mother
of two cats,

615
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,353
and also has a reputation
in the neighborhood

616
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:25,920
for being a filial daughter to
her mother.

617
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,120
But, because of that
one wrong decision...

618
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,386
No!

619
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:33,753
I never made a wrong decision.

620
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:35,586
It wasn't my fault!

621
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:37,533
I never admitted I'm guilty!

622
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:43,800
Please, just stay still...!

623
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,386
- Yoon-seo.
- Yes?

624
00:31:55,466 --> 00:31:59,066
I may have lost today,
but it wasn't a defeat.

625
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,153
- Sorry?
- My defendant had

626
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:03,520
clearly committed a crime,

627
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,220
and now she'll be punished.

628
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,020
That means justice has
triumphed in the end.

629
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,186
So although I lost, justice won,

630
00:32:09,266 --> 00:32:10,766
so it's not defeat.

631
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,800
What does that mean, exactly?

632
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:17,586
Anyway,

633
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:20,020
I must go and talk to my client.

634
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,020
Sure, go ahead first.

635
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,600
I'll see you in the
office tomorrow.

636
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,786
I guess not all lawyers are
competent and

637
00:32:33,866 --> 00:32:36,786
charismatic like my Mr. Kwon.
Goodness!

638
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:38,220
What was that just now?

639
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,953
"My" Mr. Kwon?

640
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:42,686
God, I must be crazy!

641
00:32:42,766 --> 00:32:43,866
Goodness.

642
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,653
- Yes?
- Yoon-seo, it's me, Su-cheol.

643
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:51,553
I've just arrived.

644
00:32:51,633 --> 00:32:52,886
I'll see you at the entrance.

645
00:32:52,966 --> 00:32:55,320
Sure, hold on.

646
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,986
Do you need coffee or anything?

647
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:59,220
I'll get it for you.

648
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,866
No, it's alright.

649
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,220
Wait!

650
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,886
There should be a bookstore
right across the street.

651
00:33:06,966 --> 00:33:08,986
Can you get me some books?

652
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:11,153
Whether it's on civil or
penal code, it doesn't matter.

653
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:13,533
Just get me everything
you can find on law.

654
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:30,266
New message!

655
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,866
I received your email.
Thank you for today.

656
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,720
Tsk...

657
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,000
Even his texts are so formal.

658
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,353
Mr. Kwon,

659
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:59,053
I bought some books
so I can brush up on law again.

660
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:00,986
128 dollars' worth!

661
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:04,633
I'll study hard so I can be
of use to you.

662
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,833
You've been assigned a case.

663
00:34:21,766 --> 00:34:23,833
It's the pro bono that
you applied last month.

664
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,386
She's still in high school.
Was it Ji-yong from Xteen?

665
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:30,886
Anyway, she lied to her friends
that she'll get his autograph,

666
00:34:30,966 --> 00:34:33,920
and took money from them.

667
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,086
But she's still so young,
you know?

668
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:38,253
So please look into it for me.

669
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:39,400
Sure.

670
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,686
You want me to somehow
obtain a written petition?

671
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:45,453
It'll help with the ruling.

672
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:48,686
But uh... I happened to see that
trial yesterday

673
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:50,186
when I followed Mr. Choi to
observe his trial,

674
00:34:50,266 --> 00:34:52,820
and it's quite clear that
she's guilty.

675
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,220
Whether she's guilty or not is

676
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,286
up to the judge to decide.

677
00:34:55,366 --> 00:34:58,053
My duty is to defend her.

678
00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:00,153
But she scammed her friends

679
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:01,886
and lied to the judge.

680
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,866
There's really no saving her.

681
00:35:05,966 --> 00:35:07,486
Do you think it's possible to

682
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:09,886
only defend clients
who aren't guilty?

683
00:35:09,966 --> 00:35:11,553
No, but...

684
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:14,153
I already informed Ms. Yang,
so on your way now.

685
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:16,166
Alright, then.

686
00:35:28,433 --> 00:35:29,986
Um, Ms. Yang?

687
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:33,153
Mr. Kwon asked me to get
a written petition,

688
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:34,553
so when shall we head out?

689
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,220
Oh no.

690
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,486
I just got a text
from my daughter,

691
00:35:38,566 --> 00:35:41,053
and she's just come down with
a cold and went home.

692
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:43,786
There's no one else at home to
look after her,

693
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:46,920
so I think I should go and
take an early leave, too.

694
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,800
Of course you should go, yes!

695
00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:52,286
But what about the petition?

696
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:53,920
Why don't I come with you?

697
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,286
- With... you?
- Yes.

698
00:35:56,366 --> 00:35:58,486
I've much experience from
my detective days.

699
00:35:58,566 --> 00:35:59,633
Oh.

700
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:03,253
I'll go with her,
so please go ahead.

701
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,966
Thank you so much.

702
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,920
Here, the Lim Yun-hee case.

703
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,153
The woman who murdered her
DV husband.

704
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:19,820
Weren't you going to
assign it to Mr. Lim?

705
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,720
Is this because of the feminists?

706
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,786
Yep.

707
00:36:22,866 --> 00:36:25,653
People are already saying
it's a witch hunt.

708
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:27,320
So the higher-ups have decided

709
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,453
it's best that a female
prosecutor handles the case.

710
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:31,553
And I personally agree, too.

711
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:32,586
So I'm the shield, am I?

712
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:34,286
So you don't want to take it?

713
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:35,953
No, I'll take it.

714
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:38,420
I was personally
interested in this case.

715
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,053
Handle this case well,

716
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:42,920
and I'll send you to wherever
it is you want to go,

717
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,420
so do your best.

718
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,933
I'll do my best, sir.

719
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:51,900
Hey, Yu Yeo-reum!

720
00:36:53,366 --> 00:36:54,466
What's with him now?

721
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:58,066
- Yes?
- Where are your morals?

722
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,453
Were you that
desperate for success?

723
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:02,486
Did you want to climb the
ladder that badly,

724
00:37:02,566 --> 00:37:03,986
going as far as stealing the case
I had dibs on?

725
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:07,153
As far as I know, it was
never assigned to you.

726
00:37:07,233 --> 00:37:08,920
Oh, so you just snatched it?

727
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,986
As you said, I thought it was
an opportunity to

728
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:13,553
climb the ladder,
so I didn't refuse, that's all.

729
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:14,700
Hey!

730
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,153
Please, that's enough.

731
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:19,853
Hey, let go.

732
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:21,986
Didn't you see her attitude?

733
00:37:22,066 --> 00:37:24,333
Later. Let's talk later.

734
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,833
Oh what?

735
00:37:34,266 --> 00:37:35,600
Get your acts straight.

736
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,233
Because I'll be watching you.

737
00:37:41,866 --> 00:37:42,953
What's with Prosecutor Lim?

738
00:37:43,033 --> 00:37:46,153
- Oh, please. Prosecutor Yu.
- Sir!

739
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:48,986
- What's with him?
- Yu stole Lim's case.

740
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,286
How could she steal
her senior's case?

741
00:37:50,366 --> 00:37:51,986
Right?

742
00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:53,053
Really?

743
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:54,420
She's got a reputation,
didn't you know?

744
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,120
- Whoa.
- I knew she'd cause trouble.

745
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,420
She stole a case?

746
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,886
She did? What case?

747
00:38:00,966 --> 00:38:02,953
Oh, about that DV husband?

748
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:05,166
That Yu Yeo-reum...
She's unbelievable.

749
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:22,266
- Um, ma'am?
- Yes?

750
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,553
This is for you,
in case you have indigestion.

751
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:27,620
They're pills to
help with that.

752
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,053
How did you know?

753
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:33,100
Prosecutor Kim Se-won
asked me to pass them on.

754
00:38:51,233 --> 00:38:52,666
I'm quite busy.

755
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:55,353
Here.

756
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,420
I heard it's from you.

757
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,633
I don't need it.

758
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,586
Anything more you want to say?

759
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:08,453
I don't want any more of this
unwanted kindness from you.

760
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:10,720
It's completely over for us.

761
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,266
What's over for us?

762
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:18,720
I guess you don't know
because you're selfish,

763
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,553
but this much kindness is the norm
between colleagues.

764
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:25,586
So don't you be mistaken about us.

765
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:27,253
I won't be.

766
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:29,586
Don't worry.

767
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,053
Is that all you've got to say?

768
00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:32,233
Yes.

769
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:06,453
Oh, um...

770
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:08,120
If you're bothered that
someone may recognize you,

771
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,420
you can just stay in the car.

772
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,586
No, it's alright.

773
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:13,920
I've been going to all sorts of
places lately,

774
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,820
but no one's managed to
recognize me!

775
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,553
Then, shall we go?

776
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:20,766
- For that written petition?
- Sure.

777
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:23,286
Written petition?

778
00:40:23,366 --> 00:40:25,386
There's no way
I'll write one for her.

779
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:28,220
Besides, do you think that's the
only lie she told us?

780
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,453
She told us that
her grandmother is the

781
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:31,353
most famous shaman in Korea!

782
00:40:31,433 --> 00:40:32,920
And that she inherited her blood

783
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,853
and will soon undergo
the same ritual.

784
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,020
But it turns out
she doesn't have a grandmother.

785
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,986
She told me she has end-stage
esophageal cancer.

786
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:40,620
So I took pity on her
and was nice to her,

787
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,153
but it turns out
that was a lie, too!

788
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:44,753
I say it's more
end-stage mythomania!

789
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,420
She's an attention seeker.

790
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,586
She also claims she was a trainee
at Yeon Entertainment, but ha!

791
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:52,166
Anyway,

792
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,153
I don't want to,
even if she begs like this.

793
00:40:56,233 --> 00:40:57,466
Um...

794
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:02,000
What's this?

795
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,653
Is it true that you're close with
Ji-yong from Xteen?

796
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:07,686
If you two are close,

797
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:09,533
then why didn't you get his
autograph for your friends?

798
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,986
Just because?

799
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:15,620
Why were you trying to
sell the autographs?

800
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,320
Because I don't have money.

801
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,453
If you needed money,

802
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:20,153
you could have
talked with your parents.

803
00:41:20,233 --> 00:41:21,766
I don't have parents.

804
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,620
On your register,

805
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,400
it says you do.

806
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,386
That brat is lying again!

807
00:41:33,466 --> 00:41:35,653
It'll be in your favor to

808
00:41:35,733 --> 00:41:37,286
pay that money back to
the victims.

809
00:41:37,366 --> 00:41:38,566
But I spent it all.

810
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,520
Excuse me,

811
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,386
do you think Mr. Kwon is
one of your classmates?

812
00:41:45,466 --> 00:41:46,700
Why do you keep on lying to him?

813
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:49,400
Who are you, anyway?

814
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,553
- Oh Yoon-seo?
- I look much like her, huh?

815
00:41:54,633 --> 00:41:55,686
But no.

816
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:58,286
I'm not her. Don't get me wrong.

817
00:41:58,366 --> 00:42:00,953
I saw you at the trial yesterday,

818
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:03,886
and you were lying to
the judge too, weren't you?

819
00:42:03,966 --> 00:42:05,066
And...

820
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:08,420
I just met with your friends,

821
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,486
and every one of them told me
how you deceived them!

822
00:42:11,566 --> 00:42:14,986
Anyone can see that
you'll be sentenced guilty now,

823
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:18,153
yet Mr. Kwon here stepped forward
to help you.

824
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:19,720
So is this the way to treat him?

825
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,886
Stay out of this.

826
00:42:20,966 --> 00:42:22,020
You're just a washed-up celebrity.

827
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,053
Washed-up...

828
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:24,766
Are you done talking?

829
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,353
What do you think you're doing?

830
00:42:26,433 --> 00:42:28,366
Yeah, what do you think
you're doing?

831
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:30,753
I mean you, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

832
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:31,920
Me?

833
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,400
What, you don't mean her?

834
00:42:35,966 --> 00:42:37,386
So that's your real name?

835
00:42:37,466 --> 00:42:39,386
It's not Jin-sim!

836
00:42:39,466 --> 00:42:40,933
And I'm not Oh Yoon-seo, either!

837
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,153
Why did you have to interrupt us?

838
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:54,820
Well, she kept lying, so...

839
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,620
The first meeting between
the lawyer and the client is

840
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,553
the key step to finding
a way to solve the case.

841
00:42:58,633 --> 00:43:00,186
the key step to finding
a way to solve the case.

842
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:00,753
So why did you have to interrupt
when I'm trying to get the

843
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:03,420
truth on the whole story?

844
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,253
Interrupt you?

845
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,420
Don't you get it already?

846
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,520
She has no intention of
telling the truth.

847
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,986
I went to see if anyone will
write a petition for her,

848
00:43:11,066 --> 00:43:13,153
but none of her friends
believed in her anymore.

849
00:43:13,233 --> 00:43:15,553
It just shows how much
they had to put up with her!

850
00:43:15,633 --> 00:43:18,586
I just thought you didn't
need to waste your time,

851
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:20,220
listening to those
nonsense lies...

852
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,986
It's not up to you decide on

853
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,986
whether I will accept
this case or not.

854
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:25,820
Doing your best and impending on
my duties are different.

855
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,453
This is clearly
an act of arrogation,

856
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:29,486
so I hope you won't cross the line
any more than this.

857
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:33,120
I was only trying to help you,

858
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,920
so hearing you
put it that way is...

859
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,333
It's so disappointing.

860
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,786
Don't be emotional.

861
00:43:42,866 --> 00:43:45,200
Your attitude doesn't help at all.

862
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:53,753
Eat up,

863
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:55,320
and stop playing with your food.

864
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,466
They say nothing beats a good rest
for beating the cold.

865
00:43:59,066 --> 00:44:00,886
I already had plenty.

866
00:44:00,966 --> 00:44:02,386
I'm going to go rest.

867
00:44:02,466 --> 00:44:04,320
But you should eat more.

868
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,200
That's right.
You should take your meds.

869
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,766
That's right, water.

870
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:16,466
Jin-hee, here's your water.

871
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,000
What... are you doing?

872
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,900
Here.

873
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:38,366
I made copies, as you requested.

874
00:44:40,966 --> 00:44:41,986
There's five.

875
00:44:42,066 --> 00:44:43,453
I only asked for three.

876
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:44,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

877
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,520
I made more copies than
you asked me to.

878
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,386
This is also an act of
arrogation, right?

879
00:44:49,466 --> 00:44:51,300
I'll watch myself.

880
00:44:52,966 --> 00:44:55,020
What are you doing?

881
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,120
Oh, that's right.

882
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,120
You told me not to get emotional,

883
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,966
so sorry I'm being emotional,
still bearing a grudge.

884
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:03,986
Ah! Before you despise me for
not going home on time,

885
00:45:04,066 --> 00:45:05,333
I'll take my leave.

886
00:45:06,566 --> 00:45:07,666
Alright, then.

887
00:45:11,266 --> 00:45:12,400
Alright, then.

888
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:24,153
Ha! Act of arrogation?

889
00:45:24,233 --> 00:45:26,500
Don't get emotional?

890
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,866
I was only trying to help!

891
00:46:04,133 --> 00:46:06,886
The coffee tastes so good
after we changed the beans!

892
00:46:06,966 --> 00:46:07,886
Well...

893
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:09,220
I'm not so sure.

894
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,753
Because when it comes to coffee,

895
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:13,686
nothing beats Einspanner
from Vienna.

896
00:46:13,766 --> 00:46:18,020
Last winter, I took an impulse
trip to Vienna,

897
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,900
and as soon as I had a sip of that
bittersweet Einspanner...

898
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:26,800
I still can't forget that
very moment.

899
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:35,753
I thought you two were
too quiet for awhile.

900
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:36,920
Did you guys fight again?

901
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,120
I wouldn't call it a fight...

902
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,533
But something happened, huh?

903
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,333
Don't just bottle it in,
but let it out.

904
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,700
Well, uh...

905
00:46:51,933 --> 00:46:54,253
You know that highschooler that
Mr. Kwon is defending?

906
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:57,020
Well, she was even
lying to him as well!

907
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,886
I mean, how could you lie to
someone who's offered to help?

908
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:01,053
I mean, how could you lie to
someone who's offered to help?

909
00:47:01,133 --> 00:47:03,053
So as a grown-up,

910
00:47:03,133 --> 00:47:04,453
and as his secretary,

911
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:07,153
I gave her a lecture that
that's not the way to go,

912
00:47:07,233 --> 00:47:09,386
and Mr. Kwon took her side!

913
00:47:09,466 --> 00:47:10,953
My goodness.

914
00:47:11,033 --> 00:47:13,420
I'd like to lecture
Mr. Kwon, then.

915
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,153
That was too harsh, Kwon!

916
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:16,486
Whatever.

917
00:47:16,566 --> 00:47:18,920
Mr. Kwon is absolutely right.

918
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,953
It's not our place to
interrupt the conversation

919
00:47:22,033 --> 00:47:24,120
between attorneys and
their clients.

920
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,386
By the way, why did she even
do what she did?

921
00:47:27,466 --> 00:47:29,453
Probably because
she needed the money?

922
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:32,120
I guess she's not well-off to
go pro bono.

923
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,953
Well, she'll be coming in
with her parents later today,

924
00:47:35,033 --> 00:47:36,800
so we'll see.

925
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,700
What, she's here by herself?

926
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:52,086
I thought I asked you to
come with your parents.

927
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:53,633
They're busy people.

928
00:47:56,066 --> 00:47:58,033
Can I have their number, then?

929
00:47:58,633 --> 00:47:59,786
They don't have a cellphone.

930
00:47:59,866 --> 00:48:01,753
Then at least their work number.

931
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:02,953
I'm sure there's a phone
in their office.

932
00:48:03,033 --> 00:48:05,020
Oh, that's right.

933
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,700
They quit work just yesterday.

934
00:48:13,366 --> 00:48:14,586
I've no more to say.

935
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:16,100
Can I go now?

936
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:20,586
If you keep up that
attitude in Court,

937
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:22,453
you may face
additional punishment.

938
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:24,766
That may mean imprisonment.

939
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,166
Are you trying to scare me?

940
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,386
You know what?

941
00:48:31,466 --> 00:48:33,286
That sort of thing
doesn't scare me at all.

942
00:48:33,366 --> 00:48:35,320
You're trying to act like
you don't care,

943
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,253
but to me, it's like
your crying out for help.

944
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:39,520
- Just what...
- The trial will start soon,

945
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,786
and those people with the
authority to take your freedom

946
00:48:40,866 --> 00:48:42,620
will gather in Court.

947
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,600
And their decision may leave
a record in your criminal history.

948
00:48:48,433 --> 00:48:50,253
And in that trial,
the only person who can help you

949
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:51,320
is me.

950
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,953
So if you want help,

951
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:54,600
you can start by trusting me.

952
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,153
Trust you? Ha!

953
00:48:57,233 --> 00:48:58,566
No thanks.

954
00:49:09,733 --> 00:49:12,533
God, why's she such a liar?

955
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,466
And why won't she shut the door?

956
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:19,120
I can't go on the weekend.

957
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,333
I think I should time with
Jin-hee instead.

958
00:49:23,366 --> 00:49:25,586
I thought Jin-hee had
all grown up,

959
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:29,553
without going through any trouble,

960
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,653
but I guess she was
actually quite lonely.

961
00:49:31,733 --> 00:49:35,453
I'm her only family,
but I've been too busy.

962
00:49:35,533 --> 00:49:38,353
She said she took an early leave
because she was sick,

963
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,353
and it turns out
she was only lying.

964
00:49:41,433 --> 00:49:44,553
She was pretending to be sick
so she could get my attention.

965
00:49:44,633 --> 00:49:45,900
Attention?

966
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,253
Yun-ha? Ah, Kim Yun-ha!

967
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:54,920
Right, she was a trainee here
until last year.

968
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,186
Really?

969
00:49:56,266 --> 00:49:57,886
So she was a trainee?

970
00:49:57,966 --> 00:50:00,120
Yes. But last year...

971
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,586
She failed to make the
final cut for our group,

972
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,020
so we let her go.

973
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,686
She joined us
when she was fourteen,

974
00:50:06,766 --> 00:50:08,420
so I guess she was here for
about five years?

975
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,220
You know Ji-yong from
Xteen, right?

976
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,786
He was her audition buddy,

977
00:50:11,866 --> 00:50:13,253
so they were quite close.

978
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:16,286
But Ji-yong moved to
JD Entertainment

979
00:50:16,366 --> 00:50:18,320
and debuted there, and
it all worked out for him.

980
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,733
Whereas it didn't really,
for Yun-ha.

981
00:50:21,766 --> 00:50:23,086
You see,

982
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:24,686
she had talent,

983
00:50:24,766 --> 00:50:26,586
but was it because
her family's not well-off?

984
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:28,686
She'd never show up for training!

985
00:50:28,766 --> 00:50:30,186
Because she had to work
part-time or whatever.

986
00:50:30,266 --> 00:50:31,420
So what if she trained here
for five years,

987
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,886
when she never got any better?

988
00:50:32,966 --> 00:50:34,953
In the end, we had no choice
but to let her go.

989
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:37,000
But why do you ask?

990
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,500
It's nothing.

991
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,266
Did she go astray because
she was kicked out?

992
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,066
Thanks for all the hard work.

993
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,153
Hyuk-jun, thanks for taking care
of me these past couple of days.

994
00:50:55,233 --> 00:50:56,620
I bet it was a full schedule
in a long time,

995
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,120
since you're stuck with Yoon-seo
who's got no work.

996
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,953
Nah. Thanks for everything!

997
00:51:00,033 --> 00:51:02,353
Hyuk-jun, I really like
the way you work.

998
00:51:02,433 --> 00:51:03,786
Can't you just join my team?

999
00:51:03,866 --> 00:51:05,266
Come on, don't say that!

1000
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,053
You know I've worked with
Yoon-seo for years,

1001
00:51:07,133 --> 00:51:08,153
so don't say that.

1002
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:09,753
That's exactly my point.

1003
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:12,720
Because I don't think she'll have
work coming in, ever.

1004
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,586
I mean, everyone else has
said the same thing.

1005
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:17,620
That her image has been
completely ruined,

1006
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,253
so it'll be almost impossible for
her to make a comeback.

1007
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,000
Hey, Kim Min-ji!

1008
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,033
Yun... Yoon-seo...

1009
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,220
Why, Yoon-seo.
It's been a long time.

1010
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,320
Don't take
what I just said to heart.

1011
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,220
I was simply sorry to see
Hyuk-jun go to waste.

1012
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:39,320
I mean, everyone knows you're at
the edge of the cliff,

1013
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,386
so what if he falls with you too,

1014
00:51:40,466 --> 00:51:43,386
by continuing to stay next to you?

1015
00:51:43,466 --> 00:51:44,666
Am I not right?

1016
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:49,253
Gosh, I need to be at a meeting
for an ad I'm doing.

1017
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:52,186
You were busy once too,

1018
00:51:52,266 --> 00:51:53,666
so you understand, right?

1019
00:51:58,166 --> 00:52:00,353
Hey. What do you think
you're doing?

1020
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:01,353
What the hell?

1021
00:52:01,433 --> 00:52:03,433
Are you crazy?

1022
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,986
Yes, I'm crazy.

1023
00:52:06,066 --> 00:52:08,120
Do you think I'll still be sane

1024
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,453
when you're looking down
at me like that?

1025
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:10,753
Stop it, Yoon-seo!

1026
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:13,333
Oh what the hell?

1027
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:16,720
- Why are you doing this?
- Hey, are you crazy?

1028
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,466
They must've both gone crazy!

1029
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:22,053
No, you can't take pictures!

1030
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:23,320
You can't take pictures!

1031
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,266
If you take pictures...
Block the cameras!

1032
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:28,633
Hey, let go of me!

1033
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,100
I said, let go!

1034
00:52:31,366 --> 00:52:33,266
You're so dead today.

1035
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,053
Wow, what a great view.

1036
00:52:51,133 --> 00:52:54,020
Doesn't it feel much better,

1037
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,266
being out in the open?

1038
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,233
No...?

1039
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,686
Yoon-seo, I'll pop out and

1040
00:53:01,766 --> 00:53:03,353
get you some sweet coffee.

1041
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:05,553
Sweet things help you
cheer up, right?

1042
00:53:05,633 --> 00:53:07,000
Wait right here.

1043
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,553
Yoon-seo.

1044
00:53:57,633 --> 00:54:00,320
Why don't we just go home?

1045
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,786
Let's call the office and
tell them you're not well.

1046
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:04,666
In this condition, you...

1047
00:54:05,233 --> 00:54:06,320
No, it's alright.

1048
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,033
I'm much better.

1049
00:54:14,566 --> 00:54:15,700
Hyuk-jun,

1050
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:20,386
I'm going to finish
this 3-month project

1051
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,133
successfully, no matter what,

1052
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,100
and definitely return on screen
as an actress.

1053
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,033
To prove to the world
that they were wrong.

1054
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,833
And Hyuk-jun?

1055
00:54:35,066 --> 00:54:36,200
Yeah?

1056
00:54:36,766 --> 00:54:39,100
Don't ever lie to me, ever again.

1057
00:54:40,233 --> 00:54:42,786
I'll forgive you this time,
but there's no second time.

1058
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:45,233
- You know that, right?
- Of course I do.

1059
00:54:45,966 --> 00:54:47,400
I'll be good to you.

1060
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:10,320
Yes, Detective.

1061
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,053
Yes, I received a call
from Yun-ha.

1062
00:55:12,133 --> 00:55:15,353
I'm on my way to the station, yes.

1063
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:17,520
What was that? Police station?

1064
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,053
Did something happen to Yun-ha?

1065
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:20,986
She's been sued by the
mother of the victim,

1066
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:22,286
and is at the station right now.

1067
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:24,120
As for you, Ms. Oh,
you can just go home.

1068
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,333
I'll come. Take me with you.

1069
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,600
Alright, let's go.

1070
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:45,820
So... Why did she call you,

1071
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,020
instead of calling
her parents first?

1072
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,653
Yun-ha hasn't heard from
her parents for years.

1073
00:55:50,733 --> 00:55:53,120
What? Haven't heard from them?

1074
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,186
Her mother left home
when she was little,

1075
00:55:55,266 --> 00:55:57,520
and she hasn't heard from
her father since two years ago.

1076
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,666
Oh...

1077
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:03,220
Many eyes will be there watching,

1078
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,420
so why don't you just
wait in the car?

1079
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,666
Oh...

1080
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,800
Alright.

1081
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,953
Um, wait.

1082
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:13,353
She really was a trainee
at Yeon Entertainment,

1083
00:56:13,433 --> 00:56:15,920
and it's true that she was
close with Ji-yong.

1084
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,686
So what I mean is...

1085
00:56:17,766 --> 00:56:21,733
She's not such a brat,
so take good care of her.

1086
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:36,520
Please, ma'am.

1087
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,820
Please calm down.

1088
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,686
No, I don't need any of this.

1089
00:56:39,766 --> 00:56:41,666
Just lock her up now!

1090
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:44,686
I'm Kwon Jung-rok,
Ms. Kim Yun-ha's lawyer.

1091
00:56:44,766 --> 00:56:46,886
- What's going on?
- Well,

1092
00:56:46,966 --> 00:56:49,486
she barged into our house
and caused a scene.

1093
00:56:49,566 --> 00:56:51,353
I didn't cause a scene.

1094
00:56:51,433 --> 00:56:52,853
I was only trying to
apologize to Min-ah.

1095
00:56:52,933 --> 00:56:53,853
My goodness,

1096
00:56:53,933 --> 00:56:57,586
if we thought you were causing
a scene, then you were!

1097
00:56:57,666 --> 00:57:00,020
You wanted that letter,
is that why you barged in?

1098
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,386
Just unbelievable!

1099
00:57:01,466 --> 00:57:04,453
I hear you don't have parents
and live all by yourself.

1100
00:57:04,533 --> 00:57:06,353
Is it because you had
no one to teach you manners?

1101
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:08,933
Because you don't even know
what basic manners are, huh?

1102
00:57:09,466 --> 00:57:11,286
Please watch your language.

1103
00:57:11,366 --> 00:57:13,853
Your words just now could be
considered defamation.

1104
00:57:13,933 --> 00:57:15,253
- Sorry?
- And

1105
00:57:15,333 --> 00:57:16,353
there is a clear difference between

1106
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,386
causing a scene and

1107
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:19,086
coming to visit you to apologize.

1108
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:20,253
If it's revealed that

1109
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:22,720
she had come to apologize,
but you had falsely reported her

1110
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,320
as causing a scene, you may be
punished for calumny.

1111
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,053
What... Don't bite at
every one of my words!

1112
00:57:27,133 --> 00:57:28,820
I'm just simply upset, that's all!

1113
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,233
I've had enough!

1114
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,186
You do realize that
she's a con, right?

1115
00:57:34,266 --> 00:57:35,786
She lied to my daughter,

1116
00:57:35,866 --> 00:57:37,586
saying she's friends with
some celebrity,

1117
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:38,753
to get money off her.

1118
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:39,786
The Court's yet to rule whether
it is fraud or not,

1119
00:57:39,866 --> 00:57:41,420
The Court's yet to rule whether
it is fraud or not,

1120
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,153
so if you go around
accusing her of fraud,

1121
00:57:43,233 --> 00:57:44,453
that's defamation.

1122
00:57:44,533 --> 00:57:46,220
What...

1123
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,100
Every word I say is a crime?

1124
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:50,620
Detective,

1125
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,053
this case is still under trial

1126
00:57:52,133 --> 00:57:54,720
so I think there's no more for
you to do at this point.

1127
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,720
And it seems this lady has
been mistaken, too.

1128
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,053
She was asked to accompany you
voluntarily anyway,

1129
00:57:59,133 --> 00:58:00,953
so I'll take her from here.

1130
00:58:01,033 --> 00:58:02,700
- Sure, you do that.
- Thank you.

1131
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:08,833
Let's go.

1132
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:27,086
How did it go?

1133
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:28,853
Has everything been settled?

1134
00:58:28,933 --> 00:58:30,800
What about you? Are you alright?

1135
00:58:42,433 --> 00:58:44,686
Come on, eat up!

1136
00:58:44,766 --> 00:58:46,966
I said I don't have the appetite.

1137
00:58:47,366 --> 00:58:49,466
Um, this is from
an important client, so...

1138
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:50,933
Hello?

1139
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,566
Why are you looking at me
like that?

1140
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,986
Yun-ha.

1141
00:59:04,066 --> 00:59:05,400
It's tough, isn't it?

1142
00:59:07,666 --> 00:59:10,420
You made up all those lies

1143
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,500
because it's been tough
and lonely for you, huh?

1144
00:59:12,766 --> 00:59:14,620
Because you wanted to be loved.

1145
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:15,820
What are you on about?

1146
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,420
You're making me cringe.

1147
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,820
Why?

1148
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,820
Is wanting to be loved

1149
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,200
something to be ashamed of?

1150
00:59:33,433 --> 00:59:34,833
Fine, you're right.

1151
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,786
I'm Oh Yoon-seo.

1152
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:40,866
And like you said, I'm
a washed-up celebrity.

1153
00:59:41,966 --> 00:59:42,886
That's...

1154
00:59:42,966 --> 00:59:44,753
People told me,

1155
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:47,120
that I am now washed-up,

1156
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,233
and that it'll be hard for me to
make a comeback.

1157
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:52,033
That I'm standing at
the edge of a cliff.

1158
00:59:54,733 --> 00:59:55,933
But you know, I...

1159
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,233
I want to be loved again,
like before.

1160
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,686
I want to return to
where I was, shining brightly.

1161
01:00:06,766 --> 01:00:09,053
Is that something to be
ashamed of?

1162
01:00:09,133 --> 01:00:11,000
Well, uh...

1163
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,886
I think I know how you feel.

1164
01:00:17,966 --> 01:00:19,953
You only had your eyes on
making your debut,

1165
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,200
but you were pushed out
from that world.

1166
01:00:23,566 --> 01:00:26,633
It seemed like the
world was over for you,

1167
01:00:28,566 --> 01:00:32,566
and you were lonely, because
you felt you had no one.

1168
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:37,666
But you know what, Yun-ha?

1169
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:42,220
Don't abuse yourself.

1170
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,133
What you're doing now...

1171
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,986
You're hurting yourself the most,

1172
01:00:47,066 --> 01:00:50,033
not other people.

1173
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:04,020
Maybe I shouldn't have
said this to you?

1174
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,253
I was scared,

1175
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:07,566
to be honest.

1176
01:01:12,966 --> 01:01:15,200
If I told everyone
the truth about me,

1177
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,000
I thought I won't be loved.

1178
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:23,133
So I started lying,

1179
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:30,720
and when I realized it,

1180
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,986
those lies just grew bigger
and bigger.

1181
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,186
No, it's never too late,

1182
01:01:37,266 --> 01:01:38,753
to turn things back.

1183
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:40,653
So...

1184
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:43,186
Don't ever give up on yourself.

1185
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,053
I'm sorry.

1186
01:01:45,133 --> 01:01:46,666
What I did was wrong.

1187
01:01:57,833 --> 01:01:59,000
Don't cry.

1188
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:18,853
Under Article 347 of
the Criminal Law,

1189
01:02:18,933 --> 01:02:21,086
the defendant, Kim Yun-ha, is
hereby charged with fraud.

1190
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:23,286
the defendant, Kim Yun-ha, is
hereby charged with fraud.

1191
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:25,733
Defense Counsel, do you accept the
content of the indictment?

1192
01:02:27,133 --> 01:02:29,633
No, we plead not true.

1193
01:02:31,866 --> 01:02:34,653
The defendant pleads not guilty.

1194
01:02:34,733 --> 01:02:38,520
But in the last hearing,
she confessed to everything.

1195
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,753
So why change your position to
not guilty?

1196
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:43,920
The criminal offence of fraud is
defined as

1197
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,120
committing a fraudulent act
for the

1198
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,553
purpose of monetary gain or
other benefits.

1199
01:02:47,633 --> 01:02:49,120
However, no act of
fraudulence, one of the

1200
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,220
requisites for fraud
to be established,

1201
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,266
was committed by the defendant.

1202
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,253
The defendant is
a former idol trainee,

1203
01:02:57,333 --> 01:03:00,653
and she is well acquainted with
Ji-yong from Xteen,

1204
01:03:00,733 --> 01:03:03,920
who used to train with her
under the same agency.

1205
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:04,920
She told the victims

1206
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,953
she will get the autograph of
the said idol group member,

1207
01:03:08,033 --> 01:03:10,020
because she thought it was
quite possible,

1208
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:13,720
based on their friendship.

1209
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,386
Because there is no deliberance to
her actions,

1210
01:03:15,466 --> 01:03:17,153
Because there is no deliberance to
her actions,

1211
01:03:17,233 --> 01:03:19,066
the defendant pleads not guilty.

1212
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,853
Do you think the Court will
rule not guilty?

1213
01:03:29,933 --> 01:03:32,266
In my opinion, it's almost a 100%.

1214
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:37,120
Here I was, only thinking about
how to reduce her sentence.

1215
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,686
But you found a way to
make her not guilty,

1216
01:03:39,766 --> 01:03:41,666
and that's amazing.

1217
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,720
I'm sorry.

1218
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,020
Pardon?

1219
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:57,120
I told you not to get emotional

1220
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,286
and that an attitude like that
won't ever help.

1221
01:04:00,366 --> 01:04:01,766
But let me apologize for my words.

1222
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,553
Thanks to your emotional lecture,

1223
01:04:06,633 --> 01:04:08,433
I was able to convince Yun-ha.

1224
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,686
I didn't do anything...

1225
01:04:11,766 --> 01:04:14,266
Well done, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

1226
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,533
Please say that again.

1227
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,453
What?

1228
01:04:36,533 --> 01:04:40,120
Please compliment me again.

1229
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,020
What you said before.

1230
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,033
It was really nice,
hearing those words.

1231
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,033
Please, just one more time.

1232
01:05:05,766 --> 01:05:07,066
Well done.

1233
01:05:11,233 --> 01:05:14,000
Well done, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

1234
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,886
Be my private tutor tomorrow,
as my reward.

1235
01:06:01,966 --> 01:06:04,486
This is like a campus date!

1236
01:06:04,566 --> 01:06:07,320
My secretary said she wanted to
study up on law.

1237
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,486
We were only there to study,
that's all!

1238
01:06:08,566 --> 01:06:11,453
I can't believe I'm finally
seeing you go on a date.

1239
01:06:11,533 --> 01:06:13,653
It's not like,

1240
01:06:13,733 --> 01:06:15,653
I'm interested in Mr. Kwon.

1241
01:06:15,733 --> 01:06:16,720
Kwon Jung-rok!

1242
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,320
- Yeo-reum.
- Was her name Yeo-reum?

1243
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,120
He totally let his guard down
in front of her!

1244
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,053
Why are you so loose?

1245
01:06:23,133 --> 01:06:24,686
That's the first time
I'm hearing such a thing.

1246
01:06:24,766 --> 01:06:26,086
You acting like that...

1247
01:06:26,166 --> 01:06:27,086
It's as if you're jealous.

1248
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:29,253
Jealous? No way.

1249
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:30,386
So what? What about it?

1250
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:31,886
I'm jealous.

1251
01:06:31,966 --> 01:06:35,366
I have something to tell you.
