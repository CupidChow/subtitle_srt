(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:46,353
I'm more scared about seeing you
disappear from by my side,

3
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:49,786
rather than missing this opportunity
because of a scandal.

4
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:51,000
So…

5
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,166
Let's start again.

6
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:03,066
You're really going to
let me go like this?

7
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,533
Even if you might…

8
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,700
…never see me again?

9
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:37,700
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

10
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,666
I love you.

11
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,666
(Episode 15)

12
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:30,386
We're here already.

13
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:32,200
Why does my place
have to be so near?

14
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:40,720
I don't want to go home tonight.

15
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,720
I just want to stay with you.

16
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,833
To be honest with you... so do I.

17
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,600
Can I leave, after
watching you fall asleep?

18
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:12,020
I don't fall asleep easily.

19
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,253
Then even better.

20
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,420
That way, I get to
see you much longer.

21
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,753
You know, I was never
bothered by my insomnia,

22
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,753
but after breaking up with you,

23
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:28,353
it was a bit hard for me.

24
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,753
Because all through those
sleepless nights,

25
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,933
I'd end up thinking about you.

26
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:40,620
When was it the hardest for you?

27
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,120
Actually, forget I even asked.

28
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,600
You were probably fine,
because you were so busy.

29
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:46,953
Who says so,

30
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:48,786
that I was perfectly fine?

31
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:52,453
It was hard for me every night,
and every morning.

32
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,686
Even while at work,
or at the court…

33
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:58,753
Every moment was hard for me.

34
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,820
Really?

35
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,753
It really was hard for you?

36
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,586
What, is that something to be
so excited about?

37
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,953
Of course.

38
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:09,400
That just proves
how much you love me.

39
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:13,333
Somehow, that puts me at ease.

40
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:27,553
Let's never break up again.

41
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:30,320
Promise me that

42
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,700
you won't ever let go of my hand.

43
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:36,186
Alright.

44
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:37,633
I promise.

45
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,453
I will never let go of this hand.

46
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:46,333
And I will protect you,
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

47
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,620
The reason why
I left you was because

48
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,553
these are important times for you

49
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:59,220
and I didn't want to be
your burden.

50
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,686
And even now,
I don't want that at all.

51
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:04,953
So in order to protect you,

52
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:08,520
I think we should be extra careful
about seeing each other.

53
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,720
Extra careful?

54
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,186
Yes. We can't risk another
picture of us like last time,

55
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:17,853
so let's refrain from
meeting outside.

56
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:20,553
Let's either meet here
at your place, or mine.

57
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:23,833
Or somewhere else that's enclosed.

58
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:31,453
Enclosed?

59
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:32,566
Yes.

60
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:38,133
Somewhere secretive and quiet,
with only the two of us.

61
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,766
May I stay for the night?

62
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,520
I won't ever cross this line.

63
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,953
I promised you, didn't I?

64
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,400
That I'll protect you.

65
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:12,900
Well, uh…

66
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,466
Thank you so much for
protecting me.

67
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:12,786
Good morning, Mr. Kwon.

68
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,466
Yes, good morning.

69
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:19,420
It must've been uncomfortable
sleeping like that.

70
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,020
It's fine.

71
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,486
What's your schedule like today?

72
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,386
I'm quite free today.

73
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:29,553
We start shooting at about 1,
so I should be done by 7.

74
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:32,420
Then we can have dinner together.

75
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,120
I'll call you as soon as I'm done.

76
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Alright.

77
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:38,633
Who is that
so early in the morning?

78
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,453
It's my manager!

79
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,720
- What do we do?
- Yoon-seo!

80
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,800
He might get the wrong idea
when he sees you here!

81
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,986
Maybe we can pretend that

82
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:51,620
- we're not here?
- Yoon-seo!

83
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,953
No.

84
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:53,953
He knows the passcode.

85
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:56,186
If I don't answer him,
he'll probably let himself in.

86
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:58,186
- What do we do?
- Passcode? Why?

87
00:07:58,266 --> 00:07:59,220
Even if he is your manager,

88
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,000
- you have your privacy…
- I'm coming in!

89
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:09,886
Hide in here, for the time being.

90
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:11,533
But, uh… Ms. Oh Jin-sim!

91
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:17,353
Oh what?

92
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:18,953
So you were up already.

93
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:22,520
I thought you were still in bed.

94
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,753
Well, uh… I was using the blender,

95
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,500
and I guess
I didn't hear the bell.

96
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:33,453
So… Why are you here so early?

97
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:35,086
Don't I start at 1 o'clock?

98
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,953
I got a call that
there's been some changes.

99
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,453
You start at eleven now,

100
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:39,853
so we need to get going now.

101
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:41,953
Oh, I see. Sure.

102
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:44,420
Then I'll get ready and
come right down.

103
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,953
You wait in the car.
I'll be right there.

104
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:48,833
- Sure, make it quick.
- Alright.

105
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,886
Oh, that's right.

106
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,833
Can I use the bathroom?

107
00:08:58,033 --> 00:08:59,033
Hyuk-jun!

108
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:01,553
What is it?

109
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:03,220
I'm sorry,

110
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,820
but can you not use the bathroom?

111
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,620
- But why?
- Huh?

112
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,053
Well, uh… Just!

113
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:10,653
Yoon-seo, I'm sorry,

114
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:13,320
but I'm about to burst.

115
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,320
So please excuse me.

116
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,353
- Hyuk-jun, but…
- Please.

117
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:18,300
- Hyuk-jun! Hyuk-jun!
- Please excuse me.

118
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,653
Yoon-seo,

119
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,886
are you going to just stand there?

120
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:33,020
Oh. Sorry, Hyuk-jun.

121
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,086
- Right?
- Yeah.

122
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,300
If you're so sorry to my bladder,
then off you go.

123
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:38,500
- Sure.
- Now!

124
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
Who's there?

125
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:21,600
Mr. Kwon!

126
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,153
Ah, yes.

127
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:26,900
The Prosecution Service…?

128
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,833
Well, uh…

129
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:36,800
Are you alright?

130
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,333
Uh… Mr. Kwon?

131
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:47,920
I'm alright. Uh…

132
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,133
I was going to
take a shower anyway.

133
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,466
(Shingil 3-dong
Morning Football Club)

134
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:53,600
Oh no…

135
00:10:57,466 --> 00:11:01,333
At least Hyuk-jun had
a spare shirt in his car.

136
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,720
I'll wash this and
return it to you later.

137
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,920
So what's going on?

138
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,686
Why are you here, Mr. Kwon,
so early in the morning?

139
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:13,400
Don't tell me…

140
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,620
You spent the night here?

141
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,620
- No!
- Yes.

142
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,686
No? Yes?

143
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:19,853
No, yes?!

144
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:20,953
There's my answer there.

145
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:21,953
But Mr. Kwon,

146
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:24,753
while I did say I'll approve of
you two dating,

147
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,920
this is… This is just not right!

148
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,066
Hyuk-jun!

149
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,153
Mr. Kwon, you should get going.

150
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,420
You'll be tight for time since
you need to go home first.

151
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,800
So come on. Let's go.

152
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:37,600
Then…

153
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:39,753
Mr. Kwon?

154
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,200
I'm not done…

155
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:45,833
What's she going to do?

156
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Here.

157
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:58,500
- Bye.
- I'm off, then.

158
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,120
Hyuk-jun, how could you be
so mean to him?

159
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,586
When he got all soaked,
because of you?

160
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,353
Yoon-seo,

161
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:21,786
Mr. Kwon may have been
soaked because of me,

162
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,453
but for me,
this is a complete shock!

163
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:26,720
You haven't even dated him for
long enough,

164
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,253
and you call him here?

165
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,720
Then what?

166
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,820
Should we just see each other
on the streets?

167
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,920
You want people to
snap photos of us?

168
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,153
Even if they do snap
a picture of you,

169
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:37,720
I can always come up with
an excuse if it's elsewhere.

170
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,953
But if they get a picture of him
leaving your place,

171
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:41,453
then there's absolutely
no excuse for that!

172
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,220
Just leave this to us.

173
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,220
We're doing our best
so we're not busted!

174
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,053
If you said you'll pretend
you don't know we're dating,

175
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,320
then please, just do that!

176
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,633
Pretend you've seen nothing,
even if you did!

177
00:12:57,533 --> 00:12:59,586
I'd like to do that too,

178
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,386
but I'm still worried that
you'll be busted…

179
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:04,020
And even if I did say I'll approve,
I can't quite, completely…

180
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,466
This is driving me nuts, too!

181
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,166
What are you looking at,
you stupid hedgehog?

182
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:22,953
Oh what?

183
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:25,386
I didn't see you this morning
so I wondered where you were.

184
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:26,733
You were out
playing soccer, were you?

185
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,666
But… "Singil 3-dong
Morning Soccer Club?"

186
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,633
Why'd you have to go so far?

187
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,986
They're a good team, are they?

188
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:39,486
Can I come next time?

189
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:41,853
You're never allowed there.

190
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:43,553
Why not?

191
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:44,986
What,

192
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:47,086
are they strict about
accepting new members?

193
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,153
But I'm good at soccer!

194
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:52,266
When I say no, just accept it.

195
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,320
What's wrong with him?

196
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,566
Why does he have to be
so cocky and stingy?

197
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:12,133
(Singil 3-dong
Morning Soccer Club)

198
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,300
I can't believe what I've been
getting myself into.

199
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:33,386
You said you'll be done around 7,
and I couldn't wait to see you.

200
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:34,866
Are you done with
your shooting yet?

201
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:40,066
We're almost done.
Shall we have dinner together?

202
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,386
Sure.

203
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,833
Then see you at my place.

204
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,820
I won't end up being
soaked, will I?

205
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,853
Of course not.

206
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:54,233
I'm thinking of changing the
passcode as soon as I'm home.

207
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:59,333
Then I'll get
your favorite, sushi.

208
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,086
Yes, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

209
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,453
- I just…
- What do I do?

210
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:18,620
We'll be shooting some more
and so I'll be finishing late.

211
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,286
I don't think
I'll be able to see you tonight.

212
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:25,086
I see… It can't be helped.

213
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,400
You didn't buy the
sushi already, did you?

214
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,786
No, not yet.

215
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:34,200
Don't worry about me,
but good luck with your work.

216
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:36,300
Bye, then.

217
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:57,866
I'm here.

218
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,120
Oh what?

219
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,720
Why are you having
two to yourself?

220
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,686
Oh, one's for me, is it?

221
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,053
No, it isn't.

222
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:11,800
Then who did you buy it for?

223
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,586
They're both for me, so what?

224
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,333
You're really selfish.

225
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:19,786
You won’t let me into
that soccer club,

226
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:22,066
and now you're having two packs of
sushi, all to yourself…

227
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,220
Why have you changed so much?

228
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,400
It's not like that.

229
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:29,986
From now on,

230
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:32,333
I'll teach you the joy of sharing.

231
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,753
Now watch and learn.

232
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,700
Learn how to be
with others. Alright?

233
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:44,720
Yes, that's right.

234
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,900
Eat up.

235
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:49,553
So you had something to tell me.

236
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,753
What is it?

237
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,686
Well, it's really nothing.

238
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:56,386
As you know, our actors have
been going beyond Korea

239
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:58,586
and that means our contracts
have become global, too.

240
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:02,986
So I've been thinking, maybe
we should have a corporate lawyer.

241
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:05,100
Oh!

242
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,520
So you'd like to
partner up with our law firm, huh?

243
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,853
Well, though I understand
your wishes,

244
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:13,086
I'm not sure if
that's quite possible.

245
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,520
- Eh?
- I'm sure you've, uh…

246
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,320
…heard about the Lim Yun-hee case
that everyone's talking about.

247
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,833
Who solved that case?

248
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:22,733
We, Always, did.

249
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:27,053
Hey, get your facts right.

250
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,153
How did Always solve it?

251
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:29,220
It was Kwon Jung-rok
who solved it.

252
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,286
That guy may be a prick,
but he's sure competent.

253
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:32,400
Anyway,

254
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:36,886
that's why our law firm is
now in high demand.

255
00:17:36,966 --> 00:17:40,986
Especially me, as the head of
that law firm in the spotlight.

256
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:44,553
All the TV stations and
magazines are

257
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:46,520
desperate to interview me.

258
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,520
There hasn’t been a single place
that hasn't called me!

259
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,753
So… Will you do it, or no?

260
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,853
I'm not saying no.

261
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:57,166
I'm just saying, we may not
have the capacity.

262
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:01,020
So you don't have the
capacity… Too bad.

263
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,253
If you become our family,
then there are those

264
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,053
end-of-year parties with
our celebs… Cheers!

265
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:12,020
Oh, and the summer camps on
the Waikiki beach…

266
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,720
Beach volleyball…!

267
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Toss!

268
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:16,553
I have it!

269
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:18,486
You could've met them all.

270
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:20,166
Too bad, then. Alright.

271
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:24,953
Jun-seok, Jun-seok…

272
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:27,286
My dear cousin!

273
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:30,453
Where's your sense of humor?

274
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:33,386
Did you think I would
really turn you down?

275
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:36,553
I really don't know how you run
your business with your naivety.

276
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:38,286
Bring me the contract,
and I'll sign it right now.

277
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:40,253
Aw, cousin…

278
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,120
Thanks, man.

279
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,120
By the way, the production team
of Yoon-seo's drama

280
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,920
wants an advisory lawyer.

281
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,020
Advisory lawyer?

282
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,253
You know. Those professionals

283
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,720
who join the set
and make sure that

284
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,686
all the legal jargons are correct.

285
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:58,420
And they wanted someone
who's acquainted to Yoon-seo.

286
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,620
I can help.

287
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,733
Me, I'm available!

288
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,553
Right, you're a lawyer, too.

289
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:05,053
Of course I am.

290
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:07,086
Too bad, though.

291
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,753
- Huh?
- You don't have the capacity.

292
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,653
Just find someone else
for me, then.

293
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,486
It's okay, cutie pie. I'll do it.

294
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:16,186
No, no. I'm not sure
if I can trust you.

295
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:19,186
What if you go to the set and

296
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:21,753
end up making gif files like this?

297
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,020
Just find me someone else.

298
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,153
But no one else will
probably want to do it.

299
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,653
An advisory lawyer?

300
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,733
Yes.

301
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:30,553
So no one wants to do it?

302
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:33,053
I guess it's tiring and
takes up too much time.

303
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:34,186
I mean, right?

304
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:35,886
Yes, well…

305
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,386
I'm also busy with many cases,

306
00:19:38,466 --> 00:19:41,453
and I wouldn't want to be
approached by

307
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:44,786
casting managers…

308
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:46,153
I'll pass, thank you.

309
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:49,553
Okay! Then it's decided, I'll go.

310
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:51,353
You must be happy, Mr. Yeon.

311
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:53,986
Now you'll get to see
Yoon-seo more often.

312
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:56,820
Right? I guess I'll be
seeing her often, huh?

313
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,686
They say they need one
starting today,

314
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:01,320
so it's decided, I'll go.

315
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
No.

316
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:05,700
I'll go.

317
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:12,853
I think I'm hearing things.

318
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:15,533
Kwon, can you repeat that again?

319
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,686
I said I'll go.

320
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:19,933
For the advisory lawyer position.

321
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:27,386
But you're not interested in
that kind of thing.

322
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:29,186
No, but…

323
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:32,400
I thought it wouldn't hurt,
for the experience.

324
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,120
Kwon, they say when you
act out of character,

325
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,420
you're only bringing
death upon you.

326
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,353
So just stay out of this
like you always have,

327
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:44,320
and continue fighting for justice.

328
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,686
No, I want to do it.
The advisory lawyer.

329
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:48,786
Why do you have to say that?

330
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:52,420
What, do you think
you've become a celebrity

331
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,686
after that interview from
a few days ago?

332
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:55,486
Why are you suddenly
seeking so much attention?

333
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:58,486
Seek attention? Then why even
agree to it in the first place?

334
00:20:58,566 --> 00:21:00,253
Whatever, fine.
Then let's have everyone vote.

335
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,720
Vote?

336
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,353
Yes. Because if you make
a mistake while on the set,

337
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:06,220
that'll be tainting us
Always' reputation.

338
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,020
So let's leave it to
our good citizens to decide

339
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:17,166
who is better suited to
represent Always.

340
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
(Yeon Jun-gyu: 1 vote
Kwon Jung-rok: 4 votes)

341
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,533
Then I'll be off.

342
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,620
Ms. Oh Jin-sim, listen to this.

343
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,920
We can finally see each other.

344
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,253
I'll be joining the set

345
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,266
as your advisory lawyer…

346
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,353
Actually, no.

347
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:04,100
Let's surprise her.

348
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,020
Is it because I didn't get to see
Mr. Kwon last night?

349
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,966
I just don't have the
energy or the appetite.

350
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:23,553
I see.

351
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:27,020
So that's why you left
two strands of radish.

352
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,100
I thought you had
washed this clean already.

353
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,700
When did I say
I didn't have the appetite?

354
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,186
You know, Yoon-seo…

355
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:37,686
I really like how you eat so well.

356
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:38,886
I really do, but…

357
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:40,786
You need to watch your weight.

358
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:43,786
What if you appear
all chubby on the camera?

359
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:44,953
Oh, and…

360
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:46,486
You know you have
a photoshoot next week, right?

361
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:48,553
Yes, yes, I know. Don't worry.

362
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,500
I have a conscience.

363
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:55,686
For example, I'm drinking this
because it's supposed to help.

364
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:57,320
Yes, good.

365
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,120
You know, you drinking that looks
like you're advertising for it.

366
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,433
Go on, drink more.

367
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,433
- May I see you for a second?
- Oh, sure.

368
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,900
Gosh, I miss Mr. Kwon.

369
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,420
Who knew?

370
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,453
That Mr. Kwon would be
interested in that sort of thing.

371
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:20,620
I know, right?

372
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,186
It's like seeing the mirage
of oasis in the desert.

373
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:24,433
I still can't believe what I saw.

374
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:28,453
Oh, so there you are.

375
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:29,600
Having tea?

376
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:32,200
Looks delicious.

377
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:39,120
By the way, I'd like someone to
keep meeting minutes from now on.

378
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,120
It can be a bit loud
on the keyboard,

379
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,586
so I'd like someone to
write it down instead.

380
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:45,986
Sure, I'll do it.

381
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:47,986
Oh, Hae-young. But do you have
good handwriting?

382
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:48,986
Yes.

383
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:50,220
Because I'd like it to be

384
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,020
someone with fine handwriting.

385
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,353
- Uh…
- Just to be sure,

386
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,786
why don't we all write down
something and see?

387
00:23:56,866 --> 00:23:59,486
Everyone, write "meeting minutes."

388
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:01,020
"Meeting minutes."

389
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,833
It's best to leave it to
the best person, right?

390
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:15,200
(Meeting minutes)

391
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:22,453
There you are. I see!

392
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:25,233
So that's who you are.

393
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,966
Choi, Dan, Hae-young, Ms. Yang…

394
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,666
I'm so disappointed.
I trusted you guys!

395
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,486
I was so good to you,

396
00:24:34,566 --> 00:24:36,800
yet you betray me
and vote for Kwon?

397
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:39,586
What… What do you mean?

398
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,286
I voted for you, Mr. Yeon.

399
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:43,100
You had one vote, right?

400
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,320
Well, that was from me.

401
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,853
Whatever!

402
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:47,220
Look here.

403
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,020
Compare "Kwon Jung-rok" with the

404
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,620
"meeting minutes"
you all just wrote down,

405
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,920
and this is the only
handwriting I'm not seeing.

406
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,020
This is the only one.

407
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,333
I see you were in
a dilemma, Ms. Yang.

408
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:01,953
You said voting would be
kept confidential.

409
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,253
So you can't just do this!

410
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,353
Well, who cares?
I was just curious.

411
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:08,320
Besides, I never said
there'll be any disadvantages.

412
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,186
By the way, why's it
so dusty in the office?

413
00:25:11,266 --> 00:25:13,320
Why don't we all come in
on the weekend and

414
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,486
have a massive clean-up?

415
00:25:15,566 --> 00:25:17,166
Except for you, Mr. Lee.

416
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,686
I'll give you a movie ticket,

417
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:20,066
so go watch a movie instead.

418
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,320
Good morning. Good morning.

419
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,453
Ah, Yoon-seo.

420
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:32,786
- Hello.
- Oh, um…

421
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:34,966
Our new advisory lawyer is here.

422
00:25:48,366 --> 00:25:51,233
Mr. Kwon, can you take
a look at the script?

423
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:54,900
(Waiting Room/Oh Yoon-seo)

424
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,986
What… How…?

425
00:25:58,066 --> 00:25:59,420
How did you come here?

426
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,120
You're the advisory lawyer for
our drama?

427
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,353
It wasn't an easy path to
being voted the advisory lawyer.

428
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:06,353
Voted?

429
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:10,186
Yes. Mr. Yeon, who enjoys
attention from the media,

430
00:26:10,266 --> 00:26:12,353
couldn't have made
his ambitions more clear about

431
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:13,886
being the advisory lawyer for
your drama, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

432
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:16,520
But determined to
see you no matter what,

433
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,753
I withstood his temptations
and his criticisms,

434
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:21,153
and as a result, it was decided
it'll come down to voting.

435
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:23,320
And so, through what was
a landslide vote of 4:1,

436
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,786
I, Kwon Jung-rok,

437
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:28,600
was proudly voted
your team's advisory lawyer!

438
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:32,053
Even when I look back now,

439
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,666
it was a very close call indeed.

440
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,653
It does sound so dramatic.

441
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:39,853
Yes.

442
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,186
But after coming here
and seeing you like this,

443
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:44,900
I'm glad I stood for candidacy.

444
00:26:46,066 --> 00:26:48,753
But, uh… I hope me being here

445
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,020
isn't putting you in trouble
or making you uncomfortable…

446
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,653
No way!

447
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:54,386
You've no idea
how happy I am right now.

448
00:26:54,466 --> 00:26:57,600
I missed you so much, too.

449
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,266
Yoon-seo, are you in here?

450
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm really sorry.

451
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:07,786
Are you, uh… Actually, no.

452
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:09,520
Yoon-seo. Oh Yoon-seo!

453
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Yes?

454
00:27:10,766 --> 00:27:12,720
We need to start now.
So come on, hurry up!

455
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,753
Sure, sure. I'll get going.

456
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,853
Um… Mr. Kwon, you better come too.

457
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:17,933
Alright.

458
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,300
What was that for?

459
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:27,186
Mr. Kwon, I understand
how you feel,

460
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:29,953
but coming here as
the advisory lawyer is…

461
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:31,420
I have free will and the
freedom to do so.

462
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,586
Besides, interfering with
everything we do is

463
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:33,820
infringing on
our rights to happiness

464
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,620
and our right to act freely,

465
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,786
both of which are guaranteed by
the Constitutional Law.

466
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:38,866
Then please excuse me.

467
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:40,700
Sure.

468
00:27:42,766 --> 00:27:43,920
Yoon-seo, don't go!

469
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,500
Not just you two, together!
Wait up for me!

470
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:51,620
You testified that you were
at home on that day.

471
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,800
Is this true?

472
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:56,966
Your Honor.

473
00:28:00,866 --> 00:28:01,786
Sorry, one moment.

474
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:04,486
Um… Mr. Kwon?

475
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:06,520
When I say, "Your Honor,"

476
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,286
what should I do with my hand?

477
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:12,220
Oh, uh..

478
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,333
Please.

479
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:14,700
Sure.

480
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:20,866
Instead of pointing at the judge
directly like this,

481
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,986
stand straight, or gather your
hands to the front, politely.

482
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:26,733
I think this will look better.

483
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,220
Not like this?

484
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,186
No, both hands would be too…

485
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:32,600
Stand straight, or…

486
00:28:39,566 --> 00:28:41,166
Your Honor!

487
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:45,453
Mr. Kwon,

488
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:46,853
here you are.

489
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:47,933
Thank you.

490
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,666
Um, Mr. Kwon.

491
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:58,453
I'm a little bothered by
this part on the script.

492
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:01,333
Is this expression okay?

493
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,100
(Kwon Jung-rok)

494
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:12,033
Yes, that's absolutely correct.

495
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I see.

496
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:16,953
Yep, that's right.

497
00:29:17,033 --> 00:29:19,686
From how I see it,
this script is absolutely perfect.

498
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:21,466
So can we move onto
the next scene already?

499
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:22,900
You… Follow me.

500
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
Ms. Dan.

501
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:54,620
Though our contract dating's over,

502
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,353
we're still colleagues, aren't we?

503
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:58,586
So why do you have to
ignore me like this?

504
00:29:58,666 --> 00:29:59,786
Oh, did I?

505
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:02,666
If I did, I'm sorry.

506
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:04,133
Wait.

507
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,086
Is it going well with
that delivery guy

508
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:11,120
- you chased after that time?
- No.

509
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,286
That was just my drunk habit,

510
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:14,953
and it's nothing
serious with him, really.

511
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:19,653
Anyway, I'm sorry
I failed to keep that clause about

512
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:22,420
how I won't fall for someone else

513
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,586
during the term of the contract.

514
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:26,853
Of course you should be.

515
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:27,920
Well,

516
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,420
I don't think you have
the right to say that.

517
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,386
You said
your heart doesn't move.

518
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:35,920
So what's the point of

519
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,653
continuing on
this contract relationship with

520
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:39,386
someone who continues to
feel nothing for me?

521
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:41,553
I'll just end up…

522
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:42,620
…hurt.

523
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,833
I'll get going then.

524
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,320
Oh what?

525
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,820
In the past,

526
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,820
she'd look at me with honey
dripping from her eyes.

527
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,986
And now she's icy cold!

528
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,400
How could she change like that?

529
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,866
Oh… My heart…

530
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:13,966
Was I too harsh?

531
00:31:16,766 --> 00:31:17,720
Actually, no.

532
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,153
What's the use of being clingy

533
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:21,633
when he says he feels nothing?

534
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:25,200
Let's just move on.

535
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,466
Somehow, I feel as if…

536
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:35,753
…there's this
emptiness in my heart.

537
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,233
What is this feeling?

538
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,900
(Short-term Relationship Contract)

539
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,766
Well, our contract is over,

540
00:31:54,066 --> 00:31:55,733
so let's forget her.

541
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,566
Goodbye.

542
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:02,800
Although you were somewhat clumsy…

543
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,300
I guess it was innocence.

544
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,900
Goodbye, to a page in my life…

545
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:20,386
Argh, hot!

546
00:32:20,466 --> 00:32:21,966
It's hot, it's hot!

547
00:32:58,433 --> 00:32:59,486
What is it?

548
00:32:59,566 --> 00:33:00,600
Hmmm?

549
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:03,666
Oh, nothing.

550
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,086
Ah, from how you're
in need of caffeine,

551
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:12,733
I guess your new role as an
advisory lawyer's tiring you out.

552
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,220
But then again, you have
a lot of cases on your hands.

553
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,286
And now, that advisory lawyer job…

554
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:19,966
Of course you'd be tired.

555
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:25,486
Tsk, I can see that
you're regretting it.

556
00:33:25,566 --> 00:33:28,853
Fine, I'll be your sacrifice.

557
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:31,253
I'll brace the great exhaustion
the job entails,

558
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,886
and take over the
advisory lawyer position.

559
00:33:33,966 --> 00:33:34,920
It's fine.

560
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,153
It's fine?

561
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:37,820
I see.

562
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,486
So it's manageable, huh?

563
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:40,953
By the way,

564
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:42,953
how was it like on the set?

565
00:33:43,033 --> 00:33:44,033
Is it fun?

566
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:48,853
And… How are things between
Yoon-seo and the male lead?

567
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:51,020
I didn't meet the
male lead yesterday,

568
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,853
but what do you mean?

569
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:54,586
Well, I was a bit curious.

570
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:58,320
I saw a teaser video of
Yoon-seo on the set,

571
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,253
and there was great chemistry
between the two leads.

572
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:02,553
Some people even commented that

573
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:05,166
they suspect the two are dating!

574
00:34:06,433 --> 00:34:08,986
- What?
- I'm an expert in this area.

575
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:10,886
From how I see it,

576
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,253
there's definitely something.

577
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:14,753
I say there's even a chance that

578
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,920
they might start dating
after this drama.

579
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,666
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

580
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:26,586
Aren't you leaving?

581
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:27,866
This is really uncomfortable.

582

00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:54,286

"Kiss expert…"

586
00:35:08,366 --> 00:35:10,720
Ms. Dan, this is
your schedule for next week.

587
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,320
Thanks, I'll take a look.

588
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Sure.

589
00:35:14,066 --> 00:35:15,320
Huh?

590
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,520
You know how to play the
ukulele, Ms. Dan?

591
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,286
Oh, I started learning as a hobby.

592
00:35:22,366 --> 00:35:25,786
Someone did teach me for
a short while, too.

593
00:35:25,866 --> 00:35:27,753
I've always wanted to
learn how to play it, too.

594
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:31,053
If you don’t mind,
may I take a look?

595
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:32,433
Yes, sure.

596
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:37,486
I learned the basic chords from

597
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:39,666
watching the videos
on the Internet.

598
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,533
This is how you do it, right?

599
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:52,833
Your finger…
Here, use the forefinger.

600
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,520
Like this?

601
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,766
Your pose is, uh…

602
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,866
If you look here,

603
00:36:00,466 --> 00:36:03,233
you need to hold it like
holding a baby.

604
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,266
Do you want to try playing
the C-chord?

605
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,066
You're doing great!

606
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,920
How could she… make harmony with

607
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,486
some other man,
with the ukulele I gave her,

608
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:34,620
the ukulele that holds
so many memories of us?

609
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,920
I really don't understand her!

610
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,786
- Oh, there she is.
- There's a ukulele concert,

611
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:41,053
and I was shy about going alone.

612
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:42,320
Why are they together?

613
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,020
I'm glad you're able to join me.

614
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,520
Well, this is a great chance to
see a good concert,

615
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,766
so I'm happy, too.

616
00:36:53,266 --> 00:36:54,286
Ms. Dan?

617
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:55,353
Can I talk to you for a second?

618
00:36:55,433 --> 00:36:57,853
But Jong-hwa and I are
going somewhere right now.

619
00:36:57,933 --> 00:36:59,586
We're going to see
a ukulele concert…

620
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:02,120
No, you can't. Never!

621
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,133
I'm sorry, but can you go to
that concert alone?

622
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:12,733
Because I've something important
to discuss with her, right now!

623
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,886
What is it?

624
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:18,653
What is this something important
that you needed to discuss?

625
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:20,253
Ms. Dan,

626
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,620
I'd like my ukulele back.

627
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,700
What?

628
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,986
Why do you want it back
after giving it to me?

629
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:29,486
Why are you taking it back
after giving it to me?

630
00:37:29,566 --> 00:37:31,253
What did I take back?

631
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,053
Your heart. Why did you
take it back?

632
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:37,120
You shouldn't have been so good to
me in the first place, then.

633
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,720
Why did you get your hair
pulled out for me on my birthday?

634
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,286
Why did you bone the fish,

635
00:37:42,366 --> 00:37:43,820
and why did you
give me those vitamins?

636
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,586
Why? Why!

637
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:48,020
Just what do you…

638
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:53,420
Well, who was the person
who said he felt nothing?

639
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
Yes.

640
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,286
I thought
I wouldn't feel anything.

641
00:37:58,366 --> 00:37:59,366
But…

642
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:17,620
What's this?

643
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,966
What's this speed?

644
00:38:23,566 --> 00:38:24,800
Like an idiot,

645
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:27,720
my heart started moving

646
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,086
after I realized your absence.

647
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:31,166
And…

648
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,386
When I saw you smiling with
someone other than me,

649
00:38:36,466 --> 00:38:38,633
I even felt pain in my heart, too.

650
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:40,766
My heart is…

651
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,620
…now restless, because of you.

652
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,900
- So…
- So…?

653
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:53,333
Go out with me.

654
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:56,033
Not on contract this time,
but for real.

655
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,300
I'll give you three seconds.

656
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,433
3,

657
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:06,766
2,

658
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:08,266
1.

659
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:17,733
0.5,

660
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,233
0.25…

661
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,066
0.125…

662
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,266
Alright! I'll go out with you!
I totally will!

663
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:44,900
Good times.

664
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,266
They must be dating.

665
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:47,733
Good times.

666
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,766
Is she still filming?

667
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:01,220
Mr. Kwon!

668
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Ms. Oh Jin-sim!

669
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,766
How did you…

670
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,333
- Get in.
- Sure.

671
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,300
Didn't you say
you still have shooting?

672
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,986
What about your manager?

673
00:40:20,066 --> 00:40:22,686
Shooting's been cancelled.

674
00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:25,520
So I sent Hyuk-jun home.

675
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,686
Um… I thought about calling,

676
00:40:28,766 --> 00:40:31,720
but I wanted to surprise you
like you did,

677
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,886
so I just showed up.

678
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:35,253
Well done.

679
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,853
It's really nice,
seeing you like this.

680
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:40,253
Right? It's so nice, right?

681
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:43,953
I don't know how we spent
so much time apart.

682
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:45,266
I agree, yes.

683
00:40:47,066 --> 00:40:48,853
I'm so glad the
shooting's been cancelled.

684
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:50,453
You must've been tired.

685
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,686
It's alright. It's not too tiring.

686
00:40:52,766 --> 00:40:54,486
Still,

687
00:40:54,566 --> 00:40:57,953
from my brief experience
on the set yesterday,

688
00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:01,820
I came to the conclusion that
acting is hard labor.

689
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,953
So don't cut down on your meals
saying you're on a diet.

690
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:07,186
Eat up, and take care of yourself.

691
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:08,300
Alright?

692
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:11,953
I should be saying that.

693
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:13,986
You need to take care of
yourself, Mr. Kwon.

694
00:41:14,066 --> 00:41:16,733
You're the busiest lawyer
at Always, aren't you?

695
00:41:17,566 --> 00:41:20,966
Actually, let's have something
healthy for dessert.

696
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,620
This is red ginseng.

697
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,766
Go on.

698
00:41:31,466 --> 00:41:32,466
Sure.

699
00:41:38,766 --> 00:41:41,786
Mr. Kwon? After you take that,
you need to help me.

700
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:42,920
Pardon?

701
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,466
Help me with my acting.

702
00:41:45,933 --> 00:41:47,053
Your acting?

703
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:48,686
Yes, it's much easier
when you have someone

704
00:41:48,766 --> 00:41:52,686
acting it out with you.

705
00:41:52,766 --> 00:41:55,653
I want to go over the part for
tomorrow's shooting.

706
00:41:55,733 --> 00:41:56,986
You'll help me, right?

707
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:58,200
Oh, sure.

708
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,866
Who knew I'll ever do
something like this?

709
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,933
The script is…

710
00:42:09,366 --> 00:42:10,566
Here it is.

711
00:42:17,566 --> 00:42:20,433
(Jung-do takes Ju-ha's hand
and kisses her)

712
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,986
Oh, that's right.

713
00:42:24,066 --> 00:42:26,233
There was a kiss scene
in episode 4.

714
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:29,453
Oh what? Jung-do!

715
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:32,666
I thought you're in Asrael.

716
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,286
I came, because
I didn't want to regret it.

717
00:42:36,366 --> 00:42:38,286
I didn't want to regret
letting you go,

718
00:42:38,366 --> 00:42:40,233
for the rest of my life.

719
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,233
If says here, "Jung-do takes
Ju-ha's hand and kisses her."

720
00:42:51,366 --> 00:42:53,366
Oh, we can just skip that.

721
00:42:55,766 --> 00:42:58,386
Why should we?

722
00:42:58,466 --> 00:43:00,253
Since I agreed to help you,

723
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:01,733
I should help you in every way.

724
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,766
Oh my gosh!

725
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,733
Should we just not do this?

726
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:20,886
No.

727
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:22,786
I still need to practice.

728
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,100
This is practice.

729
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,200
Um, Mr. Kwon? Here's the script.

730
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,400
Wow.

731
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:44,033
So this is what a script is like.

732
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:49,686
What's this?

733
00:43:49,766 --> 00:43:52,453
Hmmm? What?

734
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:54,553
Take a look here.

735
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:56,086
It says here,

736
00:43:56,166 --> 00:44:00,186
"Your Honor, the defendant is
in deep remorse…"

737
00:44:00,266 --> 00:44:01,266
Yes?

738
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:05,700
But isn't this a criminal case?

739
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,020
It's "the accused" for
a criminal case,

740
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,886
and "defendant" for a civil suit.

741
00:44:11,966 --> 00:44:13,953
That's why, it should be
"the accused," not "defendant."

742
00:44:14,033 --> 00:44:16,120
Um, well…

743
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,333
I'm not the one
who wrote the script, so…

744
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,620
But this is basic stuff!

745
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,700
Are you, uh… mad?

746
00:44:25,566 --> 00:44:30,686
I'll relay that to
the writer, then.

747
00:44:30,766 --> 00:44:32,966
Please do.

748
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:38,986
Oh. Why don't we practice
this scene?

749
00:44:39,066 --> 00:44:40,586
Which…?

750
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:42,700
Scene 27, at the court.

751
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:45,753
The court scene?

752
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:48,320
Yes, why don't you go
and act it out?

753
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,520
Stand up straight, and be serious.

754
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,286
What? Stand up?

755
00:44:51,366 --> 00:44:52,466
Yes. To the front.

756
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:55,853
I'll review every detail.

757
00:44:55,933 --> 00:44:57,000
Sure.

758
00:45:00,066 --> 00:45:04,386
While our complainant completed the
demolition through Bujin…

759
00:45:04,466 --> 00:45:05,533
Ms. Oh Jin-sim?

760
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,866
The plaintiff is
usually to your left.

761
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,300
This side?

762
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,820
While our complainant completed the
demolition through Bujin,

763
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,366
after failing to securing funding…

764
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,566
…he has failed to pay for
the project, did he not?

765
00:45:29,933 --> 00:45:32,600
…he has failed to pay for
the project, did he not?

766
00:45:37,266 --> 00:45:39,053
- Ms. Oh Jin-sim.
- Yes?

767
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:42,386
I don't think your tone just now
was appropriate.

768
00:45:42,466 --> 00:45:46,320
There's hardly a case where
lawyers raise their voice in court,

769
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,120
so I think it's best to finish off

770
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,833
with a restrained, yet
a charismatic tone.

771
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:54,386
"While our complainant completed the
demolition through Bujin,

772
00:45:54,466 --> 00:45:56,453
after failing to securing funding,

773
00:45:56,533 --> 00:45:59,153
he has failed to pay for
the project, did he not?"

774
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:02,486
- Like this.
- Right, like that.

775
00:46:02,566 --> 00:46:04,200
- I'll try once more.
- Sure.

776
00:46:06,933 --> 00:46:09,953
While our complainant completed the
demolition through Mujin…

777
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:13,353
Ms. Oh Jin-sim?
It's "Bu-jin," not "Mu-jin."

778
00:46:13,433 --> 00:46:17,000
Oh, right. Bujin…

779
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,020
Um, can I get a drink of water?

780
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,700
Sure, go ahead.

781
00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:27,633
"While our complainant completed…"

782
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,620
I thought this was
going to be all romantic,

783
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,566
but this is more
hardcore than on the set!

784
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:46,700
I'm glad I could be of help,
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

785
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,700
Sure…

786
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,020
"Place: Court.

787
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,653
After her trial,
Ju-ha steps out of the court,

788
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,153
and is met with surprise.

789
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:01,433
Jung-do is standing there,
in his uniform…"

790
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:04,766
"Jung-do takes Ju-ha's hand, and…

791
00:47:08,366 --> 00:47:10,000
…kisses her."

792
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:15,233
"The two kiss with the court
in the background."

793
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,700
(Kiss Expert)

794
00:47:31,966 --> 00:47:33,666
"Kiss expert," huh?

795
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,020
Oh, uh…

796
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:41,386
I reserved that beef barbecue place
in front for dinner.

797
00:47:41,466 --> 00:47:43,386
Yes, good job!

798
00:47:43,466 --> 00:47:45,220
The raw beef there is
a work of art.

799
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,286
I say the chef there is
a beef expert!

800
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:49,753
Expert?

801
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,320
There's no such thing as
a kiss expert!

802
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,433
What, the chef is a kiss expert?

803
00:47:57,866 --> 00:47:58,886
It's nothing.

804
00:47:58,966 --> 00:47:59,986
I'll get going first.

805
00:48:00,066 --> 00:48:01,553
What, you're not going to
finish your meal?

806
00:48:01,633 --> 00:48:03,966
No. I have to be at the court now.

807
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,820
"Kiss expert..."

808
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,853
That's what he said.

809
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:11,066
He said "kiss" something,
didn't he?

810
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:15,786
Does Kwon want a girlfriend?

811
00:48:15,866 --> 00:48:17,053
But then again,

812
00:48:17,133 --> 00:48:20,453
it's spring and
love is in the air…

813
00:48:20,533 --> 00:48:22,700
Even Kwon would want one.

814
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:27,453
Hold on. Everyone here is
single, right?

815
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:28,620
There's so many of us here,

816
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,666
and not one is in a relationship?

817
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:33,753
If you don't have time to
go out and find one,

818
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:36,486
then look for one here.

819
00:48:36,566 --> 00:48:39,520
There's plenty of office dating
in other companies,

820
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,820
so why haven't I heard of
one in our company?

821
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,586
I thought you don't really
approve of office dating.

822
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:47,120
Because you're worried we won't
concentrate on work.

823
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,086
Hey, I'm not that old-fashioned.

824
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:51,486
You know what?

825
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:54,320
If I ever see
a couple being born here,

826
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,586
I'll buy both of them new suits to

827
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,466
cheer on for their relationship.

828
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,220
So as soon as you start dating,

829
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,800
raise your hand and report it.

830
00:49:05,533 --> 00:49:07,353
- What are you two doing?
- You said to report it.

831
00:49:07,433 --> 00:49:09,620
Ms. Dan and I are dating.

832
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,733
Right, though we only just
started dating since yesterday.

833
00:49:14,766 --> 00:49:15,853
Oh, come on!

834
00:49:15,933 --> 00:49:18,053
What do you think
you two are trying here?

835
00:49:18,133 --> 00:49:19,620
I get you both want free suits,

836
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,886
but you two, dating?
It doesn't make sense!

837
00:49:20,966 --> 00:49:23,166
Hey, it's not even funny.

838
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:33,833
What… You're really dating?

839
00:49:37,166 --> 00:49:39,033
I've been stabbed
right in the back!

840
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,700
(Court)

841
00:49:47,866 --> 00:49:51,066
The whole team's there,
so she should be here, too.

842
00:49:57,433 --> 00:49:58,553
Yoon-seo.

843
00:49:58,633 --> 00:50:01,153
What do you plan to do here?

844
00:50:01,233 --> 00:50:03,053
Just do what you want,
and I'll try to follow.

845
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:04,120
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

846
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,333
Alright, then.

847
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,533
Huh?

848
00:50:11,966 --> 00:50:13,033
Mr. Kwon!

849
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,200
Ah, yes.

850
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,620
What brings you here?

851
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,653
I had business here,

852
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:21,953
when I heard
you'll be shooting here.

853
00:50:22,033 --> 00:50:24,000
So here I am, in case you need me.

854
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,253
I'm glad we're shooting
at the court today.

855
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:30,386
We got to bump into
each other like this.

856
00:50:30,466 --> 00:50:33,033
- Yes.
- Yoon-seo, we're starting!

857
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:42,320
I'll get going then, Mr. Kwon.

858
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,400
Sure.

859
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,166
Jung-do.

860
00:50:56,933 --> 00:50:58,286
How did you…

861
00:50:58,366 --> 00:51:00,486
I thought you're in Asrael.

862
00:51:00,566 --> 00:51:02,220
I came, because
I didn't want to regret it.

863
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,566
I didn't want to regret
letting you go, Ju-ha.

864
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,553
Cut!

865
00:51:23,633 --> 00:51:24,853
Oh what?

866
00:51:24,933 --> 00:51:27,253
Did you hear that car?

867
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:29,920
Please remove that for me.

868
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,120
Alright, everyone on standby.

869
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,800
Um… wait!

870
00:51:37,533 --> 00:51:40,186
May I offer advice,
as the advisory lawyer?

871
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:41,786
Sure, go ahead.

872
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:43,186
I know this is a drama,

873
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,453
but I think the two kissing
in front of the court is

874
00:51:45,533 --> 00:51:48,033
too out of touch with the reality.

875
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:49,453
Besides, we're talking
about a lawyer,

876
00:51:49,533 --> 00:51:51,086
who is the guardian of justice,
and a military judicial officer!

877
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:53,786
So kissing in front of
the sacred court?

878
00:51:53,866 --> 00:51:56,086
As someone in this industry,

879
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:59,220
I think this is
pushing it too far.

880
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,366
We're all very conservative.

881
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,433
Still, if you think this needs
to be an emotional scene…

882
00:52:09,033 --> 00:52:11,186
A hug! I think a hug will do.

883
00:52:11,266 --> 00:52:13,586
- A hug?
- Actually, no.

884
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:14,766
Not even a hug.

885
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,153
A handshake! Yes, a handshake.

886
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:20,053
I think a handshake is enough.

887
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:22,666
Mr. Kwon? How about
you join me for coffee?

888
00:52:23,033 --> 00:52:24,053
I'm alright.

889
00:52:24,133 --> 00:52:26,300
No, I think you should join me.

890
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,186
Just now, you told me to back off,

891
00:52:31,266 --> 00:52:34,353
saying I was infringing on your
rights to happiness or whatnot.

892
00:52:34,433 --> 00:52:37,586
Yet what was that just now?

893
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:40,486
I was simply doing my job
as an advisory lawyer.

894
00:52:40,566 --> 00:52:43,220
If you're here as an
advisory lawyer, then do your job,

895
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,753
instead of being jealous!

896
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:46,953
I wasn't jealous.

897
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:48,900
You were jealous.

898
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,420
I mean, look.

899
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,753
Look at them, Mr. Kwon.

900
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:55,720
Just now, you went on about
how everyone's all conservative,

901
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,553
but look at those two,
holding hands in public!

902
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:59,333
What happened to the
"conservative," huh?

903
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,753
But… That's not normal.

904
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:05,366
Everyone in law is
very conservative, and…

905
00:53:08,466 --> 00:53:09,500
…Kim se-won?

906
00:53:11,033 --> 00:53:13,386
Ah, Jung-rok.

907
00:53:13,466 --> 00:53:14,600
Jung-rok?

908
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,233
What, they're even
your acquaintances?

909
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,020
I don't know them.

910
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,286
Kim Se-won!

911
00:53:21,366 --> 00:53:22,653
Jung-rok!

912
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:23,886
I'll exercise my right to
remain silent.

913
00:53:23,966 --> 00:53:25,933
Look at you, so jealous!

914
00:53:29,966 --> 00:53:31,786
Are you two allowed to
hold hands like that

915
00:53:31,866 --> 00:53:33,920
in your gowns, at court?

916
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,920
Who cares?

917
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,920
It's not like us dating is
affecting work.

918
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Besides, we were tired of
keeping it a secret forever.

919
00:53:40,466 --> 00:53:44,620
We decided to stop caring about
what other people think.

920
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,486
Same here. I wouldn't have
ever thought of doing this,

921
00:53:48,566 --> 00:53:50,686
but Se-won's right.

922
00:53:50,766 --> 00:53:51,720
It's always hard the first time,

923
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,266
but keep at it,
and it's really nothing.

924
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:56,586
Jung-rok.

925
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,020
What do I do?

926
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,366
I guess I'm becoming
just like him.

927
00:54:02,766 --> 00:54:04,000
Sure, sure.

928
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,586
Alright, here's to…

929
00:54:32,666 --> 00:54:34,000
- Always!
- To Always!

930
00:54:41,366 --> 00:54:44,353
So, how did you two
end up together?

931
00:54:44,433 --> 00:54:47,820
Right, you were the
worst of enemies.

932
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,120
Let's be honest,
I'm not saying this because

933
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,953
he's my boyfriend, but
Mr. Choi was born to be loved!

934
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:54,220
He's handsome,

935
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,286
competent, and is a gentleman.

936
00:54:56,366 --> 00:54:57,386
Not only that,
he's such a filial son.

937
00:54:57,466 --> 00:55:00,020
He really is the perfect man!

938
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,820
Same with Ms. Dan.

939
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,200
Sometimes she's cute,
sometimes she's just so chic.

940
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,933
She's a woman with
a thousand charms!

941
00:55:08,133 --> 00:55:09,253
Sure.

942
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:11,553
Though I can't quite
agree with what you said,

943
00:55:11,633 --> 00:55:13,466
a promise is a promise.

944
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:18,320
Here, go buy yourselves new suits.

945
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,620
Thank you, Mr. Yeon.

946
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,786
Should we get matching suits?

947
00:55:21,866 --> 00:55:24,800
Something lovely,
that will suit you perfectly?

948
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,653
No, no.

949
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:28,620
Let's go for something
classic and chic,

950
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,886
that suits you perfectly.

951
00:55:30,966 --> 00:55:32,186
Honey…

952
00:55:32,266 --> 00:55:33,266
Here.

953
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,386
I don't know why
I'm paying money to

954
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:38,566
watch you two like that.

955
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,986
Anyway, if there are
any other couples

956
00:55:41,066 --> 00:55:41,786
who are yet to come out,
here's your chance.

957
00:55:41,866 --> 00:55:43,120
In fact, why don't you all

958
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,820
use this chance to
get matching suits?

959
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,320
I have a big loan to
pay off anyway,

960
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,153
and whether it's 700 grand
or 770 grand,

961
00:55:48,233 --> 00:55:49,533
there's not much
difference, is there?

962
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:53,820
Um, Hae-young…
How about we use this chance

963
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,553
and get matching suits?

964
00:55:55,633 --> 00:55:57,100
I have plenty, thank you.

965
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,353
So, uh… Mr. Kwon.

966
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:13,600
Is something up?

967
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,486
Right.

968
00:56:16,566 --> 00:56:18,700
You don't look so good.

969
00:56:20,366 --> 00:56:22,753
Don't tell me that you'd been
secretly in love with Dan,

970
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:24,853
but now that she's going out
with Choi, you're all heartbroken

971
00:56:24,933 --> 00:56:27,853
and that's why you're
drinking in silence, like this!

972
00:56:27,933 --> 00:56:29,686
Is that true?

973
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:32,353
Unrequited love is still love.
I'll be rooting for you.

974
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:33,766
Oh, no…

975
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:43,900
Mr. Kwon, are you still having
dinner with everyone?

976
00:56:45,866 --> 00:56:47,053
I see.

977
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:49,633
I just got off,
and I'm on my way home.

978
00:56:51,466 --> 00:56:54,000
Then call me, once you're done.

979
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,066
Alright.

980
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,353
Did Mr. Kwon say anything?

981
00:56:59,433 --> 00:57:01,486
Say anything?

982
00:57:01,566 --> 00:57:03,333
- Why?
- Well, uh…

983
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,386
Back then,

984
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:11,453
he was all jealous over
that kiss scene,

985
00:57:11,533 --> 00:57:13,053
so I told him
he's taking it too far.

986
00:57:13,133 --> 00:57:14,986
I'm worried that
he took it to heart.

987
00:57:15,066 --> 00:57:16,066
Huh?

988
00:57:18,766 --> 00:57:20,920
But then again, that's the
price of dating a celebrity.

989
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,786
You need to pretend you're fine
with your girlfriend's kiss scene,

990
00:57:23,866 --> 00:57:26,320
but really, you're jealous…

991
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,886
And it's not like you can tell
anyone you're dating her,

992
00:57:28,966 --> 00:57:32,266
let alone be seen with her
in public.

993
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:35,753
Yoon-seo,

994
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:38,553
this is why I'm worried.

995
00:57:38,633 --> 00:57:41,120
I'm worried whether
you two will be okay.

996
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,053
Because dating in secret…

997
00:57:43,133 --> 00:57:45,633
You're bound to get tired of it
sometime or later.

998
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:55,300
Here. Honey, say ah!

999
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,333
You two, honey. Ah!

1000
00:58:02,766 --> 00:58:05,366
Love is blooming in Always.

1001
00:58:06,466 --> 00:58:07,720
Well…

1002
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,986
For me, rage is
blooming in my heart.

1003
00:58:11,066 --> 00:58:12,153
You know what?

1004
00:58:12,233 --> 00:58:13,820
After watching those two,

1005
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,886
I think I now know why
CEOs hate office dating.

1006
00:58:16,966 --> 00:58:18,420
I mean, what has the
CEO done so wrong to

1007
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,653
pay them and
watch them be like that?

1008
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:23,820
You know, all this stress is
going to make me ill,

1009
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,553
so if you're all done, let's go.

1010
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:26,633
Let's go, then.

1011
00:58:28,466 --> 00:58:30,086
- Ah, Yoon-seo!
- Hello.

1012
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:31,853
Yoon-seo.

1013
00:58:31,933 --> 00:58:33,433
What brings you here?

1014
00:58:34,266 --> 00:58:36,786
I heard you guys were
having a group dinner here,

1015
00:58:36,866 --> 00:58:38,153
so here I am!

1016
00:58:38,233 --> 00:58:40,253
Great timing.
We were only getting started.

1017
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,600
This way, please.

1018
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:44,400
This way.

1019
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,786
Jong-hwa, where was
your seat again?

1020
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:51,966
- Over there.
- Right?

1021
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:56,520
Yoon-seo, Yoon-seo!

1022
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,186
We have big news.

1023
00:58:58,266 --> 00:59:00,420
And it's that…

1024
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,700
Ms. Dan and Mr. Choi are dating!

1025
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:05,486
- What, really?
- Yes, we are.

1026
00:59:05,566 --> 00:59:09,066
We were planning to tell you soon.

1027
00:59:10,066 --> 00:59:11,620
Wow, congratulations!

1028
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,886
Kwon.

1029
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,286
Aren't you happy to see Yoon-seo?

1030
00:59:14,366 --> 00:59:15,720
Why are you all silent?

1031
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,886
- Pardon?
- Oh what?

1032
00:59:16,966 --> 00:59:18,120
Are you sure
nothing's up with you?

1033
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,900
You look all down.

1034
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,553
Is it because it's spring?

1035
00:59:22,633 --> 00:59:24,066
You're lonely, aren't you?

1036
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,186
- Is that why?
- What…

1037
00:59:26,266 --> 00:59:27,853
What do you mean, what?

1038
00:59:27,933 --> 00:59:30,766
Actually, why don't we
set up a blind date for him?

1039
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,486
I'll pass, thank you.

1040
00:59:33,566 --> 00:59:34,520
What do you mean?

1041
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,920
It's obvious you're still single.

1042
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,820
Take the chance when
it's offered to you, alright?

1043
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,686
Hae-young, Dan!

1044
00:59:40,766 --> 00:59:42,286
Do you know anyone
who's available?

1045
00:59:42,366 --> 00:59:43,566
Anyone around you?

1046
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,186
Um…!

1047
00:59:47,266 --> 00:59:52,066
Mr. Kwon has a girlfriend.

1048
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,433
- What…
- Really?

1049
00:59:57,866 --> 00:59:59,753
Kwon has a girlfriend?

1050
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:01,933
Yes, well…

1051
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,533
And she's…

1052
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,100
She's me!

1053
01:00:16,766 --> 01:00:18,400
Aw, please!

1054
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,653
You really are an actress.

1055
01:00:21,733 --> 01:00:23,653
The way you fooled us
without even batting an eye…

1056
01:00:23,733 --> 01:00:26,120
"And she's…"
Gosh, even I can't do that!

1057
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,266
But it's true.

1058
01:00:33,633 --> 01:00:36,100
Though I hesitated at first,

1059
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,086
since you are all so important
to me and I trust you,

1060
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:42,033
I wanted to be honest.

1061
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:46,953
Mr. Kwon and I…

1062
01:00:47,033 --> 01:00:48,386
We're…

1063
01:00:48,466 --> 01:00:51,933
We're really a couple.

1064
01:01:02,733 --> 01:01:08,066
And I love Mr. Kwon very much.

1065
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:11,700
I see.

1066
01:01:19,033 --> 01:01:20,900
Mr. Yeon, isn't that hot?

1067
01:01:22,566 --> 01:01:23,633
Argh, hot!

1068
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:32,253
I'm crying because
my hand hurts so much.

1069
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:33,520
- Really?
- Yes, because of the pain.

1070
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,686
Not because you're heartbroken?

1071
01:01:34,766 --> 01:01:37,453
No, no. Because of my hand.

1072
01:01:37,533 --> 01:01:38,886
Because it hurts so bad.

1073
01:01:38,966 --> 01:01:40,700
What do I do…

1074
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:43,853
Anyway, congratulations.

1075
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:44,933
Gosh, that's hot.

1076
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,653
Let me go to the restroom.

1077
01:01:46,733 --> 01:01:48,133
What great news!

1078
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:49,866
Restroom…

1079
01:01:50,766 --> 01:01:52,600
Don't look at me.
Congratulate them.

1080
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,200
Ah, sure.

1081
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,033
Congratulations, Yoon-seo.

1082
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,886
I never would've imagined it

1083
01:02:04,966 --> 01:02:07,520
that there would be
so many couples in our office.

1084
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,886
Exactly.

1085
01:02:08,966 --> 01:02:10,686
But I never would've thought

1086
01:02:10,766 --> 01:02:12,886
Mr. Kwon and Yoon-seo
would be together.

1087
01:02:12,966 --> 01:02:15,520
They're so different,

1088
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,253
yet… look so great together.

1089
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:19,833
I think they're a great match.

1090
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,286
Hey, forsythia.

1091
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:25,486
Ah, you're right.

1092
01:02:25,566 --> 01:02:27,753
Forsythia's my favorite flower.

1093
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:31,286
Do you know what the meaning
behind forsythias is?

1094
01:02:31,366 --> 01:02:32,420
No.

1095
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,566
What is it?

1096
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,953
My love is…

1097
01:02:41,033 --> 01:02:42,933
…deeper than your love.

1098
01:02:44,366 --> 01:02:46,133
Oh, I see.

1099
01:02:52,266 --> 01:02:55,653
Um, Ms. Yang?

1100
01:02:55,733 --> 01:03:00,033
If it's okay with you, how about
we have dinner sometime?

1101
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,366
Sure, let's do that.

1102
01:03:17,366 --> 01:03:19,953
Why the wine?

1103
01:03:20,033 --> 01:03:23,186
I wanted to drink to
celebrate today.

1104
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,520
Today's the day
we told anyone about

1105
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,800
our relationship.

1106
01:03:29,733 --> 01:03:32,386
But… Will it really be okay?

1107
01:03:32,466 --> 01:03:34,953
Because of me, you…

1108
01:03:35,033 --> 01:03:36,720
Mr. Kwon.

1109
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:41,633
Do you know the words
you say to me the most?

1110
01:03:42,866 --> 01:03:44,753
"Are you okay?"

1111
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:47,286
You always ask me,

1112
01:03:47,366 --> 01:03:50,320
if I'm really okay.

1113
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,220
And suddenly,
it occurred to me today.

1114
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:57,133
You're always asking me
whether I'm okay,

1115
01:03:58,533 --> 01:04:00,800
but what about you?

1116
01:04:02,033 --> 01:04:04,353
What if you had
no time to worry about yourself,

1117
01:04:04,433 --> 01:04:07,866
because you're always
worrying about me instead?

1118
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,920
If you're not okay, Mr. Kwon,

1119
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,833
then I'm not okay.

1120
01:04:15,133 --> 01:04:17,353
Because the way you feel is

1121
01:04:17,433 --> 01:04:19,833
how I feel.

1122
01:04:22,366 --> 01:04:24,053
Oh, and one more thing.

1123
01:04:24,133 --> 01:04:28,186
I wanted to see you today to
tell you this.

1124
01:04:28,266 --> 01:04:29,333
What is it?

1125
01:04:31,966 --> 01:04:33,820
That kiss scene just now…

1126
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,753
We weren't kissing for real.

1127
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,386
Yes, well…

1128
01:04:37,466 --> 01:04:39,120
You don't have to
bring that up anymore.

1129
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,053
Don't try to avoid the subject.

1130
01:04:41,133 --> 01:04:43,820
That's just acting. Acting!

1131
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,820
That wasn't a real kiss.

1132
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,020
Look.

1133
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:52,353
We just hold each other like this,
and we do this.

1134
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:55,333
We only tilt our heads and
pretend we kiss.

1135
01:04:58,466 --> 01:05:02,066
So no misunderstandings, alright?

1136
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,353
Us actors all have our tricks.

1137
01:05:06,433 --> 01:05:09,853
Tricks to pull off
something as real.

1138
01:05:09,933 --> 01:05:13,100
Then is this…

1139
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,833
…how the real thing is done?

1140
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,600
Is it alright,

1141
01:05:54,633 --> 01:05:56,733
if I don’t protect you tonight?

1142
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,000
(Touch Your Heart)

1143
01:06:59,233 --> 01:07:00,153
Ta-da!

1144
01:07:00,233 --> 01:07:02,420
But why did she choose
Kwon over me?

1145
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,786
You're so fine-looking,
and unnecessarily handsome!

1146
01:07:05,866 --> 01:07:08,086
How could you be so sly?

1147
01:07:08,166 --> 01:07:09,253
Huh?

1148
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,186
I know you're quick to
fall in love,

1149
01:07:11,266 --> 01:07:12,453
but how could you,
when your boyfriend's right here?

1150
01:07:12,533 --> 01:07:15,986
You remember our dinner date
tomorrow, right?

1151
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:17,886
Then I'm really going over to
your place, alright?

1152
01:07:17,966 --> 01:07:18,886
Sure.

1153
01:07:18,966 --> 01:07:21,786
Your one-day secretary is
waiting for you in your office.

1154
01:07:21,866 --> 01:07:23,953
- Ms. Oh Jin-sim!
- The flight's tomorrow.

1155
01:07:24,033 --> 01:07:25,353
- What?
- Now that you're dating an actress,

1156
01:07:25,433 --> 01:07:26,886
you're up to things
you were never up to before.

1157
01:07:26,966 --> 01:07:28,386
Now you're really like those
male leads in those rom-coms.

1158
01:07:28,466 --> 01:07:30,586
I just want to say,

1159
01:07:30,666 --> 01:07:32,600
that I'll be right here,
waiting for you.
