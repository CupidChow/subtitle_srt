00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:41,200
(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:50,900
Excuse me.

3
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,800
I mean you, Mr. Kwon.

4
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,966
Are you...

5
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,166
...not interested in women?

6
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:03,753
What?

7
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,166
So what I mean is,

8
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,333
are you into...

9
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:11,900
Are you not into women?

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry to
disappoint you, but...

11
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:20,820
What are you doing?

12
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,900
I...

13
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,520
I'm into women.

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,233
I'm very into women.

15
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,300
Extremely into women.

16
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:34,000
It's just that...

17
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm not interested in you,
whatsoever.

18
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,766
Can you please leave now, then?

19
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,800
Excuse me!

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,486
Since you say
you're so into women,

21
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:58,420
let me give you a piece of advice.

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,620
Do something about
your personality!

23
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,600
I mean, what woman would like
cranky guys like you?

24
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:06,953
I won't ask you to like me,

25
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,466
so don't worry.

26
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:11,753
Who should be
worrying about who here?

27
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:15,653
Anyway, I hope
you'll keep your word.

28
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:17,420
Or what is it?
Are you not confident anymore?

29
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,786
It's not that I'm not confident,
it's that I don't have time.

30
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:23,233
Because now I have to look for
the files you've lost, Jin-shim.

31
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:27,366
It's Oh Yoon-seo. Oh Yoon-seo!

32
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,266
Yoon-seo! About your
welcoming party tonight...

33
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,886
Did I do something wrong?

34
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:48,486
I think she just had
a fight with Mr. Kwon.

35
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:49,920
Why?

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,720
Don't they get along?

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,220
How am I supposed to know that?

38
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,986
Then why assume that
they had a fight?

39
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:57,233
Just.

40
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,366
- Oh what?
- Oh what?

41
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,400
(Episode 2)

42
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,853
Kwon Jung-rok, you bastard!

43
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:14,953
You prick...

44
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:18,953
You nasty, damned bastard!

45
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,866
I hate you!

46
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,033
Gosh, it's cold.

47
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:31,720
But then again, Vivien Leigh said so

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,566
from "Gone with the Wind,"
didn't she?

49
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:37,720
"After all,

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,000
tomorrow is another day."

51
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,553
It's cold...

52
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:46,466
I really do just want to be
gone with the wind.

53
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,986
Mr. Kwon, what are you doing?
Looking for something?

54
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,500
It's nothing.

55
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,486
By the way,

56
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:59,853
did you and Yoon-seo have a fight?

57
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:00,886
We did no such thing.

58
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:03,120
But then again,
how could you get mad at

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,453
a fine secretary like Yoon-seo?

60
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:06,553
You know me, right?

61
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:08,853
That I rarely compliment anyone.

62
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,153
But I must do so, about Yoon-seo.

63
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:14,020
Talk about perfect looks, and
perfect personality!

64
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,486
You know, I say

65
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:18,586
she'd be better with me than you,
since I'm also perfect.

66
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,553
Perhaps Mr. Yeon partnered her up
with the wrong lawyer?

67
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:23,220
Is that all your business?

68
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,553
Oh, would you look at me?

69
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:25,753
I came to return this.

70
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:26,933
Thanks.

71
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,586
Why do you have this?

72
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,753
Oh what?

73
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,666
I told you yesterday that
I'll be borrowing it brief...

74
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,586
Oh, that's right!

75
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,833
I was going to tell you that
I was, but I forgot.

76
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,033
Why take someone else's stuff
without a word?

77
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,553
Hey, I'm sorry.

78
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:52,586
I had to request a provisional
injunction against

79
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,020
deliverance of possession,
so I was too busy to ask.

80
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,153
You know
what it's like to be busy,

81
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:58,666
so let me off
on this one, alright?

82
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,500
(Provisional injunction against
deliverance of possession)

83
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,586
(Tasks for this morning)

84
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:22,833
(3. Tidy desk, neatly)

85
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:35,286
I'm off to Court, and I'll be
heading home straight from there.

86
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:37,320
Do as you wish.

87
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,533
And...

88
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:41,466
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:45,000
About what?

90
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:47,953
The papers you...

91
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,453
I mean, the papers
I thought you lost...

92
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,820
Turns out Mr. Choi had them.

93
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,320
Pardon?

94
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,820
I'm sorry I accused you without
even looking for them properly.

95
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,920
Hold on.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,520
So you're saying
it's not my mistake,

97
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,120
but yours?

98
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,986
Yes, so I'm apolo...

99
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,720
You think apologizing
will just cut it?

100
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,453
You already hurt me,

101
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:11,666
so you think sorry will
solve everything?

102
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:16,820
If those papers were so important,
put them in a safe place!

103
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,900
Why point fingers at me when
you were the one who lost them?

104
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:26,686
Please don't jump to
conclusions from now on.

105
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:27,953
And appreciate it
when I tidy your desk,

106
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:30,733
instead of getting cranky.

107
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:33,920
I can't agree on that one.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,353
While I do admit I was hasty
in jumping to conclusions,

109
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:37,620
I had my desk organized
in my own way

110
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,820
so please, don't ever touch it.

111
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,033
Then...

112
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,733
Then...?

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,920
What the...

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Was he here to apologize,
or to pick a fight?

115
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,200
Hey.

116
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:51,920
Ah, Mr. Kwon!

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,420
You haven't forgotten about
the welcoming party, have you?

118
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,386
I thought I already told you
I'm seeing a client.

119
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:57,953
Come on, but we can't
not have you there.

120
00:06:58,033 --> 00:06:59,253
When it's a welcoming party for
your own secretary.

121
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,420
Who's the one
who decided it'll be tonight

122
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,020
without even asking me
whether my schedule was free?

123
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,320
Me.

124
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,453
But even if
your schedule was free,

125
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:06,933
you would've told me
you're not coming.

126
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,953
If you don't come,
Yoon-seo will be disappointed.

127
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:12,366
So make sure you're there!

128
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:17,753
Wait.

129
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,420
Sir, please can you listen to...

130
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,553
Forget it!

131
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,053
Like you're the only lawyer
out there.

132
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:24,453
I mean, what?

133
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:26,100
How could you accuse me of
being a criminal?

134
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,600
But sir! I, uh...

135
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:33,686
I'm sorry, sir.

136
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:35,720
You see, he's filthy rich

137
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,153
yet he was refusing to pay taxes,

138
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:39,653
and I let my sense of justice
get ahead of me...

139
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,220
No, well done. Well done, you!

140
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,586
Why, justice is important.

141
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,753
What if we make
a little less money?

142
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,253
We'll just be a little behind
on our rents, right?

143
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,753
At least we guarded justice,
even if it means we won't be

144
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,253
getting our own building.
So well done!

145
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,653
You know what I mean, right?

146
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:51,900
Good one.

147
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,100
Doors closing.

148
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,320
The evidence is clear,

149
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,520
so that should be
at least 15 years.

150
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,986
Good. Make sure it's settled well.

151
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:06,066
Yes, sir.

152
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,020
Sir, about that woman
who murdered her own husband.

153
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,386
Please leave that case to me.

154
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:13,233
I'll make sure that
she is sentenced.

155
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:15,153
What's this case about?

156
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:16,986
This woman stabbed
her husband to death,

157
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:18,986
and her ex-husband also happened
to perish in fire a few years ago.

158
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,853
Something's definitely fishy.

159
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,720
It could be that her ex was
also murdered as well.

160
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,100
What makes you think that?

161
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:30,486
I looked at the case file,

162
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:32,866
and I could see that
she was a little coquette.

163
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,766
So I hear Kim Se-won is
coming back.

164
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:39,053
He'll be here from tomorrow.
Didn't you hear?

165
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,053
You guys don't keep in touch
after breaking up?

166
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:43,286
Don't cause trouble.

167
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:45,186
I don't care what goes on
between you two,

168
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:47,286
but I won't ever see you

169
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:49,320
tainting our reputation again.

170
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,800
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

171
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,766
First floor.

172
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,520
It's been a long time.

173
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,633
Yeah.

174
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,820
I heard the news.

175
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,500
So you're coming back.

176
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,866
Yes, I am.

177
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,320
I take it you've been well?

178
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,600
Thanks to you, yes.

179
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,486
So you were just
with the Chief, were you?

180
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,633
Yeah.

181
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:04,920
Did you have lunch yet?

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,186
I did.

183
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:08,220
You should eat more.

184
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,600
You look skinny.

185
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,153
A welcome party?

186
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:22,986
Do you have to go?

187
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:25,986
What if you get drunk and
do something you regret?

188
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:27,553
Don't worry.

189
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:28,986
I'll watch myself.

190
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:32,186
I mean, I can't turn it down
when the party's for me.

191
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,053
Anyway, I'll call once it's over.

192
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,253
Alright. Then I'll be
waiting for you

193
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,020
somewhere nearby, so call me
once you're done.

194
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,986
And hey, don't drink too much.

195
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,553
Oh, alright!

196
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:42,720
Hyuk-jun.

197
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,986
I'm Oh Yoon-seo!

198
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:48,333
What, you think I'll get drunk
and say stupid things?

199
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,553
I'll stay classy and elegant
until the very end,

200
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:54,766
so don't you worry.

201
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:02,786
I know, right?

202
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:06,186
I was only trying to do my best,

203
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,486
hoping to hear a thank you.

204
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:10,686
That's why I tidied his desk.

205
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:12,120
You know what I mean right,
Ms. Yang?

206
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,253
What? Yes, of course I know.
That you've been working hard.

207
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,520
But... Yoon-seo? I think
you've had a little too much.

208
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,320
But Mr. Kwon...

209
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,666
He'd just get mad at me,
and ignore me.

210
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:31,166
Or does he have anger
management issues?

211
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:33,686
You know, I think he might.

212
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:34,720
See, I also made
a very small mistake that

213
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,720
most people won't even
criticize about,

214
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,320
but he was fuming.

215
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,533
Right? That's what
I'm talking about.

216
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,666
I knew it.

217
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,153
So...

218
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:52,420
Why do you think
Mr. Kwon isn't coming?

219
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,620
Because I...

220
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,500
I had something to tell him.

221
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:59,066
Oh no.

222
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,953
She passed out.

223
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:04,120
What do we do?
I think she drank too much.

224
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,886
We'll just have to wait
until she wakes up.

225
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,720
But before that, poor Yoon-seo.

226
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,720
It seems like she's not
doing well with Mr. Kwon.

227
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,786
Sir, that's exactly my point!

228
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,686
If you had assigned her to me
from the very start,

229
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:17,053
it wouldn't have come to this.

230
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:18,886
I would've trained
Yoon-seo in her work,

231
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:20,386
helped her to adjust,

232
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:22,833
- ...and date her.
- and date her!

233
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:25,053
What was that just now?

234
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:26,553
Oh, I'm sorry.

235
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:30,153
But I thought you were
interested in her, so...

236
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:32,253
I won’t deny that
I'm interested in her, but...

237
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,486
Interested in her?
How could you?

238
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,586
How could you dare to
take an interest in her?

239
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,086
"How could you dare?"

240
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,186
Why can't I?

241
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:41,020
I have fine looks, fine character,
I'm rich, I'm competent.

242
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,553
Not only that,
I'm very good to my mother...

243
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:44,353
- Mommy's boy.
- Yes, a mommy's boy!

244
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:46,220
Hey, are you trying to
pick a fight with me?

245
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,500
No, I'm not good with fights.
I'm really sorry.

246
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,566
Oh man, I really...

247
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:55,620
Do you think this will be okay?

248
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,986
Mr. Kwon and Yoon-seo, I mean.

249
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:00,153
From what I read
about that scandal,

250
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:02,820
it seems Yoon-seo can get
feisty when she's mad.

251
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,386
Maybe she'll just
lose it one day?

252
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:07,820
Don't worry. It's my duty
as the leading lawyer to

253
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,920
adjust things as needed before
something like that happens.

254
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,233
So don't worry.

255
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,586
Anyway, why isn't
Jung-rok here already?

256
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,166
What, Mr. Kwon's here?

257
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,100
Where is he?

258
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,366
Mr. Kwon?

259
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:28,486
What's with your face?

260
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:30,420
Is it because you keep
getting mad at me?

261
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,866
Because your face is getting
scarier and scarier.

262
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,353
Therefore, it'll be to
your advantage to

263
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:47,733
settle privately without
taking the matter to Court.

264
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,733
I'm sure that's the case.

265
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,486
I mean, with my position
in the community,

266
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,486
I have to mind my reputation.

267
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:56,853
I really don't want to
have to go to Court

268
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:58,786
over a dog, you know.

269
00:13:58,866 --> 00:13:59,920
But what can I do?

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,586
My son hasn't been able to
concentrate on his studies

271
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,920
because of that dog's barking,

272
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,966
and has been failing
his college entrance exams.

273
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:07,866
Is that right?

274
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,486
He's been repeating for
the fourth time now.

275
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:11,786
If he doesn't make it
again this year...

276
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:13,820
I'm very sorry.
I must get going now.

277
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,486
But why?

278
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:18,820
Come on, just one drink!

279
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,486
My principle is not to
drink with the clients, sir.

280
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:24,600
And, uh...

281
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:28,400
Then I'll meet and discuss this
with their lawyer, too.

282
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:31,386
Alright, then. So just one drink!

283
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:34,220
I'm sorry. But I must
leave you first today.

284
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,300
Then please excuse me.

285
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:38,266
Oh, alright.

286
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,386
But uh... Mom?

287
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:42,686
How about a celebrity as
your daughter-in-law?

288
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:45,553
What? Not over your dead body?

289
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:46,686
But Mom!

290
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:49,086
Why do you have to say
something so extreme?

291
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,633
Say you'll approve, please!

292
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,966
Then I'll see you at home.

293
00:14:58,366 --> 00:14:59,886
Off for round two?

294
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,786
Then how about that bar
right across the...

295
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:02,820
Let's just go home.

296
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,886
Everyone's tired.

297
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:04,920
Yoon-seo's pretty drunk as well.

298
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,633
But it's too early to just say
goodbye like this.

299
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:09,653
So... Where's Yoon-seo?

300
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:12,486
She's on the phone with
her mana...

301
00:15:12,566 --> 00:15:14,986
I mean, her cousin. Her cousin!

302
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:16,620
He says he's on his way to
pick her up.

303
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,220
Um... I'm sorry, but
may I go ahead first?

304
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,320
Jin-hee's almost
done with cram school, so...

305
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,486
Oh, sure! Go ahead first.

306
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:26,053
You too, Mr. Lee.
You're headed the

307
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,986
- same way, aren't you?
- Yes.

308
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:30,386
Then have a pleasant evening,

309
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,400
like that beer we had
together just now.

310
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,820
See you tomorrow.

311
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,386
See you!

312
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:37,586
Wait.

313
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,386
What... Beer?

314
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:40,820
What was that about?

315
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,753
I don’t know.

316
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,953
Hey! Mr. Kwon's here.

317
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:46,553
- Ah, you're here.
- Ah, Mr. Kwon!

318
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:48,853
You're late. We've been
waiting for you!

319
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:50,253
It dragged on, so...

320
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,753
Hey, that's Kwon Jung-rok!

321
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,520
Kwon Jung-rok!

322
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,453
Mr. Kwon, why are you so late?

323
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:03,533
Do you know just how much
I have to tell you?

324
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,586
- Are you drunk?
- Drunk?

325
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,920
Who's drunk?

326
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,766
I'm not drunk, you know!

327
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,520
Kwon Jung-rok...

328
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,000
Mr. Kwon!

329
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:22,733
How about a serious talk
while we're still sober?

330
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,153
Did you just...

331
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:46,166
Did you just push me?

332
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,766
Jung-rok!

333
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,886
- Oh what?
- I'm back to work from tomorrow.

334
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,420
- And?
- I had to come in a rush,

335
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,133
so I haven't found
a place to stay yet.

336
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:44,566
- And?
- So let me crash at your place.

337
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,186
Were you out drinking?
You're late. Let's go in, then.

338
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:49,320
Se-won.

339
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,433
Yeah?

340
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:52,753
Hey, I'm freezing.

341
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,820
I've been waiting here for
two hours, alright?

342
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,200
So come on, let's go.

343
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,333
Hey, let's go!

344
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Ah, it's warm in here. Very nice.

345
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:15,253
I heard you got a new secretary.
Did you have a welcome party?

346
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,920
- How did you know?
- Jun-gyu told me.

347
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,420
That it's someone
out of this world.

348
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,953
Did he tell you who?

349
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:23,033
No.

350
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:26,753
Why? Do I know her?

351
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,520
You don’t want to know.

352
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,366
Why? Who is it?

353
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:33,366
What about Yeo-reum?
Did you see her?

354
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:37,733
Briefly.

355
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:40,786
She wouldn't even
give me a chance, though.

356
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:42,366
What were you expecting?

357
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:45,300
Right?

358
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:48,886
She got skinny.

359
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:50,086
Has she?

360
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,733
And still beautiful, as always.

361
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,020
I think this place is
big enough for two.

362
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,733
Should I just stay here?

363
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:04,253
If you're happy sleeping on the
couch with a blanket, alright.

364
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,486
How about next to you?

365
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:07,520
Do you want to leave?

366
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,533
No, I'm staying.

367
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,153
You've beer in the fridge, right?

368
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,400
I'm sure you do.

369
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:24,753
Shit, I'm so embarrassed!

370
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:25,753
Yes, Yoon-seo.

371
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,086
I get it, so calm down!

372
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,620
And what was that word?

373
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,553
Choose your words carefully,
you're an actress!

374
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:35,353
What about my choice of words?
What better words than "shit?"

375
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:38,986
Because I was so embarrassed
that I could just die.

376
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:40,153
Yes, alright.

377
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:42,720
Kwon Jung-rok... That bastard!

378
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,220
How could he just
push me right there and then?

379
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,433
From what I heard just now though,
he didn't quite push you.

380
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,186
But then again, if he had
grabbed you,

381
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:57,820
you wouldn't have fallen over
so pathetically like that.

382
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,820
That bastard.

383
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,620
What, like it costs him anything
to save you from falling!

384
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,520
That heartless lawyer bastard...!

385
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,286
- Exactly!
- Yep.

386
00:20:04,366 --> 00:20:06,020
I won't just let this pass.

387
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,353
I'm going to get my revenge!

388
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:11,166
Revenge? Hey, come on.

389
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:14,053
Let me avenge you instead.

390
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,786
What do you want me to do?

391
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,253
Do you want me to
chop him up into bits?

392
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,453
No.

393
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:19,486
I'm going to get revenge,
with my own hands.

394
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:21,053
You're going to
tear him to pieces yourself?

395
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:22,166
No.

396
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,186
I'm going to be the
most perfect secretary ever,

397
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,420
and make him completely
depend on me.

398
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,953
So that 3 months later,
when I quit all of a sudden,

399
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:32,953
he'll feel my absence

400
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:35,553
and cry like a baby.

401
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:38,486
That sounds more like getting
revenge on your ex.

402
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:41,320
I'm going to destroy you,
Kwon Jung-rok.

403
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,166
I'm going to destroy you,
and go to hell!

404
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,386
No one should be in
the office at this time, right?

405
00:21:01,466 --> 00:21:02,953
Of course.

406
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:05,086
You start at nine,
but it's only 8 o'clock.

407
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,086
It'll be awkward bumping into
people at the office,

408
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,986
so hurry up into your room and
stay there all day.

409
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:11,553
Alright. I was planning to

410
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:13,386
engross myself with work
starting today,

411
00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:16,186
so I'm just going to hole up there
and focus on work.

412
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:17,620
Focus on work!

413
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,220
Yes, I like the sound of that.

414
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,286
Yoon-seo, let's really
go crazy today.

415
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,533
Alright? Are you ready?

416
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:31,366
Man, but she's the type that
you don't want to see go crazy.

417
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:43,933
Why are you...

418
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:46,533
I dropped this.

419
00:21:47,466 --> 00:21:49,520
Are you alright?

420
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,233
Yes, of course.

421
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,020
Yoon-seo.

422
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,120
- Hello.
- Hello!

423
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,366
Hello.

424
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,933
Hello.

425
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,986
By the way, are you alright?

426
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:14,100
You didn't bruise yourself?

427
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:17,820
No, I'm fine.

428
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,353
What's this about?

429
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:21,253
- Oh.
- You see, Yoon-seo...

430
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,553
She fell over big time yesterday.

431
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,753
Fall over big time?

432
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:26,953
Well, uh...

433
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:29,120
Mr. Kwon arrived
pretty late yesterday,

434
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,720
and Yoon-seo ran toward him,
as if she had

435
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,286
something to say to him.

436
00:22:32,366 --> 00:22:33,720
But she slipped on her heels!

437
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,286
So she lost her balance,

438
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:39,020
but instead of helping her,
Mr. Kwon just dodged,

439
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,753
- and bang!
- Oh my goodness.

440
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,286
Mr. Kwon just dodged?

441
00:22:42,366 --> 00:22:44,086
Yes. Unbelievable, right?

442
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,220
Anyway, Yoon-seo was trying
so hard not to fall over,

443
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,286
so she even grabbed onto
a wheeled trash can,

444
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:50,853
but in the end,
she fell over big time.

445
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:53,120
Um, I'm not sure
if I understood this.

446
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,986
What's this about
a wheeled trash can?

447
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:57,933
Well, uh...

448
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,233
This is what happened.

449
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,400
Oh.

450
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:13,500
Stop.

451
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:17,853
Oh, I'm sorry.

452
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:20,900
I was just trying to help
so she'll understand.

453
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,186
Oh, no.

454
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:26,333
It's alright.

455
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:28,900
Then please excuse me.

456
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:38,420
God, this is so humiliating.

457
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,200
Why did everyone have to
come in so early?

458
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,886
Jung-rok!

459
00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:48,966
Hello.

460
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,366
You were so mean.

461
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:54,166
You really were.

462
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,353
Why did you have to
do that, yesterday?

463
00:23:57,433 --> 00:23:58,953
Why, what did I do?

464
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:00,286
Do you really have to ask?

465
00:24:00,366 --> 00:24:02,666
Why couldn't you help
Yoon-seo back there?

466
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,086
How could you just
dodge her like that?

467
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,720
I never dodged like that.

468
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,986
- I only moved this much.
- Well, you did this

469
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:10,353
and moved away from her.

470
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:12,786
I mean, people normally
catch others, you know?

471
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:14,086
Watch. Normally, you...
You should've caught that!

472
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,633
Why are you dodging,
instead of catching it?

473
00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:22,053
Well, I knew you were odd.

474
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:23,520
Anyway, thank God
it was only us who saw that.

475
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,153
What if other people had
seen it too?

476
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:27,553
She might have had haters
posting pictures

477
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,000
all over the Internet,
mocking her.

478
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,453
Anyway, I do hope

479
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:35,286
Yoon-seo is alright.

480
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:36,786
I mean, she's an actress and

481
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:39,066
she was just humiliated
in front of everyone.

482
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:42,720
What if she says she won't
come into work, starting tomorrow?

483
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,200
What, she might not?

484
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:47,453
What's that look on your face?

485
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:48,700
You're hoping she says so?

486
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,186
If she doesn't come into work,
you don’t have to, either.

487
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:57,720
- Do you really mean it?
- Just kidding!

488
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,886
But be good to her, alright?

489
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:02,300
Come on, be good to her. Be nice!

490
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,600
Be nice to her, come on!

491
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:09,900
Do a favor for my cousin
and be nice to her.

492
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,653
I've never even met him.

493
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:14,166
Well, he's quite adorable.

494
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:20,086
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

495
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,120
- Ah, you're here.
- Hello.

496
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,120
I never knew you were
so heartless, Mr. Kwon.

497
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,600
I'm very disappointed.

498
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:32,020
I heard what happened too,

499
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,066
but I think you were
a little too harsh yesterday.

500
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:41,020
Not a little, but a lot!

501
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,186
Yoon-seo looked really down today.

502
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:45,133
What do you have to say to that?

503
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,086
But then again...
Instead of receiving flowers,

504
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,386
she was put to shame publicly...

505
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,020
Like she'd be in a good mood.

506
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,633
Why did you do that, even?

507
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:57,866
I'm sorry.

508
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,300
My apologies if that offended you.

509
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:14,800
Good morning, Mr. Kwon.

510
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,933
Yes, whatever.

511
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,953
Would you like your
morning coffee?

512
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:22,553
No, thank you. I'm fine.

513
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:25,520
If there's anything you need,
just tell me.

514
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,753
Because I've made up my mind to be

515
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,200
the most perfect secretary ever.

516
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:34,920
Before that, about yesterday...

517
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,786
What? Is he going to apologize?

518
00:26:36,866 --> 00:26:38,986
Alright, then. I'll be generous
and accept your apology.

519
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:41,153
You had drunk too much,
Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

520
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,853
It wasn't a pretty sight.

521
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:44,820
- What did you say?
- I advise that from now on,

522
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,753
you refrain from heavy drinking.

523
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,100
What... Just what is...

524
00:26:53,266 --> 00:26:55,486
Instead of advice,

525
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,233
shouldn't you be offering
an apology instead?

526
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,986
Apology?

527
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:04,786
Well, I fell over yesterday

528
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:07,453
because of you, didn't I?

529
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:09,420
Let's get the facts straight.
It wasn't because of me.

530
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,153
You tripped over your own feet.

531
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:15,520
So you're saying
you're not to blame?

532
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,433
I do feel a sense of
moral responsibility.

533
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,233
Moral...?

534
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:25,586
This is affliction of injury
due to willful negligence!

535
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:27,753
You dodged, even though
you knew that

536
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:30,486
I could be seriously injured
if you hadn't caught me.

537
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,420
In other words,
you had neglected someone

538
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,633
who was intoxicated and
could barely stand!

539
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,086
So you do know
something about law.

540
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:40,053
Well, I was a law major...

541
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:41,853
Anyway, that's not
what's important here, is it?

542
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:45,320
If you have anything to say,
then please say so.

543
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,886
What about the fact that
you drank until you lost control?

544
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:50,720
- Pardon?
- From your previous experiences,

545
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,453
I'm sure you knew pushing your
limit is dangerous.

546
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:56,253
Isn't that also
willful negligence?

547
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,333
Then...

548
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,053
Then... Then?

549
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:01,220
Then?

550
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,333
Then?

551
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:04,733
I hate him!

552
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:10,233
How does it feel to be back?

553
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,586
I'm only grateful to you for
having me back here.

554
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,900
I guess this is why you need to
know the right people.

555
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,953
Did you review the
case files I sent you?

556
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:20,553
Sorry to dump work on you

557
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:21,920
when you barely had time to
unpack everything.

558
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,833
But that's why you called me
in the first place, no?

559
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:26,353
So this Jung Ji-ho...

560
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:29,020
He's the same man
who was indicted for

561
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,020
overseas gambling, is he?

562
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,086
Yep. Park's on that case,

563
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:34,920
so you dig into his slush funds.

564
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,153
Did we secure
any evidence of that?

565
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:37,553
We received a tip-off.

566
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,120
Though there were always rumors
about his embezzlement,

567
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,420
we weren't even able to
indict him.

568
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,266
- Why?
- Why do you think?

569
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,320
Are you telling me to
take the spear?

570
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,853
No. I just thought unless
it's a crazy bastard like you,

571
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:49,966
it would be hard to
dig behind him.

572
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:55,053
Well... I appreciate you
thinking so highly of me,

573
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,053
so I'll do my best, then.

574
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:58,820
It'll be hard, doing all that
work alone.

575
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,353
I'll find you a suitable partner,

576
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:01,353
so good luck.

577
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:02,566
Thank you, sir.

578
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,920
Um... Are you Mr. Kim Se-won?

579
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,253
Yes, that'll be me.

580
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,853
Ah, yes. Hello.

581
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,453
I'm Kim Young-sik,
and I'm a Chief Detective.

582
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,920
I'm Yu Hyun-ji.
We'll be in your care.

583
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,920
Yes, I look forward to
working with you.

584
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,600
I'm Lee Ju-young, and
I'm a district attorney.

585
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,820
I've been assisting with the
overseas gambling case,

586
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,220
so I know much about Jung Ji-ho.

587
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,453
Then we should be
able to get moving fast.

588
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:43,720
Alright, then let's get settled,

589
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,566
and start with the briefing.

590
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:47,733
Let's say in three minutes.

591
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:52,620
Three minutes? We're not
cooking instant ramen here.

592
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,920
I did hear the rumors, but...

593
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,920
We need time to prepare.

594
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,133
I know, right?

595
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:03,820
Yes, this is Mr. Kwon's office
at Always.

596
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,500
- Yes.
- Why even bother?

597
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,866
Yes, please hold on.

598
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:15,853
What are you doing?

599
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:17,933
I just transferred the call.

600
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:22,100
He says he's your client.
Mr. Kim Young-hwan.

601
00:30:23,633 --> 00:30:24,700
Ah, okay.

602
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:33,000
Yes, this is Kwon Jung-rok.

603
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,633
Yes, I'm aware of it.

604
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,053
I'll see you in an hour, then.

605
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:40,266
Yes.

606
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:03,086
I'm off to see a client.

607
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,800
Alright.

608
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:08,053
Oh. And I don't think
I can have lunch with you today.

609
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,986
Yes, don't worry.

610
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:13,920
I'll take care of
my own lunch, thank you.

611
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Alright. You do that, then.

612
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:21,820
What do I do about lunch, then?

613
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,853
Pho?

614
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:24,933
Alright. I'll get them for you
right away.

615
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,053
What's this about pho?

616
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:28,486
Yoon-seo says she has
no one to have lunch with,

617
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:29,520
so she wants me to
bring her some pho.

618
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,320
Oh, really? Then get her some.

619
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,253
It's not like she's asking for
the whole restaurant.

620
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,366
Go buy her some.

621
00:31:34,966 --> 00:31:37,586
By the way, don't you think
she's really pretty

622
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:38,686
when she eats?

623
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:40,653
Well, she does make food
look delicious.

624
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:41,786
Right? She's really
beautiful, right?

625
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,153
That's what got me and

626
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:45,053
had me cast her on the spot!

627
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:46,466
Oh, really?

628
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,233
She really was pretty.

629
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:55,086
(14 years ago)
I'm done for this manager job.

630
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,453
Should I just take out a loan

631
00:31:57,533 --> 00:31:58,786
and open a bar or something?

632
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:00,586
- Four cakes, please.
- Sure.

633
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, alright.

634
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:06,066
Alright. Let's grab soju sometime.

635
00:32:06,766 --> 00:32:07,933
Actually, treat me.

636
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:10,166
Alright.

637
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:12,720
Tsk, damn.

638
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,586
Hey, hey!

639
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,153
You have cakes under
that jacket, don’t you?

640
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:17,486
- No?
- Whatever!

641
00:32:17,566 --> 00:32:19,186
Give them, let's share!

642
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:20,300
Let's see.

643
00:32:20,966 --> 00:32:22,520
See, here they are!

644
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,100
Four of them.

645
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:04,366
- Here it is.
- "Here it is."

646
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:10,020
Yoon-seo had her break with
that ad, you know.

647
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,086
And thanks to her,
I'm where I am today.

648
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:14,333
Time sure flies.

649
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:23,020
You know, I'm going to see

650
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,666
Yoon-seo get back up
on her feet no matter what.

651
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:30,686
Why am I tearing up?

652
00:33:30,766 --> 00:33:32,053
Maybe it's your age.

653
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:34,553
I heard men become
emotional at your age.

654
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:35,553
Oh, really?

655
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:36,633
Shut up.

656
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:38,666
Oh what?

657
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:44,033
Hey, Yu. What's up?

658
00:33:44,966 --> 00:33:46,353
Oh, really?

659
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:47,353
Alright, don't worry.

660
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:49,433
Sure, alright.

661
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,453
Um, Min-ji has to
travel out of Seoul,

662
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:53,520
and you'll have to go with her.

663
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,753
Yu says he's not feeling well.

664
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,553
But Mr. Yeon, who will drive
Yoon-seo to work, then?

665
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,053
Tell her to catch a taxi!

666
00:33:58,133 --> 00:33:59,786
You're already getting her pho,
aren't you?

667
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:01,753
Min-ji's about to make it,

668
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,286
so we need to give her
our full support.

669
00:34:03,366 --> 00:34:05,233
Don't you know who the
trend is these days?

670
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:09,366
Why? Something bothering you?

671
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,886
Nice and hot, right? And the
noodles are still perfect.

672
00:34:22,966 --> 00:34:25,453
I made sure to deliver them fast

673
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:27,520
so you can have them
when they're still delicious.

674
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,066
You're really all I've got.

675
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,753
I think I can finally breathe now.

676
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:34,486
I guess my hard work pulled off!

677
00:34:34,566 --> 00:34:37,786
But why not just get lunch with
people in the office?

678
00:34:37,866 --> 00:34:41,820
How can I, after that
humiliation yesterday?

679
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,066
By the way, did that prick
ever apologize to you?

680
00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:47,553
Apologize?

681
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:49,753
That prick said
he's done nothing wrong!

682
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:50,920
Man, there's no saving him,
is there?

683
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,986
If I ever see that bastard,

684
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:54,666
I'm going to teach him a lesson.

685
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:56,486
That.. That...!

686
00:34:56,566 --> 00:34:58,420
- What?
- That's him, right there!

687
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,120
Who? Who's what?

688
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,920
The prick.

689
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,153
What? Why, I'm really going to...!

690
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:05,233
Hold it.

691
00:35:08,033 --> 00:35:09,333
Man, he's handsome.

692
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,120
Handsome? How?

693
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,900
Take another good look.

694
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,600
I had another good look,
but he's still handsome.

695
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:22,253
Actually, now that
I see him again,

696
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:25,586
he kind of looks like
a little weasel.

697
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,186
But why are you hiding?

698
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:28,300
Huh?

699
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,020
Why else?

700
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,586
I'm supposed to be here because
I wanted an average life,

701
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:35,000
so what if he spots me
with you, my manager?

702
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:36,920
And besides,

703
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,066
it's not elegant, eating pho
inside the car.

704
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,386
I should get going.

705
00:35:44,466 --> 00:35:47,500
A perfect secretary never
leaves her seat, so...

706
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,700
That guy really was
handsome, though.

707
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,553
The food here is great.

708
00:36:03,633 --> 00:36:05,286
We should order from them
next time as well.

709
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:06,400
It is good, yes.

710
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,386
By the way, why won't
Yoon-seo eat with us?

711
00:36:12,466 --> 00:36:14,053
I don't think it's that
she won't eat with us,

712
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:16,120
but that she won't
eat anything at all.

713
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,753
I guess she's still
embarrassed about

714
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,853
falling over like that
in front of us.

715
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:22,120
But when she was
drunk yesterday,

716
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,453
didn't she tell us
she can't eat by herself?

717
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:26,586
I wonder who she's having
lunch with today.

718
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:28,186
Maybe it's just the
Job's Tears Tea again?

719
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:29,753
Whenever Mr. Kwon's out,

720
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:32,700
I caught her having tea
all by herself.

721
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,320
Ah, you're here.

722
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
Yes.

723
00:36:53,266 --> 00:36:55,720
Why are you just standing there?

724
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,753
Did you need something?

725
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,686
Let's go eat.

726
00:37:00,766 --> 00:37:02,353
- Pardon?
- Since you had a lot to drink,

727
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:05,553
how about pho?

728
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:07,366
Pho?

729
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:12,353
I'm fine, thank you.

730
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:13,800
What? But why?

731
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:18,786
I'm on a diet, you see.

732
00:37:18,866 --> 00:37:20,420
- Diet?
- Yes!

733
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,720
I just thought I should.

734
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,353
I see.

735
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:26,466
Then...

736
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:34,253
What was that about lunch,
all of a sudden?

737
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,766
Why couldn't he have
asked me earlier?

738
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,366
Oh what?

739
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:06,166
What's up with her?

740
00:38:13,233 --> 00:38:14,333
You're here again.

741
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:18,733
Hello.

742
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:21,620
You want your usual with

743
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,186
honey oat bread and
honey mustard sauce, right?

744
00:38:24,266 --> 00:38:25,566
Yes, honey...

745
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:29,433
I mean, yes. Yes, that's the one.

746
00:38:30,366 --> 00:38:32,720
How come you remember?

747
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,820
Come on, how can I not?

748
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,686
You're our special guest.

749
00:38:36,766 --> 00:38:38,220
Special...

750
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,386
...guest?

751
00:38:39,466 --> 00:38:40,466
Um, ma'am?

752
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,553
You look exactly like
my grandmother.

753
00:38:44,633 --> 00:38:46,386
Grandmother...?

754
00:38:46,466 --> 00:38:48,553
Maybe that's why
you feel like family.

755
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:52,420
Can I call you auntie from now on?

756
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,533
Sure.

757
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,186
Ms. Dan!

758
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:19,886
Why did you ignore me,
when you clearly saw me?

759
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:21,433
Why are you ignoring me?

760
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,320
Please forget about
all that you saw just now.

761
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,686
Forget what?

762
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:29,420
I was too engrossed in eating

763
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,920
and didn't see anything.

764
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,486
Really?

765
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:34,886
Yes.

766
00:39:34,966 --> 00:39:37,620
I only saw the part-timer
you're crushing on

767
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,686
telling you that you look
exactly like his grandmother,

768
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:42,586
and asking you whether
he can call you auntie.

769
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:45,233
Congratulations,
you've a nephew now!

770
00:39:46,433 --> 00:39:48,820
Can you stop, please?

771
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,286
Come on,

772
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:51,820
don't let that get to you.

773
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:57,186
You'll fall in love again
in no time.

774
00:39:57,266 --> 00:39:58,800
You always fall in love
quickly, don't you?

775
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,820
Mr. Kwon, would you like
a cup of coffee?

776
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,633
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

777
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,053
It's 3 p.m., the most tiring
time of the day.

778
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:26,266
I'll go bring one for you,
so you can concentrate on work!

779
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:31,533
You don’t have to...

780
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:41,986
This is so humiliating.

781
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:44,953
Why did Mr. Choi have to see it,
out of all people?

782
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:48,020
Just forget it. Besides,
this is not the first time.

783
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,066
What was that just now?

784
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:51,986
If I had only been
a little prettier...

785
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:53,553
If I had a great figure like
Yoon-seo and

786
00:40:53,633 --> 00:40:54,553
was as beautiful as she is,

787
00:40:54,633 --> 00:40:56,720
I wouldn't have had to
go through that humiliation.

788
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,286
I bet she's never had
this kind of experience.

789
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:01,986
Bet she hasn't, no.

790
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:03,420
I mean, just look at
all the lawyers here.

791
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,753
Plus there are many
male celebrities

792
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:07,353
who named her as their ideal type.

793
00:41:07,433 --> 00:41:08,620
She was popular, remember?

794
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,720
Yes, you're right.

795
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,286
I guess that's why she was
even involved with a chaebol.

796
00:41:13,366 --> 00:41:15,086
I'm really curious about
what really happened.

797
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,086
You mean the drug scandal?

798
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:17,853
But she tested negative and
was found to be not guilty.

799
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,220
No, not that.

800
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,153
But about her relationship
with that chaebol.

801
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:25,486
I mean, it's true that
she was there.

802
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,686
But then again,

803
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:28,986
she wouldn't have been there
if she didn't know him.

804
00:41:29,066 --> 00:41:30,553
The tabloids said...

805
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:31,720
Huh?

806
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,233
There you are.

807
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,520
Having tea, are you?

808
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:41,020
I was just about to get
some coffee for Mr. Kwon.

809
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,053
I see.

810
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:43,120
- Hey!
- Huh?

811
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,553
You're wearing makeup today.

812
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:46,000
But I always wear makeup.

813
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,133
Really?

814
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,300
Your makeup looks great today.

815
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Yes.

816
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:10,133
Here.

817
00:42:10,766 --> 00:42:11,720
Please enjoy.

818
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,133
It smells very nice.

819
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:15,933
Thank you.

820
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,886
What is it? Did something happen?

821
00:42:45,966 --> 00:42:46,966
Huh?

822
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,833
Nothing.

823
00:42:51,966 --> 00:42:53,320
Why, what is it?

824
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,333
Did that prick give you
a hard time again?

825
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,420
Should I ask Mr. Yeon to partner
you up with someone else?

826
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,586
It's fine.

827
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:01,720
Besides, I told you.

828
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,720
I'm going to be the
most perfect secretary ever,

829
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,520
and get my revenge.

830
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,453
I've already done a lot today.

831
00:43:08,533 --> 00:43:10,820
I transferred calls,
copied papers,

832
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,286
and even brought him coffee.

833
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:13,686
All done perfectly!

834
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:15,266
That's my girl.

835
00:43:17,933 --> 00:43:21,886
Yoon-seo, you'll have to go to work
on your own tomorrow.

836
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,720
I can't pick you up.

837
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Why not?

838
00:43:25,566 --> 00:43:27,486
I have my army drill.

839
00:43:27,566 --> 00:43:28,566
Oh.

840
00:43:30,633 --> 00:43:32,886
Then what do I do?

841
00:43:32,966 --> 00:43:34,700
Get a taxi. Just for tomorrow.

842
00:43:35,766 --> 00:43:37,153
But I don't want to...

843
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:39,320
It's kind of uncomfortable
if the driver recognizes me…

844
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,720
Exactly. I mean,

845
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,420
I was trying to find you
someone else to drive you,

846
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,620
but no one happens to be free.

847
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,053
Alright.

848
00:43:49,133 --> 00:43:50,286
I can take care of myself,

849
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:53,386
so you do a great job
with your drills.

850
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:54,466
Alright.

851
00:43:56,566 --> 00:43:58,220
- By the way, Hyuk-jun.
- Yes?

852
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,320
You've done your
military training?

853
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,833
Why, of course!

854
00:44:04,733 --> 00:44:07,466
What do you take me for, anyway?

855
00:44:08,266 --> 00:44:11,666
I served in
a real tough unit, you know.

856
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,120
I've been too soft on you
until now, have I?

857
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,633
Let me speed up, then.

858
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,353
Hey, you're back much earlier
than I thought.

859
00:44:27,433 --> 00:44:29,100
- What about dinner?
- Yet to have dinner.

860
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,066
That's why I prepared
dinner for you!

861
00:44:33,266 --> 00:44:35,020
Am I not the most perfect
housemate ever?

862
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,620
Don't you want me to
just stay here?

863
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,286
Get your own place,
as soon as you can.

864
00:44:39,366 --> 00:44:41,266
You're so heartless.

865
00:44:42,466 --> 00:44:46,066
That's right. Yeo-reum might
call you out for a drink soon.

866
00:44:48,266 --> 00:44:50,253
She's probably stressed out
because of me.

867
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,253
So can you, uh...

868
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:52,720
You solve your own affairs.

869
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,120
Why? She likes you.

870
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,853
She trusts you, and
always goes to you.

871
00:44:57,933 --> 00:45:00,433
Then she would've picked me,
not you.

872
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,053
- Right?
- Don't get cocky.

873
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:05,153
I hate that.

874
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:06,886
You're so cranky.

875
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:09,053
Hey, do something
about your personality.

876
00:45:09,133 --> 00:45:10,720
If it wasn't me but
someone else who was here,

877
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,820
they wouldn't be able to
put up with you anymore.

878
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,433
I bet that secretary has a hard
time adjusting to you.

879
00:45:18,366 --> 00:45:19,366
Whatever.

880
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,766
Whatever, he says.

881
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,633
(Provisional injunction against
deliverance of possession)

882
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:46,220
I can't see the documents
I need to review right now.

883
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,286
Have you forgotten? I told you to
just kill some time

884
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:49,253
if you have nothing to do!

885
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,720
I was only trying my best,

886
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,920
so do you have to
get so mad at me?

887
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,186
Fine, I admit there's not much
I can do,

888
00:45:55,266 --> 00:45:58,120
but at least I try,
when you teach me.

889
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,386
The tabloids said...

890
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:01,020
Tabloids?

891
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,600
Huh? There you are.

892
00:46:04,433 --> 00:46:05,520
Please enjoy.

893
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,920
It smells very nice.

894
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,066
Thank you.

895
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,500
As long as
I drive like that, right?

896
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,566
Just don't panic,

897
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:53,820
and I'll get there safely.

898
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:54,966
Ready...

899
00:46:57,666 --> 00:46:58,766
...action!

900
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:13,000
Alright.

901
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,766
Yes, I'm going. I am!

902
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:18,720
Hey, drive properly!

903
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,220
- I'd like to drive properly, too.
- Hey, roll down that window!

904
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,520
Roll down that window, you!

905
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,020
The office is just there,
so why am I not there already?

906
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,353
Hey, I said to roll it down!

907
00:47:28,433 --> 00:47:32,033
- Oh, you're not? Fine.
- Oh my God!

908
00:47:34,433 --> 00:47:35,853
Oh what?

909
00:47:35,933 --> 00:47:37,033
Why isn't he moving?

910
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:42,366
Let's go, then.

911
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:51,653
Oh my gosh!

912
00:47:51,733 --> 00:47:53,233
Did I just crash into his car?

913
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,286
More trouble for actress
Oh Yoon-seo, it seems.

914
00:47:58,366 --> 00:48:01,553
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo, who announced
a temporary hiatus two years ago

915
00:48:01,633 --> 00:48:04,453
following a drug scandal, has
met with another public backlash

916
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:06,120
after causing trouble on the road.

917
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,853
...Another public backlash...

918
00:48:07,933 --> 00:48:09,000
Oh no.

919
00:48:11,033 --> 00:48:12,086
Get out.

920
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:13,653
Hey, get out!

921
00:48:13,733 --> 00:48:14,886
Get out, missus.

922
00:48:14,966 --> 00:48:17,700
God, my day's completely
ruined already!

923
00:48:18,533 --> 00:48:20,020
My car's completely damaged.

924
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,386
You crashed into my car,
so get out!

925
00:48:23,466 --> 00:48:25,353
I'd like to take a look at
that face!

926
00:48:25,433 --> 00:48:27,386
Come on, take off your sunnies
and roll down that window!

927
00:48:27,466 --> 00:48:29,053
Get out, you! Get out!

928
00:48:29,133 --> 00:48:30,653
Why won't he pick up?

929
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:31,720
Please pick up...

930
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,253
Get out here and see the
damage to my car for yourself!

931
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,386
Do you want me to
break your windows?

932
00:48:35,466 --> 00:48:36,720
Hey, I'm right here!

933
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,000
And my fist is right here.
Hey, I'm going to smash this!

934
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:43,966
Please stop.

935
00:48:45,733 --> 00:48:46,686
Who... Who are you?

936
00:48:46,766 --> 00:48:48,486
You can talk with me.

937
00:48:48,566 --> 00:48:51,086
I'm her lawyer.

938
00:48:51,166 --> 00:48:52,953
Law... Lawyer?

939
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:55,286
Just because you're her lawyer,
do you think you can undo the

940
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:56,800
damage she did to my car?

941
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:58,620
No, we can't undo that.

942
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,953
But that doesn’t mean you can
undo your actions, either.

943
00:49:03,033 --> 00:49:04,953
- What did I do?
- Your actions just now

944
00:49:05,033 --> 00:49:06,986
can be seen as reckless driving,

945
00:49:07,066 --> 00:49:09,220
and under clause 2 of
article 151 of the Road Traffic Act,

946
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,520
you may face up to
$5,000 in fines

947
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,920
or a year in prison.

948
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,720
What? But that woman...

949
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,666
She just crashed into my car!

950
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,266
Yes.

951
00:49:22,266 --> 00:49:25,286
And I'm sure the black box
will tell us more.

952
00:49:25,366 --> 00:49:28,753
Including how you
changed lanes suddenly,

953
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:30,233
without your indicators on.

954
00:49:35,566 --> 00:49:37,753
You know what?
It's only a scratch.

955
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,253
And besides,

956
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:41,286
this is just one of those days
on the road, I guess.

957
00:49:41,366 --> 00:49:43,786
I don't think this is
worth getting upset and

958
00:49:43,866 --> 00:49:46,153
raising your voice over,

959
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,820
so I'll just be generous.
Let's settle this quietly.

960
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:50,900
No.

961
00:49:51,633 --> 00:49:53,086
Let's go by the law.

962
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:54,933
I'm quite into that, you see.

963
00:49:59,466 --> 00:50:00,966
Why are you looking at me
like that?

964
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,233
I never looked at you.

965
00:50:08,733 --> 00:50:11,753
Then why are you looking
at me like that?

966
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:14,686
I was wondering if you're really
okay, not seeing a doctor.

967
00:50:14,766 --> 00:50:16,133
I don't need to.

968
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,700
I'm fine.

969
00:50:22,066 --> 00:50:24,333
By the way, how did you
know it was me?

970
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,900
I saw everything.

971
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,986
Get out.

972
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,486
Hey, get out!

973
00:50:37,566 --> 00:50:38,753
Get out, missus.

974
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:41,286
God, my day's completely
ruined already!

975
00:50:41,366 --> 00:50:44,233
You crashed into my car,
so get out!

976
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:50,453
Anyway... Thank you for

977
00:50:50,533 --> 00:50:52,186
stepping out for me back there.

978
00:50:52,266 --> 00:50:54,120
To repay your kindness,

979
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,100
I'll work really hard today.

980
00:50:57,366 --> 00:50:59,600
Yes, whatever.

981
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:05,453
Good morning, Yoon-seo.

982
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:07,366
Yes, good morning.

983
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,633
But you, Mr. Kwon, are
cold as ever, aren't you?

984
00:51:20,866 --> 00:51:22,433
Yep, so cold.

985
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,386
You should be all smiles

986
00:51:25,466 --> 00:51:27,320
if you bumped into Yoon-seo.

987
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,586
How can you be so heartless

988
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:31,820
when you work closest to her?

989
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,120
I bet you treat her less than
a stranger outside the office.

990
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,220
Am I not right?

991
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,066
Sorry? Well, uh...

992
00:51:38,566 --> 00:51:39,920
Come on, smile!

993
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,633
Like this.

994
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:53,253
I know it feels like
you're in Siberia when

995
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:54,653
you're with Jung-rok,
but hang in there.

996
00:51:54,733 --> 00:51:56,353
You have my full support.

997
00:51:56,433 --> 00:51:57,500
Yes, um...

998
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:59,586
And you know,

999
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:02,486
he'll do anything with
one word from me,

1000
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:04,286
so if he ever gives you
a hard time or bullies you,

1001
00:52:04,366 --> 00:52:06,220
come to me at any time.

1002
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,866
And don't think of
leaving us, alright?

1003
00:52:10,633 --> 00:52:11,553
Well...

1004
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:13,766
He might be nicer than
he appears to be.

1005
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,886
What did you say?

1006
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,833
Sorry? Oh, it's nothing.

1007
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:22,800
Maybe I misheard it?

1008
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,933
- Ms. Oh Jin-shim?
- Yes?

1009
00:52:49,033 --> 00:52:50,520
You went to law school, right?

1010
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,986
Yes, just the first semester
of my first year.

1011
00:52:52,066 --> 00:52:53,053
But I wasn't kicked out.

1012
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:54,486
I left on my own will.

1013
00:52:54,566 --> 00:52:56,086
I was too busy, you see.

1014
00:52:56,166 --> 00:52:58,753
Have you ever looked up
judicial precedents?

1015
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:00,120
No.

1016
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,120
Go into the High Court website

1017
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,486
and type in the keywords,

1018
00:53:03,566 --> 00:53:05,786
and you'll find them.

1019
00:53:05,866 --> 00:53:08,233
Please find me
all the precedents there are.

1020
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:10,420
What should I search for?

1021
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,900
For lawsuits regarding
pet dogs and noise issues.

1022
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:17,420
It doesn't have to be a pet dog.

1023
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,520
Any disputes between neighbors
regarding noise is fine.

1024
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,033
Alright. This is your first order,
so I'll do my best.

1025
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:29,133
Yes, well...

1026
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,866
(High Court)

1027
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,333
I didn't expect that
there would be so few cases.

1028
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:45,920
Especially regarding
pet dogs and noise disputes.

1029
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,020
Oh.

1030
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,286
But uh...

1031
00:53:48,366 --> 00:53:51,120
I had a quick search because
I remembered this story.

1032
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,786
There was this case in the U.S.,
not in Korea,

1033
00:53:53,866 --> 00:53:55,620
where someone was sued
by his neighbor

1034
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,486
because of his dog's barking,
and lost.

1035
00:53:59,566 --> 00:54:02,233
And can you guess how much
he had to pay?

1036
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,820
$500,000.00

1037
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,133
Isn't that amazing?

1038
00:54:07,766 --> 00:54:09,820
When did you hear this story?

1039
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,620
Um, during my first semester,

1040
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,953
we had a mock trial session.

1041
00:54:14,033 --> 00:54:17,033
One of the other groups
brought that up, so...

1042
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:19,620
That must've been
quite a long time ago,

1043
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,133
and you still remember all that?

1044
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,953
I have a great memory.

1045
00:54:25,033 --> 00:54:28,153
While I've never been
praised about my acting,

1046
00:54:28,233 --> 00:54:30,220
the directors did say that

1047
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,286
I get all my lines right,
without a single mistake!

1048
00:54:32,366 --> 00:54:33,386
But then,

1049
00:54:33,466 --> 00:54:35,520
I guess it's not something to
show off about.

1050
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,853
I think it is.

1051
00:54:37,933 --> 00:54:39,386
Sorry?

1052
00:54:39,466 --> 00:54:40,753
Anyway, that was a great help.

1053
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:42,100
You may go.

1054
00:54:46,466 --> 00:54:47,500
Sure.

1055
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:53,466
Then, uh...

1056
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,986
Is he because
he's the top lawyer here?

1057
00:55:08,066 --> 00:55:09,800
Because he sure has a lot of work.

1058
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:17,500
He said he despises people
who don't go home on time.

1059
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,100
Should I really go home, then?

1060
00:55:43,266 --> 00:55:44,366
Look at the time.

1061
00:56:14,066 --> 00:56:15,986
I wasn't sleeping.

1062
00:56:16,066 --> 00:56:20,320
I was just thinking about
your schedule tomorrow.

1063
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,166
Why haven't you gone home already?

1064
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:27,533
Well, in case you needed me
for anything else.

1065
00:56:29,033 --> 00:56:30,466
Let's go eat.

1066
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:33,466
- Sorry?
- I said, let's go eat.

1067
00:56:34,966 --> 00:56:37,933
What's with you today?

1068
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,120
Why are you being so nice to me?

1069
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,920
You stepped up to help me
for that car crash,

1070
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,986
and gave me work when
only yesterday, you said

1071
00:56:47,066 --> 00:56:48,420
me doing nothing is helping you.

1072
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,453
And now you're even asking me
if I want to join you for dinner.

1073
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,200
It's just so weird.

1074
00:56:57,533 --> 00:57:00,420
Don't tell me...
Are you firing me?

1075
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,953
So you're being nice to me,
for the last time?

1076
00:57:02,033 --> 00:57:03,120
And this dinner is
a farewell dinner,

1077
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,820
- is it?
- No, it's nothing like that.

1078
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,166
I'm simply just asking
if you want to join me.

1079
00:57:10,433 --> 00:57:11,500
Let's go.

1080
00:57:14,066 --> 00:57:15,066
Huh?

1081
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:20,133
Oh God.

1082
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:35,266
Do you come here often?

1083
00:57:36,266 --> 00:57:37,820
Not many people are here...

1084
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,820
Maybe it's a nice place,
but people don't know about it?

1085
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,900
No.

1086
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,153
This place isn't all that good.

1087
00:57:43,233 --> 00:57:44,586
The meat's pretty tough, too.

1088
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:45,853
Then why did we come here?

1089
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:48,586
You said crowded restaurants
make you feel uncomfortable.

1090
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:51,853
Oh, so you were being considerate?

1091
00:57:51,933 --> 00:57:54,666
How long are you going to
keep those sunglasses on?

1092
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,953
Right, there's no one here to
recognize me,

1093
00:57:59,033 --> 00:58:01,833
so I guess I can just
take them off.

1094
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:08,320
Hey! I was a model for that
soju brand.

1095
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,886
Do you remember?

1096
00:58:10,966 --> 00:58:13,366
"So you're saying
I'm always consistent?

1097
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,853
Well, I always take things on
like it's my first time.

1098
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:20,553
That's why I'm drawn to
drinks that are just like me.

1099
00:58:20,633 --> 00:58:23,200
Consistent, and never-changing.

1100
00:58:23,966 --> 00:58:25,366
Just like the first time!"

1101
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:33,566
Oh what? Now I feel embarrassed.

1102
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:37,400
Can I drink heaps today?

1103
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:39,886
You drink heaps often, don't you?

1104
00:58:39,966 --> 00:58:43,253
I drank a lot last time because
I wasn't feeling so good.

1105
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:48,300
But today, I'm planning to
because I don’t feel so bad.

1106
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:00,753
Hello! Brrr, it's cold.

1107
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:03,133
Ma'am, you should
change the poster!

1108
00:59:03,633 --> 00:59:05,453
It's been ages since
we replaced our old model.

1109
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:08,120
We've no customers here anyway.

1110
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,753
Well, that's why
I brought them here.

1111
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:12,200
- I'll replace them for you.
- Sure!

1112
00:59:24,466 --> 00:59:26,753
I think we picked the right table.

1113
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:29,333
It would've been awkward
if he recognized me, right?

1114
00:59:38,266 --> 00:59:39,366
Thank you! Bye!

1115
00:59:45,566 --> 00:59:48,700
You're stronger than
you seem, Jin-shim.

1116
00:59:50,533 --> 00:59:52,453
Well, all those years in the
entertainment business has

1117
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:53,666
made me strong.

1118
00:59:54,733 --> 00:59:56,820
Being gossiped about,

1119
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,386
seeing malicious comments
on the articles about me,

1120
00:59:58,466 --> 01:00:00,853
suffering from false rumors
spread by tabloids...

1121
01:00:00,933 --> 01:00:02,686
After many years of that,

1122
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,133
I'm immune to it.

1123
01:00:05,633 --> 01:00:08,766
Though I'd be lying
if I said I'm totally fine.

1124
01:00:12,366 --> 01:00:14,466
How's the work at our law firm?

1125
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,420
It's been a bit tough until now,

1126
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,086
but today was manageable.

1127
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:24,153
Today I had something to do,

1128
01:00:24,233 --> 01:00:25,653
was praised,

1129
01:00:25,733 --> 01:00:28,133
and now, this barbecue bonus!

1130
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,886
I'll see you tomorrow,

1131
01:00:42,966 --> 01:00:44,353
Mr. Kwon.

1132
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:46,166
Take care.

1133
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,400
Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

1134
01:00:56,266 --> 01:00:59,066
Please, it's Oh Yoon-seo.

1135
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:01,766
Yes?

1136
01:01:03,066 --> 01:01:04,986
Until now, I never once

1137
01:01:05,066 --> 01:01:08,166
thought of you as my secretary.

1138
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,653
I thought of you as
an annoying burden,

1139
01:01:12,733 --> 01:01:15,633
because you'll be here
only temporarily.

1140
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,433
But I decided to have
a change of mind.

1141
01:01:22,433 --> 01:01:24,186
- Pardon?
- I'd like to give you

1142
01:01:24,266 --> 01:01:26,833
the chance to work
as my official secretary.

1143
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:31,000
Let's start again from
the very beginning.

1144
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:33,500
Really?

1145
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:45,953
Thank you, Mr. Kwon.

1146
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:49,100
I'm really going to do my best!

1147
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:21,333
I...

1148
01:02:23,966 --> 01:02:25,600
I didn't dodge this time.

1149
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,233
(Touch Your Heart)

1150
01:03:09,733 --> 01:03:11,553
Something's fishy.

1151
01:03:11,633 --> 01:03:13,466
She's alright, as a secretary.

1152
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,166
I've made a list of
your duties, Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

1153
01:03:17,866 --> 01:03:19,720
Oh what? After saying he'll give
me a chance to work for him,

1154
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,166
he's working me to death!

1155
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,420
What do you think?

1156
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,086
No one will be able to
recognize it's you, right?

1157
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:25,086
You... You recognize me?

1158
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:26,733
Of course I can.

1159
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,753
Our witness is giving
a false testimony!

1160
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:30,753
What do you think you're doing?

1161
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:32,533
Yes, what do you think
you're doing?

1162
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,520
You should choose
your words carefully.

1163
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,800
What? Yoon-seo's been
indicted again?

1164
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:40,733
I've never seen you
smile like that.

1165
01:03:41,433 --> 01:03:42,386
It's not a date.

1166
01:03:42,466 --> 01:03:43,620
Whatever.

1167
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,100
It's just to study.
