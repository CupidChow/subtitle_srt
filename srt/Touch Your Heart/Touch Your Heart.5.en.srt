1
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,200
(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,733
(Episode 5)

3
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,833
Who is it so early in the morning?

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,566
I'll be seeing a client,
so will be in an hour late.

5
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,620
Alright. I see.

6
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,753
It's going to be cold today,

7
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,733
so make sure to dress warm.

8
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,266
Was that going too far?

9
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,066
Make sure to dress warm too,
Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

10
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:51,453
Well, he told me to dress warm,

11
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:53,866
so I'll dress warm, then.

12
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:56,920
Pink is always right!

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,366
I look so pretty.

14
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,753
Doors closing.

15
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:11,753
Wait! Please wait for me!

16
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,633
Ah, thank you.

17
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,886
Oh, it's you, Kwon.

18
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:18,700
Doors closing.

19
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,686
As always, I bump into you
in the elevator.

20
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,386
Even though I came in an hour late
as I was seeing a client.

21
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:27,353
If someone else heard us,
they'll think that

22
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:30,886
I'm always waiting around the
elevator to bump into you.

23
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:33,966
I was also seeing a client too,
that's why I came in late.

24
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:39,553
By the way, I have some good news.

25
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:41,153
I don't want to know.

26
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:42,886
Your good news has
never turned out to be

27
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:45,400
quite good for me.

28
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,553
I mean it this time!

29
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:51,786
I have two amazingly good news,

30
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:53,286
so which would you like to
hear first?

31
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:56,553
There's the big good news,
and the small good news.

32
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:57,633
Fine.

33
00:02:58,133 --> 00:02:59,686
Since us men always go for big,

34
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:01,653
I'll tell you the
big good news first.

35
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:03,486
Always may be

36
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:05,953
taking on a big, big case.

37
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:07,553
It's 99% confirmed at the moment,

38
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:09,053
but if we do take it,

39
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,766
we'll be able to make
a name for ourselves.

40
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,100
Just what is this case anyway?

41
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:16,866
Oh, that's a secret.

42
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,353
Now the small good news.

43
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:23,466
We're going to have
a group dinner tonight.

44
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:26,186
Kwon?

45
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:28,466
Kwon, where's your answer?

46
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,353
We're going to have
a group dinner tonight.

47
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,420
I won't be there.

48
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,933
You always say that.

49
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,420
Why can't you enjoy even the

50
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,000
good news that's brought to you?

51
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,033
He's a weird one.

52
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,153
Sorry I'm late today.

53
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:44,400
Ah, you're here.

54
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,486
What's all this?

55
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,553
It's so pretty, right?

56
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:56,753
Spring is coming.

57
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,520
So I decided to make it
all... Pink pink!

58
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,586
Even if spring is approaching,

59
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,820
"pink pink" for
a law firm, is a bit...

60
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,953
So...?

61
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:08,266
Are you saying it's not allowed?

62
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,986
You do realize that

63
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:12,620
that's violating my right to
pursue happiness,

64
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,853
and my freedom of
common action, right?

65
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:16,953
How did you...

66
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,286
You told me at the
drive-in theater.

67
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:22,353
I have a good memory,
so I remember everything.

68
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:24,020
Fine, then.

69
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,500
Do what you want.

70
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,233
What is all this?

71
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:44,153
It's not nice to just
skip your desk, so...

72
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:47,453
Still, I prefer black over
"pink pink."

73
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:49,586
Even if you do prefer black,

74
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,453
why don't you try pink sometimes?

75
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:53,986
You'll find that it cheers you up.

76
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,353
Please respect my right to
pursue happiness,

77
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:58,720
and my freedom of
common action as well.

78
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,300
Alright, I'll clear them.

79
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:09,033
The strawberry...

80
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,300
Oh, um.

81
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,386
Take these, too.

82
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:19,186
Just keep them.

83
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:21,353
When I'm away from my desk,

84
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:23,486
you could just leave
a note for me, can't you?

85
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:25,453
So that we don't both just
forget about it.

86
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,566
Then please excuse me.

87
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,166
Then...

88
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:42,166
What the...

89
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:48,966
Yes.

90
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,853
I'll send that certificate of
contents through, then.

91
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:53,933
Alright.

92
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:17,200
(Please send that certificate of
contents to Ms. Jung Da-young)

93
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:21,333
Please send that certificate of
contents to Ms. Jung Da-young.

94
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,566
(Yes, Mr. Kwon)

95
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:29,900
Yes?

96
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,433
"Yes, Mr. Kwon."

97
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:55,033
She could've just said it instead.

98
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,086
Could you submit an application to

99
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,533
change Mr. Park Jae-won's hearing
to next Tuesday?

100
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:14,853
It's been re-scheduled for
February 26th, at 3 p.m.

101
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,320
Please contact the Prosecution
Service in Cheongju

102
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,666
and ask for Mr. Baek Sun-myung's
case files.

103
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,020
All done.

104
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,586
Please check and inform
Mr. Han of the appellate deadline.

105
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,453
The deadline is the 27th,

106
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,200
and he'd like to appeal.

107
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:31,720
Thank you.

108
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,620
I'm sorry I've been
dumping work on you.

109
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,033
No, it's alright. Anytime.

110
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:53,486
Yes, hello?

111
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:55,453
Is this quick delivery?

112
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,633
I'm Dan Mun-hee from Always...

113
00:07:58,366 --> 00:07:59,786
Yes.

114
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:03,220
I need to send something by
quick delivery.

115
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,733
Alright, I'll be waiting.

116
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,933
I wonder what he thinks of me.

117
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,220
He...

118
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,786
He likes me,

119
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:24,153
he likes me not.

120
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:25,586
he likes me,

121
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,620
he likes me not.

122
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,466
He likes me, he likes me not.

123
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,166
- He...
- ...likes me!

124
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,733
I guess he must like you, too!

125
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:43,853
But you know, I've seen
people do it with flower petals,

126
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,786
but never with mandarin oranges.

127
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:47,220
It's my first time, too.

128
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,600
I'm just so desperate to know
what he thinks of me.

129
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:52,720
What's he like?

130
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,420
Is it still one-sided?

131
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,053
Well.

132
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:01,200
I think he's interested
in me, too, and...

133
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,720
Will you hear me out?

134
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,186
Yes, sure.

135
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:09,220
He's the quick delivery guy
who often comes to our office.

136
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,820
And his tone changes
when he's talking to me.

137
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,986
To other people, he's like,

138
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,453
"Did you call for
delivery service?"

139
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,100
But to me, he's like, "Did you
call for delivery service?"

140
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:18,986
Just shows how much
he's excited to see me.

141
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:20,286
But that's not all.

142
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:22,086
They give you a free keychain

143
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,653
after you use their
service for five times,

144
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:24,953
but I only called 4 times.
Just four times,

145
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:26,966
and only four times, yet...!

146
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,020
Yet he gave me this key chain.

147
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,000
Love makes you want to give
everything you have, right?

148
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,986
Wow, that's so pretty.

149
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:39,953
I guess he's head over
heels in love with you.

150
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:42,053
- Really?
- Yes.

151
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:44,353
Since it's coming from you,
who's dated a ton of guys,

152
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:45,586
I'll believe you.

153
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,586
Huh?

154
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,620
I've never… had a relationship.

155
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,086
Oh, right. I read your interview.

156
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,600
So you've never had a boyfriend.

157
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:56,620
But even though
I've never been in a relationship,

158
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,286
I'm good at giving advice on love.

159
00:09:58,366 --> 00:09:59,753
Remember that
matchmaking TV show?

160
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,866
I even hosted that show!

161
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:05,066
So from how I see it,

162
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:07,886
it's 100%.

163
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:09,486
Oh please!

164
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:10,566
Yay!

165
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:15,266
- This is a secret, alright?
- Sure.

166
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:17,786
Wow.

167
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:19,633
She must really like him.

168
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,400
So with mandarins oranges...?

169
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:29,233
Should I try it too, then?

170
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,233
He likes me,

171
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,233
he likes me not.

172
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,966
He likes me,

173
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:53,800
he likes me not.

174
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:55,486
(He likes me
He likes me not)

175
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:57,033
(He likes me
He likes me...)

176
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,166
He likes me!

177
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,053
Ms. Oh Jin-shim,
it's time to go to Court.

178
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,366
Yes, I'm coming.

179
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,420
Our witness' testimony just now

180
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,820
validates my client's alibi as true.

181
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,153
In other words, he was not
present at the scene.

182
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:23,486
So Your Honor,

183
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:25,466
I ask that you sentence him
not guilty.

184
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,520
Mr. Kwon.

185
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,520
It looks like we'll win, right?

186
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,986
Yes, well...

187
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,220
No need to be so humble!

188
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,153
You're smiling, so that means
you're confident that we will.

189
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,933
I guess you're a lawyer,
being happy over a win.

190
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:56,466
By the way, why did you
decide to become a lawyer?

191
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,920
From what I heard,

192
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,220
I heard all your friends from
college are now prosecutors.

193
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,566
Lawyers make much more money.

194
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:12,920
Oh what? He became
a lawyer for money?

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,453
So he's honest too, isn't he?

196
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,766
The more you get to know him,
the more charming he is.

197
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,186
It's lunchtime,

198
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,200
so should we have lunch
before going back in?

199
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:28,733
Sure.

200
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,486
Oh what?

201
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:36,600
Ah, that's right.

202
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:40,686
What if she asks us to
join her for coffee again?

203
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:41,720
No.

204
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,833
Since it's lunchtime, she might
ask us to go for lunch.

205
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,733
Aren't you coming?

206
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:51,186
I am. Let's go!

207
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:53,033
Come on, hurry up!

208
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:57,020
- Kwon Jung-rok!
- Huh?

209
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,386
UFO!

210
00:12:58,466 --> 00:12:59,653
- What?
- Over there!

211
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:00,653
It went over there.

212
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,786
Come on, hurry up!

213
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,233
- Hurry up!
- Jung-rok.

214
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,353
Hey.

215
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:07,853
I guess you had a trial?

216
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:08,933
Yes.

217
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:10,853
I'm bumping into you
quite often, aren't I?

218
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:12,366
What, you don't like that?

219
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:15,720
Hello, so you came with him
today, Ms. Oh.

220
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,886
Yes, well...

221
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:18,620
If you're alright for time,
how about we go for lunch?

222
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,420
How does pasta sound?

223
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,953
Pasta?

224
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:24,800
You see, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

225
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,820
- Is it something important?
- Yes.

226
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,220
It's very important.

227
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,566
And quite confidential, too.

228
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:36,900
I'm very sorry, but
please go ahead first.

229
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,900
What?

230
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,386
Go ahead first?

231
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:46,820
He promised to go have
lunch with him first,

232
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,986
so why won't he keep his promise?

233
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,700
Doesn't he know
just how much I like...

234
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,366
...pasta?

235
00:13:57,066 --> 00:14:00,133
So, what's this important and
confidential subject?

236
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,986
- You know the Lim Yun-hee case?
- Yes.

237
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:07,986
I've been put in charge of it.

238
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:11,120
Here we have a woman who's
a long-time DV victim,

239
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,353
and she stabbed her husband to
death when he beat her up.

240
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,586
So, is this homicide or
self-defense?

241
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,033
What are your thoughts?

242
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,886
But if her claim of
self-defense is accepted,

243
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:24,953
not only is it a burden for the
prosecutor leading the

244
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:26,220
investigation, but many more
people in a similar situation

245
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,620
will claim self-defense
in the future.

246
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,653
And all the lawyers too,
will take this as an example

247
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:32,466
and argue for
self-defense as well.

248
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:35,566
As you can see, it's
a sensitive topic for us.

249
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:40,653
But this is a grey zone.

250
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:41,800
Right?

251
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:46,186
I wasn't asking you,
hoping for an answer.

252
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:49,853
I just took the case, pretending
I'm ready to handle it,

253
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,300
but really, I'm quite lost.

254
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,733
Shall we go get coffee?

255
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,920
No, I have to get going.

256
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,420
Why? I thought
you still had some time left.

257
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,566
I have something to do.
I'll catch you later, then.

258
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,733
Why's he so busy?

259
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:22,986
Why were you in there?

260
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:24,753
To confiscate these!

261
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:29,053
You're not qualified to
have these notes.

262
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:31,220
Do I need to be? For notes?

263
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,753
Why? I thought you didn't
want them from the start.

264
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,853
Now you want them, do you?

265
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:38,253
Not quite, but why take back
something you gave to me?

266
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,953
Because I want to.
These were mine anyway.

267
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,920
If that ticks you off,
then sue me.

268
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,853
I don't think that's necessary.

269
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,686
There's still 20 minutes to go,

270
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:46,920
so why don't we go out
so you can eat lunch?

271
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,933
I'm not in the mood for
lunch anymore!

272
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,353
Why are you glaring at me?

273
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:56,453
I'm not.

274
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:59,186
People always tell me my
eyes always burn with intensity.

275
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:00,186
But to be an actress,

276
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:02,966
you need to be able to knock back
the camera with your eyes.

277
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:13,686
Alright, then. Have a nice one.

278
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:14,766
Um, excuse me.

279
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:16,586
Yes?

280
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,853
Did you have something to say?

281
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:22,220
This is totally out of the blue,
but let's have lunch sometime.

282
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,053
- Sorry?
- How about tomorrow?

283
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,453
Why don't we go somewhere
nice together for lunch?

284
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:30,186
Oh... I don't think I'll be
all that hungry tomorrow.

285
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:31,420
Then let's watch a movie!

286
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,920
Do you like melodramas?
How about "Love in Titicaca?"

287
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,653
- How does that sound?
- I watched it yesterday.

288
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,033
It comes out tomorrow.

289
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,653
Oh... So it comes out tomorrow.

290
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:43,986
Um, I'll just be direct.

291
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:45,833
I like you too, Chan-seong.

292
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
"I like you too?"

293
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,153
So I'd like to
see a movie with you

294
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:52,720
or have lunch with you,

295
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,166
so that I can get to
know you better.

296
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,220
Sorry, but I really
didn't see this coming.

297
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,486
Will you give me
some time to think?

298
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:08,986
Of course.

299
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:09,986
But how much time?

300
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,453
About...

301
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:12,566
...ten years?

302
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,366
Take care, then.

303
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:23,320
I'm off to see a client, and
will go straight home from there.

304
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Alright.

305
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,420
Are you mad at me for something?

306
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,920
If this is about
how I broke our promise to

307
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,453
have lunch together earlier...

308
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,986
It's nothing like that.

309
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:38,186
Then why are you...

310
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,586
Do I have to tell you everything?

311
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:44,586
Don't you know we have
the right to privacy?

312
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,520
Did I teach you this, too?

313
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,220
No, I learned that on my own.

314
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,166
It's stated in Article 17,
of our Constitution.

315
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:55,166
But that's not
what's important here.

316
00:17:56,966 --> 00:17:57,886
Alright, then.

317
00:17:57,966 --> 00:18:00,366
I'll respect
your right to privacy.

318
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:02,866
Um...

319
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:06,500
Can I ask you something?

320
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,286
Between "Avatar"
you watched in 2009,

321
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:13,320
and "What's Wrong With
My Lawyer" you watched last week,

322
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,153
which did you like better?

323
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:17,486
Sorry?

324
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:19,286
I'm asking,
which you liked better,

325
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,466
and which was more memorable.

326
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,086
"Avatar" dealt with a unique theme
so it was entertaining,

327
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,886
but so was
"What's Wrong With My Lawyer,"

328
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:30,233
because I could relate to it.

329
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,353
So you like both,

330
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:37,720
and can't choose between the two?

331
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,300
You're really bad, you know that?

332
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:54,020
Then I'll see you on the
day of the trial.

333
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,453
Sure, please tell me if you need
any more documents.

334
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,166
- I'll see you, then.
- Goodbye.

335
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:07,120
Please re-check with
our witness that

336
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,653
he'll be standing in Court
next week,

337
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,366
and guide him through
the procedures.

338
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,333
(OK)

339
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:23,133
"OK?"

340
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,033
What's wrong with her?

341
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:40,853
Welcome.

342
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:42,900
Should I have booked
a private room?

343
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,620
Yun-seo,

344
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,020
are you fine with having dinner
in an open space?

345
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,120
Sure.

346
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
I'll just sit in a corner,
like this.

347
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:53,900
Mr. Kwon's not joining us
again, is he?

348
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:58,320
Have you ever seen Kwon
join us on his free will?

349
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,086
Hey, over there!

350
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,466
He's joined us on
his free will tonight.

351
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,020
- Alright, cheers!
- Cheers!

352
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,300
We've the whole team here
in a long time.

353
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:23,286
Ms. Dan, why are you
drinking like that?

354
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:24,920
She's been rejected again.

355
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,220
By that quick delivery guy
this time.

356
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,786
- Really?
- Wow.

357
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:30,386
You were quick to fall for him

358
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:32,753
and to be rejected, weren't you?

359
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,020
You must be quite busy, Ms. Dan.

360
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,766
Being rejected at least
once a week!

361
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,033
What did you say?

362
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,153
Anyway, what happened?

363
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:48,953
You said you won't be coming,
just this morning.

364
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,986
What changed your mind?

365
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,100
Well...

366
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,820
Why are you looking at Yun-seo?

367
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,920
Are you here to see Yun-seo?

368
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,853
Yes. I'm here to see
Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

369
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:05,920
Whoa, he straight up admitted it!

370
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,086
Then something's going on
between you two, is there?

371
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,620
What?

372
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,553
That's just preposterous.

373
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:13,420
- It's not like that.
- Then...

374
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,586
...why that shocking statement?

375
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:16,853
It's nothing shocking.

376
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:19,066
I'm really here to see
Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

377
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,353
I had something to ask her.

378
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:23,153
Something to ask her?

379
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:24,653
She's been working diligently,

380
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:26,153
and very enthusiastic
about her work too,

381
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:27,520
even using her own time to
study law.

382
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,420
But today, for some reason,
she was half-hearted in her duties

383
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,153
and expressed her
discontent with me.

384
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:35,020
I know she's not someone to
do that without a reason,

385
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,986
so I came here to
clear any misunderstanding.

386
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:38,120
Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

387
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,166
Just why are you mad at me?

388
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:47,220
What... You're asking,
in front of everyone?

389
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,120
Yes. I thought I should
so others can hear us out.

390
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,186
And if the majority judges
it was my fault,

391
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:54,186
I'll try and fix my faults.

392
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:57,000
So please. Go ahead and tell me.

393
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,053
You said it wasn't because

394
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:07,233
I couldn't keep my promise
that I'll have lunch with you.

395
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,520
Then is it perhaps because

396
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,720
I forbid you from decorating
my office in pink?

397
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,253
- Excuse me, Mr. Kwon.
- What...

398
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,633
What's this about?

399
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,400
Um, you see... I like pink.

400
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,833
I really do.

401
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,320
So uh...

402
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,486
I decorated
Mr. Kwon's office in pink,

403
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:30,853
and he said he hates it. And I...

404
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,220
But that's not why I'm mad.

405
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,820
Then are you mad because

406
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,120
I gave you so much work today?

407
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,520
Because I kept sticking notes
on your desk?

408
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,453
Tsk, you've no humanity, do you?

409
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:46,453
If you have work to give her,
ask her politely in person,

410
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,453
instead of just chucking
notes on her desk!

411
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,720
Even I'd be offended. Right?

412
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,686
No, it's not because of that.

413
00:22:52,766 --> 00:22:53,766
It's uh...

414
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:59,366
Well, I don't think I had
a particular reason, really.

415
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:03,720
I think I was just...

416
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,800
...all sensitive, because
I was hungry.

417
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,200
Yes, right.

418
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:23,086
I'm sorry I made you
misunderstand, Mr. Kwon.

419
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,353
It's alright.

420
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:26,300
I'm glad that's been cleared up.

421
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:28,920
So it was nothing after all.

422
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,966
Then why don't we
drink to your making up?

423
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:33,666
No, there's no need.

424
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,620
I guess Mr. Kwon feels much better
now that it's been cleared.

425
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,766
Come on.

426
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:46,600
Cheers!

427
00:23:49,766 --> 00:23:50,833
That's nice to see.

428
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:56,600
Please, go on.

429
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,433
Sure.

430
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,733
Mr. Kwon?

431
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:20,200
Can I talk to you?

432
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,433
Sure.

433
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:26,053
I thought we cleared
our misunderstandings.

434
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:27,700
So what's this about now?

435
00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:31,653
Why did you?

436
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:34,520
Why did you do that?

437
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,553
- Why did I... What?
- It's...

438
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:37,986
This is about us,

439
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:40,320
so we should solve it between us.

440
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,186
So why did you have to go and

441
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:44,753
blab about it, in front of
everyone else? Why?

442
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,286
Blab about it?

443
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:47,420
As I explained before,

444
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,886
I wanted everyone to
hear me out, and

445
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:51,700
if the majority judged that
it was my fault...

446
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:54,886
What, is this a trial?

447
00:24:54,966 --> 00:24:57,453
Picking faults in front of
everyone, that's...

448
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:58,933
How's that different to a trial?

449
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,353
I'm sorry if that offended you.

450
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:05,720
But now that we finally
cleared our misunderstanding...

451
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,620
Clear our misunderstanding?
Whatever!

452
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,220
Oh no, we're not done yet.

453
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,753
Why?

454
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:17,266
Because the reason
why I'm mad at you, is...

455
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:21,200
...entirely something else.

456
00:25:22,366 --> 00:25:23,600
Just what...

457
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,633
Why did you go have pasta
with her?

458
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:33,853
Why not me?

459
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:35,800
I wanted pasta, too!

460
00:25:38,366 --> 00:25:40,820
Then you were mad at me
for the whole day...

461
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,220
...over pasta?

462
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,853
Let's go get pasta tomorrow, then.

463
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:47,153
Why did you?

464
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:52,066
Why did you have pasta
with someone else?

465
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,800
I hate that.

466
00:25:58,233 --> 00:26:00,100
Pasta...

467
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:06,586
Pasta!

468
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,266
I wanted pasta, too...

469
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,120
Welcome home.

470
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,220
Sure.

471
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,653
By the way, Ju-won told me.

472
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:25,666
He saw you having pasta
with Yeo-reum.

473
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:28,453
Pasta again?

474
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:29,886
What do you mean, again?

475
00:26:29,966 --> 00:26:31,286
This is the first time
I'm asking you about it.

476
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:32,920
So what? What if I had pasta?

477
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,120
What about it, huh?

478
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,833
I'm saying, I'm jealous.

479
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,186
What?

480
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:39,920
- Jealous?
- Of course.

481
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,120
Though I'm like this now
after breaking up with her,

482
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,886
that doesn't mean
I'm completely over her.

483
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:44,920
What, you don't think
I'll be mad when I hear that

484
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,920
the girl I'm interested in is

485
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,300
having pasta with another man?

486
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:54,686
If you're mad that she had
pasta with someone else...

487
00:26:54,766 --> 00:26:56,453
Does that mean...

488
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,520
...you're interested in her?

489
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
What?

490
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,733
She's interested in me?

491
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:26,320
Hyuk-jun.

492
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,253
Shall we go for a drive
to the sea?

493
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,653
What are you on about
from so early in the morning?

494
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,153
You need to go to work.

495
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:35,486
Right?

496
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:37,620
I need to go to work...

497
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,933
Did you do something
stupid again, drunk last night?

498
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:45,386
Who do you think invented alcohol?

499
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:47,166
So you did. Yep!

500
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:48,886
I want to ask myself, too.

501
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:50,620
Just who invented alcohol,

502
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,453
only to drive you into
a corner, each time?

503
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:56,053
So what did you do this time?

504
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,120
- I don't know.
- Whatever, tell me!

505
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,686
That way, I can cover up for you

506
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:01,020
or make excuses for you.

507
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,353
I said, I don't know!

508
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:04,200
I want to be alone. Get out!

509
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:07,233
What, here?

510
00:28:10,466 --> 00:28:12,120
We're here now.

511
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,120
Really?

512
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,333
We're here already?

513
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,786
Oh no.

514
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,020
How do I explain myself?

515
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,933
What do I do?

516
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,520
Hello.

517
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,800
Yes, good morning.

518
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,366
Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

519
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,520
Yes?

520
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,120
The trial from yesterday.

521
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,286
Can you check that the
written ruling was sent,

522
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:55,753
and whether the case 2018-327

523
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,186
has been filed for appeal?

524
00:28:58,266 --> 00:29:00,033
Ah, sure.

525
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:03,786
Um...

526
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:05,066
Mr. Kwon?

527
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:10,433
About what I said last night...

528
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,300
Huh? Just what...

529
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,686
Well,

530
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:18,553
about how I ranted about

531
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:21,700
why you had pasta with
someone else, and not me.

532
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:26,800
Well, that was just
out of friendship.

533
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,286
Friendship?

534
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:31,153
Yes.

535
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:32,753
Girls are like that.

536
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,120
Even in high school,
when your best friend goes for

537
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,253
teokbokki with someone else
and not you,

538
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:40,386
you just get so mad, you know?

539
00:29:40,466 --> 00:29:42,600
And it feels like she's been
stolen from you.

540
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,986
I mean, let's be honest.

541
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:50,166
We're like best friends
at Always, right?

542
00:29:51,966 --> 00:29:53,453
"Best friends?"

543
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:55,986
Yes. We are the best of friends.

544
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:57,520
I mean, I work closest to you,

545
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,886
and we have lunch together.

546
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,753
And we solve cases together!

547
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,320
Who else is a better
"best friend" than you?

548
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,753
So... I was a tad bit mad that

549
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:08,820
my best friend seemed

550
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,986
more intimate with
someone else, and not me.

551
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:12,553
Just a tad bit.

552
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:14,620
It's childish, right?

553
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,520
Not only do I look
young for my age,

554
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,866
but so is my mentality...

555
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:29,453
So please forget about

556
00:30:29,533 --> 00:30:30,766
what happened yesterday.

557
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:32,953
- Alright?
- Yes.

558
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:34,266
Alright.

559
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:37,586
Mr. Kwon.

560
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,020
Mr. Yeon wants to see you.

561
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,100
Alright.

562
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:42,920
I'll be back.

563
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Sure.

564
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,433
What am I doing?

565
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:01,586
What did you want to see me for?

566
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:03,253
Did I mention this yesterday?

567
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,386
I did, right? Yes, I did.

568
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:07,433
I said we may have
some good news, right?

569
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,620
That Always may take on
a big case that will have

570
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,920
the whole world know about us?

571
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,553
So it's come to us, has it?

572
00:31:14,633 --> 00:31:16,420
Well, you know.

573
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,533
Here.

574
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:20,386
Have a read.

575
00:31:20,466 --> 00:31:22,466
And this, too.

576
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,620
Isn't this the Lim Yun-hee case?

577
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,920
It's the hottest case
there is right now.

578
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,766
I want to hear not guilty, based
on the grounds of self-defense.

579
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:35,920
I can't.

580
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,033
Why can't you? Why not?

581
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:40,753
I've put you in charge of a big
case, so you should say thank you.

582
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,020
Why are you rebelling again?

583
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,253
This isn't rebelling,
I simply can't.

584
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,386
The number of cases
I'm handling right now is...

585
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:47,386
...thirty-two.

586
00:31:47,466 --> 00:31:49,020
Hey, still.

587
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,386
Everyone's eyes are on this case,

588
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:51,453
so it's too good to pass up.

589
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:54,353
If that's what you think,
then why don't you take it?

590
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:56,120
Besides, you're not
all that busy these days.

591
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,300
And we know you won't get any more
offers for TV appearances.

592
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:00,286
Let's not talk about that.

593
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:02,453
Even if I did get an offer,
I'm not doing it anymore.

594
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:04,200
I've been traumatized
after that incident.

595
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:06,720
All it was, was that
it wasn't my best day,

596
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,786
but there were
all these hate comments!

597
00:32:08,866 --> 00:32:10,053
"Did he really pass the bar exam,

598
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:11,953
because he was
stuttering like an idiot.

599
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:13,400
Maybe he's just a representative,
and not a lawyer?"

600
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,386
It... It really was embarrassing.

601
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:18,020
So from now on,

602
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,553
don’t even mention the word
TV again to me.

603
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:22,253
But Mr. Yeon, you...

604
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,833
I said, don't even
mention that word!

605
00:32:25,366 --> 00:32:26,733
- Cushion.
- I said, don't!

606
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:28,233
Your cushion.

607
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,833
You think this is a cushion?

608
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:36,300
This is a blanket!

609
00:32:39,366 --> 00:32:41,186
Anyway, you're taking
this case, alright?

610
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:43,886
You've taken a lot of cases
with high public interest,

611
00:32:43,966 --> 00:32:47,553
and so the women's rights advocacy
asked for you especially.

612
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:48,633

Huh?

620
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:05,453
I saw this on the news.

621
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:08,286
So you'll be defending her,
will you?

622
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:10,153
Somehow, it turned out that way.

623
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:11,853
Great.

624
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:14,720
If someone as competent
as you can represent her,

625
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,220
maybe her claims of
self-defense will be accepted.

626

Ms. Oh Jin-shim,

627
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,253
do you believe this was
on the grounds of self-defense?

628
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,686
Sure.

629
00:33:23,766 --> 00:33:26,320
From what I heard,
it was on a spur

630

while she was being beaten
badly by her husband.

631

But it's not as simple
as it sounds.

632
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:34,053
Besides, for the Court to judge
it was self-defense,

633
00:33:34,133 --> 00:33:36,233
there are some pre-conditions.

634
00:33:36,966 --> 00:33:38,600
Pre-conditions?

Here she comes.

640
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,086
For the establishment
of self-defense,

641
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,153
a pre-condition is that there was
an attack against you,

642
00:33:57,233 --> 00:33:59,053
or a third party.

643
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:01,020
And that attack must have

644
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,620
happened before your eyes,
at the time of action.

645
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,620
How do you feel?

646
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,620
And finally,

647
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,753
even if you were exercising
action to defend yourself,

648
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:10,133
it can't be at an extreme level.

649
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,720
Put simply,

650
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,186
even if you were taking
action to defend yourself,

651
00:34:14,266 --> 00:34:16,500
there is a limit to
how far you can go.

For example, if someone slaps you,

00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,533
you can't hit them back
with a weapon.

654
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:26,833
That won't be recognized as lawful
exercise of right to self-defense.

655
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,486
There were similar cases
in the past,

656
00:34:31,566 --> 00:34:33,086
but none were accepted as
it was based on the

657
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:35,020
grounds of self-defense
by the High Court.

658
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,086
And the Prosecution will probably
refer to these cases.

659
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:41,120
Then why don't you make
a new case example?

660
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,766
By winning this case.

661
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:46,866
But it could be that she may have
murdered him intentionally.

662
00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:51,520
Anyway, please search up
more articles for me.

663
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Sure.

664
00:34:55,566 --> 00:34:56,733
Ms. Lim Yun-hee?

665
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,320
From here on, I will address you
as "suspect."

666
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,086
You have the right to
remain silent,

667
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:07,486
and right to refuse to
answer specific questions.

668
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:09,753
Choosing to remain silent will not
disadvantage you in Court,

669
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:13,220
and you may seek assistance
from your attorney.

670
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,053
Ms. Lim Yun-hee, you have been
notified about

671
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:16,400
the right to silence,
have you not?

672
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:21,086
Will you seek assistance
from your attorney?

673
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:24,033
Or shall we begin?

674
00:35:29,466 --> 00:35:31,220
Why did you want to see me again?

675
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,933
Ah, are you busy?

676
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:35,886
I was reviewing that
Lim Yun-hee case.

677
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:37,786
So, do you think you see a way?

678
00:35:37,866 --> 00:35:38,853
Well.

679
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:39,986
I'll have to go to
the detention center

680
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:41,953
and meet with her first.

681
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:42,953
As I thought!

682
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:45,120
Once you're on it,
you give it 100%.

683
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,786
So... You're here to check

684
00:35:47,866 --> 00:35:49,686
whether I'm on it, 100%?

685
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:51,253
Hey, come on!

686
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:52,720
Do you really think
I called you to check up on you?

687
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,920
Hmmm?

688
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,486
Pick out a tie for me.

689
00:35:55,566 --> 00:35:57,386
This is homme fatale look,

690
00:35:57,466 --> 00:35:59,653
and this is the
innocent, shy-guy look.

691
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:01,433
Which do you think is better?

692
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:07,786
What are you doing?

693
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,620
You see,
I've been contacted by the media.

694
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,900
They're coming for
an interview tomorrow!

695
00:36:12,233 --> 00:36:13,586
But not so long ago,

696
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,753
you said you were
traumatized by that incident

697
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,386
and that you'll have nothing to
do with the media again.

698
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,286
Confucius once said,

699
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:21,086
"The best of glory is

700
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:22,786
not about never failing,

701
00:36:22,866 --> 00:36:25,386
but getting up every time
after each failure."

702
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:28,153
Though my first appearance had me
nervous and ended as a failure,

703
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:29,986
I'm going to overcome it

704
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:31,220
and get up.

705
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,886
And should I fail again,

706
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:34,453
I'm going to get up again.

707
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:36,233
Then I guess it's time for me to
get up as well.

708
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:40,586
I'm really tired now,

709
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:42,353
and I desperately need coffee.

710
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:43,820
Can you get me one too,
with extra shot?

711
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,766
Wait, about Yun-seo!

712
00:36:46,866 --> 00:36:48,720
What about Yun-seo?

713
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,553
The director told me
they're a bit behind

714
00:36:51,633 --> 00:36:54,653
so they're not sure what
time they'll be here.

715
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:55,720
If they catch her
walking around here,

716
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,933
it might make her
feel uncomfortable.

717
00:36:59,466 --> 00:37:02,800
But it's not like we can make her
stay at a cafe all day.

718
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,220
Oh well. I'm sure it'll be okay.

719
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,386
I mean, there has to be somewhere
for her to hide in this office!

720
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:09,500
Right?

721
00:37:09,866 --> 00:37:11,433
Homme fatale.

722
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,320
Innocent.

723
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,320
What do you think? Is this better?

724
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,433
- Go with homme fatale.
- Homme fatale.

725
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:20,766
This is better.

726
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:28,933
Ah.

727
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:32,486
Would you like

728
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:34,120
a cup of coffee as well?

729
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,420
No, it's alright.

730
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,033
I can get my own.

731
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,200
Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

732
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,086
I'm going to the detention center
to meet Ms. Lim Yun-hee.

733
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:56,086
Would you like to come with me?

734
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,853
- What, me?
- Yes.

735
00:37:57,933 --> 00:38:00,686
Though you won't be able to see
her since you're not her lawyer,

736
00:38:00,766 --> 00:38:02,353
a trip to the detention center

737
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:05,153
could help you out in your career.

738
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:06,320
Of course!

739
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,553
It'll help way more than
not going at all.

740
00:38:09,633 --> 00:38:10,853
Thank you,

741
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:13,233
for thinking about me.

742
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:16,533
Have your coffee, then.

743
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,833
Detention center...
That means a long drive.

744
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,233
Then it's just us two, and...

745
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:46,053
Since we're going far,
let's be prepared.

746
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:47,553
After all, this is work.

747
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:48,933
Yep!

748
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,633
What should I wear tomorrow?

749
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,586
If I don’t like my outfit,
I'll feel depressed,

750
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:01,600
and won't be able to
concentrate on work, so...

751
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,853
If my skin feels dry,

752
00:39:04,933 --> 00:39:08,386
I won't be able to
concentrate on work, so...

753
00:39:08,466 --> 00:39:11,633
I really must be a workaholic!

754
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,466
Good morning, Mr. Kwon.

755
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:05,633
Your tie.

756
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:08,533
It suits you very well.

757
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,666
Your necklace suits you
very well, too.

758
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,300
Please get in. It's cold out.

759
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,453
It's so nice, going for
a drive in a long time.

760
00:40:28,533 --> 00:40:30,620
We're not going for a drive, but
we're off to the detention center.

761
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,700
To work.

762
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:35,900
Well, we're in a car,
so that's going for a drive.

763
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:45,266
Yes, this is Kwon Jung-rok.

764
00:40:47,866 --> 00:40:49,733
Yes, alright.

765
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:53,786
That was from
the detention center.

766
00:40:53,866 --> 00:40:56,486
My visit's been delayed
by two hours.

767
00:40:56,566 --> 00:40:57,700
Really?

768
00:40:58,633 --> 00:41:00,020
It's almost lunchtime,

769
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,533
so why don't we go
somewhere for lunch?

770
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:04,286
Um, actually...

771
00:41:04,366 --> 00:41:06,766
I packed lunch for us.

772
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,553
Lunch?

773
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:13,353
It's a waste of time,
trying to find a restaurant.

774
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:15,833
I wanted to avoid that,
so we can focus on work.

775
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,620
Besides, it's always been
my dream to

776
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,633
eat lunch out in a nice place.

777
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,400
Well, we've time to kill,
so let's do that.

778
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:41,833
Sure.

779
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:51,733
Shall we just eat in the car?

780
00:41:52,266 --> 00:41:54,266
No, let's just eat here.

781
00:41:54,866 --> 00:41:57,300
But why? It's cold out here.

782
00:41:58,033 --> 00:41:59,300
You said it's your dream.

783
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:04,986
I didn't expect you to
be a good cook.

784
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:08,153
Hey, what did you
think of me, then?

785
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:11,386
I once played a Korean
food chef in a drama.

786
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:13,886
For that role,
I learned from professional,

787
00:42:13,966 --> 00:42:16,853
and now I can cook up
anything in a second!

788
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:18,120
As an actress,

789
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,753
you get to experience
many lives, don't you?

790
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:22,400
It sounds interesting.

791
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,100
I was really happy, back then.

792
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,533
What makes you feel happy?

793
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:39,100
Pay day?

794
00:42:39,966 --> 00:42:41,120
Oh what?

795
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,220
You said you became a lawyer
because lawyers make money,

796
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,633
so it must be true
that you love money.

797
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:50,886
Actually, no.

798
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:52,020
Let's go in.

799
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,333
It's my loss if you catch a cold.

800
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,900
Sorry?

801
00:42:56,566 --> 00:42:58,486
Why would that be your loss?

802
00:42:58,566 --> 00:42:59,600
Huh?

803
00:43:01,733 --> 00:43:04,986
Well, you're the ace attorney
at our law firm,

804
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:07,086
so if you come down with
a cold because of me

805
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:08,353
and can't come to work,

806
00:43:08,433 --> 00:43:11,820
imagine what I'll have to
deal with for that whole day!

807
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,433
That'll be a huge loss of
manpower for the firm.

808
00:43:35,966 --> 00:43:38,566
If you're cold, put your
hands in the pocket.

809
00:43:42,566 --> 00:43:43,800
Really?

810
00:43:47,933 --> 00:43:49,400
Thank you.

811
00:43:59,433 --> 00:44:03,566
I meant, in your pocket.

812
00:44:09,366 --> 00:44:10,800
I'm sorry.

813
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,800
Pocket...

814
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:29,986
Prosecutor.

815
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:33,253
Isn't it uncomfortable,
crashing at your friend's place?

816
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:34,253
It is, extremely.

817
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,320
He's so fussy, too.

818
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,086
Then it must be uncomfortable
being home all day on the weekend.

819
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:42,753
How about you watch
a movie with me, then?

820
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:44,866
That sounds even
more uncomfortable.

821
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,966
That's Prosecutor Yu.

822
00:44:58,466 --> 00:45:00,586
Prosecutor Yu must be
stressed about that

823
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:02,686
Lim Yun-hee case.

824
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,020
Why?

825
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,086
It's not going well?

826
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:07,120
That Lim Yun-hee case...

827
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,920
Prosecutor Lim had been after it,

828
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,886
but Prosecutor Yu took it instead.

829
00:45:10,966 --> 00:45:12,820
Prosecutor Lim's known for
holding a grudge,

830
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,533
so I hear he's been bullying her.

831
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:22,453
Ah, so that's the new girl
who came.

832
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:23,900
Assigned under Kim Se-won.

833
00:45:24,466 --> 00:45:26,320
But why are they always together?

834
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,533
Are they going out?

835
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:33,666
I hear her father's
someone high-up.

836
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:38,333
A son of a hospital director, and
a daughter of a high official...

837
00:45:38,966 --> 00:45:41,253
Not a bad match, I must say.

838
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:42,333
Right?

839
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,000
I agree.

840
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,733
Isn't the new girl a great match
for Kim Se-won?

841
00:46:10,633 --> 00:46:11,920
They were both born with
silver spoons in their mouths.

842
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,920
But then again,

843
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,620
A son of a hospital director, and
a daughter of a con...

844
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,133
It just doesn't make sense.

845
00:46:20,033 --> 00:46:22,186
But you know, I must say
you are something.

846
00:46:22,266 --> 00:46:24,286
First your father commits fraud,

847
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:27,186
next your ex-boyfriend
chooses not to indict him

848
00:46:27,266 --> 00:46:29,233
and gets transferred to Chuncheon!

849
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:30,686
How could you still
hold your head up high,

850
00:46:30,766 --> 00:46:33,133
despite all that?

851
00:46:34,233 --> 00:46:36,820
If I were you, I would be
too ashamed to be here.

852
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,766
What is it that
you're trying to say?

853
00:46:41,433 --> 00:46:43,466
That you can't hide low birth.

854
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,353
Even if you get greedy,

855
00:46:45,433 --> 00:46:47,253
a prosecutor is as
far as you'll go.

856
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:48,486
But then again,

857
00:46:48,566 --> 00:46:50,620
I guess you know that, which is
why you're trying so hard.

858
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,300
Right? So you can try
climbing up the ladder.

859
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,486
- Please stop.
- Do you think

860
00:46:56,566 --> 00:46:59,253
the Lim Yun-hee case went to you,

861
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:00,953
because of your competence?

862
00:47:01,033 --> 00:47:02,686
It's because you're a woman,

863
00:47:02,766 --> 00:47:05,266
and they wanted to
make use of that.

864
00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:11,966
If you now know,
then know your place already.

865
00:47:29,133 --> 00:47:30,586
Would you like to wait in the car?

866
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:31,586
No.

867
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:33,666
I'll take a look around.

868
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:46,520
As I explained before,

869
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,053
you won't be allowed in with me.

870
00:47:48,133 --> 00:47:50,733
I know that much.

871
00:47:51,633 --> 00:47:53,453
So everyone here...

872
00:47:53,533 --> 00:47:56,286
Are they all waiting for
their trial, like Ms. Lim?

873
00:47:56,366 --> 00:47:57,820
That's not always the case.

874
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,453
they may be convicted already,

875
00:47:59,533 --> 00:48:02,500
or be a prisoner on trial.

876
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:07,720
Oh my, it's 2 o'clock already.

877
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,220
You should get going.

878
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,153
It's cold out, so I think
you should just wait...

879
00:48:12,233 --> 00:48:14,553
Why? Are you worried?

880
00:48:14,633 --> 00:48:16,800
Yes, I am.

881
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,420
Because it's also my loss

882
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,700
if you ever catch a cold.

883
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,820
But why...

884
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,420
If you catch a cold,
everything will slow down,

885
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,186
and that means I'll have
more to do myself.

886
00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:31,586
And on top of that, if I ever
catch it from you...

887
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:34,533
Ha, you're so unbelievable.

888
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,333
Happy now?

889
00:48:48,733 --> 00:48:50,053
It's very cold today.

890
00:48:50,133 --> 00:48:51,420
Don't be stubborn,

891
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,700
but wait in the car
after you take a look around.

892
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:02,486
Oh what?

893
00:49:02,566 --> 00:49:04,333
So is he worried about me?

894
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,366
Oh what? Oh what?

895
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,786
Ms. Lim.

896
00:49:15,866 --> 00:49:17,886
Could you tell me

897
00:49:17,966 --> 00:49:21,100
just what happened, on that day?

898
00:49:22,433 --> 00:49:24,986
I understand it's painful to
recall the incident,

899
00:49:25,066 --> 00:49:27,520
you need to tell me what happened,

900
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,966
without leaving out
even the tiniest detail.

901
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:35,686
Do you admit to the
charges brought against you,

902
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,400
that you killed your husband?

903
00:49:42,033 --> 00:49:44,586
Then do you have remorse for

904
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:46,233
your actions?

905
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,686
I fully understand that
you had long suffered

906
00:49:52,766 --> 00:49:54,853
from your husband's violence.

907
00:49:54,933 --> 00:49:56,653
However,

908
00:49:56,733 --> 00:49:59,420
the fact that you are
a domestic violence victim

909
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,153
does not justify your
actions of homicide.

910
00:50:01,233 --> 00:50:02,300
Then...

911
00:50:04,866 --> 00:50:07,066
What else should I have done?

912
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:12,433
Should I have died, instead?

913
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:20,733
(Case file)

914
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,633
No matter how I think about it,
it has to be self-defense.

915
00:50:37,066 --> 00:50:38,320
So, how was it?

916
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,320
It was self-defense, wasn't it?

917
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,766
I don't think we should come to
a hasty conclusion just yet.

918
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:51,600
I guess meeting with her has
left you with more doubts.

919
00:50:55,633 --> 00:50:57,953
Then while you're driving,

920
00:50:58,033 --> 00:50:59,920
I'll read this through once more.

921
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,186
There may just be a way,
if I go over it carefully.

922
00:51:03,266 --> 00:51:05,086
Just trust me.

923
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:06,166
Sure.

924
00:51:16,966 --> 00:51:18,966
You said you'll find a way.

925
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:52,833
Oh my!

926
00:51:54,466 --> 00:51:58,600
I must've dozed off
while contemplating.

927
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,153
You should've woke me up
if we're here already.

928
00:52:02,233 --> 00:52:04,353
You were sleeping
too soundly, so...

929
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:05,620
Did you wait long?

930
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,700
No.

931
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:14,220
I didn't make any mistakes
while sleeping, did I?

932
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:18,320
I'm not sure if you can
call it a mistake,

933
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,953
but you snored. A lot.

934
00:52:21,033 --> 00:52:21,953
Me?

935
00:52:22,033 --> 00:52:23,686
Oh Yun-seo?

936
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:26,200
No way. I don't snore!

937
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,586
Just kidding.

938
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:34,020
How could you tell a joke
with a straight face like that?

939
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,486
But is it so wrong to snore?

940
00:52:36,566 --> 00:52:37,686
Of course!

941
00:52:37,766 --> 00:52:40,866
I want you to see
only my best side...

942
00:52:44,966 --> 00:52:46,333
What, me?

943
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:50,500
Yes, because...

944
00:52:52,366 --> 00:52:56,053
You're stricter than
any other person!

945
00:52:56,133 --> 00:52:59,033
Otherwise, you might
pick faults with me, so...

946
00:53:04,933 --> 00:53:06,566
Thank you for today.

947
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:11,966
Have a good night.

948
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,320
Are you crazy?

949
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,520
Why did you say that just now?

950
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,766
Are you crazy?

951
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,386
Ah, hello.

952
00:53:37,466 --> 00:53:38,466
Yes.

953
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:41,166
There's something I need you to
look urgently into.

954
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:44,753
Ms. Lim Yun-hee's father
was also abusive,

955
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:46,253
so her mother walked out
when she was little

956
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:47,986
and it was just her and
her father from then on.

957
00:53:48,066 --> 00:53:49,586
But her father too,

958
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:51,700
has been missing
since ten years ago.

959
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,353
Ten years,
since he's been missing...

960
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:57,386
Then he must've been
determined dead, then.

961
00:53:57,466 --> 00:53:58,500
That's right.

962
00:53:59,433 --> 00:54:01,086
Her mother walked out on her,

963
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:03,920
her father deemed dead
after missing for so long,

964
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,120
her ex-husband perished in fire,

965
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,766
and now, her current husband...

966
00:54:11,266 --> 00:54:13,686
What a life.

967
00:54:13,766 --> 00:54:15,033
I must say so myself.

968
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,953
Ever since she graduated
from high school,

969
00:54:19,033 --> 00:54:21,653
she's been working odd jobs
including as a cashier

970
00:54:21,733 --> 00:54:24,066
and a salesperson
at department stores.

971
00:54:24,533 --> 00:54:27,753
Oh, she was also in insurance.

972
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:29,266
Did you say insurance?

973
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:36,953
Do you think there's a way
with this case?

974
00:54:37,033 --> 00:54:38,186
Well...

975
00:54:38,266 --> 00:54:40,153
The main arguments will be
that it was on impulse versus

976
00:54:40,233 --> 00:54:43,400
that she'd been after the
insurance payout.

977
00:54:43,933 --> 00:54:46,186
There's the fact that
she was in insurance,

978
00:54:46,266 --> 00:54:47,386
so they'll be
even more suspicious.

979
00:54:47,466 --> 00:54:50,020
About Ms. Lim Yun-hee.

980
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:54,320
Her file said her ex-husband had
also exerted physical violence.

981
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,320
So why do you think she
married another guy like him?

982
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,753
Shouldn't she have known better?

983
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:04,853
But then, I played a psychologist
in a drama once,

984
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:06,953
and one of my patients was
a woman who

985
00:55:07,033 --> 00:55:11,353
forgave her DV husband every time
he begged for forgiveness.

986
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:15,353
But apparently, that's
a mental issue.

987
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:18,466
I have requested that
she sees a psychologist, yes.

988
00:55:21,933 --> 00:55:23,666
(Yu Yeo-reum)

989
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:27,900
I don't know what to say.

990
00:55:28,766 --> 00:55:31,753
You knew how hung up
I am on this case,

991
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:33,786
so did you have to
choose to oppose me?

992
00:55:33,866 --> 00:55:35,286
It's against ethics to
reject a client

993
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:38,120
when she asks you to
defend her, isn't it?

994
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,586
If I have to take every factor
into consideration

995
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:43,253
before taking a case,
I'll have to reject them all.

996
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:44,586
I know.

997
00:55:44,666 --> 00:55:46,653
But there's something
you should know, too.

998
00:55:46,733 --> 00:55:49,320
The Court has never recognized
a case as being

999
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,033
a lawful exercise of
right to self-defense.

1000
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:53,866
That's not so important to me.

1001
00:55:54,833 --> 00:55:57,353
Anyway, I'm going to do my best to
reveal the truth,

1002
00:55:57,433 --> 00:55:59,053
and if she is found guilty,
I'll make sure

1003
00:55:59,133 --> 00:55:59,920
she isn't over-penalized.

1004
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,253
And if she isn't, I'll make sure
she receives a not guilty ruling.

1005
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:04,286
Because that's what my job is.

1006
00:56:04,366 --> 00:56:05,853
She will never be

1007
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:07,586
sentenced not guilty.

1008
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:09,533
Because that is my job.

1009
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,886
- ...The Prosecution...
- Today,

1010
00:56:12,966 --> 00:56:15,220
Ms. Lim Yun-hee will be in Court
for her first hearing.

1011
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,586
The Prosecution has charged
Ms. Lim Yun-hee,

1012
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:20,653
who had supposedly murdered
her husband on impulse

1013
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:21,953
as an act of self defense,
not for the crime of injury

1014
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:23,720
but for homicide.

1015
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,253
Ms. Lim Yun-hee is the
legal spouse of

1016
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:28,153
Mr. Kim Hyung-tae, the victim,

1017
00:56:28,233 --> 00:56:30,686
and while being physically
abused by him in their home

1018
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:33,320
on January 21st, 2019,

1019
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,153
she went to the kitchen
and took up a kitchen knife,

1020
00:56:36,233 --> 00:56:37,920
threatening to kill him
before stabbing him once

1021
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,500
in the chest and in the abdomen.

1022
00:56:41,633 --> 00:56:45,053
Our victim, Mr. Kim Hyung-tae
was a long-time DV offender

1023
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:47,186
so the defendant's actions
may be viewed as

1024
00:56:47,266 --> 00:56:50,020
an act of self-defense.

1025
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,853
However, if you see the
autopsy report that was submitted,

1026
00:56:52,933 --> 00:56:54,720
it becomes clear that

1027
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,420
this is homicide with
clear intentions.

1028
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,786
What is the chance that

1029
00:56:58,866 --> 00:57:03,020
this knife ended stabbing him

1030
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,366
where it would prove fatal?

1031
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,553
For this reason, the
prosecution has charged

1032
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,466
Ms. Lim on the crime of homicide.

1033
00:57:14,066 --> 00:57:18,133
You may begin your defense.

1034
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,886
According to the testimony by
the paramedic who was

1035
00:57:21,966 --> 00:57:23,820
present at the scene,

1036
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,286
my client had suffered
severe injuries,

1037
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:30,220
including two broken ribs.

1038
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,320
Even if she did
stab him intentionally,

1039
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,920
what is the chance of
a fragile woman,

1040
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,953
with severe injuries requiring
9 weeks in hospital,

1041
00:57:36,033 --> 00:57:37,153
stab him once right at the spot

1042
00:57:37,233 --> 00:57:41,466
where it would prove
fatal for him?

1043
00:57:43,933 --> 00:57:44,953
For this reason,

1044
00:57:45,033 --> 00:57:48,033
we plead not guilty, on the
grounds of self-defense.

1045
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:53,720
At the time, Ms. Lim had
no other intention

1046
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,353
or no other plan whatsoever,

1047
00:57:56,433 --> 00:57:59,900
except for her desperate
will to survive.

1048
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:06,653
Ms. Lim. You said your mother
walked out on you

1049
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,133
when you were ten.
What was the reason?

1050
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,186
She hit her head hard on the floor

1051
00:58:12,266 --> 00:58:14,553
while being beaten by
my drunk father.

1052
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:17,386
There was a lot of blood,

1053
00:58:17,466 --> 00:58:21,053
and while father was searching for
something to hit her again with,

1054
00:58:21,133 --> 00:58:22,600
she fled.

1055
00:58:24,233 --> 00:58:26,166
Probably to live.

1056
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,353
And ever since then,

1057
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:39,820
your father started
abusing you as well.

1058
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,020
Is this true?

1059
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,400
Yes, it's true.

1060
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,120
Your ex-husband, and
Mr. Kim Hyung-tae too,

1061
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,453
were also abusive.

1062
00:58:51,533 --> 00:58:53,953
The memories of your father
must have been painful enough,

1063
00:58:54,033 --> 00:58:56,053
so why did you marry men

1064
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:58,766
who had the same
violent character?

1065
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,320
Your Honor.

1066
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,553
I'd like to call
her psychologist to stand,

1067
00:59:06,633 --> 00:59:09,400
who may better help us
grasp her situation.

1068
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:12,886
Though you may be
so convinced at first,

1069
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,420
but when you're exposed to
an abnormal situation for long,

1070
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,686
you come to accept that
this is the norm.

1071
00:59:17,766 --> 00:59:20,120
Could you expand on that?

1072
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,520
Those who have been
abused since young

1073
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,120
fail to realize that abuse is
something that's wrong.

1074
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,620
And at one point, they come to
accept that this is the norm,

1075
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,920
and even find themselves
psychologically unstable

1076
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,920
if this abnormal environment
doesn't hold up.

1077
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,333
In the end, you're left with
a vicious cycle.

1078
00:59:35,866 --> 00:59:39,566
If you look at
our psychologist's report,

1079
00:59:40,633 --> 00:59:42,653
it reads, "Based on the fact
that the patient has been

1080
00:59:42,733 --> 00:59:45,753
exposed to an abusive environment
since childhood,

1081
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:49,333
it can be said her sense of
judgment is distorted."

1082
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,053
Is this true?

1083
00:59:53,133 --> 00:59:54,820
Yes, that was my conclusion.

1084
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,320
In other words,
according to your analysis,

1085
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,253
we can conclude Ms. Lim was not
mentally sound

1086
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:02,820
at the time of the incident.

1087
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,933
Do you agree?

1088
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:06,933
Yes.

1089
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,633
I rest my case.

1090
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,720
Counsel,

1091
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,320
will you cross-examine?

1092
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,400
Yes.

1093
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,053
Ms. Lim Yun-hee.

1094
01:00:19,133 --> 01:00:21,886
These are the applications for
the insurance payouts

1095
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:25,933
for your ex-husband, and
also for your father's death.

1096
01:00:30,033 --> 01:00:33,153
Did you submit these
papers in person?

1097
01:00:33,233 --> 01:00:34,720
Yes, I did.

1098
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,553
You were also aware that
Mr. Kim Hyung-tae had

1099
01:00:38,633 --> 01:00:40,753
- life insurance?
- Yes.

1100
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:43,153
Do you know how much
the amount is, in total?

1101
01:00:43,233 --> 01:00:44,453
No, I do not.

1102
01:00:44,533 --> 01:00:48,786
The total payout of the insurance
plan for Mr. Kim is...

1103
01:00:48,866 --> 01:00:51,100
...4.94 million dollars.

1104
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,200
Isn't the amount too large to
simply say you did not know?

1105
01:01:05,933 --> 01:01:07,133
I rest my case.

1106
01:01:14,266 --> 01:01:16,020
Going with abnormality of
mental functioning, are you?

1107
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,820
But then again, even if
self-defense is not accepted,

1108
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,486
it's not bad business for you
if you can reduce her sentence

1109
01:01:22,566 --> 01:01:24,653
by claiming she isn't
mentally sound.

1110
01:01:24,733 --> 01:01:26,000
Don't put it like that.

1111
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,753
Whether it's self defense or
poor mental functioning,

1112
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:33,320
they're both valid reasons
under the Penal Code.

1113
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,520
I won't ever let the
Court accept your argument,

1114
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,286
so don't even try.

1115
01:01:38,366 --> 01:01:39,453
Because this is

1116
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:41,700
something you can't win.

1117
01:01:58,466 --> 01:02:00,700
Why are you so hung upon
that Lim Yun-hee case?

1118
01:02:02,066 --> 01:02:04,133
Because this is the only way.

1119
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,586
Though you'll never understand,

1120
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:11,566
since your starting line was
so far ahead.

1121
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:22,853
You're back.

1122
01:02:22,933 --> 01:02:24,786
- Welcome back.
- We're back.

1123
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,020
Um...

1124
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,433
What about Mr. Kwon?

1125
01:02:29,466 --> 01:02:32,020
He told me to go ahead first,

1126
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,886
because he needs to speak
with the prosecutor.

1127
01:02:33,966 --> 01:02:35,520
How did the trial go today?

1128
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,153
It's all over the news!

1129
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:39,286
From your expression...

1130
01:02:39,366 --> 01:02:41,300
Does that mean it didn't go
so favorably for us?

1131
01:02:42,233 --> 01:02:44,320
No. It was all fine

1132
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,086
when Mr. Kwon argued that

1133
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:49,053
she was not mentally healthy,

1134
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:53,520
but when the topic of
insurance came up,

1135
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,220
everyone was bought.

1136
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,086
How much is the payout anyway?

1137
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:01,000
4.9 million dollars.

1138
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:03,620
4.9 million...

1139
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,386
No wonder the
audience was convinced.

1140
01:03:05,466 --> 01:03:06,386
Right.

1141
01:03:06,466 --> 01:03:08,153
Even I'm starting to suspect that

1142
01:03:08,233 --> 01:03:10,720
she did it for the money.

1143
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,753
Poor Mr. Kwon!

1144
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:15,786
The media is following
this case closely,

1145
01:03:15,866 --> 01:03:18,820
so if he loses,
that'll mean a lot of damage.

1146
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,553
The ruling's not out yet,

1147
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:22,786
so don't say that.

1148
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:24,266
Mr. Kwon...

1149
01:03:26,233 --> 01:03:27,466
I'm back.

1150
01:03:42,466 --> 01:03:43,466
Um,

1151
01:03:44,366 --> 01:03:45,633
Mr. Kwon?

1152
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,986
Don't mind too much

1153
01:03:51,066 --> 01:03:52,720
what other people said.

1154
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,553
I won't.

1155
01:03:54,633 --> 01:03:56,153
Because based on today's results,

1156
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:58,233
anyone would think the same.

1157
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:00,133
Sure.

1158
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:03,053
But you know,

1159
01:04:03,133 --> 01:04:06,020
I think you'll win.

1160
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,720
I'll be honest.

1161
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,620
I thought lawyers were people

1162
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:14,253
who were all about
logic and principles,

1163
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:17,700
but now I see some lawyers with warm hearts.

1164
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,600
Just like you, Mr. Kwon.

1165
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,486
Because you're warm-hearted and

1166
01:04:25,566 --> 01:04:27,600
considerate, even though
you look like you don't.

1167
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,320
There was a time in the past

1168
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,986
when I felt like I was the
only one left in this world

1169
01:04:36,066 --> 01:04:39,566
and that no one was
there by my side.

1170
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:43,586
It had been so hard for me.

1171
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:49,553
Now I'm thinking about
how nice it would've been,

1172
01:04:49,633 --> 01:04:51,786
if I had someone like you

1173
01:04:51,866 --> 01:04:54,053
by my side, back then.

1174
01:04:54,133 --> 01:04:57,220
Because you're that amazing,

1175
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:00,933
I'm sure you'll solve
this case beautifully.

1176
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,366
It's already...

1177
01:05:33,766 --> 01:05:35,633
Why haven't you gone home already?

1178
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:40,600
I was searching up some
relevant case examples.

1179
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,853
In case they might help.

1180
01:05:44,933 --> 01:05:46,833
Would you like to
join me for dinner?

1181
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:52,786
Sure. You know, I'm really hungry.

1182
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:53,966
Then let's go.

1183
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,620
To be honest,

1184
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,533
I became a lawyer because...

1185
01:06:08,266 --> 01:06:10,086
Rather than to punish people,

1186
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,866
I wanted to be on their side.

1187
01:06:14,533 --> 01:06:15,533
Oh.

1188
01:06:16,966 --> 01:06:18,786
Then why did you say it was

1189
01:06:18,866 --> 01:06:21,566
because lawyers make
lots of money?

1190
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,733
Because... It's kind of
embarrassing to say it honestly.

1191
01:06:28,566 --> 01:06:29,566
Hmmm?

1192
01:06:29,833 --> 01:06:33,633
Then why are you being honest now?

1193
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,886
Because...

1194
01:06:42,966 --> 01:06:46,333
I just wanted to, after
what you told me.

1195
01:06:47,466 --> 01:06:51,766
Thank you for telling me that
you believe in me.

1196
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:59,853
And... If you
find yourself in that situation,

1197
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:03,300
where you feel like you have
no one else in this world...

1198
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,400
then I'll be on your side.

1199
01:07:22,633 --> 01:07:23,866
Mr. Kwon...

1200
01:07:36,566 --> 01:07:39,900
There's something
I need to tell you.

1201
01:07:42,366 --> 01:07:43,433
But...

1202
01:07:46,266 --> 01:07:48,053
But not just now.

1203
01:07:48,133 --> 01:07:52,766
However, this feeling...
What I'm feeling now,

1204
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:59,633
I'm going to tell you someday.

1205
01:08:07,966 --> 01:08:09,033
Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

1206
01:08:17,233 --> 01:08:18,266
Do you...

1207
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,233
...like...

1208
01:08:25,866 --> 01:08:26,866
What?

1209
01:08:27,633 --> 01:08:29,466
(Thank you to Hwang Chan-seong for
his special appearance)

1210
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,800
(It's alright, anytime)

1211
01:09:04,433 --> 01:09:06,066
(Touch Your Heart)

1212
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:07,286
Working girl,

1213
01:09:07,366 --> 01:09:08,820
workaholic!

1214
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,753
You're so sexy.

1215
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:12,486
Aren't you slaving
my Yun-seo around?

1216
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:14,033
"My" Yun-seo?

1217
01:09:14,433 --> 01:09:16,133
- Hey, I...
- "Oppa?"

1218
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,520
Would you like some coffee?

1219
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,453
Didn't he tell me not to
slave you around?

1220
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:21,620
Your boyfriend, I mean.

1221
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,166
You've never had
a girlfriend, have you?

1222
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,686
Because I don't think you have
talent in that field.

1223
01:09:26,766 --> 01:09:27,953
Someone once told me,

1224
01:09:28,033 --> 01:09:29,353
that she thinks I'll win this case.

1225
01:09:29,433 --> 01:09:31,486
So please believe in me.

1226
01:09:31,566 --> 01:09:33,386
This has taken a new turn.

1227
01:09:33,466 --> 01:09:35,820
This person could be
our only witness,

1228
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:38,333
or even a whole new suspect.
