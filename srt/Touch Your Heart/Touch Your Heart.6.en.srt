(Episode 6)

3
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:51,733
There's something
I need to tell you.

4
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:55,300
But...

5
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,733
But not just now.

6
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:04,700
However, this feeling...
What I'm feeling now,

7
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,300
I'm going to tell you someday.

8
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:22,600
Tell me what later?

9
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:25,333
(The REAL Pork BBQ)

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,820
I wonder if she likes
pork barbecue.

11
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,066
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

12
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:35,766
Do you like...?

13
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:39,200
Well, uh...

14
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,853
I, um...

15
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,900
I think so, yes.

16
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:45,633
But you asking me
so directly is...

17
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,266
It's making me panic.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,433
Anyway, how did you know?

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,666
About me liking...

20
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:55,853
Because most people do.

21
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:57,300
Because most people do?

22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,286
I didn't know you were so popular.

23
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:03,420
Well,

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,053
it's relatively cheap, isn't it?

25
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:06,133
What?

26
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,966
Cheap?

27
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,333
Isn't it cheaper than beef?

28
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:15,966
(The REAL Pork BBQ)

29
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:22,453
Wait a minute.
Were you just asking me

30
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,820
if I like pork barbecue?

31
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,853
Yes.

32
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,020
We're out for dinner,

33
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,900
so I thought we should
decide on what to eat.

34
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:31,533
Why? What did you think
I was asking you instead?

35
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,133
Well, uh...

36
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:37,820
Pork stew!

37
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,533
Pork stew...

38
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,653
I thought you asked me
if I like pork stew.

39
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:44,686
As far as I know,
there's no place that does them

40
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:46,866
within a radius of 1 km from here.

41
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:48,720
Then let's get pork barbecue.

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,233
I'm fine with that.

43
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,420
- Yay, pork barbecue!
- Alright.

44
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,086
Then let's go there, then.

45
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,186
It doesn't look crowded,

46
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,333
so you shouldn't feel too
uncomfortable there.

47
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:58,586
Let's go, then.

48
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,800
Yay, pork barbecue...

49
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:19,320
I guess you really like
pork barbecue.

50
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,153
Yes, I do, a lot!

51
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,720
You're so fast to catch on,
aren't you?

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,453
Yes. Maybe it's because
as a lawyer,

53
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:29,686
I get to meet all kinds of people.

54
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:31,833
I'm becoming better at
reading people.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,720
Mr. Kwon,

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,366
you've never been in
a relationship, have you?

57
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:45,086
What... Why are you
asking me this?

58
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:49,033
Just. I don't think you have
any talent in that field.

59
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,953
Then do you, Ms. Oh Jin-sim,
in that field?

60
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,133
Of course.

61
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:58,486
If you can't believe me,
then look it up.

62
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:02,353
I even hosted a matchmaking
TV show once.

63
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:05,100
I gave out great advice.

64
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,753
In fact, my nickname
at that time was...

65
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,100
"Never had a boyfriend."

66
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,033
What?

67
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,800
That's what it says here.

68
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,866
Did you really have to
look that up?

69
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,453
"Oh Yoon-seo, the love counselor of
the TV show, Love Cafe,

70
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,053
has in fact, never had a boyfriend."

71
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:22,920
"Top celebrity Oh Yoon-seo,

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,586
who is highly popular for
her honest advice on love on

73
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,986
the new matchmaking TV show,

74
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,186
has in fact, never been in
a relationship,

75
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,553
to many people's disbelief."

76
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,186
- Please stop.
- "The program director says

77
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:33,353
he appreciates Ms. Oh's efforts,

78
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:35,453
because despite having
zero experience

79
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:37,320
and no knowledge in this area,

80
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,253
she studies up all night
reading books on love to

81
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,366
relay tips on love to...

82
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,566
I said, stop it already!

83
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,333
...the participants."

84
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:51,553
Have some more, Ms. Oh
who never had a boyfriend.

85
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,200
Oops, excuse me.

86
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:07,966
We're going to get busier
from tomorrow.

87
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,733
Because we need to prepare to
strike back?

88
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:17,586
Don't worry so much.

89
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,220
I said it already,

90
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,800
but I think you'll totally
win this, Mr. Kwon.

91
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,220
You're the most competent lawyer

92
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,066
out of the lawyers I know.

93
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,466
Do you know many lawyers?

94
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:36,500
Well, there's Mr. Choi
and Ms. Dan...

95
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:38,533
Anyway.

96
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:42,586
From tomorrow,

97
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,753
I'm going to come into work

98
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,686
with real determination
and my fists clenched tight.

99
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:49,020
So let's really do this!

100
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,133
Alright?

101
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,966
Sure.

102
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,933
So, did you manage to
find a way out of this?

103
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:00,120
During that public trial last week,

104
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,553
they mentioned Ms. Lim is
entitled to a $4.9 million payout

105
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,733
which turned the tables
in their favor.

106
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:06,866
I'm still thinking of a way.

107
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,386
If Ms. Lim's claims of self-defense
are not accepted,

108
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:10,753
our law firm will...

109
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,400
We'll face much public backlash.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,753
You know all the civic groups and

111
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,700
the public are on
Lim Yun-hee's side, right?

112
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,253
But I'm not trying to
pressure you, alright?

113
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,533
So don't feel so burdened.

114
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:27,666
Anyway, man...

115
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:30,086
If we lose this case that has

116
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,520
the entire country's interest,

117
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,553
our firm will never take on
another big case.

118
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:36,066
What are we to do?

119
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,986
But I'm not trying to
pressure you.

120
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,700
So don't feel so burdened.

121
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:44,533
If you're done,
then please excuse me.

122
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:47,853
What do I do?

123
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:50,053
We've only four lawyers
including me,

124
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,220
yet I took out that massive loan
and founded this law firm

125
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,386
out of my grand vision that

126
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:56,566
we'll surpass Jang & Park someday.

127
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,586
But if we lose this case,

128
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,886
instead of a grand vision,

129
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:02,566
I'll be left with a grand debt!

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,220
So you know...

131
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,620
I'm pressuring you.
Actually, uh...

132
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,920
No, I'm not.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,420
Don't, uh... Oh, what do I do?

134
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,986
Don't worry too much.

135
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:11,886
- Huh?
- Someone told me,

136
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:13,633
that she thinks it will be
my sure win.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,033
Who?

138
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,886
Anyway, I agree with her,

139
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:21,366
so please believe in me and wait.

140
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:27,566
What? Who told him
something like that?

141
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,233
Oh, it was a shaman.

142
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,766
Yep, it had to be a shaman!

143
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:36,886
Was it a child messenger?

144
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:38,533
Or a maiden divinity?

145
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:42,453
Whoever it was, I hope
she's a powerful shaman.

146
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:43,933
So that he really wins.

147
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:57,153
No matter how hard I search,
there are no case examples.

148
00:07:57,233 --> 00:08:00,300
Probably because self-defense has
never been accepted by the Court.

149
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,800
Why don't you go home first,
Ms. Oh Jin-sim?

150
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:10,986
It's alright.

151
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,153
Besides, how could I
when you're still here?

152
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:15,633
I'm not that heartless.

153
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,586
That should be my line.

154
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,086
You've been working late these
past few days because of me.

155
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,386
So go ahead first.

156
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,533
Then when will you go home?

157
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:29,300
I still have work to do, so...

158
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:32,033
(Hyuk-jun)

159
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,320
Ah, Hyuk-jun.

160
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,066
No need to come pick me up, I
said I'll be fine on my own today.

161
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,266
Worried? Please.

162
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:43,353
Alright, I'll come down.

163
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:45,266
Alright then.

164
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:50,753
Then... I'll go ahead first.

165
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,833
Sure.

166
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:11,466
Huh? Mr. Kwon.

167
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:14,600
Let's just leave together.

168
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:22,400
I thought you still had
something to do.

169
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,966
I decided to leave it
for tomorrow.

170
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,120
Now that the maximum working hours
of 52 a week is in place,

171
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,866
I should set an example
as someone who's in law.

172
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,986
Then what about all the
late-nighters we pulled to date?

173
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,100
Well, that's...

174
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:39,920
Huh? What's going on?

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,920
Did the elevator just stop?

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,233
What do we do?

177
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,300
(Emergency call)

178
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,520
Yes, this is the control room.

179
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,653
The elevator just stopped.

180
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:50,386
- What floor are you on?
- On the third floor.

181
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:51,486
Alright.

182
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:52,586
Please hurry.

183
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,066
Please hurry, sir!

184
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,400
Jeez, what's taking her so long?

185
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,420
Hey, Yoon-seo. When are you coming?

186
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,786
Ah, Hyuk-jun.

187
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:07,286
The elevator just stopped,

188
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:10,020
so I'm stuck here with Mr. Kwon.

189
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,986
Are you alright? You're not hurt?

190
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:14,086
No, I'm not hurt.

191
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,153
Someone will be here soon,
so don't worry.

192
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,966
If anything comes up,
I'll let you know.

193
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:21,066
Alright, then.

194
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,966
We should be okay, right?

195
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,586
Well.

196
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,753
There were 254 casualties
in the past ten years

197
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,153
due to accidents
involving elevators.

198
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:40,853
Why did you have to
mention that now?

199
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,200
Right at this time?

200
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:46,600
You asked, so I simply
told you the facts.

201
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,820
Where are you, Mr. Kwon?

202
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,200
Where are you?

203
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:57,986
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

204
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,200
Are you alright?

205
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,166
Huh?

206
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,333
Are you alright?

207
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:33,133
Yes, we're fine.

208
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,053
Yoon-seo! Are you alright?

209
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,253
- Ah, Hyuk-jun.
- You're really not hurt?

210
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,320
That was a scare, right?

211
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,986
I'm fine.

212
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:44,020
Whatever!

213
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,153
That's why you should get off
work on time.

214
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:47,333
- Why work late and...
- Be quiet!

215
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:50,600
Yoon-seo, wait right here.

216
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,766
Excuse me, Mr. Kwon.

217
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:56,753
- Yes?
- I really didn't want to

218
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,453
have to bring this up,

219
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,820
but aren't you slaving away
my Yoon-seo?

220
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,920
"My" Yoon-seo?

221
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,920
That's right, MY Yoon-seo.

222
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,833
From now on, she's banned from
working overtime.

223
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,253
Oppa, what are you doing?
Are you crazy?

224
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,653
But I'm right, aren't I?

225
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:09,820
Why should you work late?

226
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,466
You're not even
a regular employee here.

227
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,620
Did you really have to...

228
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,766
Let's just go. Come on!

229
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:17,853
I'm sorry, Mr. Kwon.

230
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:19,320
Never mind him.

231
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,320
- Sure.
- Let's go, hurry up!

232
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Come on!

233
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:23,653
What? I never said anything wrong.

234
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,600
Just be quiet, and let's go!

235
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:28,453
You should've just stayed
in the car, why'd you come here?

236
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:29,566
Hey, Yoon-seo!

237
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,920
What was that?

238
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,386
Imagine what he thinks now,
because of you!

239
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:36,220
That should be my line.

240
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,753
I was only looking out for you.

241
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:38,753
You said you were
stuck in the elevator,

242
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,966
so do you know how worried I was?

243
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:42,820
What's to worry about?

244
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,053
It's not like
I was in there alone,

245
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:45,353
Mr. Kwon was with me.

246
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:46,586
That's what worried me even more!

247
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,233
In case he fondles you
and acts like pervert.

248
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,420
Pervert?

249
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,486
Are you crazy?

250
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:53,120
Mr. Kwon's not like that!

251
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,020
What, you don't think he's a man?

252
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,153
Any guy in this world would

253
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,920
want to try something with you.

254
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,353
- That's true, yes.
- Right?

255
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:00,766
Yes. Huh?

256
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,653
Anyway, no.

257
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:03,886
There was nothing like that.

258
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:04,966
Really?

259
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:06,186
By the way, Yoon-seo.

260
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:08,366
Are you planning on becoming
a real secretary or something?

261
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:09,653
How many days has it been,
you working so late?

262
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:11,120
But you told me to work hard.

263
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,420
Well, there's a limit to
everything.

264
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,486
All you need to do is
just observe and

265
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:15,733
see how things run there.

266
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:18,320
How can you expect
fine acting from me,

267
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,666
if I'm there to just pretend
I'm a secretary?

268
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,933
Stop talking, you know nothing!

269
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,253
Yoon-seo, you really...

270
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,253
Well, uh...

271
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,520
You're really serious
about this, aren't you?

272
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,666
About your acting!

273
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,120
I'm so touched.

274
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,120
I'll also work harder in
supporting you,

275
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,753
so that you'll become
a fine actress!

276
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,753
So let's bid goodbye to
bad acting, alright?

277
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:40,833
Let's do this!

278
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Let's do this!

279
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,966
Alright, get in. It's cold.

280
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:57,200
"Oppa..."

281
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:05,000
Tsk, why did he have to say that?

282
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,766
I'm sure Mr. Kwon was still
overcoming his shock, too.

283
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:22,686
But wait a second.

284
00:14:22,766 --> 00:14:24,933
The elevator stopping...

285
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,766
That was so romantic.

286
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,800
I thought my heart was
going to stop for a second!

287
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,500
I can't believe the
elevator stopped like that!

(Lim Yun-hee's Profile)

294
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:06,433
Working girl, Oh Yoon-seo.

295
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,420
You're like a workaholic now,

296
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,133
and it's so sexy!

297
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,366
Ah, you're here.

298
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,853
- Yes.
- Would you like some coffee?

299
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:20,553
Extra sweet, with sugar?

300
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:21,733
It's alright.

301
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,266
Didn't he tell me not to
enslave you?

302
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,000
Your boyfriend, I mean.

303
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:30,933
Boyfriend? Don't say that.

304
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,186
Then he's not?

305
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:36,786
Of course not!

306
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:38,066
He's just my...

307
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:40,553
My cousin.

308
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:42,686
You know, the one who always
comes to pick me up.

309
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:46,020
Oh, that's him?

310
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,486
Yes.

311
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:50,166
So please, no misunderstandings
like that!

312
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,786
Alright.

313
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:56,820
So you're not really
having any coffee?

314
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,286
Then... May I ask you for just one?

315
00:16:00,366 --> 00:16:01,366
Sure.

316
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,433
Ah, that smells so nice.
The smell of those coffee beans!

317
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,400
You know something, Ms. Yang?

318
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,386
You won't find expensive beans like
these at other law firms.

319
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:15,386
It's pretty much your standard
tea and instant coffee mix

320
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:17,353
in their tea room.
But I'm different!

321
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:19,186
I'm always looking out for
our family at...

322
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:21,186
I brought these beans.

323
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:22,953
I received them as a gift
during the festive holidays.

324
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,286
Otherwise it's just your standard
tea and instant coffee mix

325
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:27,266
in our tea room as well.

326
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:30,300
Oh, I see.

327
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,086
You're much better than me!

328
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,086
You really are.

329
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,553
So let's drink this coffee

330
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,666
and draft our grand vision again.

331
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,253
- Good morning!
- Ah, good morning.

332
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,686
Ah, you're here.

333
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:45,920
By the way, you were working
until late with Mr. Kwon, right?

334
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,553
Did anything happen?

335
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:48,720
Why do you ask?

336
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,020
I heard the elevator stopped
working last night.

337
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,286
Well, uh...

338
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:54,886
A security officer here told me,

339
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:57,653
some people were stuck
in the elevator

340
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,086
so he rushed over to help, and...

341
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,266
He found a couple in there,

342
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,966
about to kiss each other.

343
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,853
What? But, but...

344
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:12,220
Maybe they weren't
trying to kiss, after all.

345
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,420
Who's this couple anyway?

346
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,420
They're really so daring.

347
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,986
I was curious myself,
so I asked what they looked like.

348
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:19,386
And he remembered them
pretty well.

349
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:21,933
He said the man was really tall,

350
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:24,220
with these round eyes.

351
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,820
And as for the woman...

352
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,886
He said she was a beauty,
like some actress.

353
00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:30,253
A tall man with round eyes,

354
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,820
and a beauty who
looks like an actress...

355
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,333
And they're one of those people
who were working late, huh?

356
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,600
Yoon-seo.

357
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:43,200
No, it wasn't me and Mr. Kwon!

358
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,166
It really wasn't.

359
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
What?

360
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,620
Huh? I mean,

361
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,333
we weren't the couple who were
kissing in the elevator.

362
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,066
Haha, you're so funny.

363
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:56,786
Of course not!

364
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:58,020
We both know too well

365
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,886
of the hard feelings
between you two.

366
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:02,586
I called you to
remind you about your coffee.

367
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,720
Yes, coffee.

368
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,033
Oh, my coffee.

369
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:12,853
Anyway, it was probably an office
couple who's secretly dating.

370
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:15,400
They don't always
have to be dating.

371
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:18,153
When you put a young man
and a woman in a closed space,

372
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:19,120
romance may just start

373
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,033
even if they weren't so
aware of each other before.

374
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,086
Um... Hello?

375
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,553
We're stuck in the elevator.

376
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:29,153
Please help!

377
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,053
What the hell... What the hell!

378
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,553
What kind of a situation is this?

379
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:35,866
I can't believe I'm wasting
my precious time like this.

380
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,053
Do you think...

381
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:40,166
...we're running out of
oxygen, maybe?

382
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:42,133
Because it's getting harder
and harder to breathe...

383
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,000
What, in just 2 minutes?

384
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:48,400
Oh, you're right.

385
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,886
I guess it was just me.

386
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:52,866
Anyway, why did it have to be
you, of all people?

387
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,920
What are you talking about?

388
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,186
I'm the one
who's extremely sorry that

389
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:59,220
I had to here with you,
who's so easy to fall in love,

390
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,586
and not the cosmic goddess,
Yoon-seo.

391
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,020
I'm warning you just in case,

392
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,920
but don't you fall in love
with me now

393
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,866
just because it's just us two
in this enclosed space.

394
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:10,033
Do I have to force myself to
look ugly or something?

395
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:16,120
Ha! That would never happen, even
if you were just standing there.

396
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,453
Well, same here!

397
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:18,686
I would never!

398
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:19,686
I would never, ever!

399
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:21,866
I would never, ever, ever!

400
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,166
Ah... Mommy!

401
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:25,833
Get off me!

402
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,366
Are you... alright?

403
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,520
All checked?

404
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Yes.

405
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:46,020
And as for Jung's franchise business...

406
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,720
- Include three restaurants...
- Yes.

407
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,353
And two affiliated restaurants for
the seizure and search warrant.

408
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:51,353
Yes, sir.

409
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:52,533
Let's have a 10-minute break.

410
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,020
I'll go buy some coffee.
What would you like?

411
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,320
I'll come with you.

412
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,520
It's alright,
I'll just go on my own.

413
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,000
I've some things to
think about too.

414
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,666
Alright, then.
I'll have an Americano.

415
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,353
By the way, did you hear about
the public trial last week?

416
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:13,566
About how Prosecutor Yu gave
Mr. Kwon a run for his money?

417
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,786
I heard they're friends,
so don't you think it's ruthless?

418
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:19,066
I guess she's merciless
and heartless as people say.

419
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,186
And this is just a rumor
that's going around,

420
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,320
but apparently,
there's been some back dealing

421
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,320
and if Prosecutor Yu
succeeds this case,

422
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,533
she'll be promoted to
anywhere she wants.

423
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:33,453
I knew she was ambitious,

424
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,686
but isn't she something?

425
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,420
Stop there.

426
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,066
I don't want to hear anymore.

427
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:41,286
But why not? It's already
over between you, isn't it?

428
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,233
Who are you to decide
whether it's over or not?

429
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,353
One Latte, and
one Americano please.

430
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:56,433
Sure.

431
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,633
And this too, please.

432
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,500
- What is this?
- Thought you might need sugar.

433
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:23,066
I'm busy.

434
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,600
No need to say it like that,
I can see you are busy.

435
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:31,500
Autopsy report?

436
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,786
Goodness me.

437
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:35,933
You really want to see something
terrible like that here?

438
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:40,366
Did you want to
talk to me about something?

439
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,486
Even if you're busy,
take care of yourself.

440
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:46,620
That's your business?

441
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,753
Yes.

442
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:48,933
Because if you fall sick,

443
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:52,266
I'll feel troubled.

444
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:55,053
I'm off.

445
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:56,386
You should get going, too.

446
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:58,666
Don't you have someone
waiting for that coffee?

447
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:06,820
(Evidence 29)

448
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,866
(Evidence 30)

449
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,853
Prosecutor Yu.

450
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,353
This is the file you asked for.

451
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:16,533
Thank you.

452
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:22,286
Both the autopsy report and expert
opinions are in our favor, right?

453
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:25,253
From how the defending counsel's
been unusually quiet,

454
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,033
I guess they don't see
a way out of this.

455
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,020
It's unlikely that the Court will
uphold their claims that

456
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,366
it was self-defense, right?

457
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,100
Still, it's too early to
jump to conclusions.

458
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:38,786
(Kwon Jung-rok, Attorney)

459
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:40,900
(Evidence 29
Evidence 30)

460
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,320
I'll be out for a while.

461
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,420
If you receive any important
calls, please take notes.

462
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,486
Sure.

463
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:54,953
By the way, where are you going?

464
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:56,700
Off to meet a client?

465
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,353
I'm thinking of visiting
Ms. Lim Yun-hee's house.

466
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,520
Ms. Lim Yun-hee's house...

467
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,120
You mean the crime scene?

468
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,953
Yes, there's something that
I don't quite understand,

469
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,620
so I thought
I should go to the scene

470
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,833
and decide whether the
report's claims are valid or not.

471
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,686
So lawyers also work
on their feet, huh?

472
00:23:15,766 --> 00:23:18,020
It's also the attorney's job to

473
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,453
submit evidence that could
invalidate evidence

474
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,000
produced by the prosecution.

475
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,953
There's also the saying,
if it's not in the records,

476
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:25,800
then the answer is at the scene.

477
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:28,120
- Then let me also...
- No.

478
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,286
There's no need for you to
see such a terrible scene.

479
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:31,553
Still...

480
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:33,120
Who knows?

481
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,333
I might catch something that
you may miss.

482
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,533
I've been studying hard, too.

483
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:48,833
I'd like to help, somehow.

484
00:23:50,233 --> 00:23:52,553
So can't I come with you?

485
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:53,633
Please?

486
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:20,133
So this is...

487
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:23,433
Yes, it's Ms. Lim Yun-hee's house.

488
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,333
Are you really alright with this?

489
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:31,153
Sure.

490
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:33,853
I played a detective once,

491
00:24:33,933 --> 00:24:35,520
so I'm used to this.

492
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,420
But dramas and reality
are a lot different.

493
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,733
Follow me, and stay close.

494
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,033
Watch your step.

495
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,920
These are the blood stains
from the incident, are they?

496
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yes.

497
00:25:27,766 --> 00:25:29,386
They're called impact stains.

498
00:25:29,466 --> 00:25:31,133
Impact stains?

499
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:35,420
When you stab someone
and draw the weapon out,

500
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
blood projects through the air.

501
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:39,953
By analyzing the stains,

502
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:42,933
we are able to deduce where
they were standing at the time.

503
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:48,933
Mr. Kim Hyung-tae was...

504
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:51,786
...stabbed, while he was standing.

505
00:25:51,866 --> 00:25:56,166
What do you mean that
he was stabbed standing?

506
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:59,686
If Ms. Lim had stabbed him
on impulse while being attacked,

507
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,753
then normally, we'd expect her to
be in a lower position.

508
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:02,853
But Mr. Kim Hyung-tae was stabbed

509
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:05,820
while standing up,
facing his assailant,

510
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,853
and the prosecution will
probably take this to

511
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:11,320
argue that the
murder was intentional.

512
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Oh.

513
00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:14,100
Let's look around a bit more.

514
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:16,666
Sure.

515
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,800
Mr. Kwon, are you alright?

516
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:31,386
Yes, I'm fine.

517
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,233
Can you call the police for me?

518
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:03,466
Who are you?

519
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,353
Are you alright?

520
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,753
Should I take you to the ER?

521
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:16,820
I'm alright.

522
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,866
I'd first like to give my
testimony as the victim.

523
00:27:29,433 --> 00:27:30,820
Ms. Oh Jin-sim, are you alright?

524
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,020
What about you, Mr. Kwon?

525
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,153
Are you...

526
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:35,320
Oh no. You're still bleeding!

527
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,533
Oh no...

528
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:40,100
Wait.

529
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:48,853
Look at me, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

530
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,420
I'm fine.

531
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,933
But... But you're bleeding.

532
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:54,766
Let's go to a hospital, now.

533
00:27:55,033 --> 00:27:56,186
Not now.

534
00:27:56,266 --> 00:27:57,486
I have to give my testimony.

535
00:27:57,566 --> 00:28:00,133
Is that so important,
when you're hurt?

536
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:03,233
Wait a second. My handkerchief...

537
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,320
I see you're in shock.

538
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,600
I think it's best you go home
and get some rest.

539
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:20,953
Let me take you...

540
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,153
No.

541
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,420
I'll be fine on my own.

542
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,400
So you, Mr. Kwon...

543
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:27,220
You give your testimony

544
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,066
and see a doctor
right away, alright?

545
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:39,566
I'll call you later, then.

546
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:41,066
Alright.

547
00:28:41,733 --> 00:28:43,566
Please take her home safely.

548
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:00,933
What? An intruder?

549
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,733
Who's the victim?

550
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,366
Mr. Kwon Jung-rok?

551
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
Alright, I'll be right over there.

552
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:10,133
(Dongbu Police Station
Silli Patrol Division)

553
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,300
Ah, you're here.

554
00:29:13,866 --> 00:29:16,486
Gosh, you're hurt badly.

555
00:29:16,566 --> 00:29:17,886
Are you alright?

556
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,453
Yes, well... I'm fine.

557
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:20,853
But before that,

558
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,100
what did he say?

559
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:23,520
Well, uh...

560
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,686
This is Mr. Park Su-myung,
and he lives in this neighborhood.

561
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:26,686
He said he was passing by

562
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,486
when he heard a noise
coming from the empty house,

563
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,320
and went in, in case
there was a thief.

564
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,066
He's one of our civil patrollers.

565
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:34,120
Do you know him personally?

566
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,786
His mother is a butcher.

567
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:37,186
He does the deliveries for her.

568
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:38,820
Can I speak to him, alone?

569
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,933
Ah, yes. Sure.

570
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,053
Mr. Park Su-myung?

571
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:56,386
Does it hurt?

572
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:57,466
Yes?

573
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,566
Your head... It's bleeding.

574
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:06,086
I'm alright.

575
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:08,500
But before that,
I'd like to ask a few questions.

576
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:11,353
Go on.

577
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:12,786
So you thought I was a thief.

578
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:13,866
Yes.

579
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:17,466
Are you acquainted with
Ms. Lim Yun-hee?

580
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,620
Have you ever been to that house
before today?

581
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,700
Yun-hee...

582
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:31,100
Yun-hee told me
not to tell anyone.

583
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,133
Not tell what?

584
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:39,986
By any chance... Were you there,

585
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,400
on the night of the incident?

586
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,453
- Did you see...
- Prosecutor Yu?

587
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:46,600
Yes.

588
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:48,933
I called her, because she's the
prosecutor in charge.

589
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:56,266
Are you hurt badly?

590
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,933
I'm fine, this is nothing.

591
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:03,153
So is this him?

592
00:31:03,233 --> 00:31:05,133
The intruder at the crime scene.

593
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:12,533
(Police)

594
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,186
Is it really okay to
let him go like that?

595
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:21,033
It was all
a misunderstanding, so...

596
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,853
Thank you for saying
you don't want him punished.

597
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:25,786
Su-myung, go on and thank him.

598
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:27,133
Thank you!

599
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:29,700
I'm sorry.

600
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,833
Goodbye, then.

601
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:57,553
Sir, this is Yu Yeo-reum.

602
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,920
I'd like you to do some
research on a man.

603
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,153
The name's Park Su-myung,

604
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:04,353
and he runs a butcher shop in
Lim Yun-hee's neighborhood.

605
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:05,986
About Mr. Park Su-myung...

606
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:08,853
I'd like to know where he was
on the night of the incident.

607
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:09,933
Yes.

608
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:11,853
Yes, yes.

609
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:13,366
Yes, thank you.

610
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,453
Ms. Oh, how did you...

611
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:19,553
But you clearly left in that taxi.

612
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,853
I couldn't just
leave you like that.

613
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:23,920
So I asked the driver to
turn the taxi around.

614
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,986
Is it all done, then?

615
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:27,286
Just who was he?

616
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:28,966
And why did he do that?

617
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,020
Actually, no.

618
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,800
Let's get you to a doctor first.

619
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,620
It's alright. The bleeding stopped
and I'm fine.

620
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,953
That's for the doctor to decide!

621
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:44,633
Come on, let's go. Hurry up!

622
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:46,666
(Emergency Center)

623
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:56,753
No need to worry so much.

624
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:59,520
It's just a mild concussion.

625
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,220
Still, don't push yourself too
much in the next couple of days.

626
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,600
- Alright, thank you.
- Sure.

627
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:11,386
Thank goodness.

628
00:33:11,466 --> 00:33:14,400
I was worried that
something might be wrong.

629
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:17,900
Now I'm finally relieved.

630
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:35,766
You really didn't have to
take me home.

631
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,333
You're injured, too.

632
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:42,553
It's alright.

633
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:45,166
You even accompanied me to
the hospital.

634
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:51,020
To be honest, I took you there

635
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,033
not for you, but for me.

636
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:59,053
I was still guilty about

637
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:01,400
leaving you behind like that.

638
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,166
I was guilty about sending you off
first, all on your own.

639
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,120
That's why I took you home,

640
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,900
so don't mind it so much.

641
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:21,286
Today must've been a shock,

642
00:34:21,366 --> 00:34:23,020
so go in and get rest.

643
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,886
Don't worry about me,
you should get some rest.

644
00:34:26,966 --> 00:34:29,433
No more thinking about
work today, alright?

645
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,433
Alright?

646
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:36,686
Yes, alright.

647
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:38,000
Then pinky-promise.

648
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:42,833
Come on, promise me.

649
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:10,833
You promised, so keep it. Alright?

650
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,133
Alright.

651
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,520
You're late.

652
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,353
I see you're busy getting
ready for the second trial.

653
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:05,466
Right.

654
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:08,520
By the way,

655
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,820
please don't face each other
at Court after this.

656
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,153
For me, it feels like walking on
thin ice every day!

657
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:14,520
Alright, then.

658
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,520
I'll just face you next time
in Court instead.

659
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,633
You...

660
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,633
Oh what? Did you hurt yourself?

661
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:25,653
How did that happened?

662
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:27,320
Or who did that to you?

663
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,500
It's nothing.

664
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:48,600
Are you acquainted with
Ms. Lim Yun-hee?

665
00:36:51,566 --> 00:36:55,286
Have you ever been to that house
before today?

666
00:36:55,366 --> 00:36:56,366
Yun-hee...

667
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:00,800
Yun-hee told me
not to tell anyone.

668
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:08,986
He's a witness, then.

669
00:37:09,066 --> 00:37:11,086
From how he said Ms. Lim
told him not to tell anyone,

670
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:12,553
it must mean he either
knows something,

671
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:15,153
or saw something.

672
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,566
Then the chances are high that
he's a witness.

673
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:19,820
I asked Mr. Lee to

674
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,253
do some research on him
and his family.

675
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:24,466
This case has taken a new turn.

676
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,786
By the way, Kwon.
Be careful, alright?

677
00:37:28,866 --> 00:37:31,886
I appreciate you working hard,
but don't get hurt.

678
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:33,153
Exactly.

679
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:36,486
I thought Mr. Kwon was
going to die yesterday.

680
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,453
Why would I die?

681
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:40,800
I throw mean punches.
Don't worry about me.

682
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:42,986
But how can I not?

683
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:45,720
You were on the floor
with just one hit!

684
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,353
Thank God it was slightly off.

685
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:49,953
If he hadn't, you...

686
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:52,053
He hit my head
real good yesterday.

687
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:53,620
Tsk, tsk.

688
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,820
You know, Yoon-seo.

689
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,500
Kwon doesn't look like it,
but he's actually fragile.

690
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:00,420
Whereas I...

691
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,620
I was on this drug
trafficking case once,

692
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,220
and was attacked by a gang.

693
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,453
A gang?

694
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:07,453
Yes.

695
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:09,486
There were two gangs
who sued each other,

696
00:38:09,566 --> 00:38:12,520
trying to lay the blame
on each other.

697
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,086
But thanks to my immaculate
and unbiased handling

698
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,420
of the case,

699
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,853
we won.

700
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:20,153
So the opposing party
attacked us out of grudge.

701
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:24,753
14, 15, 16, 17...
They came at me all at once,

702
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:28,286
and I defeated them all
with just my bare fist!

703
00:38:28,366 --> 00:38:29,453
And do you know
what my secret was to it?

704
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:30,386
What was it?

705
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:31,320
Guts.

706
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,320
- Huh?
- Guts.

707
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,920
- Guts?
- Yes.

708
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,400
I've guts, so nothing
intimidates me, ever.

709
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:39,253
However,

710
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,753
while Mr. Kwon
may have the brains,

711
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,333
he just doesn't have guts.

712
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,820
Let's talk it out.

713
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,366
Let's talk this out, alright?

714
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:53,153
You had loose hair on there.

715
00:38:53,233 --> 00:38:54,333
Hair...

716
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:02,553
Kwon,

717
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:05,820
you've no guts but
you've an eye for detail, huh?

718
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,366
How did you see this?

719
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,700
It makes me wonder.

720
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:12,686
So you're not intimidated.

721
00:39:12,766 --> 00:39:14,433
Or maybe you just don't
show any response?

722
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:16,233
Hey, come on!

723
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:19,086
But really.

724
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:20,600
How did he see this?

725
00:39:20,933 --> 00:39:23,000
Haha.

726
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,800
(Daesung Butcher's)

727
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,120
You know the hair salon
I go to, right?

728
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Yes.

729
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:36,033
Yes, I'll be back!

730
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:38,953
Hello, sir.

731
00:39:39,033 --> 00:39:41,420
Ah, so you're off for delivery.

732
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,053
Yes, I'll be back!

733
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:44,366
Alright, then.

734
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:51,866
Hello.

735
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:54,700
It's cold out today, isn't it?

736
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:56,653
I just saw that

737
00:39:56,733 --> 00:39:59,766
you're quite close with
that butcher's son.

738
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,533
Yes, but why do you ask?

739
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:13,686
Su-myung had feelings for
that woman.

740
00:40:13,766 --> 00:40:16,720
So he followed her, always.

741
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,686
Then you must've seen them
together often.

742
00:40:19,766 --> 00:40:21,420
Of course!

743
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,920
I go around every street corner
in this neighborhood.

744
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,520
Three to four times a day!

745
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,986
Then...

746
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:31,266
Did you see them meet
on the night of the incident?

747
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:34,453
What?

748
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:37,753
Mr. Park Su-myung was at
Ms. Lim's house on that night?

749
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:39,633
He said he clearly saw him.

750
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:51,786
Where are you off to,
at this time of the night?

751
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,866
Delivery!

752
00:40:54,366 --> 00:40:57,466
Sir, Yun-hee's waiting,
so I have to get going.

753
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,566
She's pretty.

754
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:04,600
Goodness, does he
like her that much?

755
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:11,433
Mr. Park Su-myung was
in love with Ms. Lim?

756
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,686
Then maybe he's pretending
he saw nothing,

757
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:17,353
even when he witnessed everything?

758
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,620
It's almost clear he's a witness.

759
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,500
He may not be a witness.

760
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,300
If he's not...

761
00:41:35,266 --> 00:41:38,086
Were you close to Ms. Lim Yun-hee?

762
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:41,020
Yun-hee's a good person.

763
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:46,086
You know that she killed
her husband, right?

764
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:47,933
I need to go make deliveries.

765
00:41:48,266 --> 00:41:51,120
Mom said there were
a ton today.

766
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,720
Were you at her place
on the night of the incident?

767
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,086
Did you witness the scene?

768
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:56,620
2 kg of ox tail for Jin-su,

769
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,353
3 kg of shoulder meat
for Myung-jin,

770
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,853
and 1 kg of soup beef
for Kyung-su!

771
00:42:00,933 --> 00:42:03,233
And, and...

772
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:05,086
Where else?

773
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:06,786
Mom told me.

774
00:42:06,866 --> 00:42:08,100
Where else was it?

775
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:14,933
He's just incoherent and
it's frustrating.

776
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,786
At first I doubted that
he may be a witness, but...

777
00:42:17,866 --> 00:42:19,486
But even if he did see something,

778
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:23,153
that may not always
necessarily help us.

779
00:42:23,233 --> 00:42:27,853
If Park Su-myung stands on
Lim Yun-hee's side

780
00:42:27,933 --> 00:42:30,420
and describes her husband's
violence and its severity...

781
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,266
It'll only mean our disadvantage.

782
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:34,386
You're right.

783
00:42:34,466 --> 00:42:36,286
I did some research,
and it seems like

784
00:42:36,366 --> 00:42:39,120
Lim Yun-hee and Park Su-myung
were quite close.

785
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,133
Let's just forget about
Park Su-myung, then.

786
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:46,386
Huh? Are you going somewhere?

787
00:42:46,466 --> 00:42:47,520
Yes.

788
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,953
I had some things to ask
Ms. Lim Yun-hee.

789
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:51,066
Then...

790
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,600
Have one of these before you go.

791
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,220
What's this?

792
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,186
What else? Red ginseng.

793
00:43:02,266 --> 00:43:05,320
Come on, I want to see you
swallow it.

794
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,400
Sure.

795
00:43:13,233 --> 00:43:14,186
Well?

796
00:43:14,266 --> 00:43:15,786
Do you feel refreshed?

797
00:43:15,866 --> 00:43:18,533
I brought some,
just for you, you know.

798
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:21,300
Because you're more fragile
than you appear to be, right?

799
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,053
Fragile?

800
00:43:24,133 --> 00:43:27,186
Maybe you didn't see me clearly
because you were panicking,

801
00:43:27,266 --> 00:43:28,253
but yesterday I...

802
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,653
He got me straight in the head.

803
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,920
Most people would be
on the floor for hours,

804
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,786
but because it was me,
I got straight up and

805
00:43:34,866 --> 00:43:36,120
even chased after the guy!

806
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,553
So if you keep on
spreading false facts that

807
00:43:37,633 --> 00:43:39,120
I almost died,
and that I'm fragile,

808
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,320
I'll sue you for defamation.

809
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,300
You'll sue me? Me?

810
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:46,086
I called the
police for you yesterday,

811
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:47,820
accompanied you to the hospital,

812
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,353
and even brought that
red ginseng for you.

813
00:43:50,433 --> 00:43:53,120
Gosh, I don't believe this.

814
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,186
I'm not saying I really will,

815
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,220
I'm only saying that
it's that offensive,

816
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,220
so please refrain from
saying something like that.

817
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,386
Alright.

818
00:44:02,466 --> 00:44:04,553
Then take care.

819
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:06,266
Alright, then.

820
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,620
He should be fine today, right?

821
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,666
I can't help but worry.

822
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:29,733
May I ask you a question?

823
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,353
On the night of the incident,

824
00:44:33,433 --> 00:44:36,033
you had suffered severe injuries.

825
00:44:37,433 --> 00:44:38,320
Yet how were you able to

826
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,920
kill your husband, who is
much larger than you in size,

827
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,633
with just two stabs?

828
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,566
All that was on my mind
was that I needed to live.

829
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,500
Because only then,
it'll all be over.

830
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:56,266
But it's not as easy as you think.

831
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,986
Unlike in the movies
or in the dramas,

832
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:01,886
a knife doesn't penetrate so
easily due to bones and organs.

833
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:04,386
That's why people who
stab someone for the first time,

834
00:45:04,466 --> 00:45:06,533
often hurt their hands.

835
00:45:11,733 --> 00:45:15,533
Do you know someone by the
name of Park Su-myung?

836
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,366
I do.

837
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:21,953
He's someone who works
at the butcher's shop, isn't he?

838
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:25,186
I heard you two were
extremely close.

839
00:45:25,266 --> 00:45:26,186
Says who?

840
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:27,920
Most people in the neighborhood.

841
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,766
That's ridiculous.
What, someone like him?

842
00:45:38,366 --> 00:45:41,520
Today's the second hearing for
Ms. Lim's trial, right?

843
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,986
Yes.

844
00:45:43,066 --> 00:45:44,586
Why am I the one who's nervous?

845
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:46,433
Same here, I'm extremely nervous.

846
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:51,486
Kwon really needs to turn the
table into our favor.

847
00:45:51,566 --> 00:45:53,353
I'm telling you, this is
making me more nervous than

848
00:45:53,433 --> 00:45:55,233
when I tried to first hold hands
with my first love.

849
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:57,786
Mr. Kwon's here.

850
00:45:57,866 --> 00:45:58,933
Ah, you're here!

851
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,886
You've got this, right?

852
00:46:02,966 --> 00:46:04,986
How's that joker up your sleeve to
turn this completely around?

853
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:06,933
Mr. Lee, may I see you
for a second?

854
00:46:12,766 --> 00:46:15,920
From that look on his face,
he must have something.

855
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,186
Though he's callous,

856
00:46:17,266 --> 00:46:19,133
he must have a card
up his sleeve.

857
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,053
Did you managed to
convince Mr. Park Su-myung?

858
00:46:23,133 --> 00:46:24,320
To stand as witness?

859
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,620
I kept trying,

860
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,186
but he wouldn't budge.

861
00:46:28,266 --> 00:46:29,420
I know it's difficult,

862
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,953
but you must bring him to
Court today.

863
00:46:32,033 --> 00:46:33,333
Please, I'm asking you.

864
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,220
I...

865
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,166
I'll try.

866
00:46:40,433 --> 00:46:42,886
I'll go with Mr. Lee,

867
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,700
and try convincing him.

868
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,286
I'll wait in the lobby.

869
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:55,400
Alright.

870
00:47:05,366 --> 00:47:06,466
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

871
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,120
It may be best that
you don't come to the trial today.

872
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,286
What?

873
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:14,053
Why...

874
00:47:14,133 --> 00:47:17,120
There'll be a lot more journalists
present today.

875
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,533
And that's too risky.

876
00:47:19,966 --> 00:47:20,953
Alright.

877
00:47:21,033 --> 00:47:22,600
Then bye.

878
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:30,866
Everything will go well
today, Mr. Kwon.

879
00:47:36,866 --> 00:47:38,820
Ms. Lim, who has been charged for
murdering her violent husband,

880
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,620
is back in Court today for
her second hearing.

881
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,520
It will be down to whether
her actions were self-defense,

882
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,286
or intentionally planned for
a huge insurance payout.

883
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:49,320
Prosecutor Yu Yeo-reum of
the Seoul Prosecution Service

884
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,353
has stated with confidence,

885
00:47:50,433 --> 00:47:52,286
that the evidence submitted and

886
00:47:52,366 --> 00:47:54,186
the circumstances of
the incident would give

887
00:47:54,266 --> 00:47:56,600
enough proof of Ms. Lim's guilt.

888
00:47:57,233 --> 00:47:58,233
Yun-hee!

889
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,533
Yun-hee...

890
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:11,333
Su-myung, where are you going?
You need to go make deliveries.

891
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,086
Um, Mr. Park Su-myung?
Can we talk?

892
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:18,686
No, I'm not going.

893
00:48:18,766 --> 00:48:20,233
I said I'm not.

894
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,733
Let me try talking to him.

895
00:48:26,266 --> 00:48:28,686
Yun-hee said not to
tell anyone. Yep, she did.

896
00:48:28,766 --> 00:48:30,586
Yun-hee told me not to
tell anyone.

897
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:33,100
That I can't tell anyone.

898
00:48:41,633 --> 00:48:43,333
Mr. Park Su-myung.

899
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,500
Do you remember me?

900
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,433
I'm sure you saw me at
Ms. Lim Yun-hee's place.

901
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,553
I was next to that lawyer that

902
00:48:58,633 --> 00:49:00,333
you assaulted, Mr. Park.

903
00:49:02,466 --> 00:49:06,320
To be honest with you,
I was really mad at the time.

904
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,433
Because the person
whom you assaulted...

905
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,853
...is the person I like.

906
00:49:12,933 --> 00:49:15,886
I was really sad because

907
00:49:15,966 --> 00:49:19,320
the person I like got hurt.

908
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,653
I'm sorry.

909
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:22,466
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

910
00:49:24,866 --> 00:49:29,753
I'm sure you know
how I feel, Su-myung.

911
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:33,820
It hurts to see the person
you like in pain, right?

912
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,266
Right, I hate it.

913
00:49:39,233 --> 00:49:40,586
I hate it.

914
00:49:40,666 --> 00:49:43,820
I hate seeing Yun-hee in
pain and suffering.

915
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:49,153
But if you continue to
say nothing, Su-myung,

916
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:52,500
things may get harder for
Ms. Lim Yun-hee.

917
00:49:54,933 --> 00:49:56,953
You need to tell the truth,

918
00:49:57,033 --> 00:49:58,753
whatever that truth is.

919
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:03,100
If you don't today, you may not
see her for a long time.

920
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:11,486
We protest! We protest!

921
00:50:11,566 --> 00:50:15,686
The Court must accept it was
on the grounds of self-defense!

922
00:50:15,766 --> 00:50:17,320
You're a researcher at
the National Forensic Service,

923
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,286
and you analyzed the
impact stains yourself, didn't you?

924
00:50:20,366 --> 00:50:21,286
Yes, that's right.

925
00:50:21,366 --> 00:50:22,586
Ms. Lim Yun-hee claims that

926
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:25,286
she stabbed the victim on impulse,

927
00:50:25,366 --> 00:50:27,486
during an intense bodily struggle.

928
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,520
Did your analysis
validate her claims as true?

929
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,986
No, they did not.

930
00:50:32,066 --> 00:50:33,453
The impact stains
discovered from the site are

931
00:50:33,533 --> 00:50:36,286
only possible, if the assailant
stabbed the victim

932
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,133
from the front, with full force.

933
00:50:45,066 --> 00:50:46,166
I rest my case.

934
00:50:48,866 --> 00:50:49,986
Counsel,

935
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:51,553
will you cross-examine?

936
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:52,666
Yes.

937
00:50:59,066 --> 00:51:01,086
How much can impact stains

938
00:51:01,166 --> 00:51:02,553
tell about the case?

939
00:51:02,633 --> 00:51:06,786
We can have an idea of
what happened at the scene.

940
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:07,820
You say these impact stains are
only possible if

941
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,986
the assailant stabs the victim
from the front, with full force.

942
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:12,833
Were they also discovered on
her clothes?

943
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:15,853
Well, no. However...

944
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:16,953
No similar blood stains were

945
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:18,886
discovered on
Ms. Lim Yun-hee's clothes.

946
00:51:18,966 --> 00:51:20,100
Am I not right?

947
00:51:22,033 --> 00:51:23,686
- Yes.
- In other words,

948
00:51:23,766 --> 00:51:26,786
there is a possibility that
she may not be the assailant.

949
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:29,100
Objection, Your Honor, leading.

950
00:51:31,233 --> 00:51:33,053
Objection overruled.

951
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:35,200
You may continue.

952
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,686
Based on our analysis,

953
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:41,066
we cannot
rule out that possibility.

954
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:50,966
Yun-hee! Yun-hee!

955
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,786
Your Honor.

956
00:51:57,866 --> 00:52:00,186
May I request to call a witness
from the audience?

957
00:52:00,266 --> 00:52:01,420
From the audience?

958
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,420
We were not informed of this,

959
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,020
what are the reasons?

960
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,753
Mr. Park Su-myung, whom I wish to
call to the witness stand,

961
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:12,086
has a close relationship
with my client, Ms. Lim.

962
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:13,553
He had also visited her home

963
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:16,386
on the night of the incident,

964
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,353
Though this detail was
omitted from the case file,

965
00:52:18,433 --> 00:52:20,453
Mr. Park may be the
sole witness of this incident,

966
00:52:20,533 --> 00:52:21,820
or even

967
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,566
another suspect.

968
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,933
Please appoint him as witness,
Your Honor.

969
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:33,586
Mr. Park.
(Witness Stand)

970
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:36,053
Before we start,
may I ask you something?

971
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:38,500
Could you write down
your name for us?

972
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,753
Do you always use
your right hand, Mr. Park,

973
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:52,153
in your daily activities including
writing and dining?

974
00:52:52,233 --> 00:52:53,853
Yes.

975
00:52:53,933 --> 00:52:56,886
You currently live with
your mother,

976
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:58,366
who runs a butcher's shop.
Am I correct?

977
00:52:58,866 --> 00:53:01,620
- Yes.
- You only do the deliveries,

978
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,686
and it's your mother who chops and

979
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:05,320
prepares the meat.

980
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,686
Am I right?

981
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,586
- Yes.
- In other words,

982
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:12,266
your work doesn't involve
holding a knife.

983
00:53:15,933 --> 00:53:17,533
- No.
- Then,

984
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,520
when did you get that
cut on your thumb,

985
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,300
may I ask?

986
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:29,753
Mr. Park, you were there
at the time of the crime,

987
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,386
at Ms. Lim Yun-hee's place,

988
00:53:31,466 --> 00:53:33,120
to make a delivery.

989
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,266
Am I not right?

990
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,220
- Yes.
- According to the

991
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,086
records I acquired,

992
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:39,553
on the night of the incident,

993
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,953
you checked into the ER

994
00:53:41,033 --> 00:53:43,753
and had your 3 cm scar
on your right thumb

995
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:45,886
stitched up.

996
00:53:45,966 --> 00:53:48,533
I hereby submit his medical
files as evidence.

997
00:53:50,733 --> 00:53:52,920
When a non-professional
stabs someone with a knife,

998
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,553
they often find the knife
doesn't penetrate so easily

999
00:53:54,633 --> 00:53:57,133
and so end up hurting their thumb.

1000
00:53:58,766 --> 00:54:01,733
So, is this a coincidence?

1001
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:03,953
Your Honor,

1002
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:07,086
the prosecution just accepted
Ms. Lim Yun-hee's confession,

1003
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:10,353
and did not even investigate
Mr. Park Su-myung.

1004
00:54:10,433 --> 00:54:11,886
From the very start,

1005
00:54:11,966 --> 00:54:13,586
the Prosecution only wanted to
put a lid on the case

1006
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:15,753
that was creating controversy,
as soon as possible.

1007
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:19,000
They were negligent about
exposing the truth.

1008
00:54:24,533 --> 00:54:25,933
Let me now ask Mr. Park.

1009
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,100
Who was it that killed
Mr. Kim Hyung-tae that night?

1010
00:54:33,433 --> 00:54:34,853
Objection, Your Honor.

1011
00:54:34,933 --> 00:54:37,453
We did not find
Mr. Park's fingerprints,

1012
00:54:37,533 --> 00:54:39,986
his blood stains, nor
any other traces for that matter.

1013
00:54:40,066 --> 00:54:42,386
The defending counsel is
merely making groundless,

1014
00:54:42,466 --> 00:54:45,420
one-sided claims
based on his pure imagination,

1015
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,986
in order to lead the judges
and the jury.

1016
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:48,300
That is not true.

1017
00:54:49,066 --> 00:54:49,953
Your Honor,

1018
00:54:50,033 --> 00:54:51,320
the evidence submitted by
the Prosecution

1019
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,653
in order to prove her guilt
are just her affidavit

1020
00:54:53,733 --> 00:54:56,386
and the autopsy report,
and no more.

1021
00:54:56,466 --> 00:54:58,286
And even that autopsy report is

1022
00:54:58,366 --> 00:55:00,320
inconsistent with
Ms. Lim's testimony.

1023
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,820
As the Prosecution have
also argued,

1024
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,753
it simply isn't possible for

1025
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:04,953
a woman with severe injuries,

1026
00:55:05,033 --> 00:55:08,100
to kill her husband
with just two stabs.

1027
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,686
Mr. Park Su-myung was
present at the scene,

1028
00:55:12,766 --> 00:55:14,786
and he injured his right thumb.

1029
00:55:14,866 --> 00:55:17,220
Ms. Lim Yun-hee claims
she is the assailant,

1030
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,300
but she was not in
the right physical condition.

1031
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,433
Let me now ask you again.

1032
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,186
Who was it that killed
Mr. Kim Hyung-tae

1033
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:32,300
that night?

1034
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:38,666
The person who stabbed him was...

1035
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,886
The person who stabbed him was...!

1036
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,786
Su-myung, no! Don't say anything!

1037
00:55:45,866 --> 00:55:47,186
Ms. Lim, please calm down.

1038
00:55:47,266 --> 00:55:49,120
Don't hit Yun-hee! Don't!

1039
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,153
Don't hit her!

1040
00:55:50,233 --> 00:55:51,886
Don't do that to her!

1041
00:55:51,966 --> 00:55:54,586
I stabbed him. I stabbed him,
with a knife!

1042
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:56,286
I stabbed him.

1043
00:55:56,366 --> 00:55:58,233
I stabbed him...

1044
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:01,153
Su-myung...

1045
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:04,920
That bastard...
He beat her every day.

1046
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,353
Even that day too.
He beat her every day.

1047
00:56:07,433 --> 00:56:10,886
So I... I stabbed him.

1048
00:56:10,966 --> 00:56:13,820
He was beating her that day, too.

1049
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,786
He was!

1050
00:56:16,866 --> 00:56:19,266
He was beating her that day, too.

1051
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:26,066
Yun-hee... Yun-hee...!

1052
00:56:30,733 --> 00:56:31,953
Help me!

1053
00:56:32,033 --> 00:56:33,520
Yun-hee! Yun-hee!

1054
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,653
Don't hit her!

1055
00:56:35,733 --> 00:56:37,320
- "Yun-hee?"
- Su-myung...

1056
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,920
Please, just run!

1057
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,133
Please...

1058
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,920
I stabbed him. I stabbed him!

1059
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,353
I stabbed him...

1060
00:56:59,433 --> 00:57:01,486
He beat her.

1061
00:57:01,566 --> 00:57:03,520
He beat her every day.

1062
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,333
Every day.

1063
00:57:18,433 --> 00:57:19,486
Here she comes!

1064
00:57:19,566 --> 00:57:20,653
Did the Prosecution exert...

1065
00:57:20,733 --> 00:57:22,286
Were you having an affair
with the suspect?

1066
00:57:22,366 --> 00:57:24,820
Only your fingerprints were
found on the weapon.

1067
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,920
Why did you distort the truth?

1068
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,220
Why did you not reveal that

1069
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,820
someone else had
murdered your husband?

1070
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,233
Please tell us.

1071
00:57:33,633 --> 00:57:35,753
I practically killed him.

1072
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:39,333
Because in my mind,
I had already killed him...

1073
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,220
...hundreds, no,
thousands of times.

1074
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,820
It has been revealed
in Court today that

1075
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,853
it wasn't Ms. Lim, but someone
else who killed her husband.

1076
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:48,220
Mr. Park, who confessed to
his crime,

1077
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,453
said he stabbed Ms. Lim's
husband on impulse.

1078
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:52,420
The police found much blood on the

1079
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,953
gloves he had worn that night

1080
00:57:54,033 --> 00:57:55,653
in his room,

1081
00:57:55,733 --> 00:57:57,720
and suspects they belong to
Mr. Park

1082
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,686
and Mr. Kim Hyung-tae, the victim.

1083
00:57:59,766 --> 00:58:01,886
A DNA analysis is
currently underway.

1084
00:58:01,966 --> 00:58:03,653
Yes, yes, yes!

1085
00:58:03,733 --> 00:58:05,153
That's our ace attorney,

1086
00:58:05,233 --> 00:58:06,520
- Mr. Kwon, alright.
- Right?

1087
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,666
I would've never dreamed
the killer was someone else.

1088
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:12,753
Really? You really didn't?

1089
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:13,953
Because I knew already.

1090
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:16,520
If you really did, you wouldn't
have kept quiet.

1091
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,166
Not when you're always bragging.

1092
00:58:19,266 --> 00:58:20,853
Bragging?

1093
00:58:20,933 --> 00:58:22,586
Are you done?

1094
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,666
Hmmm? Hmmm?

1095
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:26,953
I'm back.

1096
00:58:27,033 --> 00:58:28,100
Kwon!

1097
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,033
Come here. Well done, you!
Come here.

1098
00:58:32,866 --> 00:58:35,453
Nope! I'm going to give you
a hug no matter what.

1099
00:58:35,533 --> 00:58:37,466
I love you, Jung-rok!

1100
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:41,386
Well, today's something to
celebrate.

1101
00:58:41,466 --> 00:58:42,520
So let's all go for dinner!

1102
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,753
Round 1 will be Korean beef,

1103
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:45,486
and round 2 will be karaoke.

1104
00:58:45,566 --> 00:58:46,520
Okay?

1105
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,620
Everyone alright with that?

1106
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,020
Okay!

1107
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,553
I'm sorry, but can we
save it for next time?

1108
00:58:50,633 --> 00:58:52,220
Oh, come on. What is it this time?

1109
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,820
I'm a little tired today.

1110
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,066
I'm sorry.

1111
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:02,300
Then let's just
celebrate amongst ourselves.

1112
00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:06,620
What are you talking about?

1113
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,053
Our hero's not coming.

1114
00:59:08,133 --> 00:59:10,120
Did you ever see a fan meeting
happen without the celebrity?

1115
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,953
Or a baby's first birthday party
without the birthday baby?

1116
00:59:12,033 --> 00:59:13,933
Come on, wake up!

1117
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:31,866
You're going home on time
for once today.

1118
00:59:32,566 --> 00:59:34,520
- Yes, well...
- You must be tired.

1119
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,520
Go home quick
and get a good night's sleep.

1120
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,600
A good night's sleep!

1121
00:59:42,633 --> 00:59:43,766
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

1122
00:59:45,133 --> 00:59:48,153
Would you like to have
a glass of soju with me?

1123
00:59:48,233 --> 00:59:49,233
Pardon?

1124
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:04,866
You don't look too happy.

1125
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,253
That's strange.

1126
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,653
You're always so ecstatic

1127
01:00:09,733 --> 01:00:12,333
after a win, Mr. Kwon.

1128
01:00:13,766 --> 01:00:15,500
Oh! Is it perhaps because...

1129
01:00:16,466 --> 01:00:19,420
Because of Prosecutor Yu?

1130
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,553
Because she's your friend?

1131
01:00:21,633 --> 01:00:24,133
Well, there's that too, but...

1132
01:00:26,266 --> 01:00:30,200
There's also the fact that
Ms. Lim lied for Mr. Park,

1133
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,500
and that Mr. Park killed her
husband for her.

1134
01:00:35,233 --> 01:00:37,500
I fully understand
why they did that, so...

1135
01:00:39,133 --> 01:00:41,566
It's quite hard to be
happy about my win today.

1136
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:53,733
Here.

1137
01:01:17,366 --> 01:01:18,466
Thank you.

1138
01:01:20,133 --> 01:01:21,053
For what?

1139
01:01:21,133 --> 01:01:23,953
For encouraging me that I'll win,

1140
01:01:24,033 --> 01:01:27,500
and for worrying about me
when I got hurt.

1141
01:01:29,133 --> 01:01:30,266
It's nothing.

1142
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:36,653
But uh...

1143
01:01:36,733 --> 01:01:38,800
Can I ask you something?

1144
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:44,720
You said you were too tired for
a team dinner,

1145
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,053
so why ask me to
have a drink with you?

1146
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:49,820
Hmmm...

1147
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,800
Today, I just...

1148
01:01:53,766 --> 01:01:56,666
I just wanted to
have a drink, just us two.

1149
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,033
It's much colder out
than I thought.

1150
01:02:25,133 --> 01:02:26,533
Why are you laughing like that?

1151
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:32,266
I remembered that time when
I went to that garden with you.

1152
01:02:33,233 --> 01:02:34,753
Back then, you said

1153
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:37,986
I can put my hands in the pockets
if I'm cold,

1154
01:02:38,066 --> 01:02:39,553
but I misunderstood you

1155
01:02:39,633 --> 01:02:42,220
and put them in your pocket.

1156
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,200
I was really embarrassed, then.

1157
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,420
I've done too many dramas,

1158
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,153
so I'm not quite in touch
with reality sometimes.

1159
01:02:53,233 --> 01:02:55,753
I mean, there's no reason for
you to lend me your pocket

1160
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:58,933
just because my hands are cold.

1161
01:03:18,266 --> 01:03:19,533
I worry for you.

1162
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:27,120
Just as much as you worry
and think about me,

1163
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,233
I'd...

1164
01:03:29,533 --> 01:03:31,433
I'd now like to do the same.

1165
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:18,966
(Touch Your Heart)

1166
01:04:19,133 --> 01:04:23,066
I hope it'll be someone
who can touch my heart.

1167
01:04:24,266 --> 01:04:26,700
A workshop with the
cosmic goddess, Oh Yoon-seo!

1168
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,153
Everyone else is worried that
Yoon-seo might be cold.

1169
01:04:31,233 --> 01:04:33,520
How can you be so inconsiderate?

1170
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,120
We all went to get you
something, Yoon-seo,

1171
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,933
but he was the only one
who came back empty-handed.

1172
01:04:36,933 --> 01:04:37,933
(Oh Yoon-seo's favorite things)

1173
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,920
She was anticipating for
his next move,

1174
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,653
but when there was
nothing from him...

1175
01:04:41,733 --> 01:04:43,453
You're so bad, Mr. Kwon!

1176
01:04:43,533 --> 01:04:44,453
She's really mad.

1177
01:04:44,533 --> 01:04:46,020
Who gets so logical
in a relationship

1178
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,033
and only tries to start something
after knowing everything?

1179
01:04:49,533 --> 01:04:52,120
Does he even like me?

1180
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,786
I'm a bit slow,

1181
01:04:53,866 --> 01:04:55,420
so let me approach you

1182
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,900
at my own pace.
