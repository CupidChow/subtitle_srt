1
00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:41,200
(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,953
(Korea Wave Star
Oh Yoon-seo)

3
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:29,066
(Summoned by Prosecution on
Drug Abuse Suspicions)

4
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,233
How do you feel?

5
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,353
Ms. Oh, do you admit to
taking illegal substances?

6
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,353
What is your relationship to the
second son of the Empire Group?

7
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:04,086
Are you still claiming that
you're innocent?

8
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,086
- Please, a word!
- How are you

9
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,433
feeling right now?

10
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:16,400
(Two years later)

11
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:19,086
Let's find out what some of
our forgotten stars are up to.

12
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,686
- So, who's our star today?
- Today's celebrity is...

13
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,720
Not only was she
Korea's sweetheart,

14
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,586
but she had won hearts all over
Asia with her innocent image.

15
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:27,253
She's Oh Yoon-seo.

16
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,820
Oh my goodness!

17
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,820
I'd been curious about
what she was up to.

18
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,286
So, how's she doing? Do you know?

19
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:33,853
From what I heard,

20
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:35,153
she's currently hermiting

21
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:37,320
while waiting for the chance of
a comeback.

22
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,486
I see.

23
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:41,220
But we're talking about an actress
who was in a drug scandal!

24
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,853
Do you think she can return
on screen? No way.

25
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:46,053
Well, her test results
did come back negative

26
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,453
and the Court declared her
not guilty.

27
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,586
But while there is
a possibility of a comeback,

28
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,753
her reputation has been
damaged beyond repair.

29
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:53,853
And most important of all,

30
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:56,486
she's now forgotten. Right?

31
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:57,486
Oh, I don't know.

32
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:59,020
I'd say that right now,

33
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,066
I'd have a higher chance of
being recognized on the streets.

34
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:04,153
No, Yoon-seo!

35
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:06,186
Yoon-seo, no. Don't!

36
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,420
What do you think you're doing?

37
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,033
What's wrong with you?

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,400
I know it's tough for you,
but still... You shouldn't!

39
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,553
Yes, of course I know
how hard it must be for you.

40
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:16,820
After that rotten scandal,

41
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,553
your reputation
couldn't sink any lower,

42
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,253
and you became dead-broke,
because of all the penalties...

43
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,886
Then you took on so many haters,

44
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:23,186
so what if your name was cleared?

45
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,120
Because the clouds over your life
aren't clearing up.

46
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,120
I mean, like you have a friend or
a boyfriend to lean on.

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,586
You're always eating, sleeping,
and getting fat alone!

48
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,020
No wonder you're depressed.

49
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,786
Yes, no wonder. But Yoon-seo...

50
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:35,420
This is not the way to go.
Not the extreme option.

51
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,766
No, Yoon-seo!

52
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,066
They're... vitamins.

53
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:42,600
Vit... Vitamins?

54
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:44,920
Come on, don't say that!

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,633
How are these vitamins?

56
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:48,300
(Multi Vita Health supplements)

57
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,553
Oh, they're vitamins.

58
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:51,700
Yeah.

59
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,300
Why are you taking so many?

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,800
It says here to
take thirty at a time.

61
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:01,953
Um, Yoon-seo?
You naive, innocent darling...

62
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,320
This means that
there are 30 pills inside.

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,020
Look here. "One per day."

64
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,566
It says here to take
one pill a day!

65
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:15,120
Oh, no wonder. My stomach
would've burst otherwise.

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,466
One. Ah!

67
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:18,533
I see.

68
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,720
So, uh...

69
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,486
What brings you here today?

70
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:26,786
Oh, that's right.

71
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:30,733
Yoon-seo, remember the photos
we took last week?

72
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,086
Why do you look so beautiful?

73
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,733
I got some printed because
you were just too beautiful.

74
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:42,053
Ha... Who cares about
all those audition photos?

75
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:44,200
I'm not getting any work.

76
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,486
Hyuk-jun.

77
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:50,253
Are you sure
I can even come back on screen?

78
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,753
Of course!

79
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,420
Just you wait.

80
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,253
You'll be cast as the heroine of
an epic drama...

81
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,866
You mean, more like her auntie.

82
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,653
Do you even know how old I am now?

83
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,253
Do numbers matter?

84
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,886
It's all about the age you look.

85
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:05,753
I'll be honest. If you were
just a bit shorter,

86
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,020
I could even get you playing
child roles!

87
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,666
You look that young for your age.

88
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,966
Child roles...
That's pushing it a bit too far.

89
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:16,886
Huh?

90
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,486
I'm sure I slid it between here,

91
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:19,633
in case it gets crinkled.

92
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:21,600
(Love is bound to hurt)

93
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,400
Hey, what's with this script?

94
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:28,100
Huh?

95
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,220
Goodness!

96
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,753
This is a surprise for me, is it?

97
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,820
That audition photo was
just an excuse,

98
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,866
you're here to deliver
this script, are you? Right?

99
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,820
Oh, no...

100
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,853
No. No, I'm not.

101
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,833
So, who's the writer?
What's the drama about?

102
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,533
None of your business.

103
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:46,900
What do you mean,
it's not my business?

104
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,633
So it's not for me.

105
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,433
Yoon-seo...

106
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:00,266
If it's not, then say so.
No need to hide it!

107
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,620
Hide it? No!

108
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,133
I'm not hiding anything.

109
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:07,986
Whatever, like I was
ever interested.

110
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,086
Hey, hey! Yoon-seo!

111
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,533
Hold it right there, Yoon-seo!

112
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,766
Hey, Yoon-seo!

113
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,853
Whoa!

114
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,766
It's by Lee Se-jin!

115
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,866
"Love is bound to hurt."

116
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:32,086
"This is a story about
an M&A lawyer

117
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,153
who travels to the Middle East
on vacation,

118
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:38,100
and falls in love with
a military judicial officer."

119
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,066
That sounds interesting already.

120
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,333
(Midday, at an airport
in the Middle East)

121
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,020
You dropped this.

122
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,420
Why, thank you.

123
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,820
I really hate making
a faux pas like this one.

124
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,053
I hate people like that too,

125
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,586
and this is the first time...

126
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,033
...that anyone's looked so cute
making a faux pas.

127
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:27,333
Goodness!

128
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:30,853
Our heroine is now held hostage by
a terrorist group,

129
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:32,500
and fear has consumed her.

130
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,433
At that very moment,
our hero comes to the rescue!

131
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:30,566
Jeong-do...!

132
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:39,566
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,786
For putting you into such danger.

134
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:44,086
Why did you come here?

135
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,553
What am I to you, anyway?

136
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:49,400
You could've died!

137
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:56,033
My biggest fear isn't

138
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:58,800
my own death,

139
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,900
but losing you.

140
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,800
Ju-hye!

141
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,033
I'm...

142
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:40,533
I'm sorry I postponed these
words until now.

143
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,866
But I love you.

144
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,866
Ju-hye...!

145
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,433
Yes, this is it!

146
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:02,386
Hyuk-jun.

147
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:03,933
I just got the goosebumps.

148
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:05,966
Goosebumps?

149
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,653
The heroine of this story...

150
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,086
She's so me.

151
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,720
She's just...

152
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,620
...me, myself!

153
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,853
Why?

154
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:16,886
And what about her, exactly?

155
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:18,053
Look.

156
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:20,720
She's supposed to be
an innocent beauty,

157
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,053
which is what I totally am!

158
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:24,853
Plus,

159
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:27,186
she's a lawyer!

160
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:28,886
I majored in law, remember?

161
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:30,320
Well... A no is a no.

162
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,666
This is Min-ji's.

163
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,786
That's for Kim Min-ji?

164
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:36,733
No! I mean, no.

165
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,953
Min-ji won't take it, anyway.

166
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,253
Why not?

167
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,386
Who does she think she is to
reject Lee Se-jin?

168
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:44,386
No, it's not about her
thinking she's anybody.

169
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:47,520
80% of this will need to be
filmed abroad.

170
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,220
Who'll want to spend months
abroad, including Min-ji?

171
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,453
That's why everyone has been
turning it down,

172
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:53,886
and not only that,
it needs heavy investment,

173
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:56,186
which is why they still haven't
found a sponsor yet.

174
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,253
So from how I see it,

175
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,586
at this rate

176
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,333
this won't go through,
100 percent.

177
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,733
That's why I should do it!

178
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:10,653
Why do you think that?

179
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:12,153
I have more than enough free time!

180
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,286
I can go abroad, 100%!

181
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,020
Plus with the
high production costs,

182
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,953
won't they like it if

183
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:20,620
I agree to sign for lower numbers?

184
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,153
Just leave it to me!

185
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:24,220
I'll ask Lee Se-jin directly.

186
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,433
We worked together before,
so we're quite close.

187
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,286
Yoon-seo?

188
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:32,120
Hey, wait.

189
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,733
Please, just wait!

190
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,066
Shhh!

191
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,953
Hello?

192
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,233
Se-jin?

193
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,933
It's me, Yoon-seo.

194
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,986
Um, Yoon-seo?
I understand what you mean.

195
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:51,320
I understand
what you mean very well,

196
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,520
but I'm really not sure about
working with you.

197
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,833
I mean, that wasn't just
your everyday scandal.

198
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,420
But you know that
they were all false rumors.

199
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,820
What does it matter if
it was the truth or not?

200
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,453
Our viewers don't want to
see you on TV anymore.

201
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:10,453
And to be frank with you,

202
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:13,966
it's not like you're
a superb actress.

203
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,420
Um, Se-jin?

204
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,853
You do know that while
my acting wasn't impressive,

205
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,820
I'd always get
stellar ratings, right?

206
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,053
- Right?
- Yeah.

207
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:29,753
I can promise you that I'll have
everyone talk about this drama.

208
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,800
Of course you will.

209
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:33,333
With your awful acting.

210
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,786
Please, Se-jin.
Just trust me on this.

211
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:44,100
I really want to do this drama!

212
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:50,220
Ms. Lee.

213
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,900
Please give her a chance.

214
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:55,533
We'll make sure to
train her thoroughly.

215
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:09,066
On one condition.

216
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,000
Condition?

217
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:14,653
No, I can't. I'm not doing it!

218
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:18,386
She wants me to work
at a law firm for experience?

219
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,266
Does this even make sense?

220
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:22,153
It does make sense.

221
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:26,020
Yoon-seo, I once read this
actor's interview.

222
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,820
And he said that as soon as he was
cast as a student studying for

223
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,120
civil exams, he checked in
at a gosiwon and lived there!

224
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,686
So he can study their speech,
their dress code and habits to

225
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:34,420
reflect them in his acting.

226
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,020
So Yoon-seo, just think of it as
taking acting lessons...

227
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,620
Ha... Acting lessons?

228
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,186
Hyuk-jun.

229
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,020
I'm Oh Yoon-seo!

230
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,466
Oh Yoon-seo, the actress with
15 years of career!

231
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,320
Am I not right?

232
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,753
Right, you are Oh Yoon-seo.

233
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,786
I already feel robbed, wasting
two years when I'm innocent,

234
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:55,120
yet instead of
making a grand comeback,

235
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,700
I have to crawl between her legs?

236
00:14:58,566 --> 00:14:59,486
Don't you think so?

237
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,586
Right, you have a point there.

238
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,620
And I'll be honest.

239
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,700
I didn't make it all the way here
because of my acting.

240
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,920
But because of my pretty face!

241
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,453
So why are they suddenly
demanding superb acting?

242
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:11,886
Don't you agree?

243
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:14,033
Yes, you're known for
your awful...

244
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:18,266
What was that just now?

245
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:20,453
Um, uh...

246
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:23,233
Well, what I mean is...
Yoon-seo, what I mean is...

247
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,786
What I mean is...

248
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:26,920
Why, that Lee Se-jin!

249
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,253
Who does she think she is,
telling you to get experience?

250
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,753
Hey, just call her up right now
and tell her you won't do it.

251
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,753
Really?

252
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,120
But Sir,

253
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,333
this may be the
last chance for Yoon-seo.

254
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,820
...Last chance?

255
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,420
Hey, what if this is
her last chance?

256
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,453
When she says she won't do it.

257
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:47,020
But... This is the first offer that
came along in two years,

258
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,020
so if we turn this one down,

259
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,620
Yoon-seo may have to
wait another two years.

260
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,320
- Another two years?
- Well, good!

261
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,453
Let's just think of this
as the Olympics.

262
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,153
How about a drama
every four years, then?

263
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:57,633
I mean, she says she won't do it,
even if I threaten her to.

264
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,466
When...

265
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,986
When did I say I can't,
even if you threaten me to?

266
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:04,986
Oh, whatever.

267
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:06,653
Just call Lee Se-jin,

268
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,553
and swear at her
until her ears bleed.

269
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:10,966
Say, 'She's not doing it,'
and slam the phone down.

270
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,200
Alright.

271
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:20,566
Wait!

272
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,000
Huh? What? Why?

273
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,233
Well... I...

274
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,353
...I'll do it.

275
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:31,433
What was that? Some baby talk?

276
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
I said, I might just do it.
Working at a law firm.

277
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:39,733
But Yoon-seo.

278
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,486
You're the Goddess, Yoon-seo!

279
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:45,153
As in, 'My goddess,' 'Our goddess,'
and 'Goddess of the Universe!'

280
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:47,853
So how could you...
We're talking about 3 months!

281
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:50,633
How could you work for
three months at a law firm?

282
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:53,720
I said I can,
so what makes you think I can't?

283
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,086
You know, uh...

284
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,586
This isn't something to
think of so lightly.

285
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,833
I'm not taking it lightly.

286
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,020
I know that
if I pass up on this chance,

287
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,953
it'll be hard for me to
make a comeback.

288
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:08,833
Besides, I can't have people
criticizing my acting forever.

289
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,320
Alright. Since you say so,

290
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,486
I'll go arrange something for you.

291
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,933
Yes, alright!

292
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:17,886
Wait a minute. Just wait!

293
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:19,653
Hold on.

294
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:21,353
Don't tell me later
you want to call it quits.

295
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:22,420
Of course not.

296
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,666
- I'd never say that.
- Alright, then!

297
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,833
(Yeon Jun-gyu, Leading Lawyer)

298
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:32,600
Work experience?

299
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:36,286
You think law firms are
an acting school?

300
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:39,620
This is a sacred place
dealing with laws.

301
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,786
If you're calling to ask me for
ridiculous favors, just hang up.

302
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:42,920
This is for Oh Yoon-seo.

303
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,453
I don't care whether she's
Oh Yoon-seo, Kim Yoon-seo

304
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:45,453
or Choi Yoon-seo,

305
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:46,786
tell her to come in here,
starting tomorrow.

306
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,720
Because I'll partner her up with
our best attorneys.

307
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,433
Do you understand me?

308
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,700
I'm only saying yes
because it's you.

309
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:54,733
No need to thank me.

310
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,586
I should thank you!

311
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,920
My goddess, your goddess,
the Goddess of the Universe!

312
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,700
Oh Yoon-seo!

313
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:06,720
Dang!

314
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,520
Oh Yoon-seo...

315
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,686
Did you hear that?

316
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:11,433
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo will...

317
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,086
Did you hear that?

318
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,720
Starting tomorrow,
Oh Yoon-seo will be working here!

319
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,920
My God!

320
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,853
Oh Yoon-seo!

321
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,300
As in my Oh Yoon-seo!

322
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,766
Gosh...

323
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,086
Hello.

324
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,633
I'm Yeon Jun-gyu,
leading lawyer at Always.

325
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:31,266
It's nice to meet you.

326
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,566
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo.

327
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:40,453
It's a pleasure.

328
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,553
I'm delighted to meet you,
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo.

329
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:43,920
Why did that seem awkward?

330
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,320
Oh, it's because we both held out
our hands at the same time.

331
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,120
Wait a minute,
now's not the time for this.

332
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,766
Let's see...

333
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,833
Who should I partner up
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo with?

334
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:58,933
Dan Mun-hee,

335
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,286
who specializes in civil lawsuits?

336
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:05,253
I only borrowed it.

337
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,966
I just didn't have the money to
pay them back, that's all.

338
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:11,120
Yes. But uh...

339
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,433
You do own a building
in Gangnam, right?

340
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,386
Do you know how much
it costs to raise kids these days?

341
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:20,533
- You don't have a kid, do you?
- No.

342
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:23,566
Anyway, I'll be in your care
from now on.

343
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,986
Sure.

344
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,320
I'll do my best to try and
cover up that

345
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,620
you have no conscience, sir.

346
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,633
What? Did you just say
I have no conscience?

347
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:36,253
- No.
- She's got no guts.

348
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,586
Whatever!

349
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,320
- You just said so.
- She's got no guts.

350
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,186
At that rate, she won't be of
any help to my Yoon-seo.

351
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:43,920
- Repeat what you said.
- No.

352
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,633
I said, repeat what you said!

353
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,420
Then... The divorce lawyer,

354
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,553
Choi Yun-hyuk?

355
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:58,420
What I mean is, even if the
fault lies with you,

356
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,366
you are still entitled to
a share of your husband's wealth.

357
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:04,800
So please don't worry.

358
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:11,566
Here.

359
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:18,320
You're all I have now, Mr. Choi.

360
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,953
People get married to be happy,

361
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:22,386
but people also get divorced

362
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:24,633
to be happy.

363
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:29,566
Are you married, Mr. Choi?

364
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:32,866
No way.

365
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:39,800
Excuse me for a second.

366
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,786
Yes, Mother.

367
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:48,366
What is it?

368
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:01,086
I sound foreign?

369
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,133
That’s because I'm at work!

370
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:05,420
The Chinese medicine?

371
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,586
Of course I already took it.

372
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,753
No, no, no.

373
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,320
No, no. No way!

374
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,653
There's just no way.

375
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:13,953
I can't have Yoon-seo work for
a mommy's boy like him.

376
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:15,986
Exactly. A mommy's boy is...

377
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,420
- ...too tiring.
- Exactly.

378
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,766
Oh jeez!

379
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,520
When did you get here?

380
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,553
Just now. By the way,

381
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,520
who is this Yoon-seo?

382
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,733
Oh.

383
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:29,820
It's nothing.

384
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,033
It's nothing.

385
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,533
(Kwon Jung-rok)

386
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,553
Or attorney Kwon Jung-rok?

387
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:41,786
As you have seen, ETRI, who holds
the highest authority in Korea,

388
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:44,286
has just submitted a report that
stands with the defendant's claims,

389
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:46,953
but not the argument by
the prosecution that

390
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:50,353
the information in question is of

391
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:52,600
economic profitability
and practicality.

392
00:21:54,866 --> 00:21:57,953
Since the information cannot be
viewed as trade secret,

393
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:01,333
we expect the Court will find
my client not guilty, Your Honor.

394
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,453
In regards to the violation of the
Unfair Competition Prevention

395
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,820
and Trade Secret Protection Act,

396
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,086
the Court finds the defendant

397
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,833
not guilty.

398
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:16,420
Though he can be a little cranky,
he's our ace

399
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,353
with the highest win rate.

400
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:20,833
So you'll go with
Mr. Kwon, will you?

401
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,400
Should I?

402
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:24,386
Oh, jeez!

403
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:28,386
So Mr. Kwon it is then, is it?

404
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:30,453
Do you even know
what this is about?

405
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:32,666
- No.
- Oh.

406
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
(Court)

407
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:01,153
Did you have something to tell me?

408
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:03,420
You've been chosen!
Congratulations.

409
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,633
Chosen for what?

410
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:06,986
So why don't you want to?

411
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:08,820
Must I put it into words?

412
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,853
I won't know unless you tell me.

413
00:23:09,933 --> 00:23:11,833
How am I supposed to know
if you won't?

414
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,720
I'm offering you
a personal assistant.

415
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,486
Not only that, she's the
Goddess of Asia!

416
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:17,186
Now how can you
not like about that?

417
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:18,786
Do you think law firms are a joke?

418
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:20,020
How am I supposed to
trust and work with someone

419
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,453
who's never been in this field?

420
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,886
Bet you didn't know, but
Yoon-seo was a law major.

421
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:26,753
Though she only completed
the first semester,

422
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:29,220
she still was a law major.

423
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,033
First semester of
her freshmen year?

424
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:34,053
Then that means she's only
a law major by title,

425
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:35,420
but hardly knows her ABC's in law!

426
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,220
Exactly! Which is why
I'm asking you to

427
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,953
help her to take the first steps.

428
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:40,533
Why should I?

429
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:44,353
I don’t see the need to
continue this conversation.

430
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:45,786
Please excuse me.

431
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:47,200
Jung-rok.

432
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,666
Mr. Kwon!

433
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,753
Please reconsider this, alright?

434
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:53,953
I told you, didn't I?

435
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:57,586
My cousin's the CEO of
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo's agency.

436
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,653
And he's been pleading.

437
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:02,320
To take her in as a secretary for

438
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,000
just three months,
no more and no less.

439
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,420
It must be heart-breaking to see
the actress you raised with your

440
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,100
own hands hit rock bottom with
no way to climb back up.

441
00:24:15,866 --> 00:24:17,020
He's been trying every mean to

442
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,853
try revive her damaged reputation,

443
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:21,766
and ended up coming to me
as a last resort.

444
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,853
Anyway, please take Yoon-seo for
just three months

445
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:32,686
and teach her what we do.

446
00:24:32,766 --> 00:24:34,020
I know you're busy,

447
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,986
but you're the only one
I can trust, you know?

448
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:38,333
No.

449
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:44,133
If you don't want to,
I guess I can't force you.

450
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:46,833
But five years ago...!

451
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,833
I wonder why I even bothered to
go out of my way for that.

452
00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:57,186
- Sir!
- Yes? What?

453
00:24:57,266 --> 00:25:00,020
How long are you going to
use that against me?

454
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,266
For eternity.

455
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:05,586
Well, unless Yoon-seo is
here in our office.

456
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:07,253
Let's sit down and
think about this, alright?

457
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,586
I'm not just straight up
asking you.

458
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:10,586
I'll double your incentives!

459
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:12,686
And what's more,

460
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:14,120
I'll help you out, a lot.

461
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,366
So please?

462
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:25,186
It's all about the
first impression.

463
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:26,520
You don't want to look
too much like a celebrity,

464
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,433
but don't want to look
ordinary at the same time.

465
00:25:29,066 --> 00:25:31,400
And man, most definitely not
a celebrity that doesn't sell.

466
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:34,453
A celebrity that doesn't sell?

467
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,986
A celebrity that sells so well!

468
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:38,400
In case you give off
the celebrity vibe too much.

469
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:41,466
Yes, that's a nice one.

470
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:44,520
Uh, Yoon-seo?

471
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,486
Are you sure you can manage
on your own, fine?

472
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:48,486
Don't worry!

473
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:50,053
I'm not some two year-old kid.

474
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,253
Right.

475
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,686
But why am I always
worried about you?

476
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:55,966
And you heard what
President Yeon said, right?

477
00:25:57,566 --> 00:25:59,466
That he won't give me
any help at all.

478
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:01,753
It's alright.
I can do this on my own, fine.

479
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,320
Do what on your own fine?

480
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,453
You can't even go to the bank
all by yourself.

481
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,753
Who goes to the bank these days?

482
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:07,920
Everyone uses apps.

483
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,720
- But you can't even drive.
- I do have a driver's license.

484
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,153
You can't even eat by yourself.

485
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:12,820
How can anyone eat by themselves?

486
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,953
Besides,

487
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:16,253
you're just so paranoid.

488
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:18,886
I mean, everyone'll be lining up
to have lunch with me,

489
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:20,486
so what's to worry?

490
00:26:20,566 --> 00:26:22,166
- Right?
- Of course.

491
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,766
I don't want to wear this.

492
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:50,466
- Good morning.
- Ah, you're here.

493
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,620
What's with that overdressed look?

494
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,620
Don't tell me you went shopping
for a celebrity?

495
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,920
I already had these at home.

496
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,153
And what's with the flowers?

497
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:06,933
I had them at home, too.

498
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:14,453
Hey, we're going to have
a new family

499
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,053
so the least we can do is
welcome her.

500
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:18,486
But I never got any flowers
when I joined the company.

501
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:19,920
Really?

502
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,753
Anyway, let me emphasize
once more,

503
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:23,686
but Ms. Oh working here is
strictly confidential.

504
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:25,320
And don't ever do
anything that will

505
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,453
make her feel uncomfortable, alright?

506
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:28,453
For example, ask her for
a photo together,

507
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:29,986
or for her autograph!

508
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,253
Don't get hyped up and
do anything unnecessary,

509
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,820
but just keep calm and act normal.

510
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,420
Just relax, and act natural.

511
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,953
You know what I mean, right?

512
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:38,820
I think you're the one
who's most hyped up about this.

513
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,266
- Oh, really?
- Ah, here he is.

514
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,600
- You're here.
- Hi.

515
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,353
Mr. Kim!

516
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,586
Once Yoon-seo is here,

517
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:48,553
Be... Well, uh...

518
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,933
Be kind to her, as you normally are.

519
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,600
God, he's so callous.

520
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,286
Yoon-seo should be here
any minute now...

521
00:27:58,366 --> 00:27:59,700
Just act normal.

522
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,166
(Oh Yoon-seo)

523
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,900
(Oh Yoon-seo/
Oh Jin-shim)

524
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:12,620
Don't sweat about it so much.

525
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,286
You know about our
internship program, right?

526
00:28:14,366 --> 00:28:15,486
Why, it's kind of like that!

527
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:18,900
It'll be like providing an overview
of how a law firm works.

528
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:22,320
- But on one condition.
- Alright!

529
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,353
Anything. Go ahead.

530
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:25,853
If she says she'll quit first,

531
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:27,333
then don't bother stopping her.

532
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,466
The deal's on!

533
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:44,753
She's late on her first day.

534
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,620
Should I have gone to pick her up
since it's her first day and all?

535
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,033
Because she's running a bit late.

536
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,433
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo is here.

537
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:12,620
She's here, she's here, she's here!

538
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,766
She's here!

539
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,733
You've all come out to greet me!

540
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:31,420
Hello, I'm Oh Yoon-seo.

541
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,020
- Hello.
- Hello.

542
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,220
I'll be in your care from now on.

543
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,020
I know I have a lot to learn,

544
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,320
but please be patient with me.

545
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,420
Of course.

546
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,233
We'll have to be,
since you're so beautiful.

547
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:46,566
Thank you.

548
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,086
Oh, so you must be
the leading lawyer here.

549
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:51,166
I am.

550
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,453
- My name is Yeon Jun-gyu.
- Oh.

551
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:56,253
I see.

552
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:57,866
It's nice to meet you, Sir.

553
00:30:58,766 --> 00:31:00,620
It's nice to meet you.
Oh, this is nothing,

554
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,420
just a small welcome gift.

555
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,020
It's out of my own pocket.

556
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,333
My goodness!

557
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:09,020
Thank you so much.

558
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,186
I didn't expect such
a warm welcome from you.

559
00:31:13,266 --> 00:31:18,053
I promise to be a diligent
member of the firm.

560
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:20,400
I will repay your kindness!

561
00:31:21,966 --> 00:31:23,153
Whoa!

562
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:25,533
That was like listening to
an award acceptance speech.

563
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:29,400
What cosmetics
do you use by the way?

564
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:33,220
Your clothes look
really expensive, too.

565
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,353
Thank you.

566
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:36,553
Then shall we go back to work?

567
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,086
Ah, sure.

568
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:40,933
What should I start with?

569
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,700
Hello, I'm Oh Yoon-seo.

570
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,753
Um, don’t you know me?

571
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,933
But I'm Oh Yoon-seo.

572
00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:05,566
I've been featured in
a lot of ads, you know.

573
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,400
Why, I even did a commercial
for this laptop.

574
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,820
My notebook,

575
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,666
your notebook. Samsung Notebook!

576
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,000
You really don't know?

577
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,400
I also modeled for this sofa.

578
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,033
The sofa is not to sit on,

579
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,886
but to be embraced by.

580
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:53,266
Sofa by Acemiss.

581
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:14,800
Don't just ignore me!

582
00:33:25,466 --> 00:33:27,620
Because I'm not
your average water,

583
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,653
but something quite special.

584
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:31,900
If you're jealous,
get some for yourself, too!

585
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:39,900
Just how long are you planning to
keep this up?

586
00:33:48,633 --> 00:33:49,800
But...

587
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:53,220
I just found it so amazing that

588
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,220
someone in this country
still doesn't know me.

589
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,320
Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

590
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,086
That's Oh Yoon-seo.

591
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:00,753
There are a few rules
you must abide by

592
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,486
now that you'll be
working with me.

593
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:03,920
The first is to be on time.

594
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,753
I despise people who are
late to work.

595
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,586
Oh, I see.

596
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,286
The second is to
get off work on time.

597
00:34:09,366 --> 00:34:10,953
I also despise people

598
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:13,620
who can't finish all their work
in their allocated time

599
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,686
And thirdly,

600
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:17,686
as my secretary,
I want you, Ms. Oh, to...

601
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:19,320
Hold on.

602
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,786
Se... Secretary?

603
00:34:21,866 --> 00:34:24,353
I thought that since you
studied law and all,

604
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:26,153
you pulled some strings to
enter this law firm that's

605
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,686
out of reach for even the
finest college graduates,

606
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:31,853
now that you're struggling to
make it after that scandal.

607
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:33,033
Oh.

608
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:37,820
So that's the story, is it?

609
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,486
Okay, I understand.

610
00:34:40,566 --> 00:34:44,533
So how should I act from now on?

611
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:47,086
Let me ask, just in case,

612
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:48,833
but do you have
any experience as a secretary?

613
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:50,986
No way.

614
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:53,653
Then do you know anything about
what we do here at a law firm?

615
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:55,466
No?

616
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:58,753
Do you know how to
take calls, at least?

617
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,720
Of course. I'm really good at it.

618
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,186
I mean, I don't let go of
the phone all day!

619
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:05,600
This one time, I had
an international call...

620
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,120
Then that'll be your duty
from today onwards.

621
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,566
When someone calls,
put them through to me.

622
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,820
Just leave it to me.

623
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,633
It's my major.

624
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:26,333
I guess he can be
a little cranky.

625
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,253
But then again, I'm sure that's
the norm among lawyers.

626
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:36,600
He could help with
my character studies.

627
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:51,933
It looks like his former secretary
was quite competent.

628
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:55,200
(Please take good care of
Attorney Kwon)

629
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,766
"Please take good care of
Attorney Kwon"

630
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,133
(Okay)

631
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:11,233
Okay!

632
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,920
Ready to start work as secretary!

633
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,820
I promise to do my best.

634
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,386
Beautiful.

635
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:31,520
President Yeon, I think she's
doing better than we thought.

636
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,933
Yes, it looks like it.

637
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:36,153
But still, do pay extra attention

638
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:37,786
until Yoon-seo is settled.

639
00:36:37,866 --> 00:36:39,220
Don't just assign her a chauffeur,

640
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,420
but you drive her to and
back from work, personally.

641
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,486
Sure.

642
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:42,686
I'm doing that now, in fact.

643
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:44,120
Good on you. And, uh...

644
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,286
Don't let the others
find out about this.

645
00:36:46,366 --> 00:36:48,020
Yoon-seo's future depends on it!

646
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,286
Exercise vigilance.

647
00:36:49,366 --> 00:36:52,200
Yes, sir. I understand.

648
00:36:56,866 --> 00:36:58,353
What? Not happy about something?

649
00:36:58,433 --> 00:36:59,386
No.

650
00:36:59,466 --> 00:37:01,486
It's just that...

651
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:03,453
I'm honestly astounded.

652
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:04,866
What's with that?

653
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,486
Why, what makes you say that?

654
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:08,786
Tell me more in detail.

655
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:11,253
You really do think of
our actors like family.

656
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:14,420
To be honest, if other companies
had an actress who generated

657
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,420
zero profit for two years running,

658
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,133
they'd already be talking about
terminating the contract.

659
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,100
So I truly admire you.

660
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:23,120
Well, I guess I'm just too humane.

661
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,053
Though I really shouldn't be,
not in this industry.

662
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:27,386
Wait a second. What's with this?

663
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:28,533
Pardon?

664
00:37:28,966 --> 00:37:30,486
Why do her clothes look
so tight on her?

665
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:33,586
Oh. Well, her appetite has
grown a bit lately...

666
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:34,620
Oh, really?

667
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,586
- Put her on a diet.
- Yes, sir!

668
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:37,653
Tell her to lose 10 kg.

669
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:38,953
- What?
- Why?

670
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:40,033
You're not happy?

671
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,066
You want to go on a diet
together with her, then?

672
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:45,333
You're truly amazing.

673
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:55,133
(President Yeon Jun-seok
Hyuk-jun)

674
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:58,886
Secretary Oh Yoon-seo,
you're looking good!

675
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:00,586
Tres bien!

676
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,220
You're emitting that
secretary aura now!

677
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,020
I'm proud of you, Yoon-seo.

678
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,700
See, when I put my mind to it,
I can do it.

679
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,886
Yes hello,

680
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:27,820
this is Attorney Kwon Jung-rok's
office at Always.

681
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,686
Yes.

682
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,500
You'd like to speak to him?

683
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,466
Sure.

684
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:38,400
Uh...

685
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:46,366
Phone!

686
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,233
What's she doing?

687
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,366
Sir.

688
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,820
What do you think you're doing?

689
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,100
The cord's too short to reach you.

690
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:10,200
Hello, this is Kwon Jung-rok.

691
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,386
Yes, I'm aware of it.

692
00:39:14,466 --> 00:39:17,420
I'll send it through by the
end of the day, once it's ready.

693
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,353
If any changes need to be made,
please contact me again.

694
00:39:19,433 --> 00:39:20,866
Alright, bye.

695
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:28,020
I think you'll need
a longer chord.

696
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,186
Don't you know how to
transfer calls internally?

697
00:39:30,266 --> 00:39:32,200
Transfer... calls?

698
00:39:36,466 --> 00:39:37,553
Forget it.

699
00:39:37,633 --> 00:39:39,566
I'll just take my own calls.

700
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:49,653
Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

701
00:39:49,733 --> 00:39:52,033
Can you make copies of this?
- Sure!

702
00:39:55,966 --> 00:39:57,353
How many copies do you want?

703
00:39:57,433 --> 00:39:58,500
- Two each.

704
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:11,633
If you'll just turn around,
I'll pick them right up.

705
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:14,400
I'll just do the
copying myself, too.

706
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:24,820
Then what should I do?

707
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,400
Just make yourself comfortable.

708
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,186
So, what does everyone
want for lunch today?

709
00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:44,686
Something delicious.

710
00:40:44,766 --> 00:40:46,100
What about ox blood soup?

711
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,666
Um... Where can I get
a drink of water?

712
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,520
Just come to me whenever
you need something.

713
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Oh.

714
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,133
Um, you're yet to
have lunch, right?

715
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:04,020
There's this fine Japanese
restaurant across the street,

716
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,920
so why don't we go for some sushi?

717
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,366
- How does sushi sound?
- We're more than happy!

718
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,686
They serve tuna fresh, not frozen!

719
00:41:11,766 --> 00:41:13,686
Fresh tuna?

720
00:41:13,766 --> 00:41:15,000
Yum.

721
00:41:20,966 --> 00:41:23,153
Too bad Ms. Oh
couldn't come with us.

722
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:24,720
Right.

723
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,820
But how nice is she,
saying she'll wait for

724
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,553
Mr. Kwon to finish work first,
since it's her first day

725
00:41:29,633 --> 00:41:31,753
working with him and all!

726
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:34,100
It's cold. Let's get moving.

727
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,920
That sushi restaurant...

728
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,853
It's the one on the
crossroads, right?

729
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:41,033
Woo-hoo! Fresh tuna!

730
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,586
I'm having flashbacks of the tuna
I had in Hokkaido last winter.

731
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:46,886
Let's go, then.

732
00:41:46,966 --> 00:41:48,386
Let's go grab kimchi stew.

733
00:41:48,466 --> 00:41:49,966
Tuna kimchi stew.

734
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,466
Oh what?

735
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,386
I'm suddenly craving
tuna kimchi stew.

736
00:41:53,466 --> 00:41:56,253
If we're going to get canned tuna,

737
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:57,720
how about tuna sandwich instead?

738
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,420
There's this nice sandwich place
across the street.

739
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,620
Ms. Dan,

740
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,933
you're crushing on the part-timer
there, are you?

741
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:07,486
Until recently, it was the second
son of the owner of

742
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,066
some pork bone soup, and
you went there every day...

743
00:42:10,733 --> 00:42:13,133
Well, we all know how
she's so quick to fall in love.

744
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:15,933
But love is fickle!

745
00:42:16,966 --> 00:42:19,220
Shall we get going, then?

746
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,000
Let's go then, for
some tuna kimchi stew.

747
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:28,533
Wait up!

748
00:42:33,566 --> 00:42:36,866
Can I really just relax
without doing anything?

749
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:40,233
Gosh, I'm hungry.

750
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:49,486
- Um, sir?
- Yes?

751
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:53,333
It's been 20 minutes into
your lunchtime.

752
00:42:55,366 --> 00:42:57,553
Oh, it's already...

753
00:42:57,633 --> 00:43:00,986
Oh, and FYI, I can't go to
crowded restaurants.

754
00:43:01,066 --> 00:43:02,100
And?

755
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,420
Oh, I'm seeing
someone for lunch today.

756
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,720
You'll have to go to
lunch alone today.

757
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,520
But I can't!

758
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,520
Why can't you?

759
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,700
I can't go to the
restaurant by myself.

760
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,620
- Why can't you?
- Why can't I?

761
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,986
How can you expect me to
eat by myself?

762
00:43:16,066 --> 00:43:18,653
People are already talking
because of that scandal,

763
00:43:18,733 --> 00:43:19,920
so what would they say next

764
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,653
when they catch me having lunch,
all by myself, looking pitiful?

765
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,653
How does having lunch by yourself
make you look pitiful?

766
00:43:24,733 --> 00:43:26,820
I have lunch by myself,
almost every day.

767
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,053
But I'm not you, am I?

768
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:30,853
I'm Oh Yoon-seo!

769
00:43:30,933 --> 00:43:34,133
The Korean Wave Star
who once conquered all of Asia!

770
00:43:34,566 --> 00:43:37,153
So how can I eat by myself
at a restaurant?

771
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:38,900
Then get something delivered.

772
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,853
He's really gone?

773
00:43:43,933 --> 00:43:45,200
And left me behind?

774
00:43:51,766 --> 00:43:53,386
If Ms. Oh had come with us,

775
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:57,020
we would've had fresh tuna...

776
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,586
By the way,

777
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:00,486
doesn't Oh Yoon-seo look amazing
in real life?

778
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:01,886
Seeing her face for real
up so close

779
00:44:01,966 --> 00:44:04,153
after seeing it on TV every day...

780
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:06,520
I thought I was watching a drama!

781
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,586
Mr. Choi.

782
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:09,453
- You know what?
- What?

783
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:11,900
We can watch that drama again
very soon.

784
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:14,353
So why don't we watch the
whole series through together?

785
00:44:14,433 --> 00:44:15,633
Sir!

786
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:18,586
Here, have some tuna.

787
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:19,620
Sure.

788
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,800
But don't you find it strange?

789
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,853
I mean, many celebrities are
on private Internet channels

790
00:44:24,933 --> 00:44:26,086
or run online shopping malls

791
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:28,120
if they're not on TV.

792
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,220
But a secretary at a law firm is
totally out of the blue!

793
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,633
Right. Why did she suddenly
want an average life?

794
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,253
I wonder why.

795
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,333
I know!

796
00:44:37,433 --> 00:44:38,986
I heard she was a law major.

797
00:44:39,066 --> 00:44:42,120
Maybe this is what she wanted
before she became famous.

798
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,153
Right. She was, yes.

799
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:46,153
That must be the reason, then.
What else can it be?

800
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:48,953
Eat up, the stew's getting cold.

801
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:50,100
There's hardly any soup left.

802
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:54,920
I'm hungry.

803
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,333
There must be
something to eat in here.

804
00:45:03,933 --> 00:45:05,953
What, nothing?

805
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:07,420
What's with the employee welfare?

806
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,166
Not even a single
chocolate cookie?

807
00:45:14,766 --> 00:45:16,100
Should I have one of
these at least, then?

808
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,320
Gosh, I'm hungry.

809
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,900
Are you hot water?

810
00:46:05,633 --> 00:46:07,953
What are you doing over there?

811
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:10,300
I was just watering the plants.

812
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,353
Who are you?

813
00:46:15,433 --> 00:46:17,220
I'm Lee Du-seob.

814
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,466
Mr. Scary... I mean, Mr. Lee.

815
00:46:22,566 --> 00:46:23,653
Hello.

816
00:46:23,733 --> 00:46:25,820
Are you here to consult
with someone?

817
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,866
No, I'm not here for
a consultation.

818
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,500
I'm a para...

819
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,386
Oh, you have something
against this place, do you?

820
00:46:34,466 --> 00:46:36,386
- You're here to file a complaint.
- No, it's not that.

821
00:46:36,466 --> 00:46:38,853
Hey, hey, hey...!

822
00:46:38,933 --> 00:46:40,133
Mr. Lee.

823
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,220
- You're here.
- Yes.

824
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,433
Did you have lunch yet?

825
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:45,620
I did, yes.

826
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,720
Yoon-seo,

827
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,433
this is our paralegal.

828
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,420
Hello, I'm Lee Du-seob.

829
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,186
Oh.

830
00:46:53,266 --> 00:46:55,953
Hello, I'm Oh Yoon-seo.

831
00:46:56,033 --> 00:46:57,166
What...

832
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,166
Job's Tears Tea?

833
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,653
But that's not you, Yoon-seo.

834
00:47:03,733 --> 00:47:05,500
The perfect drink
after lunch is...

835
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,386
...caramel macchiato.

836
00:47:08,466 --> 00:47:10,933
Oh, thank you.

837
00:47:19,733 --> 00:47:21,666
(Maeum Sushi)

838
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,486
How can you expect me to
eat by myself?

839
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:28,286
People are already talking
because of that scandal,

840
00:47:28,366 --> 00:47:29,520
so what would they say next

841
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,633
when they catch me having lunch,
all by myself, looking pitiful?

842
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,986
Mr. Kwon.

843
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,033
You still haven't had lunch?

844
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,033
Oh, it's not for me...

845
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:52,020
Everyone's having a bit of
a chat with Ms. Oh.

846
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,786
But it would've been nicer to
have someone with experience,

847
00:47:53,866 --> 00:47:56,400
who's more of a help to you.

848
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:05,120
Um, Ms. Yang.

849
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,120
What's this?

850
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,686
Well, this is caramel arigatou... Wait.

851
00:48:08,766 --> 00:48:09,686
Mara...?

852
00:48:09,766 --> 00:48:10,753
You mean, caramel macchiato?

853
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:12,086
Why, what about it?

854
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:14,986
Well, I'd bought it for myself

855
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:17,386
but suddenly I just don't
feel like it anymore.

856
00:48:17,466 --> 00:48:18,420
- Um...
- If you don't want it, I...

857
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,886
Oh, no. I'll take it.

858
00:48:19,966 --> 00:48:21,433
It'll be a waste, if I didn't.

859
00:48:27,233 --> 00:48:28,353
I mean it!

860
00:48:28,433 --> 00:48:31,553
I almost gave up my bar exam,
because of you.

861
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:32,986
What, really?

862
00:48:33,066 --> 00:48:35,586
But I wasn't so easily broken.

863
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:38,253
I passed the exam safely,
so here I am now.

864
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,633
And I became a man.

865
00:48:41,766 --> 00:48:42,853
I see.

866
00:48:42,933 --> 00:48:44,053
That's truly admirable.

867
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:46,853
My mother has always told me,

868
00:48:46,933 --> 00:48:48,020
manners

869
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,220
maketh

870
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,366
man.

871
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,553
Only then will you meet
a fine woman, she said.

872
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:55,366
And I believe my chance has
finally arrived.

873
00:49:05,466 --> 00:49:06,733
Oh, you're back.

874
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,120
Yoon-seo, how about some coffee?

875
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,653
Oh, so everyone's here.

876
00:49:10,733 --> 00:49:12,120
Even Mr. Kwon.

877
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,700
Oh, that's right.
This is your office.

878
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:16,966
I had it in my house, so...

879
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:18,653
Want some coffee?

880
00:49:18,733 --> 00:49:19,753
I'm alright.

881
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:22,020
Everyone, please go
back to your work.

882
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,720
What, already?

883
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,900
But I only just got here.

884
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,653
I think it's time to
go back to work.

885
00:49:30,733 --> 00:49:31,920
Let's get back to work!

886
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,500
- Yes.
- Manners maketh man.

887
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:36,333
Here, some coffee for you.

888
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:46,500
Um...

889
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:51,420
What should I do in the afternoon?

890
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,020
What can you do?

891
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,786
- Pardon?
- Just kill some time.

892
00:49:55,866 --> 00:49:58,153
There seems to be many
who are your fans,

893
00:49:58,233 --> 00:50:00,153
so have some coffee with them
over a chat.

894
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:01,686
However,

895
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:03,733
not in my office, please.

896
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,066
Excuse me.

897
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,286
Did I do something wrong?

898
00:50:17,366 --> 00:50:18,353
I've been starving until now,

899
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:20,653
waiting for you to come back.

900
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:22,853
Yet the first thing you do is
get mad at me,

901
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:23,920
when the least you could do is
say sorry!

902
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,233
What do you have
against me, anyway?

903
00:50:29,066 --> 00:50:30,220
Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

904
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,886
That's Oh Yoon-seo!

905
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:33,333
This is a workplace.

906
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,620
- What?
- I don't know

907
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,253
what your boss has told you,

908
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:38,453
but this is not a place
where you can just

909
00:50:38,533 --> 00:50:40,120
hang out and chill all day.

910
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,453
You came here on
your own free will to work,

911
00:50:42,533 --> 00:50:44,520
so the least you could do is
not get in the way of

912
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,120
people who are
whole-hearted about their work.

913
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,686
I never intended to get in
anyone's way.

914
00:50:50,766 --> 00:50:52,286
Let me take this chance to
be honest with you,

915
00:50:52,366 --> 00:50:55,486
but I don't find people who
take their work lightly welcoming.

916
00:50:55,566 --> 00:50:56,920
Though you're famous enough to be
on TV,

917
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,786
that's a separate matter
from this law firm.

918
00:50:58,866 --> 00:51:02,086
So I do hope that
you'll come to your senses.

919
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:05,386
Come to my senses?

920
00:51:05,466 --> 00:51:06,533
Yes.

921
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:10,700
You know,

922
00:51:13,466 --> 00:51:15,686
I'm not here to just
fool around here, either!

923
00:51:15,766 --> 00:51:18,500
You say that, when you're
dressed like that?

924
00:51:20,866 --> 00:51:23,586
I didn't even have the
chance to prove myself,

925
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:27,966
so isn't it prejudice to
judge me by my clothes?

926
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:31,886
I guess you're right.
It is prejudice.

927
00:51:31,966 --> 00:51:33,286
And like you said,
I'm also aware that

928
00:51:33,366 --> 00:51:35,920
it's too early to make
judgments on anyone.

929
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,953
But Ms. Oh Jin-shim.

930
00:51:38,033 --> 00:51:40,053
Shouldn't you have at least
come to work on time so

931
00:51:40,133 --> 00:51:42,700
people won't hold such
prejudice against you?

932
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,353
- But that's...
- If you are really serious

933
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:47,253
about working as a secretary
under me, albeit temporary,

934
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:49,353
then start by dressing properly.

935
00:51:49,433 --> 00:51:50,353
Or

936
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:52,666
you can just fool around here
for the next three months.

937
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:08,966
What's with that cocky bastard?

938
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:13,253
I mean, I didn't know I'd be
working as a secretary!

939
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:15,720
If I'd known, I wouldn't have
dressed like this!

940
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,253
And it's not like
I wanted to be late.

941
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:20,533
Hyuk-jun told me
I just had to come in by 10!

942
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,186
Like he knows anything about me!

943
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,200
I'm not going to let this pass!

944
00:52:29,466 --> 00:52:30,466
Yes.

945
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,166
Like she'd last more than a week.

946
00:52:34,866 --> 00:52:37,433
She'll probably call it quits,
even as early as tomorrow.

947
00:52:37,933 --> 00:52:40,600
In other words,
there's just no saving her.

948
00:52:42,733 --> 00:52:44,120
No saving me?

949
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,466
Yes, no saving her.

950
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:51,120
The evidence is clear
but she's still denying it,

951
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,700
and it's driving me crazy.

952
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,253
Still, it's not like
she can hold out any longer.

953
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:58,420
Anyway, I'm in your debt.

954
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,486
Thanks to you,
I managed to secure evidence.

955
00:53:00,566 --> 00:53:01,933
Don't mention what?

956
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:05,220
By the way, when did you say
you're coming to Seoul?

957
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,820
What, the day after tomorrow?

958
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:07,853
Does Yeo-reum know?

959
00:53:07,933 --> 00:53:09,020
No.

960
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,353
Still don't know.

961
00:53:10,433 --> 00:53:12,086
Really?

962
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:14,300
Well, you two sort out
your own matters.

963
00:53:15,966 --> 00:53:17,353
I have a trial coming up.

964
00:53:17,433 --> 00:53:18,520
Yes, I'll talk to you later.

965
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,853
Let's hold a party to
celebrate your return, soon.

966
00:53:19,933 --> 00:53:21,000
Alright.

967
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,633
Excuse me.

968
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:44,786
Can I talk to you for a second?

969
00:53:44,866 --> 00:53:46,566
I have to be in Court.

970
00:53:47,033 --> 00:53:47,986
- But I have...
- When it's six,

971
00:53:48,066 --> 00:53:49,366
you can just go home.

972
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:58,086
I've never met
such a cranky bastard!

973
00:53:58,166 --> 00:53:59,453
What, the fact I was late?

974
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:00,620
That I was dressed like this?

975
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,286
Fine, so he has a reason to be
displeased with me.

976
00:54:02,366 --> 00:54:04,386
But then, teach me!

977
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:06,186
I mean, I'm there to learn!

978
00:54:06,266 --> 00:54:07,586
But here he is,

979
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:09,286
not happy when I'm working,

980
00:54:09,366 --> 00:54:11,020
and not happy
when I'm just relaxing, either!

981
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,453
What does he want, then?

982
00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:16,420
Exactly. Hey, what does
he want you to do?

983
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,520
Because what the hell?

984
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,820
What does he have
against you, anyway?

985
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,153
Oh, I don't know.

986
00:54:21,233 --> 00:54:23,953
I guess he detests
my very existence.

987
00:54:24,033 --> 00:54:25,853
Hold on. He...

988
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:27,686
So he hates you, Oh Yoon-seo?

989
00:54:27,766 --> 00:54:30,020
That I can't understand.

990
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,020
Unless he's not into women,

991
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,820
he can't not hate you.

992
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,420
Exactly!

993
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,053
I'm so pissed off!

994
00:54:36,133 --> 00:54:37,220
Who cares about the drama,

995
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,553
I think I'll just call it quits!

996
00:54:38,633 --> 00:54:41,220
Come on, Yoon-seo. Don't say that!

997
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,853
You're pretty and nice,
so hang in there.

998
00:54:43,933 --> 00:54:46,620
I can't! My patience has
reached its limit.

999
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,353
I really can't do this anymore!

1000
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:50,600
Cut! I'm telling you, cut!

1001
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,133
How come you've always yelled that
out, and not the director?

1002
00:54:56,766 --> 00:54:59,053
Cut! Yes, cut!

1003
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:01,100
I'll give him a good lecture.

1004
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:03,566
What if he's a lawyer, right?

1005
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,520
Yes?

1006
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,253
Sorry, we're filming right now.

1007
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:14,553
Could you bear with us
for a moment?

1008
00:55:14,633 --> 00:55:16,033
Oh, sure.

1009
00:55:18,966 --> 00:55:21,586
I was nice to you,
when we were dating.

1010
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:24,886
I said I wanted to sleep with you,
not date you.

1011
00:55:24,966 --> 00:55:28,533
What, did they rent out the
streets or something?

1012
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:32,466
Tsk, must be tough.

1013
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,853
Filming outdoors in winter is
no easy work.

1014
00:55:34,933 --> 00:55:37,000
Cut! That was great!

1015
00:55:37,466 --> 00:55:41,133
- Thank you everyone.
- Thank you everyone.

1016
00:55:44,666 --> 00:55:45,933
Thank you.

1017
00:57:03,933 --> 00:57:07,900
You're so beautiful, Yoon-seo.

1018
00:57:21,133 --> 00:57:22,586
Please just listen to me.

1019
00:57:22,666 --> 00:57:24,720
Let go of me!

1020
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,853
Let go! Let go of me!

1021
00:57:26,933 --> 00:57:27,920
I said, let go!

1022
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,966
Let go of me, let go!

1023
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:35,253
Go on, slap me.

1024
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:36,586
That would hurt less.

1025
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:37,820
Ha!

1026
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,566
How can you cheat on me?

1027
00:57:41,366 --> 00:57:43,920
How could you love two women

1028
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,286
when you have one heart?

1029
00:57:46,366 --> 00:57:48,486
I made a mistake.

1030
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:49,900
Please forgive me.

1031
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,933
Forgive you?

1032
00:57:55,266 --> 00:57:56,920
Haha... Don’t make me laugh.

1033
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,933
I'll never forgive you!

1034
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:42,300
Brrr, it's cold.

1035
00:58:45,966 --> 00:58:47,700
Maybe she's not up yet?

1036
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:54,133
Yoon-seo?

1037
00:58:57,566 --> 00:58:58,933
Yoon-seo, are you still in bed?

1038
00:59:01,966 --> 00:59:03,166
Yoon-seo?

1039
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:09,420
Yoon-seo.

1040
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,953
Oh Yoon-seo!

1041
00:59:11,033 --> 00:59:12,400
Yoon-seo, wake up!

1042
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:17,253
Hey, Hyuk-jun.

1043
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:19,053
You slept out here?

1044
00:59:19,133 --> 00:59:21,020
- Yeah.
- Why?

1045
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,986
But you never once
came into the study

1046
00:59:23,066 --> 00:59:25,720
not ever since you moved.

1047
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,100
I was looking for something.

1048
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:30,986
- What's the time?
- Um...

1049
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:33,853
- Seven-thirty.
- What?

1050
00:59:33,933 --> 00:59:35,733
- What?
- Why?

1051
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,420
Why did you only wake me up now?

1052
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,453
You should've come earlier!

1053
00:59:40,533 --> 00:59:41,986
Oh no, what am I going to do?

1054
00:59:42,066 --> 00:59:44,133
- What is it?
- I'm late!

1055
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,853
Oh what?

1056
00:59:45,933 --> 00:59:48,100
Just yesterday, she said
she was going to quit!

1057
00:59:50,266 --> 00:59:51,866
(Duties of a legal secretary)

1058
00:59:52,866 --> 00:59:54,166
(Things to bring
Tasks for this morning)

1059
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,286
She looked this up all night?

1060
00:59:58,366 --> 00:59:59,933
Voluntarily?

1061
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,033
Yoon-seo, are you sure
you're alright?

1062
01:00:07,866 --> 01:00:09,220
Good luck today, Yoon-seo.

1063
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,020
- You can do it!
- Bye!

1064
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,166
Bye!

1065
01:00:25,466 --> 01:00:26,733
Wait!

1066
01:00:28,933 --> 01:00:30,300
Thank you.

1067
01:00:38,866 --> 01:00:39,820
Good morning!

1068
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,033
Good morning.

1069
01:00:42,933 --> 01:00:43,933
Hey, Yoon-seo...

1070
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,300
Safe!

1071
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,553
I'm not late.

1072
01:00:52,633 --> 01:00:54,120
- Not bad.
- You think so?

1073
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,486
Do you think I have a chance?

1074
01:00:55,566 --> 01:00:57,000
I think it's worth taking it on.

1075
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,553
Thank goodness.

1076
01:00:59,633 --> 01:01:02,153
Thanks for sparing your time,
I know you're busy.

1077
01:01:02,233 --> 01:01:04,486
I mean, this is attorney
Kwon Jung-rok we're talking about.

1078
01:01:04,566 --> 01:01:06,320
Well, this isn't just anybody else

1079
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,853
but you, we're talking about.

1080
01:01:07,933 --> 01:01:09,786
What was that just now?
My heart just skipped a beat.

1081
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:10,933
Whatever.

1082
01:01:11,966 --> 01:01:15,620
Just kidding. Besides, I guess
that's more your line.

1083
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,286
- What?
- I heard everything.

1084
01:01:17,366 --> 01:01:19,433
So you have an outstanding beauty
as your new secretary, huh?

1085
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,253
Who did you hear it from?

1086
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:24,253
Jun-gyu?

1087
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:27,153
No, I bumped into
Yun-hyuk at Court yesterday.

1088
01:01:27,233 --> 01:01:29,220
He can never keep
his mouth shut as always.

1089
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,753
And he promised to
keep it a secret.

1090
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:33,120
Don't worry, I'll keep it a secret.

1091
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,553
So, how is it? Working with
Asia's sweetheart, I mean.

1092
01:01:35,633 --> 01:01:38,700
Is it like walking on clouds?

1093
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:42,253
More like walking on thin ice,

1094
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:44,620
not clouds.

1095
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,020
What?

1096
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,400
You don't want to know.

1097
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,053
Huh? Hello, Ms. Yang.

1098
01:01:51,133 --> 01:01:52,886
Ah, hello.

1099
01:01:52,966 --> 01:01:54,953
Would you like me to
make you some coffee?

1100
01:01:55,033 --> 01:01:56,500
No, it's alright.

1101
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,053
You know, I was surprised to
see you here as a secretary.

1102
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:03,986
I did hear that
you were a law major,

1103
01:02:04,066 --> 01:02:06,153
but didn't you get
kicked out of school?

1104
01:02:06,233 --> 01:02:08,453
Who said such a thing?

1105
01:02:08,533 --> 01:02:10,420
I quit on my own will.

1106
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,253
- Did you?
- Yes.

1107
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:13,720
By the way, Yoon-seo.

1108
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,653
Oh. Since I'm older than you,
I can just call you

1109
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:19,420
- Yoon-seo, right?
- Sure, go ahead.

1110
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,286
Maybe you're clueless because
it's your first time as a secretary,

1111
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:27,053
but a legal secretary isn't just
someone who runs errands.

1112
01:02:27,133 --> 01:02:30,320
You're more of a partner,
and not just a secretary.

1113
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,620
So I hope you'll do more to

1114
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,833
assist Mr. Kwon.

1115
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,186
Oh, now I know.

1116
01:02:39,266 --> 01:02:40,253
If you do know now...

1117
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:41,320
Ms. Yang, have you heard of

1118
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,120
- the TV series, Mad Men?
- Pardon?

1119
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,253
I watched it because the directors
recommended it to me,

1120
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:49,553
but I found it a real bore.

1121
01:02:49,633 --> 01:02:54,720
Anyway, there's this character
who's exactly like you,

1122
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,320
who's the eldest of
all the secretaries,

1123
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,886
and so lectures the
others all day!

1124
01:02:59,966 --> 01:03:03,053
So you're one of
those types, are you?

1125
01:03:03,133 --> 01:03:04,586
What do you mean,
I'm one of those types?

1126
01:03:04,666 --> 01:03:06,353
Okay, I understand you.

1127
01:03:06,433 --> 01:03:08,053
Thanks for the advice.

1128
01:03:08,133 --> 01:03:11,900
I'm really going to do my best!

1129
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,820
When the phone rings,

1130
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,420
I pick up,

1131
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,753
and I say, 'Yes, I'll transfer you
over to Jung-rok,'

1132
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:31,286
and press star,

1133
01:03:31,366 --> 01:03:32,633
and number two.

1134
01:03:34,466 --> 01:03:36,500
Then just put the phone down,
and...

1135
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,333
Yes!

1136
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,533
Call transfer, clear!

1137
01:03:42,533 --> 01:03:43,520
(Tasks for this morning)

1138
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,620
(1. Master call transfers)

1139
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:45,766
(Check)

1140
01:03:47,433 --> 01:03:50,386
Okay! Now do as I just taught you.

1141
01:03:50,466 --> 01:03:51,466
Sure.

1142
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:55,653
First, select paper size,

1143
01:03:55,733 --> 01:03:57,653
then two copies.

1144
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:00,066
Then press start!

1145
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,686
It's really working!

1146
01:04:03,766 --> 01:04:05,366
Thank you so much!

1147
01:04:07,633 --> 01:04:09,453
If you're really grateful,

1148
01:04:09,533 --> 01:04:12,086
I'd really appreciate it
if you'll share with me

1149
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:13,586
what cosmetic brands you use.

1150
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:15,100
Oh, um...

1151
01:04:16,066 --> 01:04:17,466
She didn't even stay to listen.

1152
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,166
Copier's been cleared,

1153
01:04:27,766 --> 01:04:29,266
so what next?

1154
01:04:33,033 --> 01:04:34,920
Ah, Mr. Kwon!

1155
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,220
Back from Court?

1156
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,320
Yes, well...

1157
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,653
That's right. I forgot to
mention it yesterday.

1158
01:04:40,733 --> 01:04:43,120
We're holding a welcome party
for Yoon-seo.

1159
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,953
Everyone will be there,
so don't be late.

1160
01:04:46,033 --> 01:04:47,353
Why even bother when

1161
01:04:47,433 --> 01:04:48,653
she'll only stay for 3 months?

1162
01:04:48,733 --> 01:04:50,453
Because everyone wants to.

1163
01:04:50,533 --> 01:04:52,386
She'll be here for
just three months,

1164
01:04:52,466 --> 01:04:55,120
so they want to treasure
every second we have with her.

1165
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,586
And you know, they're right.

1166
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:59,753
I guess that means we ought to
give her a huge welcome.

1167
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:01,720
- So you're coming, right?
- I have to meet a client.

1168
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,900
Yes, I know.

1169
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:04,853
And I know that
you'll be done early, too.

1170
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:06,733
You're not going to drink anyway.

1171
01:05:07,766 --> 01:05:09,786
I am going to drink.
And I might just get drunk.

1172
01:05:09,866 --> 01:05:11,253
What, really?

1173
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:12,286
That's great!

1174
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,186
Because it's easier on us to
have you around drunk,

1175
01:05:14,266 --> 01:05:17,286
then have you sober.

1176
01:05:17,366 --> 01:05:19,533
- What?
- The elevator's here. Let's go.

1177
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,253
Ah, you're here, Mr. Kwon.

1178
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:27,466
Yes, well...

1179
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,886
You're late today.

1180
01:05:30,966 --> 01:05:32,020
I was out at Court.

1181
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:34,933
Oh, so you were at Court.

1182
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:40,920
You look modest today.

1183
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,733
Oh, really?

1184
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:54,220
What is it?

1185
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,353
- Sorry?
- Didn’t you follow me in here

1186
01:05:55,433 --> 01:05:57,420
because you had something to say?

1187
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,720
Um...

1188
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:03,966
I did a little tidying up
while you were gone.

1189
01:06:08,766 --> 01:06:12,733
There were all these papers
all over the desk,

1190
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,220
so I tidied them up
as neatly as I can,

1191
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,533
since a neat environment
helps you to concentrate.

1192
01:06:21,933 --> 01:06:22,853
Ms. Oh Jin-shim...

1193
01:06:22,933 --> 01:06:25,120
That's Oh Yoon-seo,
not Oh Jin-shim!

1194
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,620
Why do something I never
even asked you to do?

1195
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:28,853
Pardon?

1196
01:06:28,933 --> 01:06:31,553
Now the papers have been mixed up.

1197
01:06:31,633 --> 01:06:34,920
And I can't see the documents
I need to review right now.

1198
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,386
Oh no!

1199
01:06:36,466 --> 01:06:37,453
If you'll tell me what that is,

1200
01:06:37,533 --> 01:06:38,720
I'll find it right now, and...

1201
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,366
Why lay your hands on someone
else's stuff in the first place?

1202
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,253
I just... It was so messy, and...

1203
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:47,220
It may have seemed messy to you,

1204
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,686
but I had them organized
in my own little way.

1205
01:06:48,766 --> 01:06:50,920
Have you forgotten? I told you to
just kill some time

1206
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,233
if you have nothing to do!

1207
01:06:53,266 --> 01:06:55,500
Aren't you a little harsh?

1208
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:57,853
I was only trying my best,

1209
01:06:57,933 --> 01:07:00,686
so do you have to
get so mad at me?

1210
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:04,120
Fine, I admit there's not much
I can do,

1211
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,966
but at least I try,
when you teach me.

1212
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,333
Whatever, you may leave.

1213
01:07:21,533 --> 01:07:22,733
Excuse me.

1214
01:07:24,933 --> 01:07:26,533
I mean you, Mr. Kwon.

1215
01:07:28,566 --> 01:07:30,520
Are you...

1216
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,866
...not interested in women?

1217
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,420
What?

1218
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,853
So what I mean is,

1219
01:07:37,933 --> 01:07:38,966
are you into...

1220
01:07:40,933 --> 01:07:43,733
Are you not into women?

1221
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,733
I'm sorry to
disappoint you, but...

1222
01:07:51,066 --> 01:07:52,520
What are you doing?

1223
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,633
I...

1224
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,186
I'm into women.

1225
01:07:57,266 --> 01:07:59,033
I'm very into women.

1226
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,066
Extremely into women.

1227
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:05,700
It's just that...

1228
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,333
I'm not interested in you,
whatsoever.

1229
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,600
(Thank you to Jang Ki-yong for
his special cameo appearance)

1230
01:08:51,566 --> 01:08:53,133
(Touch Your Heart)

1231
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,486
You cocky bastard!

1232
01:08:55,566 --> 01:08:58,286
Please don't touch my desk
from now on.

1233
01:08:58,366 --> 01:09:00,320
- Then...
- Then? Then?

1234
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,886
Perfect looks, perfect personality!

1235
01:09:02,966 --> 01:09:05,133
I'm not drunk!

1236
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:08,033
That... That's him!

1237
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,620
You sort out your own affairs.

1238
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,753
Why? Yeo-reum likes you,
doesn't she?

1239
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:15,420
I wonder what her relationship is
to that chaebol.

1240
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,433
I mean, it's true that
she was there with him.

1241
01:09:19,566 --> 01:09:23,100
I'd like to offer you the chance to
work as my secretary.

1242
01:09:24,533 --> 01:09:27,300
Let's start again from
the very beginning.
