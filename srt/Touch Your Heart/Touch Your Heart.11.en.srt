1
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,200
(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:01,166
Are you alright, Ms. Oh Jin-sim?

3
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,033
Don't get out, Mr. Kwon.

4
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,500
What is it?

5
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:54,800
I asked you, what is it?

6
00:01:57,766 --> 00:02:00,300
I mistook you for someone else.

7
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:04,433
I thought you were someone I knew,
but my mistake.

8
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,333
Mr. Kwon.

9
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:44,700
Are you alright?

10
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:50,666
What did he say?

11
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,500
Why did he say
he was following us?

12
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:58,133
He said he had the wrong person.

13
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,533
No, he had the right person.

14
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:07,000
He was following me.

15
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,033
- He's...
- I know.

16
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:15,586
He's...

17
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,033
He's someone who gave you
a hard time, I know.

18
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:24,900
That's why I didn't want to
let him go like that.

19
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,553
Seeing how you're the only one
who's happy has

20
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,520
made me feel betrayed.

21
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,333
I'll be there,
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo.

22
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,066
Don't, Mr. Kwon.

23
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:59,053
I...

24
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,900
I don't want to provoke him.

25
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,100
I just don't want to be
involved with him anymore.

26
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:41,233
(Episode 11)

27
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,900
Thank you for taking me home.

28
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:51,466
Sure.

29
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,853
I feel uneasy
leaving you all alone here.

30
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:24,866
May I stay here tonight?

31
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,400
At first, he...

32
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,833
He approached me,
saying that he was my fan.

33
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,753
Mr. Lee Kang-joon,

34
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,886
Thank you so much.

35
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:59,053
So you're considering casting
Yoon-seo for

36
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:02,286
Director Han Sang-cheol's
blockbuster movie!

37
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:03,400
Yes.

38
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,586
I'm personally a big fan of
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo,

39
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,086
but my personal feelings aside,

40
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,453
I thought she would be

41
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:12,086
a great fit in this movie.

42
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,153
Well, that calls for celebrations!

43
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,900
Let me pour you a drink.

44
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:22,086
- Allow me to as well.
- Ah, yes.

45
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,266
It'll be my honor.

46
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:39,733
Yoon-seo.

47
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:42,820
Have a drink.

48
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,666
Oh, but I don't really...

49
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,133
Go on.

50
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,133
Yoon-seo.

51
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,400
Are you alright?

52
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:20,100
Have a drink.

53
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,766
Where...

54
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,433
Where am I?

55
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:49,866
You're finally up?

56
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,466
But where's your smile?

57
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,833
I was so happy, you see.

58
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,500
Since I got to

59
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,766
watch over my girl all night.

60
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,066
I'll have to get going.

61
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,920
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

62
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,553
-Thank you everyone.
- Thank you.

63
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:27,686
You know, I've never seen
a finer teamwork elsewhere.

64
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,666
I was in awe, the whole time!

65
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:31,686
Yoon-seo.

66
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,400
The Director's looking for you.

67
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,166
- What, now?
- Yes.

68
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:36,566
- Go on.
- Alright.

69
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:43,286
I...

70
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:46,000
I shouldn't have
followed him back then...

71
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:51,266
Director?

72
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:06,353
What do you think you're doing?

73
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:07,500
Yoon-seo.

74
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,533
I love you.

75
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,033
What are you talking about?

76
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,866
What do I have to do so that...

77
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,900
...you know how much I love you?

78
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,400
Why do you look so scared?

79
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:30,253
I said I love you.

80
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,600
I love you!

81
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,620
We're the Anti-drug Division of
the Gangnam Police Station.

82
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,220
Mr. Lee Kang-joon,

83
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,153
you are under arrest under
suspicions of

84
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,833
illegal substance abuse.

85
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:43,800
Yoon-seo!

86
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,466
Let go of me!

87
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:47,066
Let go!

88
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,253
- Stop it.
- Let go of me!

89
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,533
Yoon-seo!

90
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:53,420
And that's...

91
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,033
...the story
behind my drug scandal.

92
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:57,766
And although...

93
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:02,200
Although I tested negative
and was cleared of all suspicions,

94
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,420
just because I was there...

95
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,600
I had to suffer from the rumors.

96
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,666
I'm innocent.

97
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:17,733
I was being stalked.

98
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,500
No matter how much I tried to
explain myself,

99
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:24,733
no one would listen to me.

100
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,666
And the media kept spewing
malicious articles about me,

101
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,800
and I just...

102
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,166
I just couldn't bear it anymore.

103
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:45,300
I thought I was going to collapse.

104
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:47,300
So I...

105
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,566
I just stopped there.

106
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:52,800
Back then, I...

107
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,933
Not only was I scared of him
who put me into this mess,

108
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,766
but of the people
who turned their backs against me,

109
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,520
and those people who were
creating malicious rumors, too.

110
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,466
They just terrified me.

111
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:18,133
You don't need to tell me anymore.

112
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:20,653
No,

113
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:22,200
I...

114
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:28,300
I wanted to tell you someday.

115
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,600
So that

116
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,166
you won't misunderstand me.

117
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:49,800
No.

118
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,700
I won't ever do such a thing.

119
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,366
So you don't have to worry.

120
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,053
You should go to bed, too.

121
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:19,686
I will.

122
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:22,300
But after I see you fall asleep.

123
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:26,120
I...

124
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,933
I'd never been able to tell
anyone about this,

125
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,100
but now that I have told you,

126
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:40,133
I feel much better.

127
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:43,266
Do you remember what I said before?

128
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:46,753
That it's the offenders
who should be left to suffer,

129
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,400
not the victims.

130
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:52,086
And that we should forget
all the bad memories,

131
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,266
and be happier than
anyone else out there.

132
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,853
Yes.

133
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:58,200
I do remember.

134
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,300
Well, I'm going to make sure
it goes that way for you.

135
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,066
I'll make you happier than
anyone else in this world.

136
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:09,453
So let's not fear anything,

137
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:11,900
and try to overcome this. Together.

138
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,686
Ah, Mr. Kwon. You're up.

139
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:25,766
Yes.

140
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,853
What are you doing?

141
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:30,953
What else?

142
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:32,833
Cooking breakfast.

143
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:36,666
You need to have breakfast
before you go to work.

144
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:47,286
Oh, I'm making bean paste stew.
You don't mind it, right?

145
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:49,700
- No.
- Would you like to have a taste?

146
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,886
- Oh.
- Ah!

147
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,220
Delicious, huh?

148
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,653
Aren't you at a fine restaurant?

149
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:11,600
Yes, this place does
very good bean paste stew.

150
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:14,386
But I'm going to keep this
information to myself.

151
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:17,020
Alright. Let's eat,

152
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,253
drop by your place
so you can get changed,

153
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,853
and go into the office together.

154
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:21,933
Alright.

155
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,766
Okay, now just add in the tofu...

156
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You know,

157
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:42,353
I'm going to overcome this.

158
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,233
With you, Mr. Kwon.

159
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:50,833
(Prosecution Service)

160
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,953
As you can see,

161
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:54,420
Mr. Jung Ji-ho has clearly been
embezzling funds.

162
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,686
Tens of millions have been
flowing into his pockets!

163
00:15:57,766 --> 00:15:59,033
If you need more evidence...

164
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,420
What about the Bujin Steel bribery
case I asked you to work on?

165
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,120
Sir, I can't just let go of
Jung Ji-ho like this.

166
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,586
I know you also expected it
when you entrusted it to me.

167
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,886
That I won't ever give up!

168
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:11,153
Don't you know who
Choi Yeon-su is?

169
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:12,886
He was our ace at the
Special Department.

170
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:15,120
That's the guy Jung Ji-ho
hired as his attorney,

171
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,133
and he probably bribed all the
witnesses out there.

172
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,366
Do you think you stand
a chance against him?

173
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:24,553
Sir, are you afraid of
Choi Yeon-su,

174
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:26,686
or the mastermind behind him?

175
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:27,833
What did you say?

176
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:33,066
(Evidence/Jung Ji-ho/
Embezzlement)

177
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,353
Sir, are you really going to
close the case like this?

178
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,586
Who knows when it'll be,

179
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,953
but I'm sure this box will be
opened again once more.

180
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:49,500
And when that day comes,
let's really catch him.

181
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,233
What a pity.

182
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,586
So you still love your husband,

183
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,586
yet you want to
proceed with the divorce.

184
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,033
May I hear your reason?

185
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,766
Because he's changed.

186
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,020
He used to tell me 12 times a day

187
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,986
that he loves me,

188
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:13,953
but now he only says it to me
twice a day,

189
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,866
with the excuse that he's busy.

190
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:18,800
That's as much as ten times less!

191
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,066
- What?
- But that's not all.

192
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,333
He used to know me
better than anyone else.

193
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:30,853
Anyway, he came home with
a pack of fried chicken the other day,

194
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,486
saying we should have
a chicken & drama night.

195
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:35,086
And what's the problem with that?

196
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,653
Duh, it should always be
one pack for each person!

197
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:42,020
When I saw him grab that chicken
and gnaw away,

198
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,320
I thought my heart was
being gnawed away.

199
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,886
So how can I continue
to be with him?

200
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,500
We have to go our separate ways.

201
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,486
Uh... It is with regret that
I must inform you that

202
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:59,420
that is not quite enough
a reason for divorce.

203
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,353
And there's no sure evidence that
he's changed, either.

204
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:05,200
But my husband has changed!

205
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:10,700
He is a terrible man,
for hurting my feelings.

206
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,986
Of course,

207
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:18,853
no man should make a woman cry.

208
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:20,220
Here.

209
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,600
Please wipe your tears,
and calm down.

210
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,386
Thank you.

211
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:36,933
You can keep it.

212
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:44,000
Goodbye, then.

213
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,233
Yes, Mom.

214
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,033
What?

215
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,966
Tomorrow's my birthday?

216
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,786
What do I want for my birthday?

217
00:18:58,866 --> 00:18:59,966
Oh, it's alright.

218
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,120
I should be the one
giving the gift,

219
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,466
because after all,
I'm so perfect thanks to you.

220
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,720
Alright, then.
I'll see you later, Mom.

221
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,833
Bye.

222
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,033
Tomorrow's his birthday?

223
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:28,620
Ms. Dan.

224
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,053
Is something on your mind?

225
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,066
Well, uh...

226
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:34,020
To tell you the truth,

227
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,353
I've fallen for someone...

228
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:37,433
Again?

229
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,933
Yes, and?

230
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:42,653
And...!

231
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:44,286
Tomorrow's a special day for him,

232
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:45,753
so I wanted to congratulate him.

233
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,753
But what could I get him,
as a gift?

234
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,720
If it's still one-sided,

235
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,986
keep it simple so that
he won't feel burdened.

236
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,186
But if it's both ways,

237
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:56,120
then this could be a chance to
get things moving further.

238
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,720
Like... Ask him out for dinner.

239
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,966
Um...

240
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,886
I think it's one-sided,

241
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:04,600
but both ways at the same time.
Can you hear me out?

242
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,986
First,

243
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:09,520
when I was in distress, he appeared
like a knight in shining armor

244
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,066
and whisked me away.

245
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:12,486
Second,

246
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:15,086
when I mentioned I needed something,
he gave it to me as a gift!

247
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,786
It's alright.

248
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:18,500
Just buy me a drink sometime.

249
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,720
A gift?

250
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,753
I don't think you're just
getting your hopes up,

251
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,986
I think this guy is
really interested in you!

252
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:25,166
Really?

253
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,886
He has to be interested in you,

254
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:29,420
so why not just go for it?

255
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,833
Ask him out for dinner tomorrow.

256
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,300
What about drinks?

257
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,586
He said, buy me a drink sometime.

258
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,786
That's great!

259
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,586
Then dress up really nicely,

260
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,200
so that he'll fall hard for you.

261
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,886
But uh...

262
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:47,920
How should I dress up?

263
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,686
I've never done it before...

264
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:51,686
Do you know his ideal type of
women by any chance?

265
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:54,320
It would be best to
follow that example.

266
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,866
Ideal type?

267
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,533
His ideal type, huh?

268
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,220
Ms. Dan?

269
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,286
Yes?

270
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:17,153
Did you have something to
say to me?

271
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:18,320
No.

272
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,533
- Why would I?
- But just now, you...

273
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:34,900
That was delicious.

274
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,353
Since that was a delicious lunch,
I'll buy the coffee.

275
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:39,920
Alright, I'm taking orders!

276
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,153
Then I'll have an Espresso.

277
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,220
A Mocha for me.

278
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,186
- A Latte for me.
- A Latte for me as well.

279
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:47,153
And I'd like an extra shot
in my Latte, if you don't mind.

280
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:50,320
I want a Strawberry Frappe,
with extra whipped cream.

281
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,486
Yoon-seo,
can you remember all this?

282
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:54,420
Are you sure
you won't have to write it down?

283
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,120
An Espresso for Mr. Yeon,
a Mocha for Ms. Yang,

284
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,220
Latte for Hae-young and Jong-hwa,

285
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,653
and for Pil-ki too,
but with an extra shot.

286
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:06,500
And for Mr. Lee, a Strawberry
Frappe with extra cream.

287
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,686
As for Mr. Kwon,
since he loves instant coffee,

288
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:10,666
I'll make one for you
as soon as we're back in the office.

289
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:13,500
How do you remember all that?

290
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,220
I have a great memory.

291
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,786
Alright then,
I'll go and get that coffee.

292
00:22:17,866 --> 00:22:19,953
- I'll be back!
- Let me help you. Wait up!

293
00:22:20,033 --> 00:22:21,433
- Wait for us.
- We'll help you with them.

294
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:24,553
Gosh, the cosmic goddess
treating me to coffee...

295
00:22:24,633 --> 00:22:26,633
What an honor!

296
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:29,020
By the way,

297
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,453
doesn't Yoon-seo seem to be
in high spirits today?

298
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:32,800
It's good to see her like that.

299
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,520

So he's back for good.

304
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:01,766
Ms. Oh Jin-sim, it's time to go...

305
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:05,900
Ms. Oh Jin-sim?

306
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:08,633
Yes, Mr. Kwon.

307
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:10,953
It's time to go home.

308
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:12,066
Oh...

309
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,366
Let me just make a copy of this.

310
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:29,653
(Lee Kang-joon, Former Director
of Empire Entertainment)

311
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:30,733
(Returns as Vice President of

312
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:51,666
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

313
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,020
There was a case that was
overruled by the Supreme Court

314
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,920
by a unanimous decision.

315
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,320
I'll note down the
case number for you,

316
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,033
so can you print it for me?

317
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,266
Let's go on a date tonight.

318
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:20,766
Sure, I'll?do that for you.

319
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,520
Why a theme park, out of the blue?

320
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,920
I've been watching the dramas
you did whenever I had time,

321
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,153
and whenever the heroine was down,

322
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:48,953
the hero would either
take her to the theme park

323
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:51,533
or the beach to cheer her up.

324
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,920
So after much dilemma
between the two,

325
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,020
I thought maybe
it'll be twice as fun,

326
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,220
if we come to this theme park
right here by the beach.

327
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,420
Not only that,
while this theme park is small

328
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,753
I thought that the fact that
not many frequent it as a result

329
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,700
made up for it.

330
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,486
Thank you.

331
00:25:09,566 --> 00:25:11,366
For being so considerate.

332
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:18,066
You don't have to try so hard.

333
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:21,686
- Pardon?
- It will be hard,

334
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:24,153
trying to overcome everything
at once.

335
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:26,466
So let's take it one step at a time.

336
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:30,353
I'll always be there to support you

337
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:31,866
and protect you.

338
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,033
That's really supportive.

339
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,166
- Whoa... Ms. Oh Jin-sim!
- Are you alright, Mr. Kwon?

340
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,833
Ms. Oh Jin-sim... Ms. Oh Jin-sim!

341
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:44,533
Hold on tight.

342
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,000
Ms. Oh Jin-sim!

343
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,120
Stop this!

344
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,353
Are you alright, Mr. Kwon?

345
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:53,353
I'll protect...

346
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:54,386
Don't worry,

347
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:55,800
I'll protect you.

348
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:00,566
Put your hands up.

349
00:26:01,233 --> 00:26:02,533
Ms. Oh Jin-sim!

350
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:04,753
Stop this.

351
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:05,753
Stop this right now!

352
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:06,953
Put your hands up.

353
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,286
Mr. Kwon. Mr. Kwon?

354
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,566
Can you hear me?

355
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,920
- Are you alright?
- Uh, yes.

356
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,533
I'll protect you.

357
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:16,933
Stop this!

358
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,220
Please!

359
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,066
Stop this right now!

360
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:32,666
I'm alright, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

361
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,853
Mr. Kwon,

362
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:38,320
I didn't know
you were scared of rides.

363
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,853
It's not that I'm scared.

364
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,986
It's just that
I haven't been on them

365
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:44,320
ever since elementary school,
so it's more correct to say that

366
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,320
I was a bit anxious.

367
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,486
Besides, I'm getting used to them
at a very fast speed.

368
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:48,953
Ah!

369
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:50,920
Then shall we go on it once more?

370
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,420
So that you'll really
get used to them.

371
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,320
No, no.

372
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,933
This much has been
enough for me already.

373
00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:00,020
Be honest with me.

374
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,453
You were scared,

375
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:02,533
weren't you?

376
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:05,120
- No.
- Whatever.

377
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,486
You were scared!

378
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:07,900
I said, I wasn't!

379
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,253
What,

380
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,486
so you're mad now?

381
00:27:11,566 --> 00:27:13,020
Your tone is icy again.

382
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,920
I mean that callous tone of yours,
your trademark!

383
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,533
Trademark?

384
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:20,786
No one's ever told me I'm callous.

385
00:27:20,866 --> 00:27:22,753
They probably all say it
behind your back.

386
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:25,053
Do you know just how
callous you are?

387
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:29,020
I was really shocked
when I met you first.

388
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,566
Because you were the iciest
person I'd ever met.

389
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,133
Although... Now you are the
sweetest person ever.

390
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:44,886
By the way, Mr. Kwon.

391
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:46,020
You remind me of something.

392
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,300
Remind you of something?

393
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,320
Oh.

394
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,386
You mean like an actor?
I get that a lot...

395
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:54,786
I mean, a hedgehog.

396
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:56,653
- A hedgehog?
- Yes!

397
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:58,553
That's what hedgehogs are, right?

398
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:01,453
They're all thorny on the outside,

399
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:03,533
but really, they're so cute.

400
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,966
Just like you, Mr. Kwon.

401
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:08,466
You're like a hedgehog.

402
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,720
Sure.

403
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,966
Hedgehog.

404
00:28:14,866 --> 00:28:18,253
Wow, look at that cotton candy!
It's so cute.

405
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,433
Did you see that?

406
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:21,466
Yes.

407
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,933
I'll go get it right away.

408
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,000
Huh?

409
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,720
- Ah...
- Sir.

410
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,953
Can I have a teddy bear
cotton candy, please?

411
00:28:32,033 --> 00:28:33,120
Sorry,

412
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,153
I'm done for the day.

413
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:36,300
What?

414
00:28:37,566 --> 00:28:38,820
Sir, I'm really sorry,

415
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,686
but could you make
just one more for me?

416
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:42,053
Because this cotton candy

417
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:44,233
could just be a big
cheering up for someone.

418
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,600
It could even give her the
momentum to overcome her fears.

419
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:50,053
What, this cotton candy?

420
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:51,053
Yes.

421
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:53,953
So please. I beg you.

422
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,100
Alright, then.

423
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:10,966
- Cheer up!
- Thank you.

424
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:12,766
Ms. Oh Jin-sim!

425
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,466
I'm sorry.

426
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,200
Oh no...

427
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,400
This poor thing...

428
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:31,200
It was a white polar bear before,

429
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:34,833
but now it's a black bear.

430
00:29:38,766 --> 00:29:39,933
It's all my fault.

431
00:29:40,966 --> 00:29:43,586
I should've watched my every step.

432
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:44,720
Or if I had held it
above my head to

433
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,820
protect it when I had
bumped into them...

434
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,553
Come on, it's okay.

435
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:51,120
See?

436
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,453
The back of the head is
still good.

437
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:55,700
Let's go for the back of the head.

438
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:02,233
Try some, too. say ah!

439
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:06,866
Come on, ah!

440
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,300
Ms. Oh Jin-sim!

441
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:13,800
Hey, what's that?

442
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,620
Fireworks?

443
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,353
Yes. I also got this tip

444
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:19,586
from one of your dramas, too.

445
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:23,020
They'd always play with fireworks
at the beach.

446
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,566
Just one moment.

447
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,200
You can look forward to this one!

448
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,386
Um, they say one or two
in the pack are

449
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:48,300
bound to be bad.

450
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:00,533
What do you think is
wrong with this?

451
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,900
Alright... It should
work this time, right?

452
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,420
How could they sell
such faulty products?

453
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,720
I should file a complaint to
the Consumer Agency,

454
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,333
and demand a reimbursement.

455
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,033
So pretty.

456
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,286
Mr. Kwon, let's leave the
complaints to later,

457
00:31:43,366 --> 00:31:45,186
and watch the fireworks for now.

458
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:47,720
But those aren't our fireworks.

459
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,086
If we're watching them,
they're ours now.

460
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,400
Come on, hurry up!

461
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:56,800
So pretty.

462
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:03,420
I'm sorry, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

463
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,566
Hmmm? About what?

464
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:10,200
I brought you all the way here
to cheer you up,

465
00:32:11,766 --> 00:32:13,920
but first I get scared on the rides,

466
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,353
then I drop the cotton candy
which you wanted to have,

467
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:18,633
and now the fireworks, too...

468
00:32:21,766 --> 00:32:23,533
I feel like I've ruined everything.

469
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:26,686
All the guys in the dramas

470
00:32:26,766 --> 00:32:29,366
seemed to entertain you, but...

471
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:37,266
But it was much more fun
than all of my dramas!

472
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,566
Because this time,

473
00:32:42,866 --> 00:32:47,353
I'm here with someone
I love, for real.

474
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,986
You're my real boyfriend,

475
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:53,853
and your feelings for me are real.

476
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:58,300
That's why I couldn't have
enjoyed myself more.

477
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,720
You know,

478
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,953
I'm now confident that
as long as I'm with you,

479
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:08,200
I can overcome anything.

480
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,653
Do you think you'll be alright
on your own tonight?

481
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:42,800
Of course.

482
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:48,420
If anything comes up,
call me.

483
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,420
Even if nothing does,
I'm going to call you.

484
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,133
I need to hear your voice
before I fall asleep.

485
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:56,300
- Have a safe drive home, then.
- Alright.

486
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,486
You really didn't need to
come pick me up.

487
00:34:21,566 --> 00:34:25,086
I hope I'm not troubling you.

488
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,333
It's alright.

489
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:31,286
Everything should be fine,
so no need to worry.

490
00:34:31,366 --> 00:34:32,400
Alright.

491
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:46,600
Mr. Kwon, why are you
in such a rush?

492
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:50,233
Just because.

493
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,186
Ms. Oh Jin-sim,
why don't you go ahead first?

494
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:14,620
I have to make a call first.

495
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,766
- Then I'll get going first.
- Alright.

496
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:33,533
Who are you?

497
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,520
Taking pictures without consent is
infringing on portrait rights,

498
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,753
which means you may be
liable for damages.

499
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,553
And if the victim felt
she was sexually harassed,

500
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:44,153
you may be punished by law for

501
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:45,253
violating the Special Act on the
Punishment of Sexual Crimes

502
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,120
I wasn't taking pictures of you!

503
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,766
No, you were probably
taking pictures of me.

504
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,953
I hope you won't do this again.

505
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:58,566
Actually, I should tell him directly.

506
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,853
This is Oh Yoon-seo.

507
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:11,086
I forgot to say hello,
because it was so sudden.

508
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,166
I thought I would never
see you again, but...

509
00:36:14,366 --> 00:36:16,586
If you keep hiring people to
trail me,

510
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:18,466
maybe I will see you after all.

511
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:20,800
In Court.

512
00:36:22,366 --> 00:36:24,186
You've become daring

513
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:26,320
while we haven't met, huh?

514
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,433
Yep, I'm not scared of you anymore.

515
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:40,720
Let me take this.

516
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,800
I'll need evidence when I do
take this to court later.

517
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:02,286
How did you know?

518
00:37:02,366 --> 00:37:05,353
You kept glancing at the
rear view mirror while driving,

519
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:08,153
so I took a look,
and there was a car following us.

520
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:12,120
And when you told me to
go ahead first,

521
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,386
I thought you might
approach that car.

522
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:18,100
So I'd been watching,
in case I need to call the police.

523
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:20,733
Good job, right?

524
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:28,153
Are you really alright?

525
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:29,653
I'm fine.

526
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:31,053
I told you, didn't I?

527
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:32,420
That I'll overcome this with you.

528
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Yes.

529
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,633
But... You're thinking of
taking this to court?

530
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:40,900
Well…

531
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,086
I did warn him,
so let's watch and see.

532
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:49,486
To be honest, I really don't want to

533
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:52,333
get involved with him
and make headlines.

534
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:02,086
So Kwon and Yoon-seo
aren't joining us for coffee?

535
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,153
No, I think they're busy.

536
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:06,653
By the way, I haven't seen
Ms. Dan yet.

537
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:09,133
She said she needs to
drop by at the court.

538
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,366
- Good morning, everyone.
- Here she comes.

539
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,766
Oh, you're all here.

540
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:33,800
What's with you, Dan?

541
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:36,320
Is this a protest through fashion,

542
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,420
just because I pressured you
about your records?

543
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,653
If you think this will scare me,

544
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:41,766
then you've succeeded big time.
I'm really scared now!

545
00:38:42,633 --> 00:38:43,733
Mr. Yeon!

546
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:46,820
You're so mean.

547
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,520
Anyway, I'm sorry about my records,

548
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,453
but I will try my best to
live up to your expectations.

549
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:55,500
That's a promise from me,
Dan Mun-hee!

550
00:38:57,366 --> 00:38:58,900
I'll do my best!

551
00:38:59,766 --> 00:39:01,020
Did you just hear that?

552
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,153
Am I the only one
who's creeped out?

553
00:39:02,233 --> 00:39:04,353
Huh? THe only one
who can't stand this?

554
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:06,286
Come on, Mr. Yeon.

555
00:39:06,366 --> 00:39:10,186
I don't think her transformation
today is that bad at all.

556
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:11,720
There's even a saying,

557
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,166
a woman is never guilty
about her transformations.

558
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:23,366
Let me get going, then.

559
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:29,933
But that really scared me out.

560
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:34,600
What's come over you?
You took Ms. Dan's side!

561
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,486
It just reminded me of
this one time,

562
00:39:39,566 --> 00:39:43,120
when I was in Spain.

563
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,753
I had become tired of
my always well-groomed self,

564
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:50,686
so I decided to be like
a gypsy for the rest of the trip.

565
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,953
So you're saying,
Dan's like a gypsy?

566
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:55,386
Well, not so much, but...

567
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:59,386
When you want to lose control

568
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:01,453
and if people around you
try to stop you,

569
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,566
you end up going more extreme,
is what I'm trying to say.

570
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,153
What are you doing,

571
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:20,333
in my office?

572
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,353
Well... I wanted to
ask you something.

573
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:32,720
What are your plans for
this evening?

574
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,053
Well,

575
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:36,520
not much.

576
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,686
Then would you like to have
dinner with me?

577
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:41,766
Pardon?

578
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,253
You said to buy you a drink

579
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,453
when you gave me that ukulele.

580
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:48,020
So I thought why not tonight?

581
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,353
Well, you see...

582
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:52,286
I happened to hear that
it's your birthday by pure chance

583
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:55,233
so I thought this could be
my birthday gift to you.

584
00:40:57,733 --> 00:41:00,186
Are you sure that is a gift?

585
00:41:00,266 --> 00:41:01,266
Huh?

586
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,920
Why would I drink with you
on my birthday?

587
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,853
I have a dinner date with
my mother tonight.

588
00:41:09,933 --> 00:41:14,153
This year, I happen to be single with
no woman I am interested in,

589
00:41:14,233 --> 00:41:17,266
so I reserved a French restaurant
for my mother.

590
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:20,753
So Ms. Dan,

591
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:22,233
buy me a drink some other time.

592
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,266
Off you go, then.

593
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,266
Right, sure.

594
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:38,753
You bastard.

595
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:41,466
Is that how you do your work? Huh?

596
00:41:43,866 --> 00:41:44,933
Sir!

597
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,786
What?

598
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:06,020
What is it?
What's with this serious mood?

599
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,553
Well, uh... Mr. Yeon.

600
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:13,466
We won't be able to cast
Yoon-seo for this drama after all.

601
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,700
What do you mean?

602
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,186
We're sorry, Mr. Yeon.

603
00:42:20,266 --> 00:42:22,753
We found a sponsor,

604
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:23,986
but they must've heard that

605
00:42:24,066 --> 00:42:27,320
we're considering casting
Yoon-seo for the lead role.

606
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:33,333
And the president there isn't
so fond of her.

607
00:42:34,866 --> 00:42:37,086
But... Why not?
Because of the scandal?

608
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:40,153
We're not quite sure...

609
00:42:40,233 --> 00:42:41,753
You guys are so cruel.

610
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:43,353
You know Yoon-seo's working as
a secretary in a law firm,

611
00:42:43,433 --> 00:42:46,153
all for this drama.
So how could you?

612
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:50,053
We'd like to work with
Yoon-seo too, if we can.

613
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:51,153
But what can we do?

614
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:54,886
We need a sponsor in order to
make this happen.

615
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:56,886
It took us so many months to
find a sponsor,

616
00:42:56,966 --> 00:42:59,800
so we're left with no choice.

617
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,753
Um, sir?

618
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,320
Please excuse me for asking you this,

619
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,720
but may I have this sponsor's
contact details?

620
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,300
I'd like to visit them and
convince them myself.

621
00:43:18,266 --> 00:43:19,786
What?

622
00:43:19,866 --> 00:43:21,753
The sponsor?

623
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:24,066
So when will you be
meeting him or her?

624
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:27,686
I'll come with you, Mr. Yeon.

625
00:43:27,766 --> 00:43:29,566
Let me try and convince them as well.

626
00:43:30,466 --> 00:43:32,833
Alright, I'll see you after work.

627
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,533
Did something happen?

628
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:41,266
It's nothing.

629
00:43:51,566 --> 00:43:54,420
- I had it wrong again.
- Be honest with me!

630
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,920
It's simply a misunderstanding.

631
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,986
Misunderstanding?

632
00:43:57,066 --> 00:43:58,353
But my wife told me that,

633
00:43:58,433 --> 00:44:00,653
you urged her to file for divorce

634
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:04,553
because men who make their
women cry are trash.

635
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:07,286
What... That's not what I meant!

636
00:44:07,366 --> 00:44:08,920
Not only that,

637
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,953
she said you gave her
this handkerchief, as a gift!

638
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:14,820
How is this not
evidence of temptation, huh?

639
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,320
But that was because

640
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,686
your wife was blowing your nose
into that...!

641
00:44:19,766 --> 00:44:20,753
Whatever.

642
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,786
Thank goodness we made up.

643
00:44:22,866 --> 00:44:24,720
What if we hadn't?

644
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,733
Were you really planning on
dating my wife or something?

645
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,153
Ha! You say
you specialize in divorce?

646
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:34,266
More like
you specialize in temptation!

647
00:44:34,733 --> 00:44:35,853
What kind of a nonsense is...!

648
00:44:35,933 --> 00:44:38,253
If you keep this up,
I won't hold back anymore.

649
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:39,886
What if you won't, huh?

650
00:44:39,966 --> 00:44:42,300
What if you won't?

651
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:56,486
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Dan Mun-hee, a lawyer.

652
00:44:56,566 --> 00:44:58,186
I think there's been
some misunderstanding.

653
00:44:58,266 --> 00:44:59,986
Mr. Choi isn't
that kind of a person.

654
00:45:00,066 --> 00:45:01,786
He's kind and gentle,

655
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:04,686
and would never do such a graceful
thing to his client!

656
00:45:04,766 --> 00:45:06,553
What would you know?
Stay out of this!

657
00:45:06,633 --> 00:45:08,386
I know well enough, thank you.

658
00:45:08,466 --> 00:45:10,320
So please leave,

659
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,986
before we sue you for
obstruction of business,

660
00:45:12,066 --> 00:45:14,920
defamation, and for
exerting violence!

661
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,366
You haven't forgotten that
this is a law firm, right?

662
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:21,386
Honey, let's go.

663
00:45:21,466 --> 00:45:23,486
Don't fall to temptation, Honey.

664
00:45:23,566 --> 00:45:24,853
Alright.

665
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:25,986
I'm scared.

666
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:27,220
Don't be scared.

667
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,220
But I am scared.

668
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,453
Are you alright, Ms. Dan?

669
00:45:31,533 --> 00:45:32,733
Yes, I'm alright.

670
00:45:33,433 --> 00:45:34,533
I'm sorry.

671
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:36,953
So why did you have to...

672
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:39,420
It's your birthday today,
isn't it?

673
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,220
I couldn't have them
rip your hair out on your birthday.

674
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,800
So consider this as
my birthday gift to you.

675
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,586
What's this feeling?

676
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:58,466
Until now, the only person
who ever protected me like that...

677
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,533
...is my mother.

678
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,153
Let's go.

679
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:14,453
I'll take you home.

680
00:46:14,533 --> 00:46:15,486
Oh, no.

681
00:46:15,566 --> 00:46:18,453
I'm seeing someone tonight.

682
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:19,533
Who?

683
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:24,733
Well, must I tell you everything?

684
00:46:28,766 --> 00:46:30,886
I'll be honest,
I'm going to be having

685
00:46:30,966 --> 00:46:32,520
dinner with the head of my agency.

686
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,120
He wanted to talk to me
about something.

687
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,400
I'll call once I'm done, though.

688
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:56,220
- Mr. Yeon.
- Yeah?

689
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,253
Don't worry too much.

690
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:03,153
I'm sure we'll be able to clear
their misunderstandings about me.

691
00:47:03,233 --> 00:47:04,386
Yes, Yoon-seo.

692
00:47:04,466 --> 00:47:05,766
You're right.

693
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,786
Yoon-seo... All that time working has
taught you how to comfort me.

694
00:47:10,866 --> 00:47:11,933
You're all grown up!

695
00:47:14,766 --> 00:47:16,020
Anyway, we've been
waiting for so long.

696
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,433
Why aren't they here already?

697
00:47:20,933 --> 00:47:22,000
Here they are!

698
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,453
What,

699
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:48,853
just how...

700
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:51,220
It's been a long time, Mr. Yeon.

701
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,620
And...

702
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,866
...Yoon-seo.

703
00:47:58,866 --> 00:48:00,533
I hope I didn't keep you waiting.

704
00:48:01,466 --> 00:48:02,953
Let's see.

705
00:48:03,033 --> 00:48:05,553
What was your favorite?

706
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,220
What...

707
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,900
...do you think you're doing?

708
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,933
Get up, Yoon-seo. We're leaving.

709
00:48:15,766 --> 00:48:17,920
Does that mean

710
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,553
you'll be giving up on the drama?

711
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:20,920
That's right.

712
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,420
We're not doing
this drama anymore.

713
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,900
Come on, let's go.

714
00:48:29,133 --> 00:48:31,053
Looks like Ms. Oh Yoon-seo has
something else on her mind.

715
00:48:31,133 --> 00:48:33,020
Sit down, Mr. Yeon.

716
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,253
I have something to say.

717
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,433
Yoon-seo!

718
00:48:37,866 --> 00:48:40,786
I thought
I clearly told you before,

719
00:48:40,866 --> 00:48:42,553
that I hope we don't see
each other again.

720
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:44,620
And I thought I told you too,

721
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,533
that you've become quite daring
since we last met.

722
00:48:50,066 --> 00:48:53,020
That's because I had
a lot to lose back then,

723
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,100
but not now.

724
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,020
You've nothing to lose?

725
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,453
What, when you even started
working at a law firm,

726
00:48:59,533 --> 00:49:01,186
because you want to
make a comeback?

727
00:49:01,266 --> 00:49:04,033
I see there's been
a huge misunderstanding.

728
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,100
I don't really need to
do that drama.

729
00:49:08,233 --> 00:49:11,266
Because as you said,
I'm quite happy already.

730
00:49:23,266 --> 00:49:24,433
Yoon-seo.

731
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:45,966
No need to get out.

732
00:49:50,633 --> 00:49:51,953
Have a safe drive home.

733
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:53,333
Sure, see you.

734
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:06,666
What's this all about?

735
00:50:07,566 --> 00:50:10,533
Does that really mean,
this drama is gone?

736
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:13,720
But you know,

737
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,386
Yoon-seo's doing
better than I thought.

738
00:50:16,466 --> 00:50:17,766
Right?

739
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,953
Aren't we going?

740
00:50:25,033 --> 00:50:26,720
Or are you calling it quits, too?

741
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,900
I'm sorry.

742
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:52,533
(Love Is Bound to Hurt)

743
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:28,033
Your call cannot be connected...

744
00:51:37,533 --> 00:51:41,633
I've just arrived home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

745
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,800
Is something going on?

746
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,366
Sleep tight,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

747
00:52:46,966 --> 00:52:49,286
Jung Ji-ho, President of
"Natural Table,"

748
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:51,720
who had been arrested on
suspicions of gambling

749
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,586
has been sentenced to
2 years of imprisonment and

750
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:55,233
3 years of probation.

751
00:52:55,433 --> 00:52:58,153
While many continue to criticize
his punishment was light,

752
00:52:58,233 --> 00:53:00,420
the Judges have commented
Mr. Jung showed deep remorse,

753
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,586
admitting to the charges...

754
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:04,720
Are you alright?

755
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,500
No way. Join me for a drink?

756
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,820
That Jung Ji-ho bastard...

757
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,553
Gambling's not all he did.

758
00:53:16,633 --> 00:53:18,953
He embezzled at least $20 million!

759
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:20,153
So when I think about

760
00:53:20,233 --> 00:53:21,933
how he'll have
a good night's sleep...

761
00:53:27,033 --> 00:53:28,753
Are you really going to
put the lid on it?

762
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:31,220
I'll have to.

763
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,520
For now.

764
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,700
For now?

765
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:41,900
So, what's wrong with you?

766
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,886
Can you tell me all that
you know about Lee Kang-joon?

767
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:57,586
Don't tell me...

768
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:59,166
He approached Yoon-seo?

769
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:06,120
Not only that, he hired
a man to follow her around.

770
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,266
What?

771
00:54:08,633 --> 00:54:12,220
We have the memory card with
the photos they took as evidence.

772
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,686
But?

773
00:54:13,766 --> 00:54:15,853
But I don't think she wants to
go any further than this for now.

774
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:18,000
Probably, yes.

775
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,666
The scandal that everyone was talking
about has only just gone down...

776
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:27,920
I'm so frustrated that

777
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,186
there's nothing I can do.

778
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:33,633
Well, I'll look into
the details for you.

779
00:54:46,766 --> 00:54:49,133
You're like a hedgehog.

780
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,653
What are you doing? Hurry up.

781
00:54:53,733 --> 00:54:54,733
Oh.

782
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:56,986
You go ahead first.

783
00:54:57,066 --> 00:54:58,566
I need to drop by somewhere.

784
00:55:18,933 --> 00:55:19,853
Who is it?

785
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:22,220
I'm a hedgehog.

786
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,400
What?

787
00:55:35,033 --> 00:55:36,466
Do you like it?

788
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,753
I brought this guy along,
hoping he'll always be there

789
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:42,933
when I can't be with you 24/7.

790
00:55:47,633 --> 00:55:48,586
Yes.

791
00:55:48,666 --> 00:55:50,633
I like it very much.

792
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:57,053
But your face doesn't say so.

793
00:55:57,133 --> 00:55:58,400
Mr. Kwon.

794
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:05,533
I may not be able to come into
the office for a long time.

795
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:11,820
I'll do my best to

796
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,653
complete my three months,

797
00:56:14,733 --> 00:56:20,120
and to finish all my duties.

798
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,286
But...

799
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:26,286
Now is a bit...

800
00:56:26,366 --> 00:56:28,366
...A bit hard for me.

801
00:56:30,233 --> 00:56:32,686
Because of the way I feel.

802
00:56:32,766 --> 00:56:34,720
Did something happen?

803
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,100
Why, all of a sudden?

804
00:56:38,366 --> 00:56:41,086
I'm sorry.

805
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:45,233
I can't say anything just yet.

806
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,686
Yoon-seo won't be cast for
that drama after all?

807
00:56:58,766 --> 00:56:59,920
Jeez, cousin.

808
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,520
Do you have to announce it to
everyone at your firm?

809
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,786
I'm sorry.

810
00:57:03,866 --> 00:57:06,233
It was such a shock that I...

811
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,700
Gosh, imagine the disappointment!

812
00:57:11,933 --> 00:57:13,553
Tell me about it.

813
00:57:13,633 --> 00:57:14,586
Yoon-seo's...

814
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:16,553
I mean the members of
our cosmic goddess,

815
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,953
Oh Yoon-seo's fan club!
Bet they're disappointed.

816
00:57:19,033 --> 00:57:22,520
They'd been counting down the days
until her comeback,

817
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,520
making gif files with the
videos we have of her

818
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,686
while hanging in there.

819
00:57:26,766 --> 00:57:28,086
Like of her smiling and winking!

820
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:30,886
So imagine their disappointment
when they hear the news!

821
00:57:30,966 --> 00:57:32,153
Oh what?

822
00:57:32,233 --> 00:57:34,220
You still do that kind of thing?

823
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,400
Shhh!

824
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,933
Do you have to announce it to
the entire firm?

825
00:57:38,866 --> 00:57:41,086
Only you know that
I was one of the founding members

826
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:45,153
and the mysterious Vice President
of her fan club, alright?

827
00:57:45,233 --> 00:57:46,553
You probably have no idea,
what joy it is

828
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:48,320
cheering for someone
without them knowing,

829
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,286
just like Daddy-Long-Legs.

830
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:52,486
Hey, hey!

831
00:57:52,566 --> 00:57:55,520
You really have a knack for
ticking people off, huh?

832
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,120
That's not what's important here,
is it?

833
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,586
What I'm trying to say is,

834
00:57:58,666 --> 00:57:59,853
there are many people out there

835
00:57:59,933 --> 00:58:02,366
who are waiting for her to return!

836
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,953
Poor Yoon-seo...

837
00:58:06,033 --> 00:58:08,853
I could see her adjusting to
things around here,

838
00:58:08,933 --> 00:58:11,100
and all this is now in vain!

839
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,686
That's why I came here to tell you that

840
00:58:14,766 --> 00:58:15,986
Yoon-seo won't be able to
come in anymore.

841
00:58:16,066 --> 00:58:17,166
Yes, right.

842
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,820
But others will be puzzled because
they don't know the full story.

843
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,253
What should I tell them?

844
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,686
Just, uh... Tell them
she's not well.

845
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:29,700
And I'll take care of the rest.

846
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,053
- What, did you have garlic?
- Yeah.

847
00:58:35,133 --> 00:58:36,300
Oh jeez.

848
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,686
What is it that
you want to tell us?

849
00:58:46,766 --> 00:58:48,753
Is it some kind of
a grand announcement?

850
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:51,720
More like a notice, I guess.

851
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,420
Yoon-seo's, uh...

852
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,753
She's not well.

853
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:56,500
So she'll be taking
a few days off.

854
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,586
Gosh, is she that unwell?

855
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:02,886
Then how long
will she be away for?

856
00:59:02,966 --> 00:59:04,233
Well, uh...

857
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,986
We'll have to see.

858
00:59:07,066 --> 00:59:08,720
But there you are.

859
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,120
And since Yoon-seo will be a way,

860
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,320
Ms. Yang and the interns,
help out Kwon in the meantime.

861
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,186
- Sure.
- Yes, sir.

862
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:17,700
Alright, then. Back to work.

863
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,920
Mr. Kwon.

864
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,933
About that client
I told you about yesterday.

865
00:59:37,066 --> 00:59:39,820
You know, the one who was
initially assigned to Ms. Dan,

866
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,753
but said he can't work with her.

867
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:45,120
The overseas gambling case.

868
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,553
- Ah, yes.
- He's here right now.

869
00:59:46,633 --> 00:59:48,186
I'll show him in.

870
00:59:48,266 --> 00:59:49,700
Alright.

871
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,553
Let's start off by writing
a letter of self-reflection,

872
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:03,020
which we will submit to the judges.

873
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,820
It needs to say that
you?regret your actions,

874
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,166
and that you promise to
never gamble again.

875
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:11,586
Also visit a psychologist
or a counselor,

876
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:13,186
and submit their opinions or
your counseling records,

877
01:00:13,266 --> 01:00:15,220
which will determine your sentence.

878
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,733
Will that help me to
not get arrested, then?

879
01:00:19,066 --> 01:00:21,786
I can't guarantee,
but you've no previous records,

880
01:00:21,866 --> 01:00:23,453
so attend counseling regularly.

881
01:00:23,533 --> 01:00:25,253
Because as long as we can prove
you're not an addict

882
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:27,000
we may be able?to
escape that scenario.

883
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,453
You should be relieved that
it ended at this much,

884
01:00:31,533 --> 01:00:33,120
because your bets were small.

885
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,520
As you probably saw on the news,

886
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,786
if that number was millions like
Jung Ji-ho,

887
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:38,486
that would mean you'll be
with the prosecution now.

888
01:00:38,566 --> 01:00:39,753
Jung Ji-ho?

889
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:42,666
You know, I thought
his case was a bit weird.

890
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,120
Weird?

891
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,353
This is just a rumor going around
between us gamblers,

892
01:00:49,433 --> 01:00:53,466
but apparently, President Jung
isn't a gambler.

893
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,686
What? Just what do you...

894
01:00:56,766 --> 01:01:02,253
That NCT Hotel in Macau which is
where he apparently was...

895
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:04,833
Why, I'm a regular there!

896
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:11,286
One of the guys I know works as
security for the VIPs.

897
01:01:11,366 --> 01:01:14,020
And he says he's only ever seen
Jung Ji-ho once.

898
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,053
On that very day, when he was
arrested for gambling!

899
01:01:16,133 --> 01:01:22,186
But for some reason, the media
said he was a regular there.

900
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:26,953
Isn't that kind of like,
"No, I didn't drink,

901
01:01:27,033 --> 01:01:29,533
but I drove drunk."

902
01:01:54,366 --> 01:01:55,533
Did you call for me?

903
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:57,666
Um...

904
01:01:58,166 --> 01:01:59,233
So.

905
01:02:00,266 --> 01:02:03,153
May I have Mr. Choi Yeon-su's
account history, please.

906
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:05,886
What?
But Mr. Choi Yeon-su... That's...

907
01:02:05,966 --> 01:02:08,386
Yes, he's Jung Ji-ho's attorney,

908
01:02:08,466 --> 01:02:10,520
and there's something
I can't shake off my mind.

909
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,166
Um, Prosecutor...

910
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:15,666
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can put the lid on this case.

911
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:19,000
Whatever happens,
I'll take full responsibility.

912
01:02:21,533 --> 01:02:23,500
Yes, alright.

913
01:02:27,466 --> 01:02:28,500
Hey, Jung-rok.

914
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:37,686
Lee Kang-joon was some trouble
while he was overseas, too.

915
01:02:37,766 --> 01:02:39,786
Of course, he used money
each time to take care of things.

916
01:02:39,866 --> 01:02:41,566
By the way, about Jung Ji-ho.

917
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,153
I can't be 100% sure,

918
01:02:45,233 --> 01:02:48,386
but there's a rumor
he wasn't actually gambling.

919
01:02:48,466 --> 01:02:49,466
But that can't be.

920
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,753
One thing where we do have
evidence is his gambling.

921
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:56,220
We checked his entry and
exit records in and out of Macau,

922
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,333
and there are even pictures of him
at a hotel casino.

923
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,666
Ah, here it is right here.

924
01:03:09,933 --> 01:03:11,066
Who are you?

925
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,653
- What is it?
- This man...

926
01:03:19,733 --> 01:03:23,853
He'd been hired to
follow Ms. Oh Jin-sim around.

927
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:26,253
Where did you say Lee Kang-joon
was again, all this time?

928
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:27,400
Macau.

929
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,120
Now that you mention it,

930
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,553
they have the same attorney.
I mean Choi Yeon-su.

931
01:03:35,633 --> 01:03:38,120
Two years ago, he defended
Lee Kang-joon's drug suspicions,

932
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,700
and this time, he's defending
Jung Ji-ho.

933
01:03:59,033 --> 01:04:02,266
Yoon-seo, we heard you're not well.
How are you feeling?

934
01:04:02,633 --> 01:04:04,120
(Ms. Yang Eun-ji)

935
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,286
(Ms. Kim Hae-young/Intern
Lee Jong-hwa/Intern Kim Pil-ki)

936
01:04:05,366 --> 01:04:06,486
(Mr. Choi Yun-hyuk
Ms. Dan Mun-hee)

937
01:04:06,566 --> 01:04:07,766
(Mr. Yeon Jun-kyu)

938
01:04:42,233 --> 01:04:43,366
Yoon-seo.

939
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,220
I thought you were unwell.

940
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,466
I'm not here to work today.

941
01:04:53,466 --> 01:04:56,566
I'm here as a client.

942
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,500
Is Mr. Kwon inside?

943
01:05:18,766 --> 01:05:19,900
I want to sue...

944
01:05:24,366 --> 01:05:26,033
...Lee Kang-joon.

945
01:05:39,366 --> 01:05:43,720
These are the texts and photos
he sent to blackmail me.

946
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,453
I'd held onto them
without throwing them out.

947
01:05:46,533 --> 01:05:49,920
Will this be enough evidence?

948
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,166
Of course.

949
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:54,986
Please make him

950
01:05:55,066 --> 01:05:57,686
get what he deserve this time.

951
01:05:57,766 --> 01:05:59,253
Of course.

952
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:01,200
I'll make sure he does.

953
01:06:15,633 --> 01:06:17,333
Thanks for driving me home.

954
01:06:20,466 --> 01:06:24,420
Are you really okay?

955
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,820
Yes, I'm okay.

956
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,420
To be honest,

957
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,986
it was so terrifying and horrible that

958
01:06:33,066 --> 01:06:35,620
I hadn't had the chance to
look back.

959
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:40,220
But I realized pretending
I'm okay and that

960
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,866
I've forgotten about it,
doesn't erase the scars.

961
01:06:46,266 --> 01:06:49,653
So I thought I should
pluck up the courage.

962
01:06:49,733 --> 01:06:51,333
And believe in you.

963
01:06:54,133 --> 01:06:57,133
Yes. Just trust me, from now on.

964
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:12,133
You're home.

965
01:07:19,266 --> 01:07:20,700
I came to see you,
because I missed you.

966
01:07:54,866 --> 01:07:56,200
I love you, Yoon-seo.

967
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:00,433
You still love me, don't you?

968
01:08:03,966 --> 01:08:06,400
You'd pretend you're mad to
get my interest.

969
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,166
That's why you're also pretending to
like that guy, isn't it?

970
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,053
To provoke me.

971
01:08:13,133 --> 01:08:14,166
Don't.

972
01:08:15,766 --> 01:08:17,100
If you come any closer,

973
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:21,086
I'll call the police.

974
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:22,266
Call the police?

975
01:08:29,766 --> 01:08:35,100
You still don't know me, do you?

976
01:08:48,233 --> 01:08:50,186
So come on, be honest with me.

977
01:08:50,266 --> 01:08:51,420
Tell me that you love me.

978
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,466
That I'm the only one,
and that you won't betray me!

979
01:09:16,933 --> 01:09:18,600
Don't touch my girlfriend.

980
01:09:28,433 --> 01:09:29,720
(Thank you to Lee Su-ji and
Yang Hyeon-min for their)

981
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,400
(special cameo appearances)

982
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,766
(Touch Your Heart)

983
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,986
I'd like you to play the

984
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:05,686
female lead, Yoon-seo.

985
01:10:05,766 --> 01:10:07,453
Do you think Yoon-seo will
go back to being an actress?

986
01:10:07,533 --> 01:10:09,920
She got a job here because
she was interested in this field,

987
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,620
so I presume she'll continue
working in law.

988
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:14,186
Your colleagues will probably be
in for a surprise.

989
01:10:14,266 --> 01:10:17,120
- The role of a lawyer...
- Especially Mr. Kwon.

990
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,720
I don't need anything else,

991
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,286
as long as I can be beside you.

992
01:10:20,366 --> 01:10:21,653
A woman who can contain me,

993
01:10:21,733 --> 01:10:24,253
like this rose in the vase...

994
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:25,486
Just what am I to do with you?

995
01:10:25,566 --> 01:10:27,366
There's no way they're dating.

996
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:28,953
- Oh no!
- You know something.

997
01:10:29,033 --> 01:10:31,120
- Don't you?
- Uh... Maybe no.

998
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,220
I know this is cliched,

999
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,853
but please break up with Yoon-seo
for her future.

1000
01:10:35,933 --> 01:10:39,900
Is it a trouble that I am
in love with Ms. Oh Jin-sim?
