1
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,200
(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,600
(Episode 9)
I'm just so upset.

3
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,220
If they were fair criticisms,
I would accept them.

4
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,300
But...

5
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,086
What's this about, "I wouldn't eat
here, even if they paid me,"

6
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,920
or "I had stomachache
after eating their macaroons?"

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,633
How are we to cope with
all these false rumors?

8
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,420
Will it be possible to sue that
blogger or whatever and

9
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,920
all those who left
comments on that post?

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,220
Of course.

11
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,186
You may sue them for defamation,

12
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:06,686
as false allegations are
punishable by law.

13
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,620
First let's lodge a claim,

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,253
and file a civil suit as well,

15
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,200
against specific offenders.

16
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:14,466
You know,

17
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:16,986
I've been suffering from
nightmares every day.

18
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:19,820
I'm even starting to
respect the celebrities on TV!

19
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,520
I'm even starting to
respect the celebrities on TV!

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,120
I don't know how they put up with
all those hate comments.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,733
I don't know how they put up with
all those hate comments.

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,720
By the way,

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,233
your secretary must really
love macaroons.

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,453
Please make screenshots of
any comments you find offensive,

25
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:38,066
and send them to me.

26
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,620
As soon as I have the draft ready,
I will send it to you,

27
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,753
and once you review it,
I'll proceed with it right away.

28
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:43,866
Oh, yes.

29
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:52,220
Thank you,

30
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,953
for buying so much for me.

31
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:57,753
Thanks to you,
I'm now loaded with macaroons!

32
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,120
Right.

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Please have a taste and
give me your honest thoughts.

34
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,286
Are they really that bad to

35
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:05,866
attract all those hate comments?

36
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:07,853
Oh.

37
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:09,286
So that's why you brought me, huh?

38
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:11,653
To get me to taste them.

39
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:15,020
Alright, I accept the challenge.
I love macaroons, you know.

40
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,086
But even if you do,

41
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,653
can you really finish
all of them by yourself?

42
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:21,986
Come on, why would I have them
all to myself?

43
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:23,653
I'm going to taste just one,

44
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:26,253
and share the rest with
the others in the office.

45
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,153
I'm loyal to my people, you know.

46
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,833
You're not just loyal.

47
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:32,733
You're also charming,
and kind-hearted.

48
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:35,900
Who are you?

49
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:39,766
The Mr. Kwon I know isn't
capable of saying such sweet things.

50
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:41,800
Who are you, really?

51
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,800
Just kidding.

52
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,686
But you know, you were
so out of character just now that

53
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:51,120
I couldn't believe it
for a second.

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,286
I want to hear you say

55
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:54,720
more things like that,
it's highly commendable.

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,933
Yes, alright.

57
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:58,366
So, you're not having
those macaroons after all?

58
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:00,586
Which one should I have?

59
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,920
They have unique names for
their macaroons.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,320
"Always want to go back to
that mocha-mocha-macaroon."

61
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,500
"It's so chocolate-pretty,
chocolate macaroon."

62
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:12,900
"Mint macaroons that
call for a kiss."

63
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:17,000
I wonder how this one tastes,
it says it calls for a kiss.

64
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:35,353
We're back.

65
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:37,233
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

66
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:40,033
Ta-da!

67
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:43,220
Mr. Kwon bought
macaroons for all of us.

68
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,686
- Ta-da!
- Wow, they look delicious.

69
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,253
Pick your favorite.

70
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,253
Then I'll go for strawberry.

71
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,833
I'll go for chocolate.

72
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,720
Then I'll go for...
"Earl Grey macaroons that

73
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,153
shout out Earl Grey."

74
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,620
Yoon-seo, why don’t you
take this one?

75
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,100
"Mint macaroons that
call for a kiss."

76
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:04,666
Please, I don't want to
call for a kiss!

77
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,833
My goodness.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Huh?

79
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,553
Oh, Mr. Kwon.

80
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,120
Did you need something?

81
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,620
I won't ask anymore
from now on.

82
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,733
Pardon?

83
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,566
What...

84
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,400
You said don't ask, so…

85
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:35,066
By "I won't ask..."

86
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,300
You mean, right here?

87
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,433
Yes.

88
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,320
I always checked whether the
written ruling was well delivered,

89
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,653
but it seems like you now
manage fine on your own,

90
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,400
so I won't check to
reconfirm with you from now on.

91
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:54,300
Ah, I feel so sleepy.
I should get some coffee.

92
00:04:58,433 --> 00:04:59,586
Are you crazy?

93
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,420
I know it was good,
but still, this isn't...

94
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,386
Oh my goodness. What did I say?

95
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:05,386
What was good?

96
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,800
Well... I must admit,
it was great...

97
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,933
Oh, anyway.

98
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,486
You're at work, alright?

99
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:14,566
Oh Yoon-seo!

100
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,553
Let's focus on work now.

101
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,900
Focus, alright? Focus!

102
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,320
Oh. Here are the files
you asked for.

103
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Thank you.

104
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:30,553
Just as he said earlier,

105
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:33,186
there was an awful lot of
hate comments.

106
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,586
The macaroons were of
high quality, too.

107
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,786
The reviews were really subjective
and full of malicious comments,

108
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:40,353
and some are even doubting that

109
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:43,100
the owner is a licensed patisseur.

110
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:46,233
I would be so upset,
if I were him.

111
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,386
Because I totally understand,

112
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,533
I've had my share of
malicious comments before.

113
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,486
You tell yourself
a hundred, a thousand times,

114
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,633
'Let's not mind them,
let's just ignore them,'

115
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,833
but some just stab you
right in the heart.

116
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,720
And they still hurt too,

117
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,053
because you can't just
forget them.

118
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:14,186
Why didn't you sue them?

119
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:18,086
I actually did, in fact.

120
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,686
But when I met them in person,

121
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:24,053
they were students or
the breadwinners in their family,

122
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,100
so I couldn't bring myself to
take it any further.

123
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,020
So I just forgave them,

124
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,433
after they promised
they wouldn't do it again.

125
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,700
Oh, the phone's ringing.

126
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,466
Just how malicious were
those comments, anyway?

127
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,400
(Oh Yoon-seo)

128
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,266
Let's sue them right now.

129
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:57,953
Sorry? What?

130
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,420
I looked through some of the
comments on the Internet about you

131
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,020
and they're not just
malicious, they're a crime!

132
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,253
The people who wrote such comments
need to know

133
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,353
what terrible things they did
with their fingers,

134
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:09,486
and should be punished for
their crime.

135
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:10,800
So let's sue them right...

136
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,700
Why are you laughing?

137
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:16,733
I'm being serious.

138
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,086
Because it makes me happy.

139
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,166
What?

140
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,033
What are you so happy about?

141
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:25,800
Well, think about it.

142
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,700
You're always so cool-headed,

143
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:33,220
and always like this,

144
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,820
but now you're all fired up
because of me.

145
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,586
As if this is your own affair.

146
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,466
From now on, your affairs
are my own affairs.

147
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,366
I'm really fine.

148
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:53,700
But thanks for minding me.

149
00:07:58,366 --> 00:07:59,700
Yoon-seo, why don't we have
dinner together...

150
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
What?

151
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:06,220
Oh, alright. I get it, okay?

152
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,933
Case examples?
Sure, I'll have them for you!

153
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,520
But do you always have to
push me like this?

154
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Hmmm?

155
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:17,420
I'm sorry I caught you
at the wrong timing.

156
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,033
I hope you two manage to
resolve your conflicts, though.

157
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,420
Are you alright, Mr. Kwon?

158
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,920
Yes, I'm fine.

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,733
Gosh, I'm sorry.

160
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,720
I tried to save us from
being busted

161
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,566
with a bit of acting, but...

162
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,333
Yes, well...

163
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,733
That was very commendable.

164
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,266
You're also very strong, too.

165
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:59,920
An actress' life may look
flashy on the outside,

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,953
but really, it must be difficult.

167
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:05,500
To think that you must accept
those cruel comments as destiny...

168
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,300
But still,

169
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,066
there were more ups to it.

170
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,633
For example, I'd get excited
when I see a good script,

171
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,420
and when I'm on the set,
with everyone on the move,

172
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,686
I felt like I was truly alive.

173
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:24,486
And when your work is met
with rave reviews,

174
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:25,986
then there's the sense of
achievement that comes with it.

175
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,033
In all, I have way more
happy memories.

176
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:34,320
There was this drama
called "Signal,"

177
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,286
which was my most memorable one.

178
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,953
I think it was because
the character I played

179
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:40,686
brought out a side within me

180
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:43,766
that even I hadn't been aware of.

181
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:49,453
But, after all,
I enjoyed all the dramas.

182
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:52,966
Though you wouldn't know,
because you never watched any.

183
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,600
Well, uh...

184
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:58,833
Let me take that call.

185
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,633
Yes, this is Kwon Jung-rok.

186
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:05,386
Ah, yes. I'm out at the moment,

187
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:08,986
but once I'm in the office,
I'll send you my opinions.

188
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,086
Yes. Yes, of course.

189
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,166
Alright then.

190
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:17,433
Mr. Kwon, do you have to
go back to the office?

191
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:18,686
Yes.

192
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,866
Then why did you leave
in the first place?

193
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,866
So I can drive you home.

194
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:28,800
Really?

195
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:31,200
But you didn't have to.

196
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,653
I guess this is why
people get into relationships.

197
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:39,800
Because you have someone to
look after and care for you.

198
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,566
This is really nice.

199
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:08,020
There was this drama
called "Signal,"

200
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,053
which was my most memorable one.

201
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:13,500
Though you wouldn't know,
because you never watched any.

202
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,286
A success story of a working girl

203
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:28,020
who enters a life insurance
company by the name, "Signal,"

204
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,786
and becomes their top saleswoman

205
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:33,066
after many trials and tribulations.

206
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,233
(Signal)

207
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:38,933
Detective Lee Jae-han?

208
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,953
Just what had happened in
the year 1997?

209
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,853
Just what had happened in
the year 1997?

210
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:46,420
Oh, I know.

211
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,753
You had your appendix
removed, didn't you?

212
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,433
You had your appendix
removed, didn't you?

213
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:52,086
But you didn't have health insurance

214
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,686
and so weren't covered.

215
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:57,353
Just because you're sixty
doesn't mean it's over.

216
00:11:57,433 --> 00:12:01,653
You can always change the future.

217
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,800
So don't ever give up!

218
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:14,633
How could you cheat on me?

219
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:17,820
How could you fall in love
with two people,

220
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,866
when you have just one heart?

221
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:24,633
(Videos of Oh Yoon-seo,
the Cosmic Goddess)

222
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:44,720
(Soft but rich,)

223
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,900
(a sip which completes me)

224
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,533
Now I want to see her.

225
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,386
You look more surprised than
I thought you'd be.

226
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:38,766
Though I did come here without
warning to surprise you, yes.

227
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,353
Why are you here at this hour?

228
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:43,553
Ta-da!

229
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:47,586
I came to cheer you up
with some snacks.

230
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,266
I thought you might be feeling
hungry about now, and...

231
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:54,300
I was curious how well
you were doing without me.

232
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,986
And then of course,

233
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:58,600
I wanted to see you.

234
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:29,020
What were you so
absorbed in just now?

235
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,620
I was watching one of your dramas.

236
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,953
You're amazing when you act.

237
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:34,686
Right?

238
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:36,420
I'm quite charismatic, right?

239
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,420
Though I may not be the
Queen of acting,

240
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,086
I don't deserve all those
hate comments, right?

241
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,553
No. And don't let those
hate comments

242
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,453
ever bring you down.

243
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:47,653
Because they aren't true.

244
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:49,453
Exactly!

245
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:51,266
So from now, whenever you
come across such comments,

246
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,386
dislike them for me.

247
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:55,466
Alright.

248
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,066
Why are you looking at me
like that?

249
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:06,453
I'm just thinking about
how much you must've suffered

250
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,900
before you could laugh
over it like this.

251
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:13,733
It must've been so hard for you,

252
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:17,966
but you did a great job,
hanging in there.

253
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,153
Yoon-seo.

254
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,033
Mr. Kwon isn't back yet, right?

255
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,353
Why don't you join us for lunch?

256
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:50,166
Well, uh...

257
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,920
I'll just wait for him to return.

258
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,253
He'll be back soon,

259
00:15:56,333 --> 00:16:00,420
so he might feel betrayed if
I say I went to lunch without him.

260
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,453
Alright then. Enjoy your lunch.

261
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:04,700
You enjoy your lunch too,
Ms. Yang.

262
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,866
I wonder when
Mr. Kwon will be back.

263
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:20,100
I haven't had dumplings for ages,
so they taste real good.

264
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,686
Mr. Yeon!

265
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,866
You just splashed soup on my face.

266
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:29,720
Next time, I think we should
skip any options that

267
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,320
come with hot soup.

268
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,553
What if my face is
permanently scarred,

269
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:36,886
all because of
this dumpling stew?

270
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:40,653
That's what penny-wise and
pound-foolish is, isn't it?

271
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,320
Whatever, my ass!

272
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,786
Come on, Dan.

273
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:46,353
Are you going to put up
with that? Say something.

274
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:48,686
What? Me?

275
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:51,120
Yes. You hate Choi.

276
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,366
So don't hold back,
but fire away at him!

277
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,733
When did I ever say I hate him?

278
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:07,820
Mr. Yeon,

279
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,220
I think no more dumplings for you.

280
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,486
There are 8 dumplings in total,

281
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:13,420
which means two per person.

282
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,953
But you've already had
your two, haven't you?

283
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:17,653
Jeez, do you have to be
so stingy over dumplings?

284
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:19,520
We can always order more.

285
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,220
Then should we?

286
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,900
But it might take some time
before they're cooked.

287
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:26,633
Right, we can't really
afford to wait, huh?

288
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:29,733
Then why don't you just
offer yours to me?

289
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:31,020
Oh no, thank you.

290
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,253
I quite like the dumplings here.

291
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,320
So,

292
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,033
I won't ever give this
dumpling to you.

293
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,233
Because it'll be such a waste.

294
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,620
I'm never going to
let you have her.

295
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,766
Because she's too good for
the likes of you.

296
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,566
Jeez, do you know how much
this shirt is?

297
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,400
Oh jeez.

298
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,200
What's wrong, Ms. Dan?

299
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,833
I know, right?

300
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:15,000
What's wrong with you,
covering up your cheek?

301
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,600
Is it a toothache?

302
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,120
Your molar's rotting, is it?

303
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,286
Say ah for me. Let me see.

304
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:30,986
If it hurts so much,
then go see a dentist.

305
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,420
It's not like that.

306
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,353
What's not like that?

307
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,786
That pose has to mean
it's a toothache.

308
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,553
You know, your expression isn't
always so bright to begin with,

309
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:40,153
so imagine how uncomfortable
your clients may feel.

310
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:42,720
Go see a dentist,
if it hurts so much.

311
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,153
It's not...!

312
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:46,233
...a toothache.

313
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:02,033
Oh, you like salad?

314
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,400
Bulgogi,

315
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,466
black bean noodles,

316
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,500
kimchi stew meal,

317
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,933
pizza...

318
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,800
They all sound good.

319
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,833
Oh what? Lunchtime is almost up.

320
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:27,700
When's he coming?

321
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,833
(Mr. Kwon Jung-rok)

322
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,086
Ah, Mr. Kwon! When will you...

323
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,166
What?

324
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:38,553
You're going to be late?

325
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:41,420
It's taking longer than
I expected...

326
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,420
I'll just grab a bite to eat here,

327
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,886
so you enjoy your lunch
without me.

328
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:48,453
Alright.

329
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:50,920
I'll see you later, then.

330
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,066
Bye.

331
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,500
I should've just joined
Ms. Yang earlier.

332
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:06,753
That was delicious.

333
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,653
Don't you think the stew was
a bit salty today?

334
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:10,720
You think so?

335
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,520
You had two bowls of rice,

336
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,953
so I thought you liked it.

337
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:16,020
I had two bowls,
because it was that salty.

338
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,686
I was trying to neutralize the
saltiness with it!

339
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:20,900
Then drink water,
why have more rice?

340
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,320
They say dandelion tea
helps with rhinitis.

341
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,933
Drink this, instead of coffee.

342
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:31,800
By the way, when are you
going to repay your debt?

343
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,820
There was no smoking gun

344
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,686
among the articles we seized
that may attest to his crime.

345
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:02,753
At this rate, an extension for
Jung Ji-ho's detention

346
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,333
may be rejected.

347
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:08,920
When he was first indicted for
his gambling trips,

348
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,220
I'm sure his company got to work.

349
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,400
So it doesn't surprise me.

350
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:18,020
His lawyer, Choi Yeon-su, is
an expert in that field, you see.

351
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,333
You know Mr. Choi?

352
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,966
I used to.

353
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,600
He was a senior colleague in
the Special Investigations Unit.

354
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:27,953
He was once our best
prosecutor when it came to

355
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:30,420
having violators of
economic laws arrested.

356
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,820
But now,

357
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,733
he's wiping asses for
the chaebols.

358
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,020
Anyway, thanks for this.
I'll take care of the rest.

359
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,133
Sure.

360
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,786
How about dinner next week?
I'll repay you.

361
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:49,186
What is it? Who's making you
smile like that?

362
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,400
- Yeo-reum.
- Pardon?

363
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,786
While we're on the subject,
let me make this clear.

364
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:56,486
I'm still hung up on Yu Yeo-reum,

365
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,353
and she's the only woman for me.

366
00:21:58,433 --> 00:21:59,800
and she's the only woman for me.

367
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:03,233
So don't you cross the line
from now on.

368
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,753
I don't want to lose
a competent partner.

369
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,933
I don't want to lose
a competent partner.

370
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,353
Mr. Kwon, here are the
files you asked for.

371
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:20,433
Thank you.

372
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:23,753
It's time to go home,
so call it a day.

373
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:24,900
Alright.

374
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:29,920
Um, uh...

375
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,053
I didn't have lunch today, so...

376
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:34,066
Why didn't you have lunch?

377
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:36,120
Why else?

378
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,086
I was waiting to
have lunch with you,

379
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,620
but then you suddenly called
and said you're eating out.

380
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,033
So I just had Job's Tears tea again.

381
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,820
Then you should've grabbed
something to eat on your own.

382
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,286
But you know me.

383
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,853
I can't eat by myself.

384
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:53,766
Why can't you eat
by yourself, anyway?

385
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:57,953
Mr. Kwon, after seeing me
every day,

386
00:22:58,033 --> 00:23:00,753
I guess you've become
desensitized to the fact that

387
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,486
I was a celebrity once.

388
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:06,153
I could run into trouble
while I'm out alone,

389
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:09,586
and besides, I was a top celebrity
so people wouldn't have

390
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,653
left me alone.

391
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:13,886
But that's not the
case now, is it?

392
00:23:13,966 --> 00:23:15,733
Please!

393
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,500
That's true, but...

394
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:22,120
I've never done it before,

395
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,566
so I'm not so confident about
trying it all of a sudden...

396
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:28,586
I'd also rather not,
in case I'm pitied.

397
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,053
Anyway, this is something
that's hard for me.

398
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:32,620
Then why don't we go get
something to eat first?

399
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,400
You must be hungry.

400
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,220
That's a great idea.

401
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,166
I'll get ready to go, then.

402
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,120
So this is one of the
places you want to recommend?

403
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,953
- Is it popular?
- Rather than that,

404
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:02,266
it's targeted for
single customers.

405
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:04,720
Single customers?

406
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,820
Yes. The tables are walled off,

407
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,886
so you won't know

408
00:24:09,966 --> 00:24:11,186
who's next to you and
what they're eating.

409
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,986
It's the perfect place to
get used to eating alone.

410
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:15,066
Wait. Just hold on.

411
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:18,086
Get used to eating alone?

412
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,953
But I don't understand
why we should,

413
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:21,786
when we're here together.

414
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:23,053
We need to practice,

415
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:26,500
so you won't go hungry again
while I'm gone.

416
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,853
But I'd still
rather not eat alone...

417
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:32,453
If you can't eat alone,

418
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:34,886
there's nothing you can do alone.

419
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:37,766
Let me help you, so let's take
one small step at a time.

420
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,566
Why are you sitting so far away?

421
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,766
I want you to think that
you're really here alone.

422
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,766
Mr. Kwon, would you like
some fried dumplings?

423
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,453
Please pretend
you're really here alone,

424
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:38,566
and concentrate on your meal.

425
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:47,286
But to be honest with you,
this is so awkward that

426
00:25:47,366 --> 00:25:50,320
I just don't know where to look.

427
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,320
I thought it might be better
if I chat as I eat.

428
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,486
That will only make
your stay here longer.

429
00:25:56,566 --> 00:26:00,266
So concentrate on your meal,
and save the chat for later.

430
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,200
But uh... Mr. Kwon?

431
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:48,266
I thought I told you to
concentrate on your meal.

432
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:50,520
No, what I wanted to ask is...

433
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,053
Could you take a photo of me,
eating all alone, by myself?

434
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:57,366
This is a meaningful achievement
for me, so I want to celebrate.

435
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,466
I'd like a paparazzi cut,
if possible.

436
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:29,886
- Huh?
- Ah, Mr. Lee.

437
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:31,253
You're off late, aren't you?

438
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:34,353
I'd been behind on
some of my work.

439
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:35,386
What about you, Ms. Yang?

440
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:37,720
I was having tea
with an acquaintance.

441
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,400
Oh, I see.

442
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:56,786
She must be really tired.

443
00:27:56,866 --> 00:28:00,233
She'd dozed off like this
when I first saw her, too.

444
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:12,653
I'm sorry.

445
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,153
My name is Lee Du-seob,
and I will be starting here today

446
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:16,253
as your paralegal.

447
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,100
He's an ex-detective,
so he'll be able to help us a lot.

448
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,753
Ms. Yang, I told you to go home.

449
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:25,566
Oh, I will as soon as
I tidy these up.

450
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:29,320
- Yes, hello?
- Sigh...

451
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,120
Ms. Yang sure looks exhausted.

452
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,633
And when she goes home,
she has a kid to look after, too!

453
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,200
She has a child?

454
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:37,900
Isn't she cute?

455
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,820
Her teacher sent me this photo,
and she looked too cute.

456
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,286
Yes, she's adorable.

457
00:28:46,366 --> 00:28:49,020
I thought she had
a beautiful smile,

458
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,553
so hoped that from now on,

459
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:55,086
she'll only have reasons to smile

460
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:59,553
after all that life had
thrown at her.

461
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:02,386
Maybe it was from then,

462
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:04,933
that I fell for… Huh?

463
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,300
Ms. Yang.

464
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,186
Ms. Yang?

465
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:17,653
- You're here.
- What, already?

466
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:18,820
Thank you every time.

467
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,886
I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Lee.

468
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,500
- Alright. Take care.
- Sure.

469
00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:42,820
Why are you sitting in the dark?

470
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,900
Huh?

471
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:46,220
Just because...

472
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,833
Mom, I'm hungry.

473
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,686
Thank you for driving me home.

474
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:02,200
Not only do you worry about me
because of the hate comments,

475
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,753
but you also taught me
how to eat all alone.

476
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:05,966
You're really...

477
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,200
Your boyfriend score is
99 out of 100.

478
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:17,800
Why did you deduct one point?

479
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:22,266
Because of the way you talk.

480
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,720
If you can fix that
business-like way of talking,

481
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,000
then it would be 100 out of 100.

482
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,153
Can't you relax a bit more
around me?

483
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:34,020
For example,
when you're calling me.

484
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,966
Don't say "Ms. Oh Jin-sim."
Instead, how about...

485
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,786
"Ms. Jin-sim?"

486
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:41,520
Actually, no.

487
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,766
"Jin-sim!"

488
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,353
- But why...
- Why not?

489
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:50,053
Can't you just be more casual
around me, like when you're with

490
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:51,720
Prosecutors Yu Yeo-reum
and Kim Se-won?

491
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,320
But with them, it's only natural

492
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,120
after all the time
we've known each other.

493
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,086
I really don't know what to say
when you tell me you want me to

494
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:58,953
change the way I talk to you.

495
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:00,800
"I really don't know what to say."

496
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,653
Are you copying me?

497
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:08,986
"Are you copying me?"

498
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:12,786
See? That sounded too formal,
don't you think?

499
00:31:12,866 --> 00:31:14,186
It's intimidating, huh?

500
00:31:14,266 --> 00:31:16,233
No, I find it cute.

501
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,353
It won't be easy for me to change
the way I talk, all of a sudden.

502
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:24,420
Besides, if I suddenly change it,

503
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,453
people'll start suspecting us.

504
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:32,486
I think it's best for you that
we be careful.

505
00:31:32,566 --> 00:31:35,000
Sure. You do have a point.

506
00:31:37,366 --> 00:31:39,820
By the way, I've been curious.

507
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,553
- Huh?
- You've one month to go

508
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,386
before your contract ends.

509
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:47,053
What will you do after this?

510
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:49,320
- Pardon?
- It seems you've always had

511
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,586
an interest in law to
choose it as your major.

512
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,953
Do you plan on continuing
down this path?

513
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:56,866
Well, uh...

514
00:31:58,466 --> 00:31:59,466
Oh my God!

515
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:00,866
Gosh, Hyuk-jun!

516
00:32:04,766 --> 00:32:05,866
Go away, go!

517
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:07,066
Hey!

518
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:11,586
Hyuk-jun, why are you here?

519
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:13,920
I told you I can get home
fine on my own.

520
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,420
I came over to bring you
some food.

521
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,633
So, Mr. Kwon.

522
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:25,100
What's gotten into you today,
driving her home?

523
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:27,186
What's wrong with you this time?

524
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:28,286
But I mean it.

525
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:29,620
What if the paparazzi snaps
a photo of you two

526
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,420
alone together, in the car?

527
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,486
What... What?

528
00:32:32,566 --> 00:32:34,920
You know the paparazzi haven't
been after me for ages.

529
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,066
Gosh, please. Come on!

530
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,700
Mr. Kwon, please take care.

531
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,333
Let's go!

532
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,166
Oh my God. Where'd you go?

533
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:51,033
What's wrong with you?

534
00:32:56,366 --> 00:32:57,400
Hurry up!

535
00:32:57,966 --> 00:33:00,466
He's extremely worried for
his cousin, isn't he?

536
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:09,186
You know, I...

537
00:33:09,266 --> 00:33:12,066
I really don't understand
your relationship with him.

538
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:14,653
One minute I think
you actually like him,

539
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:17,253
but the next minute, I wonder
if you hate him that much.

540
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,386
And today, it was as if
you two are best friends!

541
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:20,386
You looked so close, too.

542
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:21,553
We are.

543
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,033
He's grown on me.

544
00:33:26,566 --> 00:33:29,920
By the way, about this project...

545
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,920
This "project?"

546
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,086
Yes, this project where
I'm working at a law firm

547
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:35,386
because I want that role in
Lee Se-jin's new drama.

548
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:38,853
- Oh, right.
- Can't I...

549
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,853
...mention it to Mr. Kwon?

550
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:42,853
Why?

551
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,053
Why would you want to?

552
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:48,953
Well, I'm starting to feel bad
about lying to him.

553
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:52,166
I see him every day, so I feel
a pang of conscience.

554
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:54,220
Though Ms. Lee and Mr. Yeon

555
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,600
both told me to keep it
confidential, of course,

556
00:33:56,766 --> 00:34:00,720
Mr. Kwon's not someone to
blab about it,

557
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,100
so I'd like to tell him the truth.

558
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:09,753
Hyuk-jun, Mr. Kwon is
someone we can trust.

559
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,286
I bet if I tell him my full story,

560
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:13,120
he'll understand everything.

561
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,853
But Yoon-seo,

562
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:17,153
while I know you're
starting to feel guilty,

563
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:19,520
this project is all about
confidentiality.

564
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,386
Lee Se-jin wants people to
judge it based on its contents.

565
00:34:22,466 --> 00:34:24,186
Her first condition was that

566
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:25,820
your casting is kept confidential

567
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,386
until the official announcement.

568
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,333
So we have to keep that promise.

569
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,320
I'm just worried that
he may be disappointed

570
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,453
if he learns the truth later.

571
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:36,433
You'll never see him again
once you quit anyway!

572
00:34:37,566 --> 00:34:40,953
Yoon-seo, instead of worrying about
disappointing that lawyer,

573
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:43,120
why don't you worry about
me and Mr. Yeon,

574
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,933
who'll be disappointed if
this project goes to waste?

575
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,753
Ha...

576
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:56,100
It's difficult for me to tell him,

577
00:34:57,633 --> 00:35:00,066
but it makes me guilty
not telling him...

578
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,566
Will he feel betrayed
when he learns the truth later?

579
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:06,766
Because I never told him honestly?

580
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,300
Ha...

581
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,066
Alright, squid.

582
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:23,000
- You're late.
- Yes.

583
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:26,766
You were on a date with
the cosmic goddess, were you?

584
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:30,133
Can you stop that before
I send you off to outer space?

585
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:32,320
How about a beer?
With some grilled squid?

586
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,466
I'm alright.

587
00:35:54,366 --> 00:35:55,733
Well, since she wants me to...

588
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:57,866
Let's try this.

589
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:01,886
Ms. Jin-sim.

590
00:36:01,966 --> 00:36:02,966
Hey, Jin-sim.

591
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:06,853
Did you get home alright?

592
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:10,220
Jin-sim. Jin-sim? Jin-sim!

593
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,120
Jin-sim, you're really pretty.

594
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,600
That's so cringing.

595
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,433
Looks so good.

596
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:23,353
Jin-sim. Jin-sim?

597
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,466
Jin-sim. Jin-sim.

598
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,366
- Jin-sim...
- I really can't watch anymore.

599
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:34,453
You were probably with her
all day,

600
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:36,966
and here you are,
still calling her name.

601
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:39,520
Yep, it's love. It's love alright.

602
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,033
Can you knock, please?

603
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:42,286
Come over here for a second.

604
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,366
Why?

605
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:45,286
Are you going to show me
some pictures of your love,

606
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:46,753
the cosmic goddess?

607
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,586
No, I'm going to show you

608
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:50,200
pictures of some rooms that are
available for rent.

609
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,600
(Rooms Direct)

610
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,820
Hey, this isn't bad.

611
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,353
You can move in right away.

612
00:36:56,433 --> 00:36:57,733
- Right away?
- Yes.

613
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,953
Right away...
That's heartless, man.

614
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:02,200
See the details of
the inside, too.

615
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:05,153
First, scroll to the left,

616
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:07,186
- then to the right.
- That’s too much detail.

617
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,186
You know,

618
00:37:08,266 --> 00:37:10,086
let me take some time
searching for one.

619
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,333
I'll leave you to
your practice, then.

620
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,966
Jin-sim, do you want to
go for lunch together?

621
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,353
Oh my gosh.

622
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:27,053
That's just pushing the line.

623
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:28,333
Right?

624
00:37:30,766 --> 00:37:32,520
What are you watching?

625
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,486
This is a video that was uploaded
onto a web board I visit often.

626
00:37:35,566 --> 00:37:37,353
Someone secretly took
a video of some teenagers

627
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:39,520
bullying their friend.

628
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,920
Do you want to watch it?

629
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Sure.

630
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:45,186
Keep your promise, alright?

631
00:37:45,266 --> 00:37:46,366
Oh my gosh.

632
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,320
Kids these days, right?

633
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,200
Yes, right.

634
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,253
What do you mean?

635
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:54,366
My daughter's at the
police station?

636
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
(Sangdo Police Station)

637
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,553
Keep your promise, alright?

638
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:03,433
- Next time...
- Hold on.

639
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,953
So you're saying
this is my daughter.

640
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:08,720
Mom, it's not me.

641
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,400
Really, it's not me!

642
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,353
That's what your daughter claims,

643
00:38:15,433 --> 00:38:17,786
but everyone else in the video -

644
00:38:17,866 --> 00:38:20,486
that's not just the victim,
Ms. Park Min-ju,

645
00:38:20,566 --> 00:38:22,820
but the other
school bullies too -

646
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,953
they're claiming
your daughter is the offender.

647
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:27,100
Claim? It's fact!

648
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,686
She's been taking money
from my daughter,

649
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:33,633
bullying her for no reason...

650
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,866
It really breaks my heart,
you know.

651
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,933
It's not just one or two cents
you took from her.

652
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:43,786
Where did you spend
all that money, huh?

653
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:45,920
It wasn't me. I mean it!

654
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,100
Whatever!

655
00:38:47,433 --> 00:38:49,186
How dare you lie to
get out of this?

656
00:38:49,266 --> 00:38:50,753
So wicked at your age!

657
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,086
Excuse me, ma'am,

658
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:53,686
I understand your frustration,

659
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:55,820
but we still don't know
the full story, so,

660
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,286
could you not jump to
conclusions, please?

661
00:38:57,366 --> 00:38:58,553
Not know the full story?

662
00:38:58,633 --> 00:39:00,953
But we have witnesses!

663
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:03,286
And there's the evidence,
right here!

664
00:39:03,366 --> 00:39:05,586
But you can't make out the
face of the girl

665
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:06,986
in this video,

666
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:09,353
and therefore it's too early to
conclude she's really my daughter.

667
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:12,053
Besides, she doesn't even own
down coats like that.

668
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:13,053
- Still...
- But most of all,

669
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:15,720
the biggest reason why
I don’t think that is my daughter

670
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,953
is because she's not someone to
do such a thing.

671
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:21,320
She's not someone to
bully her peers like that.

672
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,733
Ha, please...

673
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:26,133
Excuse me, ma'am.

674
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,220
But that's what every parent with

675
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,953
problematic children say.

676
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:32,800
That their child's not like that.

677
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:35,820
Well, your child is like that.

678
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,920
She's rude, and
cruel to her friends!

679
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,900
I thought I asked you already,

680
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,366
to refrain from making
such harsh comments.

681
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,586
Sir, if you think
there's a problem,

682
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:48,586
please go by the manual.

683
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:49,733
Let's go.

684
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:53,353
I'm going to sue you.

685
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,400
I'm going to sue both of you!

686
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:02,786
Don't worry.

687
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:04,766
Mom will take care of it.

688
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,186
Thanks, Mom. For believing me.

689
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:10,020
No need to thank me.

690
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,366
Of course I believe you,
you're my daughter.

691
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,033
You're going to be late for
your cram school. You should go.

692
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,386
Get something to eat

693
00:40:21,466 --> 00:40:22,666
if you feel hungry, alright?

694
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:25,886
Alright.

695
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,366
I'm off, Mom.

696
00:40:27,766 --> 00:40:29,033
Take care.

697
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:42,833
Oh, I see.

698
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:46,333
Don't worry too much, Ms. Yang.

699
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:48,986
We've lawyers right here.

700
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:50,066
Alright.

701
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,553
Yes, we'll discuss the
details tomorrow.

702
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:54,120
Don't worry.

703
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
Alright.

704
00:40:57,866 --> 00:40:59,966
Did something happen to Ms. Yang?

705
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,520
Her daughter's been accused of

706
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,033
bullying her peers.

707
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:09,266
It sounds like she's been framed.

708
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,086
Do you think you can help, Kwon?

709
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:12,466
Of course.

710
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,900
Really?

711
00:41:14,566 --> 00:41:15,666
That was unexpected.

712
00:41:16,466 --> 00:41:17,486
Unexpected?

713
00:41:17,566 --> 00:41:18,786
What is your opinion of me,
anyway?

714
00:41:18,866 --> 00:41:19,966
Cold and callous.

715
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,700
And competent.

716
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:24,200
Anyway,

717
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,320
please do Ms. Yang a favor.

718
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,933
Her daughter's
her only family, you know.

719
00:41:36,633 --> 00:41:38,266
I still can't believe it.

720
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:40,200
What do they take my daughter for?

721
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,733
Oh God.

722
00:41:54,633 --> 00:41:56,966
She should've hung this up!

723
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,866
Hey, what's...

724
00:42:02,033 --> 00:42:03,033
Huh?

725
00:42:13,966 --> 00:42:15,433
Your call cannot be connected...

726
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:20,433
Why isn't she picking up?

727
00:42:21,866 --> 00:42:23,100
It can't be her...

728
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,533
Did you really have to?

729
00:42:27,733 --> 00:42:31,633
Jin-hee, I didn't do it
on purpose...

730
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:49,266
Ms. Yang, cheer up. Hmmm?

731
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,120
Our ace lawyer, Kwon, said

732
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,766
he'll gladly step up to help.
So what's the problem?

733
00:42:53,966 --> 00:42:56,886
Yes, so don't worry, Ms. Yang.

734
00:42:56,966 --> 00:42:58,753
I'm sure it'll all go well.

735
00:42:58,833 --> 00:42:59,920
From what I heard,

736
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,600
your daughter was wrongly accused.

737
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,266
I don't think...

738
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,800
...it was a false accusation.

739
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:14,200
It looks like...

740
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:17,800
...I failed to
bring her up properly.

741
00:43:40,366 --> 00:43:42,566
I saw her bullying her peer.

742
00:43:45,366 --> 00:43:49,953
And that down coat...
I asked where she got it,

743
00:43:50,033 --> 00:43:52,653
but from how she
refused to say anything,

744
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:53,933
it seems like...

745
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:58,000
She bought it with the money
she took from the other kids.

746
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,833
I always felt guilty

747
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:07,366
I couldn't bring her up
in a wealthy environment,

748
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:12,000
but still, I could confidently say
I showered her with much love.

749
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,800
So I thought

750
00:44:17,766 --> 00:44:20,833
I'd raised her up to be
a good girl,

751
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,733
yet how...

752
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:27,133
How could she do such a thing?

753
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:32,533
Ms. Yang...

754
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:58,700
Tsk, what do we do?

755
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,533
She really treasures
her daughter, you know.

756
00:45:03,933 --> 00:45:07,986
Are you sure the girl in the
white down coat is Jin-hee?

757
00:45:08,066 --> 00:45:09,086
Well, all the evidence say so.

758
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:11,233
Even Ms. Yang says so, too.

759
00:45:11,933 --> 00:45:13,353
But Jin-hee has
consistently denied that

760
00:45:13,433 --> 00:45:15,253
it wasn't her who did it.

761
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:17,420
Besides, in a situation like this,

762
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,700
it's the parents who are
the least objective.

763
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,833
Because they can't help but
become emotional.

764
00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:25,400
That's why we mustn't lose focus
but concentrate on the facts.

765
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,720
You're right.

766
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,386
Besides, we can't make out
the offender's face.

767
00:45:29,466 --> 00:45:31,053
And there's a probability that

768
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:32,953
the witnesses are lying.

769
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:35,653
So I think we shouldn't

770
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,253
straight up assume that

771
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:39,420
our offender is guilty,
in this case.

772
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,220
Then as you suggested,

773
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,453
I'll stand on Jin-hee's side

774
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:44,533
and listen to what she has to say.

775
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,266
May I take
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo with me?

776
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,666
Sure, do that.

777
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,733
I heard a lot about you
from Ms. Yang.

778
00:46:04,266 --> 00:46:06,453
I've always wanted to meet you.

779
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:07,766
Hello.

780
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,153
It wasn't me.

781
00:46:11,233 --> 00:46:13,400
It really wasn't me.

782
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:18,000
I know. We believe you.

783
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,100
So can you tell us honestly
about what really happened?

784
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:29,320
Um... The victim said

785
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,886
it was you who bullied her.

786
00:46:31,966 --> 00:46:33,566
What could her reasons be?

787
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,320
Does she hold a grudge
against you or something?

788
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,786
I don't even know her.

789
00:46:38,866 --> 00:46:40,386
Then what about the other bullies?

790
00:46:40,466 --> 00:46:43,566
They made you a scapegoat.
You don't know them either?

791
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:51,653
Then...

792
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:53,686
Could you tell us about
that down coat in question?

793
00:46:53,766 --> 00:46:56,000
Your mother says she doesn't
remember you having it.

794
00:46:58,166 --> 00:47:00,466
I'm sorry, but may I go?

795
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,486
Even Mom doesn't believe me,

796
00:47:02,566 --> 00:47:04,566
so what more can I say?

797
00:47:08,266 --> 00:47:09,433
- Jin-hee!
- Uh...

798
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,486
That's the girl from
the video, right?

799
00:47:13,566 --> 00:47:14,820
You wouldn't think
she's capable of it.

800
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,633
- Right?
- What's wrong with her?

801
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,800
Excuse me...

802
00:47:26,033 --> 00:47:27,320
Why are you following me?

803
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,120
I've no more to say.

804
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,233
Oh.

805
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,733
Jin-hee, uh...

806
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:37,000
Do you like teokbokki?

807
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:38,666
Pardon?

808
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,800
How did it go?

809
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:47,520
Well...

810
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,633
She kept her mouth shut,
to the very end.

811
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,986
But you know,

812
00:47:52,066 --> 00:47:55,333
I got the impression that
she's not a bad kid.

813
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:57,220
Or perhaps,

814
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,020
she's being blackmailed.

815
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,400
Blackmailed? By who?

816
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:04,900
You mean the real offender?

817
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,620
Is that why she's refusing to
say anything

818
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,633
despite all she's going through,
because she's scared?

819
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:15,986
Usually, there are two reasons
why people refuse to

820
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:17,020
name the offenders.

821
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,953
The first is that
they're being blackmailed,

822
00:48:19,033 --> 00:48:22,100
the second is that
they want to protect them.

823
00:48:23,366 --> 00:48:25,933
As for Jin-hee,
I think it's the latter.

824
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,686
According to the victim's mother,

825
00:48:31,766 --> 00:48:34,953
the victim had been constantly
bullied by her peers.

826
00:48:35,033 --> 00:48:37,320
- So I wondered if this was true,
- Hold on.

827
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,553
and checked the security cameras
in places where Jin-hee

828
00:48:39,633 --> 00:48:41,053
- and the victim may have met.
- Do you know her?

829
00:48:41,133 --> 00:48:42,120
Yes.

830
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,000
This was the girl Jin-hee was
having a fight with.

831
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,466
I thought Jin-hee was
bullying her.

832
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:54,166
Um, excuse me.

833
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,420
Who are you, lady?

834
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,133
I'm Jin-hee's mother.

835
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:02,200
Can we talk?

836
00:49:02,866 --> 00:49:04,553
The offender, Park Seon-young,

837
00:49:04,633 --> 00:49:08,053
was a childhood friend
of Jin-hee's.

838
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:09,653
But from some time ago,

839
00:49:09,733 --> 00:49:11,953
she started hanging out with
the school bullies,

840
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:13,220
she started hanging out with
the school bullies,

841
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,353
and ended up physically
assaulting the victim

842
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:16,820
while wearing the down coat
she borrowed from Jin-hee.

843
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,420
But then the video went viral,

844
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,120
and afraid of the consequences,

845
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,320
she laid the blame on Jin-hee,
who owned that down coat.

846
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,453
Then...

847
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:27,953
The reason Jin-hee
kept silent about this, was...

848
00:49:28,033 --> 00:49:29,986
She was an old friend,

849
00:49:30,066 --> 00:49:31,886
so I guess she was
waiting for her to confess,

850
00:49:31,966 --> 00:49:34,200
because she still cared for her.

851
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,220
But now that the real offender
has confessed,

852
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,253
the police will soon
close the case as solved.

853
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:42,420
And then they'll go by the manual
from then on.

854
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,766
I'm glad to hear that.

855
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,566
Did you have something to say?

856
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:09,233
Though I promised Jin-hee
I'll keep it a secret,

857
00:50:10,066 --> 00:50:12,400
I thought you should know.

858
00:50:12,733 --> 00:50:14,233
To be honest,

859
00:50:15,366 --> 00:50:17,500
Jin-hee says she's been
meeting with her father.

860
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,800
I don't want to see you
anymore, Dad.

861
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,253
I don't want to
deceive Mom like this.

862
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:29,720
I don't think that's fair.

863
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,686
That down coat, too.

864
00:50:31,766 --> 00:50:33,453
She says her father
bought it for her.

865
00:50:33,533 --> 00:50:34,833
Really?

866
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:37,200
Then why didn't she just tell me?

867
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,953
Well, uh...

868
00:50:39,033 --> 00:50:40,986
She said she couldn't
tell you honestly,

869
00:50:41,066 --> 00:50:43,320
in case it might hurt you.

870
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,433
I think Jin-hee must've
had a hard time,

871
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,186
unable to say anything about

872
00:50:49,266 --> 00:50:51,753
how she met her father and

873
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:54,333
how an old friend had
laid the blame on her.

874
00:51:04,266 --> 00:51:06,086
So you met Dad?

875
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:07,233
Huh?

876
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:09,120
I saw you with him,

877
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,766
while passing by.

878
00:51:11,766 --> 00:51:12,933
That's...

879
00:51:16,966 --> 00:51:18,400
I'm sorry, Mom.

880
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,633
Why are you apologizing?

881
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:28,766
But he hurt you, Mom.

882
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,200
You must hate him.

883
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm sorry for seeing him
behind your back.

884
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:39,933
No!

885
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,366
I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

886
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,666
I should've known
you needed your father.

887
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:51,253
I'm sorry for putting
such a burden on you

888
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:53,653
by failing to understand you.

889
00:51:53,733 --> 00:51:55,266
I'm really sorry.

890
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,566
And...

891
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,066
I'm sorry that

892
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:06,900
I didn't believe you to
the very end.

893
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:09,366
I'm sorry, my daughter.

894
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:17,866
Don't cry.

895
00:52:32,033 --> 00:52:33,400
Thank you.

896
00:52:35,366 --> 00:52:36,666
Thank you.

897
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,200
Aw, that's so cute.
You shouldn't have.

898
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,166
But you went through
so much trouble for me.

899
00:52:42,366 --> 00:52:44,086
I'm so grateful for everything,
and I'm sorry.

900
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:46,053
Why should you be sorry?

901
00:52:46,133 --> 00:52:47,153
Everyone here is

902
00:52:47,233 --> 00:52:49,753
extremely indebted to your mother.

903
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,720
This is nothing compared to

904
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,686
what your mother does for us,

905
00:52:53,766 --> 00:52:55,453
so don't you ever say sorry.

906
00:52:55,533 --> 00:52:56,953
- Alright.
- And

907
00:52:57,033 --> 00:52:58,220
remain the nice girl you are now

908
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,120
and don't make your mother cry.

909
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,220
You know how much

910
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,086
your mother cares for you, right?

911
00:53:03,166 --> 00:53:04,633
Of course I do.

912
00:53:10,466 --> 00:53:11,733
This is so cute.

913
00:53:12,533 --> 00:53:14,420
Is everything alright with
Yoon-seo at her work?

914
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,520
No more troubles with that
Kwon Jung-rok or whatever?

915
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,166
No, all's been smooth lately.

916
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,920
Goodness, how on earth did

917
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,920
Yoon-seo end up with
a boss like that?

918
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,553
Do you know what the biggest
source of stress at work is?

919
00:53:25,633 --> 00:53:27,933
Your boss, I tell you. Your boss!

920
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:29,586
Why are they never satisfied?

921
00:53:29,666 --> 00:53:30,786
They always pick
faults with everything,

922
00:53:30,866 --> 00:53:33,820
and nag at their employees...

923
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,053
Ugh, I hate that.

924
00:53:35,133 --> 00:53:36,053
It's really not cool, you know?

925
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:37,186
No it's not.

926
00:53:37,266 --> 00:53:38,833
I couldn't agree with you more!

927
00:53:43,033 --> 00:53:44,020
By the way,

928
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,733
is that the only shirt you have?

929
00:53:45,966 --> 00:53:47,453
You wore that the day before
yesterday, didn't you?

930
00:53:47,533 --> 00:53:49,020
Oh, did I?

931
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,886
You sure have an eye, sir.

932
00:53:50,966 --> 00:53:51,986
No, really. I'm impressed.

933
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:53,253
Are you planning to wear
that $30 shirt for

934
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:54,820
another 3 gazillion years?

935
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,020
What, is it a part of you now?

936
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,886
Think of our company's image!

937
00:53:57,966 --> 00:53:59,153
Go buy a new one.

938
00:53:59,233 --> 00:54:00,266
Yes, sir.

939
00:54:05,433 --> 00:54:06,466
Ah, hot!

940
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:10,666
Why do you drink coffee
like it's mouthwash?

941
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,200
Slurp, slurp, gargle.

942
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:15,320
I really hate how you're so noisy

943
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,386
when you eat or drink. Stop that.

944
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:18,466
Yes, sir.

945
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:21,353
Why?

946
00:54:21,433 --> 00:54:23,100
- Am I getting on your nerves?
- No.

947
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,566
Gosh, it's hot.

948
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,520
Um, Mr. Yeon?

949
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,086
There's something for
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo.

950
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:37,086
Oh, really?

951
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:38,200
Put it right there.

952
00:54:43,066 --> 00:54:46,000
Gosh, it's been a long time
Yoon-seo's received gifts.

953
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,466
Who knew she had such
a dedicated fan?

954
00:54:56,633 --> 00:54:57,553
Hey.

955
00:54:57,633 --> 00:54:58,620
Hey, this...

956
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,866
Isn't that what that bastard
used to send?

957
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:02,366
Yes.

958
00:55:05,066 --> 00:55:08,186
Where did you say
Lee Kang-joon was again?

959
00:55:08,266 --> 00:55:10,433
As far as I know, he's in the U.S.

960
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:30,886
Unlike our steels business,

961
00:55:30,966 --> 00:55:33,486
Empire Bio is doing fantastic.

962
00:55:33,566 --> 00:55:36,800
We're currently looking at
a 30% increase in sales.

963
00:55:42,466 --> 00:55:44,200
So I see she's doing well.

964
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,466
Why are you looking at me
like that?

965
00:56:03,066 --> 00:56:04,466
Because you're amazing.

966
00:56:05,966 --> 00:56:07,086
Huh?

967
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:08,433
What's this, all of a sudden?

968
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:10,353
I just admire you

969
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:12,920
whenever I see you
solve cases like this,

970
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,800
every time.

971
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,486
I think lawyers are truly amazing.

972
00:56:18,566 --> 00:56:20,633
I think lawyers are truly amazing.

973
00:56:22,266 --> 00:56:23,920
To tell you the truth,

974
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,533
I didn't go to law school
because I was interested in law.

975
00:56:28,166 --> 00:56:30,920
You see, I made my debut
when I was still in high school

976
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,820
and my Dad was highly against it
at the time.

977
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,386
He was scared that

978
00:56:35,466 --> 00:56:38,766
his precious daughter will
end up getting hurt.

979
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:42,653
But I wouldn't give in,

980
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,553
and he said, he'll approve

981
00:56:44,633 --> 00:56:46,753
if I get into law school.

982
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:47,886
You know those cliched lines.

983
00:56:47,966 --> 00:56:50,353
"Not over my dead body!"

984
00:56:50,433 --> 00:56:51,700
You know.

985
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,633
That's how impossible it sounded
back then.

986
00:56:55,933 --> 00:56:59,020
I wasn't the smartest in the class,

987
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,353
but I studied with all my might

988
00:57:01,433 --> 00:57:04,500
and miraculously, got in!

989
00:57:05,233 --> 00:57:08,833
As I said before,
I have a great memory.

990
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:13,386
Anyway, because I went to
law school for that reason

991
00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:15,020
I thought it wasn't for me

992
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,366
so I quit after just one semester.

993
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,720
But who knew I'd come to
admire this career path?

994
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,820
I'm now regretting it that

995
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,400
I should've put some heart to it.

996
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:29,233
It's never too late.

997
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,286
If you ever want to
go back to your studies,

998
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:33,886
I'm here to help you.

999
00:57:33,966 --> 00:57:35,486
After all, aren't you here

1000
00:57:35,566 --> 00:57:37,200
because you wanted some
experience in this field?

1001
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:40,900
Pardon?

1002
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:44,520
Kwon.

1003
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,600
Yes?

1004
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:47,253
How about a drink with me

1005
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:50,100
and Yoon-seo, after work today?

1006
00:57:52,466 --> 00:57:54,200
- Pardon?
- For Ms. Yang's case.

1007
00:57:54,966 --> 00:57:57,786
I made a reservation to
treat you all,

1008
00:57:57,866 --> 00:58:00,020
because you wouldn't accept
payment for all your troubles.

1009
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,500
But Mr. Lee says
he can't make it tonight.

1010
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,866
So why don't we just
make it us three, then?

1011
00:58:06,366 --> 00:58:07,433
So?

1012
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,420
Yoon-seo?

1013
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,453
How about it?

1014
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:12,553
I'm up for it.

1015
00:58:12,633 --> 00:58:14,833
Alright, then I'll see you later.

1016
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,966
Maybe I should've refused.

1017
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,653
You see, I'm not in
my best condition today...

1018
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:25,133
Then I'll drink for you.

1019
00:58:25,733 --> 00:58:27,100
You will?

1020
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:29,953
Are you much of a drinker?

1021
00:58:30,033 --> 00:58:32,586
It's not that I can't drink,

1022
00:58:32,666 --> 00:58:35,400
it's that I hate people seeing me
when I can't control myself.

1023
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:37,286
That's why I always hold back,

1024
00:58:37,366 --> 00:58:40,233
and make sure I don't
go over my limit.

1025
00:58:40,933 --> 00:58:42,353
In a way, you can say that

1026
00:58:42,433 --> 00:58:44,866
I'm very strict when it comes to
taking care of myself.

1027
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,100
Because I've never been
intoxicated, in my life.

1028
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,233
Mr. Yeon.

1029
00:59:06,266 --> 00:59:07,786
Have you heard of Hobbes?

1030
00:59:07,866 --> 00:59:09,886
- Hobbes?
- Yes, Hobbes.

1031
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:11,966
The theorist of the law.

1032
00:59:12,066 --> 00:59:13,686
The one who said that the
natural condition of mankind is

1033
00:59:13,766 --> 00:59:17,720
"war of all against all."

1034
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,786
Well, I can't agree with him.

1035
00:59:20,866 --> 00:59:25,220
Especially regarding his claims on
self-interest and the common good.

1036
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,953
Uh, Kwon?

1037
00:59:27,033 --> 00:59:30,720
I'm now confused whether
we're really at a debating table.

1038
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,333
Can we stop talking about
Hobbes now, please?

1039
00:59:35,233 --> 00:59:37,220
Then...

1040
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,566
How about we discuss a.l.i.c.?

1041
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:42,153
Sure, that sounds good. a.l.i.c.

1042
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:44,520
But who is that? Your ex?

1043
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,966
Some name she has, right?

1044
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,086
Actio libera in causa.

1045
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:52,453
a.l.i.c.

1046
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:54,786
Article 10, Paragraph 3 of
the Criminal Law.

1047
00:59:54,866 --> 00:59:57,353
If a person voluntarily
or involuntarily

1048
00:59:57,433 --> 01:00:00,853
puts him or herself into
a state of automatism

1049
01:00:00,933 --> 01:00:04,020
before committing a crime,

1050
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,366
should he or she be made
liable for his actions?

1051
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:10,800
What are your thoughts, Mr. Yeon?

1052
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,286
My goodness. You're still so
serious and boring,

1053
01:00:15,366 --> 01:00:17,000
even when you're drunk.

1054
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,300
Is. Mr. Kwon always like this
when he's drunk?

1055
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:25,220
I think it's my first time
seeing him drunk.

1056
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,220
Kwon,

1057
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,953
why'd you drink so much
tonight, huh?

1058
01:00:28,033 --> 01:00:29,233
Well, uh...

1059
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:34,020
I was drinking for Ms. Oh Jin-sim,

1060
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,386
so I had a little too much.

1061
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:38,333
She said she wasn't
feeling so well, so...

1062
01:00:39,966 --> 01:00:41,286
Even if she's not,

1063
01:00:41,366 --> 01:00:42,620
why should you?

1064
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,953
When you're heartless and

1065
01:00:44,033 --> 01:00:46,300
have no consideration for others?

1066
01:00:49,933 --> 01:00:50,933
Well...

1067
01:00:52,133 --> 01:00:53,820
I guess he's worried that

1068
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,900
I won't be able to come into
work tomorrow.

1069
01:00:59,866 --> 01:01:01,266
Which brings me to my next point.

1070
01:01:03,733 --> 01:01:04,733
I...

1071
01:01:08,033 --> 01:01:09,753
I need to use the bathroom.

1072
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:10,933
The bathroom.

1073
01:01:12,466 --> 01:01:13,533
Bathroom...

1074
01:01:18,066 --> 01:01:20,186
- Hobbes.
- Hobbes.

1075
01:01:20,266 --> 01:01:21,733
- a.l.i.c.
- a.l.i.c.!

1076
01:01:29,533 --> 01:01:31,686
I thought he was callous,

1077
01:01:31,766 --> 01:01:33,933
but he actually cares
much about you, Yoon-seo.

1078
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,920
- Yes.
- When you told me that

1079
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,186
he's a great mentor to you,

1080
01:01:40,266 --> 01:01:42,120
I doubted it, you know.

1081
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,433
I thought, whatever.

1082
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:48,753
But seeing him take your drinks,

1083
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:51,953
he's been looking out for you
a lot, hasn't he?

1084
01:01:52,033 --> 01:01:55,786
I guess you've both
grown on each other.

1085
01:01:55,866 --> 01:01:56,920
Yes, well...

1086
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,486
I wonder if
he'll be disappointed

1087
01:01:58,566 --> 01:02:01,666
once you're gone, Yoon-seo.

1088
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:06,766
By the way, how's the preparations
going for the new drama?

1089
01:02:10,066 --> 01:02:11,820
When I first heard that

1090
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,853
you'll be coming to
work with us for three months

1091
01:02:14,933 --> 01:02:18,420
because your new role is a lawyer,

1092
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:23,620
I thought my heart was
about to burst!

1093
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,786
But it's goodbye
as soon as we meet, huh?

1094
01:02:25,866 --> 01:02:28,453
There's just less than
a month to go now.

1095
01:02:28,533 --> 01:02:30,753
Why does time fly?

1096
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:32,286
You know, I've been keeping this
strictly confidential,

1097
01:02:32,366 --> 01:02:34,386
so it's only me
who knows about this secret.

1098
01:02:34,466 --> 01:02:37,120
But imagine. When you're
back on TV

1099
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,986
as a lawyer in your new drama,

1100
01:02:40,066 --> 01:02:43,286
how surprised would everyone be
at our law firm, right?

1101
01:02:43,366 --> 01:02:45,286
I bet even Kwon will be surprised,

1102
01:02:45,366 --> 01:02:46,753
though he hardly bats
an eye on most things.

1103
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:47,933
Right?

1104
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:04,020
Thank you, Yoon-seo.

1105
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,266
We owe it all to you.

1106
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,053
I didn't do anything.

1107
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:12,266
Anyway, I'm so glad all the
misunderstandings were cleared.

1108
01:03:21,133 --> 01:03:23,153
Yes, so after this incident,

1109
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:26,986
we promised not to keep any
secrets between each other.

1110
01:03:27,066 --> 01:03:29,486
Because I don't think
secrets should exist

1111
01:03:29,566 --> 01:03:32,133
between two people
who should be so close.

1112
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,353
- Are you alright, Mr. Kwon?
- Yes.

1113
01:03:50,433 --> 01:03:52,386
Drink some water.

1114
01:03:52,466 --> 01:03:53,633
Thank you.

1115
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:58,800
Thank you.

1116
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:01,653
How come you're so serious,

1117
01:04:01,733 --> 01:04:03,953
even when you're drunk?

1118
01:04:04,033 --> 01:04:05,833
You even talk in that same tone.

1119
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,753
Do I?

1120
01:04:08,833 --> 01:04:10,600
"Do I?"

1121
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,453
Still, at least I got to
see you when you're drunk.

1122
01:04:16,533 --> 01:04:19,953
It's nice seeing a new side of you.

1123
01:04:20,033 --> 01:04:22,386
Same for me.

1124
01:04:22,466 --> 01:04:25,686
It's nice to discover

1125
01:04:25,766 --> 01:04:27,533
new sides of you every day.

1126
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,586
I've come to learn of
your painful past,

1127
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:36,300
and those adorable days of
when you were an actress.

1128
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:41,653
It makes me happy, getting to know

1129
01:04:41,733 --> 01:04:43,066
more and more about you.

1130
01:04:43,933 --> 01:04:45,033
But...

1131
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,486
I haven't told you

1132
01:04:50,566 --> 01:04:53,833
everything just yet.

1133
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,733
There are some things
I haven't managed to tell you.

1134
01:04:58,933 --> 01:05:00,033
And...

1135
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:05,033
It's not like I'm keeping it
from you on purpose,

1136
01:05:08,366 --> 01:05:09,666
but...

1137
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,366
Actually, no.

1138
01:05:18,133 --> 01:05:20,333
Shall we go in? It's cold out.

1139
01:05:27,866 --> 01:05:28,900
Let's go.

1140
01:05:35,133 --> 01:05:36,853
It's alright,

1141
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,333
you don't have to tell me.

1142
01:05:43,266 --> 01:05:45,586
Even if you are
hiding something from me,

1143
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:47,500
that's quite alright with me.

1144
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,386
As long as that's the
best for you,

1145
01:05:52,466 --> 01:05:54,920
then you can do that,

1146
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,466
a hundred times over again.

1147
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,200
I like you.

1148
01:06:38,866 --> 01:06:41,366
I like you, Jin-sim.

1149
01:06:45,433 --> 01:06:49,300
I'm still ticked off about that
one point I lost.

1150
01:07:54,733 --> 01:07:56,433
(Touch Your Heart)

1151
01:07:56,533 --> 01:07:59,366
But the thrills!
And it's so romantic, too.

1152
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:03,586
Good times, dating in secret...

1153
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:05,253
- Is there something in your eye?
- Yes.

1154
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:06,420
I must be crazy.

1155
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,220
I keep falling harder
and harder for him.

1156
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,333
Destiny...

1157
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:11,720
Destiny? Whatever.

1158
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,720
Is this why people get married?

1159
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,853
Come over sometime.

1160
01:08:14,933 --> 01:08:16,820
So I'll be going over to
her place.

1161
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,253
Will she think I have
some other ideas...

1162
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:21,420
It's my first time, inviting
my boyfriend over.

1163
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,886
I didn't want to

1164
01:08:22,966 --> 01:08:24,186
waste the time
we have left together.

1165
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:26,620
There's just
one month to go, so...

1166
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,986
I don't want to provoke him.

1167
01:08:29,066 --> 01:08:30,453
I know.

1168
01:08:30,533 --> 01:08:33,086
I know he gave you a hard time.

1169
01:08:33,166 --> 01:08:35,120
I hear Lee Kang-joon's back.

1170
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,900
Is everything alright with Yoon-seo?
