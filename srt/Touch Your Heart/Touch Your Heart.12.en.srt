1
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,200
(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,986
Hey, what is it?

3
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:45,066
Well,

4
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,586
I thought I should
let you know first.

5
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,153
It's about Jung Ji-ho
and Lee Kang-jun.

6
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:51,386
We'll have a warrant issued for
their arrest tomorrow morning.

7
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:54,833
As you said, Jung Ji-ho's gambling
suspicions were a sham.

8
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:56,333
What do you mean?

9
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,386
We tracked the $5 million
contingent fee that

10
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:00,953
his attorney,
Choi Yeon-su, had received,

11
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:04,120
and we found a paper company
with an address in Macau.

12
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,086
And the actual owner of
this company was Lee Kang-jun.

13
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,620
Which means, until now,

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,853
that's where Jung Ji-ho's
slush funds were being laundered.

15
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:13,386
And that's why the two met
in Macau?

16
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:14,520
Yep.

17
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,620
Then they realized
we were onto them,

18
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,320
so they pretended
they were there to gamble.

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,420
Because the penalty for gambling's
lighter in comparison.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,886
Anyway, let's talk about it
more once I'm home.

21
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:25,186
I'll be there soon.

22
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:26,886
Alright, see you.

23
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:27,966
Alright.

24
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:46,466
You're home.

25
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,800
Your call cannot be
connected at this time...

26
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,366
So come on, be honest with me.

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,720
Tell me that you love me.

28
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,700
That I'm the only one,
and that you won't betray me!

29
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,800
Don't touch my girlfriend.

30
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,366
(Episode 12)

31
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:32,166
Tsk, still haven't come around?

32
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:36,000
- What's going on?
- Isn't that Lee Kang-jun?

33
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,686
As soon as he's at the station,

34
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:39,186
have his blood tested.

35
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:40,253
I have reasons to suspect
he's high on drugs.

36
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,433
Yes, sir.

37
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,986
What about Yoon-seo?
Is she alright?

38
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,520
Her cousin will be here soon.

39
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,620
Until then, I'll stay with her.

40
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,853
As for her affidavit,

41
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,886
I can always represent her
as her attorney.

42
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:54,986
Alright.

43
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:56,320
I'll go ahead first, then.

44
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,733
- Take care.
- Sure.

45
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:31,033
Now you can really rest assured.

46
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:36,300
He won't ever appear in front of
you again, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

47
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,153
Breaking news.

48
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:54,320
The Seoul Central District Court
has issued a warrant of arrest

49
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,053
for Lee Kang-jun,
Vice President of Empire Group.

50
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:58,386
Lee is not only under the
suspicion of embezzling

51
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,486
from his company to
set up his slush fund,

52
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,720
but is suspected of evading
millions of dollars in taxes.

53
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,120
Jung Ji-ho, President of
"Natural Table,"

54
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,220
will also be arrested on
additional charges of

55
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,586
embezzlement and
tax evasion.

56
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,620
Lee Kang-jun, Vice President of
Empire Group, is

57
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,453
currently being questioned by
the police for

58
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:17,886
intaking illegal substances
last night before

59
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:20,286
trespassing on actress
Oh Yoon-seo's residence

60
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:21,486
and threatening her by
damaging her property.

61
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:23,766
So far, Lee...

62
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,033
Man, that feel so good!

63
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:27,420
Man, it feels so good.

64
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,486
What... Drugs, stalking,
tax evasion and embezzling?

65
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:33,520
He's walking trash, isn't he?

66
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,586
Big trash!

67
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,720
When I think about

68
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,853
all that Yoon-seo had to go through
because of him...

69
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,700
Mr. Yeon, even now...

70
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,620
And everyone spoke ill of Yoon-seo

71
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,086
along with that bastard,

72
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,453
not knowing the full story, huh?

73
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:51,653
But now they should know,

74
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,920
since the full story is out now.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,153
- Yes.
- Mr. Yeon, congratulations!

76
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:57,300
Mr. Yeon...

77
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Ugh.

78
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,966
Didn't you wash your hair?

79
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,833
I'm sorry sir,
I just haven't had time to...

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,053
By the way,
how is Yoon-seo doing?

81
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:09,420
Are you sure
she's alright by herself?

82
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,866
Yoon-seo's been taking it
much better than I thought.

83
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:14,653
She's become so strong
in that short time.

84
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,220
She said she'll even
go back to work!

85
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,633
Back to work?

86
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,486
Why go back to work, when
she won't be doing that drama?

87
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:22,120
She says she wants to
do her best until the end,

88
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,033
since she has only
a week or so left.

89
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,933
Good morning.

90
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:37,453
Yoon-seo, you must've had
a hard time until now.

91
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:38,886
We saw the news.

92
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,286
So you were being stalked,
all this time...

93
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:44,053
Why didn't you confide in me
much sooner?

94
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:46,320
In terms of the law and my fist,

95
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,553
I don't lose to anyone!

96
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:50,053
I would've solved it in
one go for you.

97
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,653
You were always so bright
and so strong that

98
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:55,333
we never imagined
this was going on.

99
00:06:57,766 --> 00:07:00,486
Thank you for
worrying about me, everyone.

100
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:02,053
But of course we should.

101
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:04,600
You're like our family now.

102
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,220
So, what brings you back here?

103
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,086
I thought you were going to be
gone for a while.

104
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,386
Gone? No!

105
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,720
There's just a short time
before my contract ends,

106
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,820
so I should do my best
until the very end.

107
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,886
Still, you should've taken
today off, at least.

108
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:25,520
No, no. I'm really fine.

109
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,900
Please don't worry.

110
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,300
Um... here.

111
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,253
What's this?

112
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:52,453
I printed some nice comments
about you on the Internet.

113
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:53,886
I even highlighted the comments

114
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:56,766
that were extra nice.

115
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:02,186
Before, there were
so many nasty comments

116
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:03,953
which made me want to
sue them right away,

117
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:05,953
but today, most of them
were supportive,

118
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:08,253
from the bottom of
their hearts.

119
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,153
I was hoping they would
cheer you up.

120
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:12,866
Oh, and...

121
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:17,300
Did you also see this article?

122
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:23,086
This is about how much of
a hard time you must've had,

123
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,833
and all the comments on here...

124
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:26,800
Hold on.

125
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:32,300
You liked all the nice comments?

126
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,533
Yes, well...

127
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,600
Thank you, Mr. Kwon.

128
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,900
No, thank you.

129
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,200
For hanging in there.

130
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:26,320
(Fans are calling for the
return of Oh Yoon-seo,)

131
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,233
(who is on a long-term hiatus)

132
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,900
(Over 10,000 posts with the
hashtag #sorryYoon-seo)

133
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,733
The days have gotten much warmer.

134
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,033
Yes, it has.

135
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:07,900
Why are you looking at me like that?

136
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:10,566
I think I know.

137
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:14,153
"Are you really alright?"

138
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:15,333
That's what you were
going to say, right?

139
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,900
I'm really fine!

140
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,453
It's all over now,

141
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:25,186
and besides,
I have you by my side,

142
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,086
who worries about me
more than myself.

143
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,833
So what would I have
left to worry...

144
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
Oh.

145
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,766
I do have something to
worry about, yes.

146
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,833
Huh? What...

147
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,800
I'm hungry.

148
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,400
Should we go grab something?

149
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:45,066
I'm telling you, I'm hungry.

150
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,186
- Isn't that Oh Yoon-seo?
- Then what would you like?

151
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:48,686
Yes, I think so.

152
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:51,720
- It is her, yes.
- Aren't you Oh Yoon-seo?

153
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,220
Um, no...

154
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,220
You are her! You even have
the same voice.

155
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,253
Yoon-seo, I'm your big fan.

156
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,586
Can I get your autograph?

157
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,120
Yoon-seo, I saw the news.
Hang in there!

158
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,753
I believed in you
from the start.

159
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,486
- You're so pretty!
- We're your big fan!

160
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,200
Can I get a picture with you?

161
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:10,520
Whoa, everyone!

162
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,653
Please, no photos.

163
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:13,320
I understand how you all feel,

164
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,486
but since Ms. Oh Jin...

165
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:16,686
I mean, Ms. Oh Yoon-seo is
a public figure,

166
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:18,820
if the pictures get uploaded
on social media

167
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,153
that could result in
legal complications.

168
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:22,220
So while I understand
how you feel,

169
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,920
please, refrain from
taking pictures.

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,653
Taking pictures without
consent is infringing on

171
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:27,553
portrait rights, which may...

172
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,186
Uh, who are you?

173
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:30,333
Pardon?

174
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,520
I'm just a guy friend.
A guy friend.

175
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,720
I thought you were
her boyfriend or something.

176
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,200
I thought he was her lawyer.

177
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:41,620
What's your name?

178
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,033
Kim Min-ho.

179
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:45,400
Please, line up.

180
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:47,720
Careful.

181
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,586
- Can I have your autograph?
- If you push anyone,

182
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,000
you may be sued.

183
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,853
One shrimp sandwich,

184
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:56,300
one chicken sandwich,
and two Americanos.

185
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:03,520
It's been such a long time
since I was surrounded by people

186
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,253
giving autographs.

187
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,086
All the comments online were
supportive as well.

188
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,666
It's like the old days are back.

189
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,320
Then did I do something
unnecessary back then?

190
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,386
No, no. Thank you.

191
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:21,786
Pictures were a bit too much
to be honest.

192
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,286
And with you stepping forward for me,

193
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:25,866
I felt like I had strong support.

194
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,786
Why are you laughing like that?

195
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:33,186
I just remembered you saying,

196
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:36,053
guy friend.

197
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:38,566
Where did you learn that?

198
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,586
Hey, come on.

199
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,086
I know at least that much.

200
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,253
What, really?

201
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,333
Then...

202
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:52,566
What does A.S. stand for?

203
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:57,153
AS...

204
00:12:57,233 --> 00:13:01,153
"A and B in a struggle."

205
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:02,333
Hence, A.S.

206
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,720
Then what about S.I.?

207
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,400
- What?
- "S.I."

208
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:16,133
"Source the key lectures
from the Internet."

209
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,500
So Ms. Dan's still here, is she?

210
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,133
What if you won't, huh?

211
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,100
What...

212
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:52,753
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,986
So why did you have to...

214
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:57,453
It's your birthday today,
isn't it?

215
00:13:57,533 --> 00:14:00,566
I couldn't have them
rip your hair out on your birthday.

216
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,053
I'm Choi Yun-hyuk,

217
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:15,520
a man who's like a rose...

218
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,620
Beautiful, but fatal...
with a hidde thorn.

219
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,400
And I...

220
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,486
...had been searching for

221
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:27,486
a woman like this vase,
who could contain me.

222
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:31,220
And there you were, having
your hair torn out to shield me.

223
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,800
So protective, like this vase...

224
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:37,333
What am I to do with you?

225
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,466
What's with him?

226
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:55,720
What was that?

227
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,786
I think he was watching me.

228
00:14:57,866 --> 00:14:58,986
Watch me?

229
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,320
What for?

230
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,086
No misunderstandings.

231
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,200
You promised yourself that
you won't get your hopes up.

232
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Ms. Dan.

233
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,320
Um...

234
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,766
So, uh...

235
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:34,853
Let's go for a drink tonight.
Or not.

236
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,586
What...

237
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:41,166
So are you inviting me out for
a drink or not?

238
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,653
Let's have a drink. Now.

239
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,266
Right now!

240
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:06,266
Why so many bones?

241
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:28,033
I don't like it when
people butcher the fish.

242
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,853
I've met many women

243
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:40,620
who fix their makeup to
leave an impression on me,

244
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,820
but never a woman who
pick out fish bones to do so.

245
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,666
What am I going to do with you...

246
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,720
Ms. Dan.

247
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,653
Is there anyone
you're interested in these days?

248
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,086
- What?
- Well,

249
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:04,120
your heart's a workaholic and
it's busy 365 days a year.

250
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,286
But recently, it's been
pretty quiet, hasn't it?

251
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:10,020
To be honest,

252
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,166
there is someone
I'm interested in,

253
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:17,220
but I decided to give up.

254
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,220
He has zero interest in me
whatsoever,

255
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,966
so why should I break
my heart over him?

256
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:30,233
May I ask who this is?

257
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:37,766
Well, he's...

258
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,386
Yes?

259
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:44,800
- Who...
- Let's go, we had too much already.

260
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:53,920
I've met many women
who cut their hair for me,

261
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,033
but none who cut off my words!

262
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:06,586
You're so enticing like this
soju and beer...

263
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,566
What am I to do with you?

264
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,233
Ms. Dan, Wait up!

265
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,733
I was going to pay.

266
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,766
Here you are.

267
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:24,420
- Ah.
- You know,

268
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,853
there's really just a week to go.

269
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:28,500
Me driving you home like this.

270
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:32,053
Right.

271
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:36,953
Though nothing will change between us
even after my contract's over,

272
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,953
still...

273
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:42,086
When I think about how
we won't be together like this anymore,

274
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,700
it does make me sad.

275
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,133
Let's enjoy the time
we have left together.

276
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:02,900
Oh, no.

277
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:12,500
What...

278
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,120
Hyuk-jun,

279
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,053
why are you here at this time?

280
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,166
Yoon-seo.

281
00:19:20,566 --> 00:19:22,300
Are you dating that lawyer?

282
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,233
Yes, I am.

283
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
But...

284
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,266
Yoon-seo, can I talk to you?

285
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:42,553
Mr. Kwon, have a safe drive,

286
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:44,533
and call me before you go to bed.

287
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,766
Um, sure.

288
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:54,233
I mean it, hurry up!

289
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,700
What happened?

290
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,453
I thought you hated Kwon Jung-rok.

291
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:05,833
So why...

292
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:07,886
Why are you dating him now?

293
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:09,753
What, can't I?

294
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,453
Besides, I'm not a little kid
anymore, I can date whoever.

295
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:13,453
Yoon-seo!

296
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:15,653
But it's my job to care about
who you date.

297
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,720
My job is to care about
everything you do,

298
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,486
so that you can succeed
in your career.

299
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:21,133
That's exactly what my job is!

300
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,886
Alright, Yoon-seo.
You may not realize it,

301
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:27,386
but many eyes are
on you right now.

302
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:29,286
And in a time like this,
we really need to...

303
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:32,153
Hyuk-jun, I really like Mr. Kwon.

304
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:33,320
A lot.

305
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,866
I mean it.

306
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:38,553
So please don't say anything.

307
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:40,366
- Yoon-seo...
- Hyuk-jun!

308
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:45,953
Then don't get busted.

309
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:48,020
Don't get busted then, alright?

310
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
Alright.

311
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:54,853
Oh, I don't know...

312
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:57,720
What brings you here
at this time anyway?

313
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,433
You shouldn't have come.

314
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:01,520
What?

315
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,420
I was worried whether
you were fine,

316
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,520
so I came to check up on you.
Plus I had something to say!

317
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,500
But you're doing very fine,
aren't you?

318
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,766
What have you got to say to me?

319
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,886
Lee Se-jin wants to see you.

320
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:14,886
Lee Se-jin, as in the writer?

321
00:21:14,966 --> 00:21:15,986
What... But why?

322
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,600
Who knows?
How would I know that?

323
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,933
Hmpf.

324
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,366
(Yeon Entertainment)

325
00:21:22,966 --> 00:21:24,853
It's been a while, Yoon-seo.

326
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,253
Yes, it has.

327
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,353
So what brings you here?

328
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:31,253
Did you still have something to say
after rejecting us?

329
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,853
We were truly sorry back then.

330
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,553
We'd been extremely stressed

331
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:38,686
because we couldn't find a sponsor
for months,

332
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:40,620
and I guess we lost it

333
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,786
when we received such an offer.

334
00:21:43,866 --> 00:21:45,986
- I'm sorry.
- Of course you should be.

335
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:48,053
Do you take us for idiots?

336
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:50,086
You tell her to
go get real-life experience,

337
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,553
only to reject her like that?

338
00:21:51,633 --> 00:21:52,953
I was really offended, you know.

339
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:54,753
Please don't be mad at me,
Yoon-seo.

340
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:58,233
To be honest, I was
really impressed by you.

341
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,953
Who knew the cosmic goddess would
really go work at a law firm?

342
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:05,153
And last a full three months there!

343
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:06,520
I really didn't expect you to.

344
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,886
But I guess that showed
how much you were

345
00:22:09,966 --> 00:22:12,453
enthusiastic about our work,
and I was really touched.

346
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,853
Well, I was enthusiastic about it.

347
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:17,020
Right?

348
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,220
I knew it.

349
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,620
And though I'm now
embarrassed to say this, but...

350
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,020
I'd like you to be

351
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,333
our female lead, Yoon-seo.

352
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,353
To be honest,

353
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,953
I don't know where people
got the news that

354
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:33,020
Yoon-seo will be doing this drama,

355
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,066
but we've been flooded with
sponsor offers!

356
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,020
-Really?
- Yes.

357
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,820
Now that the misunderstandings
have been cleared,

358
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,653
your reputation has been restored.

359
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:45,320
And at the news of
you coming back to the screen,

360
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
everyone is trying to
board the wagon.

361
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,400
Oh, everyone is, are they?

362
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:54,853
Well, we don't work with people

363
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:55,953
who've lost our trust.

364
00:22:56,033 --> 00:22:59,086
Mr. Yeon, please don't reject us
so flatly like that.

365
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,486
Flatly or whatever,

366
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:02,086
we're just not interested.

367
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,986
Right, Yoon-seo?
You're not interested, are you?

368
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:06,420
I am. I want to do this drama.

369
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,420
You heard her, right?

370
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,433
She wants to do this drama!

371
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,453
You mean, you don't want to?

372
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:13,553
I want to.

373
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:15,066
- You... want to?
- Yes.

374
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,853
But... Don't you have pride?

375
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:20,366
Is this how I raised you?

376
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,220
To be honest,
I was a little upset,

377
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,453
but after hearing their reasons,
I understand they had no choice.

378
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:32,386
Besides, after
working at the law firm,

379
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:35,220
I now really want to
do this drama.

380
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,553
Yoon-seo, you know what?

381
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:39,120
Why not just sign the
contract right now?

382
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,886
Yoon-seo, you read the
first part, right?

383
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:43,353
I haven't shown the second and
the third part to anyone yet,

384
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:45,533
but I'll send it to you right away
as soon as I'm back in my office.

385
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,986
Don't you think you're being
too easy?

386
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:51,186
Right, Yoon-seo.

387
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:52,720
Let's think about this
a little more.

388
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,753
No,

389
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,020
I'm doing this drama.

390
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,500
I'm confident that I can
pull off being a lawyer.

391
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,086
You're really
no businesswoman, huh?

392
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:09,553
Even if you were going to say yes,
don't say it that fast.

393
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:12,753
Why shouldn't I, when it's going to
be a yes in the end?

394
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,286
And what if they really took
my no as a no?

395
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:17,753
- What then?
- Oh, jeez.

396
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,720
Yoon-seo, you're not that

397
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,086
pitiful Oh Yoon-seo you once were.

398
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,586
You're not that Oh Yoon-seo,

399
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,186
who had no work

400
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,753
and had zero income,

401
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,220
so went to all kinds of directors,

402
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,586
begging them to give you a role!

403
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,186
You're not that
pitiful you anymore.

404
00:24:31,266 --> 00:24:33,553
So forget about those dark days.

405
00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:35,520
All of it!

406
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,366
Even if I wanted to,
you're not letting me.

407
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,653
Anyway, I bet the people
at your firm will be surprised.

408
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:48,386
They think you got a job there,

409
00:24:48,466 --> 00:24:49,820
because you were out of work
and life was tough, right?

410
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,020
So imagine the surprise

411
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,686
when they see you on TV again!

412
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:55,033
Hyuk-jun...

413
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:58,766
Do you think
Mr. Kwon will be disappointed

414
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,686
when he learns the news?

415
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,020
He'll feel betrayed that

416
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,453
I've been deceiving him
all this time, right?

417
00:25:05,533 --> 00:25:06,600
Of course!

418
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:10,253
He might want to break up with you,

419
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,586
saying he can't date someone who deceives others.

420
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:16,166
So why don't you dump him first,
before he does?

421
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:19,486
I was only kidding.

422
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:21,253
Why are you getting so serious?

423
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,920
Of course I'm serious about this.

424
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,133
Wouldn't you be?

425
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,720
Mr. Lee.

426
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,386
Can you make some time tonight?

427
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:41,400
There's something I must tell you
before it's too late.

428
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,786
What should we eat?

429
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:48,786
Pasta? Or something spicy?

430
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:50,820
Sure, alright.

431
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,386
Where's Yoon-seo?

432
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:53,753
I haven't seen her
since a while ago.

433
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:56,886
She stepped out, saying
she needs to see her agency.

434
00:25:56,966 --> 00:25:59,820
Is Yoon-seo still under
that agency, then?

435
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,053
Of course. Her contract with them
still hasn't expired.

436
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:04,220
Do you think
she'll go back to acting,

437
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,320
now that the misunderstandings
have been cleared?

438
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,686
Well... I don't think so.

439
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:11,453
She got a job here as
a legal secretary

440
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:16,653
because she was interested in law,
so I suppose she'll keep going?

441
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:18,286
Let's go eat. Come on!

442
00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:20,420
Let's go eat. Let's go, let's go!

443
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,120
Just up to here, please?

444
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,520
Just up to the elevator.

445
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,986
- Please.
- We can't allow that.

446
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:27,120
But this is Always, isn't it?

447
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,120
What's going on?

448
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,620
I'm the representing
lawyer of Always.

449
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,353
Is Always the law firm where

450
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:32,586
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo was
working in secret?

451
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,853
Is it true that her next role
is a lawyer?

452
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:37,253
Were you aware that she was
here to get field experience?

453
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,553
Were you aware of
her return to the screen?

454
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:40,553
Please, a comment!

455
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:43,033
- Sir, please.
- Just one word!

456
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,500
Is this true?

457
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:47,920
Sir, is this true?

458
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,553
You are the representing lawyer
at Always, are you not?

459
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:50,553
Please, just one word.

460
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:52,633
Please sir, anything!

461
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:55,100
Sir.

462
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:03,133
Prosecutor.

463
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:05,786
You look like
you're in a good mood.

464
00:27:05,866 --> 00:27:08,020
Really? Well, of course I am.

465
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,020
Now I can lock up all the
bastards who've been bothering me.

466
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,453
I'll be honest with you,
when you asked me to track the

467
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:16,953
accounts of Jung Ji-ho and
Choi Yeon-su,

468
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:17,986
I thought,

469
00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:20,953
'here I go, risking my job.'

470
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:24,953
Anyway, I admire your
sense of justice,

471
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:27,353
as well as your far sightedness!

472
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:28,720
I really must give it to you.

473
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,966
No, please.

474
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:35,053
I'll get going, then.

475
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:36,133
Ah, sure.

476
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:41,053
I knew you could do it.

477
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:42,453
It's all thanks to you.

478
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:44,686
- Thanks to me?
- That day,

479
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:46,886
your hug really cheered me up.

480
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:47,966
Thanks.

481
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:51,286
Let's have lunch or
dinner together.

482
00:27:51,366 --> 00:27:52,886
I know you're busy, but make time.

483
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:54,886
Nothing could cheer me up
more than those words.

484
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:56,186
What about lunch, then?

485
00:27:56,266 --> 00:27:58,086
- When?
- Right now.

486
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,166
What?

487
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:14,953
This was the only place
I could think of,

488
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:17,620
where reporters can't reach, so...

489
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,100
Sure.

490
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,220
Mr. Kwon.

491
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,553
I'm sorry I couldn't
tell you sooner.

492
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:29,000
I wanted to tell you, but...

493
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,866
Congratulations.

494
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,420
I must admit I was surprised,

495
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,520
but knowing how much you
love your work as an actress,

496
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,320
this makes me happy, too.

497
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,900
I'm really happy for you.

498
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,466
What's wrong?

499
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:11,286
I'm just so relieved.

500
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:14,020
I was scared that
you were disappointed in me

501
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,953
so you didn't want
to see me again.

502
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:21,986
I was worried that
you might break up with me.

503
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:24,520
Why worry about
something like that?

504
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,086
I told you, didn't I?

505
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:27,620
Even if you were hiding something,

506
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,386
if it's for you,

507
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:32,000
you can do it over and over,
a hundred times.

508
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:34,933
Mr. Kwon...

509
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,633
The reporters are keep calling me.

510
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,986
Yes, Mr. Yeon.

511
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,066
I, uh...

512
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:05,853
Can I have the afternoon off?

513
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:09,053
I've nothing urgent,
so it should be fine.

514
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:10,133
Yes.

515
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,153
But why...

516
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:13,766
I didn't want to be disturbed.

517
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:16,820
Let's wag work.

518
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,220
Wag work?

519
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,586
Kwon's taking the afternoon off.

520
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:21,586
Whoa!

521
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,333
What, to be with Yoon-seo?

522
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,486
What do you think those two are?

523
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:29,120
They were holding hands
when they stepped out.

524
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Do you think they're dating?

525
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:32,520
Nonsense!

526
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,253
There's just no way.

527
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,186
Why would Yoon-seo date
someone like Kwon?

528
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:38,866
Why? What's wrong with Mr. Kwon?

529
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,486
So, what do you all think?

530
00:30:44,566 --> 00:30:47,366
Do you think
they're dating or not?

531
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,400
Raise your hand
if you think they're dating.

532
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:21,533
Then what should we do?

533
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:26,266
Well...

534
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:29,366
Oh, that's right.

535
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,753
You must be hungry.

536
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:34,320
I'll go cook
something for you, then.

537
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,253
You will?

538
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:37,333
Yes.

539
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:40,153
Why do you look so surprised?

540
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:42,153
I've been independent
ever since college,

541
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,900
so I can make most things.

542
00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:49,086
I'm thinking about making
kimchi stew because

543
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,700
you can't go wrong with that.
Do you prefer tuna or pork?

544
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,733
I like both...

545
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,600
- Pork, then.
- Alright.

546
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:06,886
Kimchi stew made by you!

547
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,266
I'm looking so forward to it.

548
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:28,866
Where did it go?

549
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,720
Hey, Se-won.

550
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,486
Did you see the pork
we had in the fridge?

551
00:32:41,566 --> 00:32:42,566
Oh, that?

552
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:45,853
Was it the day before yesterday?

553
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:49,086
I ate it, because I got hungry
while doing some work.

554
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:50,986
Why...

555
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:52,320
Why did you eat it?

556
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,533
You should've asked me first.

557
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:03,620
I can't see the tuna, either.

558
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,320
I had that for
breakfast yesterday.

559
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,586
You eat all your
three meals, don't you?

560
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,020
Anyway,

561
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,286
I think I'll be home late tonight.

562
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:13,866
Well, why don't you
just never come home?

563
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:19,920
What do we do?

564
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,586
I guess Prosecutor Kim ate everything.

565
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:24,653
It's alright.

566
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:26,253
I'll pop out and get something.

567
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,253
I'll come with you, then.

568
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:32,120
But... Many might recognize you,

569
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,720
with all this media
attention on you.

570
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,453
Then let's go to the market.

571
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:39,086
The age group there is much higher,

572
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:42,053
so I don't think anyone will
recognize me.

573
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:44,200
But you just radiate the
celebrity aura.

574
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,933
Oh, you think so?

575
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,900
Let me borrow your clothes.

576
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:00,700
Wow, you have many nice things.

577
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:05,700
Can I borrow this, and a hat?

578
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:12,353
I'll just wear this,
and throw something extra on.

579
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:13,433
Sure.

580
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,133
Is this lipstick?

581
00:34:21,866 --> 00:34:23,300
Oh, that's just lip balm.

582
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:27,033
My lips tend to get dry,
so I do this.

583
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,220
My lips are dry, too.

584
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,000
Then here.

585
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,433
They're much better now,
with something on them.

586
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,833
Here you are.

587
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,986
Thank you. It looks delicious.

588
00:34:56,066 --> 00:34:57,200
Ah, sure.

589
00:34:58,733 --> 00:34:59,733
It's delicious.

590
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:03,633
(Potatoes $3/bag)

591
00:35:03,966 --> 00:35:05,133
Let's see...

592
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,900
We'll take this one.

593
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:09,133
Strawberries!

594
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:18,153
Smells so good.

595
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:20,266
Mmm, it smells like air freshener.

596
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,200
Shall we get this?

597
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,533
We bought a lot.

598
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,353
We're like Paris Hilton at
the traditional market, huh?

599
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:34,633
It's been so long since I came
to a market. It's a lot of fun.

600
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,853
Then, are we ready to go home?

601
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:40,020
No, we still have to get the
ingredients for lunch.

602
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,053
What... But we just had
chicken nuggets, fish cakes,

603
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:45,020
and these pastries, too.
And you still want lunch?

604
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,200
This is all just a snack.
We need to eat a proper meal!

605
00:35:49,266 --> 00:35:51,986
Do you like braised
spicy chicken, by any chance?

606
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,420
- Yes.
- Then,

607
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,466
let's go buy some chicken.

608
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:57,820
- Hello.
- Hello.

609
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,320
Can we get one chicken?
It's for braised chicken.

610
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
Sure, alright.

611
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:07,053
By the way,

612
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:10,320
I'm sure I've seen you somewhere.

613
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,720
No way.

614
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,486
No, I'm sure
I've seen you somewhere.

615
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:16,086
You mean me.

616
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:18,786
I get told that
I look like some actor.

617
00:36:18,866 --> 00:36:20,320
Like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt...

618
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,000
I don't know who these
Tom and Brad are.

619
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:26,253
I'm sure I've seen you somewhere.

620
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:27,820
That's right!

621
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,386
Are you the one who said
who'll pay me back for the

622
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:32,620
four chickens you took,
but never did?

623
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,986
No... no!

624
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,353
Mr. Park!

625
00:36:35,433 --> 00:36:37,853
- No!
- Mr. Park, come here.

626
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:39,120
- Come on.
- Sure.

627
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,086
You've seen her
somewhere, haven't you?

628
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,253
Right.

629
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,020
She's a familiar face.

630
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,086
Honey, over here.

631
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,086
Here, for the chicken.

632
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,566
Thank you, we'll come again.

633
00:36:51,866 --> 00:36:53,466
Where did I see her?

634
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,900
This place hasn't
changed at all, has it?

635
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,266
No customers, like always.

636
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:01,853
You said you wanted to
pick the restaurant,

637
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:04,186
so I was wondering
where you'd take me.

638
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:05,420
And this is it?

639
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,853
Don't say it like that.

640
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,133
I missed this place.

641
00:37:08,566 --> 00:37:09,920
And also...

642
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,686
Stop. Don't.

643
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:16,486
Don't what?
What do you think I'll say next?

644
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:19,886
I missed the spicy
stir-fried pork here.

645
00:37:19,966 --> 00:37:21,266
Then eat up.

646
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:30,486
That was delicious.

647
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:31,686
How much is it?

648
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:32,966
That'll be $23 dollars.

649
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:35,520
Goodness,

650
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,453
it's you two.

651
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:40,553
I thought you were familiar.

652
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,986
You remember us?

653
00:37:42,066 --> 00:37:43,520
It's been such a long time.

654
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,653
Of course I remember you.

655
00:37:45,733 --> 00:37:47,600
You were studying law at
that university, weren't you?

656
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,486
You were both so fine-looking,

657
00:37:50,566 --> 00:37:52,086
in fact, you were the

658
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:54,020
best-looking out of
all my customers.

659
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,720
Wow, I must give it to you.

660
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,120
You're not just a good chef,
but have a discerning eye!

661
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,520
Then how about this?

662
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,200
You two aren't
dating anymore, are you?

663
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:07,186
How did you know?

664
00:38:07,266 --> 00:38:08,620
How would I not?

665
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,886
Back then, he'd put all the
side dishes in front of you,

666
00:38:10,966 --> 00:38:13,820
feed you...

667
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,320
It was like he came to feed you,

668
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,186
rather than to feed himself.

669
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:20,053
But I guess not today.

670
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,186
Well, uh...

671
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:22,653
Oh, it's all the same.

672
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,933
Men are all the same
once they get married.

673
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:27,353
So you have to understand.

674
00:38:27,433 --> 00:38:28,686
No, we...

675
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:30,886
Ah, I guess it's my bad.

676
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:32,286
I'll treat her better
from now on.

677
00:38:32,366 --> 00:38:36,220
Alright, then I won't
charge you for the sodas.

678
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,933
- Thank you.
- Here.

679
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,433
What are you doing?

680
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,353
- Thank you, bye.
- Thanks for the food.

681
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:46,133
Sure, bye.

682
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Kim Se-won!

683
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:54,786
Why? That was nice.

684
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:55,866
We even got free sodas.

685
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:58,920
Thanks for treating me, Yeo-reum.

686
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,653
I had fun, too. It reminded me
of the days back in college.

687
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:05,653
Why don't we come here with
Jung-rok next time?

688
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:07,120
No.

689
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,620
I already see enough of him
at home.

690
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,066
So do I really have to see him
outside as well?

691
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:15,353
How long are you planning to
stay with him, anyway?

692
00:39:15,433 --> 00:39:18,453
It's not like
you don't have a house.

693
00:39:18,533 --> 00:39:20,586
If you're talking about
my parents' house,

694
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:22,500
I won't be returning there
for a while.

695
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:24,366
I...

696
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:29,200
I found out about all the harsh
things my father said to you.

697
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,533
I respected my father,

698
00:39:32,866 --> 00:39:34,020
so I couldn't believe that

699
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,486
he'd said such things to

700
00:39:36,566 --> 00:39:37,933
someone his own son is
in love with.

701
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:41,553
That's why I can't go there.

702
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:43,186
Se-won, about that...

703
00:39:43,266 --> 00:39:47,386
That's why I want you to
take responsibility.

704
00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:49,320
I don't need anything else,

705
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,920
as long as I can be with you.

706
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,520
So you take responsibility too,

707
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,486
and think about it seriously.

708
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:00,666
Our relationship.

709
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,400
I want to get back together
with you again.

710
00:40:17,633 --> 00:40:19,753
Since you cooked for us,

711
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:21,253
I'll do the dishes.

712
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:22,853
No, please.

713
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:24,620
You peeled the potatoes,

714
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,986
and chopped the carrots, too.

715
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:27,520
You helped me,

716
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,853
so let's be fair and play a game.

717
00:40:29,933 --> 00:40:31,386
The loser will do the dishes.

718
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:32,500
A game?

719
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,153
Let's play those Jenga blocks
we bought from the market.

720
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,233
Alright.

721
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,120
By the way, this is delicious.

722
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,833
You're a great cook.

723
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:43,500
- Eat up.
- I will.

724
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,720
So we remove a block,

725
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,886
and carry out the mission
as written on it, do we?

726
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:52,566
Yes. And the person who
topples all this, loses.

727
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:54,386
You go first, Mr. Kwon.

728
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:55,466
Sure.

729
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:02,153
What is it?

730
00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:03,800
What is it? Show me.

731
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,866
(Act cute)

732
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,733
Act cute.

733
00:41:07,433 --> 00:41:09,166
Let's just say I lost.

734
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:12,133
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

735
00:41:12,866 --> 00:41:13,866
Come on!

736
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,500
Huh?

737
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,100
Ppuing...

738
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,633
Oh, the "ppuing-ppuing."

739
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:22,520
That's so old.

740
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,486
Yes, well... I don't
really watch TV.

741
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,553
Your turn.

742
00:41:26,633 --> 00:41:27,633
Alright.

743
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31,166
(Take a couple selfie)

744
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:32,566
Take a couple selfie.

745
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,120
Great, because we don't have
any pictures of us together.

746
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,486
Here, allow me.

747
00:41:37,566 --> 00:41:39,286
Let's take a cute one,
if we'll be taking one.

748
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:40,366
Sure.

749
00:41:47,566 --> 00:41:48,966
- Come closer.
- Oh, sure.

750
00:41:57,733 --> 00:42:00,253
I'll send it to you too,

751
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,720
so look at it twenty times a day.

752
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800
I will.

753
00:42:04,466 --> 00:42:06,853
Change the name you've saved
her under on your phone.

754
00:42:06,933 --> 00:42:08,553
What have you saved me as?

755
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:10,286
As "Secretary Oh Jin-sim."

756
00:42:10,366 --> 00:42:12,553
That's not on.

757
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:14,486
- The what would you like?
- Then...

758
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:15,486
How about Princess Oh?

759
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,100
Then Princess Oh, it is.

760
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,933
Do you think someone
might misunderstand?

761
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,886
Then Princess Oh Ji-sim, it is.

762
00:42:21,966 --> 00:42:23,853
Guys and girls can never
remain as just friends.

763
00:42:23,933 --> 00:42:25,420
Do you agree?

764
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,820
Hey, that was a bit rude.

765
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,220
Yes, I'll admit it.

766
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,020
Any food that
you forced yourself to eat?

767
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,100
Um...

768
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:34,586
Nothing, really.

769
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:36,453
Because I was educated to

770
00:42:36,533 --> 00:42:38,286
appreciate whatever I'm eating,
for being a man…

771
00:42:38,366 --> 00:42:41,020
Oh, alright.

772
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,100
Yes.

773
00:42:46,766 --> 00:42:47,866
(Say a wish)

774
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:49,153
Say a wish.

775
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,153
Say anything you want,

776
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:52,453
and I'll grant it for you.

777
00:42:52,533 --> 00:42:53,533
Hmm...

778
00:42:55,433 --> 00:42:56,433
What should I say?

779
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,866
There's nothing that
comes to mind right now.

780
00:43:02,066 --> 00:43:03,953
Let me keep it for now.

781
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:07,020
But you have to do whatever
it is I want, alright?

782
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,153
Yes, alright.

783
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:09,433
- Promise.
- I promise.

784
00:43:24,966 --> 00:43:26,653
How can I help you?

785
00:43:26,733 --> 00:43:28,866
I'm here to see Mr. Yeon Jun-gyu.

786
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,300
Why's the corridor so dark?

787
00:43:37,933 --> 00:43:39,053
So you're saying,

788
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:41,653
ever since that Kwon or whatever
took Yoon-seo out,

789
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:43,353
they both can't be reached?

790
00:43:43,433 --> 00:43:44,533
Yes!

791
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:46,353
Even Yoon-seo's phone
is switched off.

792
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:48,420
I don't know what's going on.

793
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,033
Don't tell me...
Are they dating?

794
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:53,886
I'm sure they're not.

795
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:55,053
No, no, no.

796
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,620
We actually voted on

797
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,253
whether they're dating or not,

798
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:01,520
and we had one more no than yes.

799
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,353
There's no way they're dating.

800
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:05,820
Then why did he grab her hand?

801
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,800
I asked our staff too, and...

802
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:10,486
While Kwon can be a little cold,

803
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,220
he's actually very loyal.

804
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,453
Some of us think that
he was helping Yoon-seo out,

805
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:16,520
in case she felt troubled.

806
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,853
And him grabbing her hand...

807
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:20,686
We think he grabbed it
by accident, in a rush!

808
00:44:20,766 --> 00:44:22,386
Yes, that's what it is.

809
00:44:22,466 --> 00:44:24,300
There's no way that
they're dating.

810
00:44:30,533 --> 00:44:31,533
Oh, really?

811
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,753
But, uh...

812
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:35,353
Why do you look so desperate?

813
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:37,933
It's as if you're hoping
they're not dating.

814
00:44:39,966 --> 00:44:41,586
Because otherwise,
I don't know how to face you.

815
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:43,453
You sent her here
because you trusted me,

816
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:44,953
but if a scandal breaks out...

817
00:44:45,033 --> 00:44:47,553
Do you think
I would feel bad or no?

818
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:49,300
You would, yes.

819
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,886
Anyway, like you said,
I hope they're not dating.

820
00:44:55,966 --> 00:44:58,786
Because if they really are,

821
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:02,186
then that's bad news.

822
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,466
What, really?

823
00:45:04,066 --> 00:45:06,720
Didn't you see the
comments on the Internet?

824
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,153
When people heard she's
working here for her role,

825
00:45:10,233 --> 00:45:11,386
everyone was like,

826
00:45:11,466 --> 00:45:13,553
"Wow, she must be
so passionate about acting."

827
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:15,320
"I love how she's so humble."

828
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,420
Everyone's been like,

829
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,420
"Yoon-seo's so down to earth!"

830
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,120
So what if they think she's been
here because of her boyfriend?

831
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,700
Now who would like that story?

832
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,286
It was so difficult for
Yoon-seo to restore her image,

833
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:29,866
and I can't see her...

834
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:32,420
...lose her footing again.

835
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,500
Ha...

836
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:35,766
You just sighed, didn't you?

837
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,520
You know something, don't you?

838
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,086
- You do, huh?
- I don't, probably.

839
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:41,720
I mean... If I knew anything,

840
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,033
I would've told you already.

841
00:45:44,733 --> 00:45:47,120
I don't think anything's
there between them.

842
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,066
So don't worry, please.

843
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,333
Anyway, where are those two
and what are they doing?

844
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,433
Why all the way here?

845
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:09,920
If I drop you off
in front of your place,

846
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,486
a paparazzi might snap
a picture of us together.

847
00:46:12,566 --> 00:46:14,520
So from now on,
I'll drop you off here

848
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,466
and watch you go in safely.

849
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:21,533
Alright.

850
00:46:22,033 --> 00:46:24,433
Then have a safe drive, Mr. Kwon.

851
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,766
I had fun wagging work today.

852
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:30,286
Same here. I also had fun.

853
00:46:30,366 --> 00:46:31,366
Alright.

854
00:46:53,766 --> 00:46:55,300
Yes, this is Kwon Jung-rok.

855
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:57,800
Ah, yes.

856
00:47:00,766 --> 00:47:01,800
Now?

857
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,620
So...

858
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,600
You're not her cousin,
but her manager.

859
00:47:13,966 --> 00:47:16,600
I'm sorry for deceiving you,
but I never meant to.

860
00:47:17,733 --> 00:47:19,386
Yoon-seo said

861
00:47:19,466 --> 00:47:22,386
she's at the law firm because
she quit acting,

862
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:23,786
so if people learned
I was her manager,

863
00:47:23,866 --> 00:47:25,666
they might think otherwise, so...

864
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,886
Yes, I understand.

865
00:47:27,966 --> 00:47:30,620
But why did you want to see me?

866
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,700
Do you...

867
00:47:33,266 --> 00:47:34,733
...care much about Yoon-seo?

868
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,266
Yes, of course.

869
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,453
Am I putting her in trouble by

870
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:52,966
being in love with her?

871
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,100
Mr. Kwon.

872
00:47:58,033 --> 00:48:01,220
Ever since I completed my
military duty,

873
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,320
I was assigned to care for
Yoon-seo at the age of 25,

874
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,086
and have been doing so,
for these past 10 years.

875
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:08,720
So in a way,

876
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,400
Yoon-seo is a part of my youth.

877
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,953
It made me happy when
she was doing great,

878
00:48:15,033 --> 00:48:16,433
but when she wasn't,

879
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:20,200
I had a really hard time, too.

880
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:24,186
When that scandal broke out,

881
00:48:24,266 --> 00:48:25,620
I had no one to talk to,

882
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,333
so I just went to Hangang
River and cried, drinking.

883
00:48:28,633 --> 00:48:31,900
I prayed every day for
her successful comeback.

884
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:34,633
You know what she's like.

885
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,653
She's been in this business
before she knew what was what,

886
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:41,153
so there's nothing else can do
besides acting.

887
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:44,166
Yet, she lasted three months
at the law firm, all because...

888
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,320
Because of that desire to
return to the screen,

889
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,466
to those days where
everyone loved her.

890
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,200
Because of that one single wish.

891
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,820
I'm sure you heard it
on the news as well,

892
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,720
but after everyone learned
she's working diligently

893
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,986
at your firm for her new role,

894
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:05,186
her public image has
much improved.

895
00:49:05,266 --> 00:49:06,333
So if...

896
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,800
If the world now learns
she's dating you,

897
00:49:12,266 --> 00:49:15,133
they will doubt that
she was there for her acting.

898
00:49:18,233 --> 00:49:19,233
Mr. Kwon.

899
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,800
These are important times for
Yoon-seo.

900
00:49:27,866 --> 00:49:30,520
What is it that
you want to say to me?

901
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,266
I know this is cliched,

902
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:38,766
but please break up with
Yoon-seo for her future.

903
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,853
I'm sorry that
this is cliched too,

904
00:49:51,933 --> 00:49:55,333
but I love
Ms. Oh Jin-sim very much.

905
00:49:56,866 --> 00:49:58,966
So there won't be a scenario

906
00:50:00,566 --> 00:50:01,666
where I would ask her to
break up with me.

907
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:06,220
I thought he would be disappointed
I didn't tell him beforehand,

908
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,600
but he even congratulated me.

909
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,266
He's really too good for me.

910
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,286
Mr. Kwon, I had
so much fun today.

911
00:50:41,366 --> 00:50:43,286
While I'm excited about being
cast for that drama,

912
00:50:43,366 --> 00:50:47,200
I'm most excited I was cast
as your girlfriend!

913
00:51:15,466 --> 00:51:17,653
Oh my goodness!

914
00:51:17,733 --> 00:51:19,320
They must be dating, right?

915
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,320
- The comments...
- Mr. Kwon.

916
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,466
Good morning.

917
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:31,620
Why are you looking at me like that?

918
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,520
I wonder why.

919
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,053
Yes, I wonder why.

920
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,720
I couldn't reach you all day
yesterday, ever since

921
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,766
you grabbed Yoon-seo's hand
and walked out!

922
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,333
And then...

923
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:44,133
What's this picture here?

924
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:49,086
It was uploaded on a webboard
that Hae-young reads often.

925
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:50,553
Someone saw you two,

926
00:51:50,633 --> 00:51:52,920
and they said you two
looked like a couple.

927
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,400
Explain to me
just what is going on.

928
00:51:59,566 --> 00:52:01,033
I don't want to, I'm sorry.

929
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,833
What, does that mean...

930
00:52:04,466 --> 00:52:07,700
...that you two are
really a couple?

931
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,920
No way.

932
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,586
I was simply helping her in case
the reporters troubled her,

933
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:20,100
and this picture is just us
having lunch together.

934
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:23,000
So no misunderstandings, please.

935
00:52:28,133 --> 00:52:29,620
They were just having lunch.

936
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,766
Just having lunch.

937
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,100
Yes.

938
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,266
I'm sorry about yesterday.

939
00:52:37,433 --> 00:52:38,766
Yes, Mr. Yeon.

940
00:52:38,966 --> 00:52:40,366
Alright, I understand.

941
00:52:41,466 --> 00:52:42,500
Alright.

942
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,300
Ah.

943
00:52:50,266 --> 00:52:52,366
Was that the head of your agency?

944
00:52:53,933 --> 00:52:54,933
Yes.

945
00:52:56,366 --> 00:52:57,820
Is it...

946
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,153
...perhaps because of
that picture on the Internet?

947
00:53:00,233 --> 00:53:03,033
You saw it, too?
The picture of us?

948
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,833
Yes.

949
00:53:06,866 --> 00:53:09,366
I guess more people have seen it
than I thought.

950
00:53:10,266 --> 00:53:13,620
Mr. Yeon says if this ends up
going on the news,

951
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,966
he's going to deny it for me.

952
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,053
That you, Mr. Kwon,

953
00:53:18,133 --> 00:53:21,386
is my boss at the law firm,

954
00:53:21,466 --> 00:53:25,600
and that that's all there is.

955
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,320
You...

956
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,153
You won't be disappointed?

957
00:53:32,233 --> 00:53:33,153
Sorry?

958
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:34,986
Well, uh...

959
00:53:35,066 --> 00:53:39,120
While I hate being named in
nonsense scandals,

960
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,766
it is true that
I am seeing you, so...

961
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,586
I don't care if
people write about it.

962
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:47,653
So if...

963
00:53:47,733 --> 00:53:49,720
If you are disappointed...

964
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,320
I'm really fine,

965
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,733
and I think it's best to
go by your agency's decision.

966
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,186
Still, if you...

967
00:53:57,266 --> 00:54:00,886
From what I've observed,
public figures who receive

968
00:54:00,966 --> 00:54:03,866
much public attention
almost have no privacy, so...

969
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,953
Because it could lead to

970
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:09,066
unnecessary criticisms and
hurt feelings,

971
00:54:11,466 --> 00:54:13,566
I think it's best you be careful.

972
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:30,733
There you were.

973
00:54:33,966 --> 00:54:35,700
I'm in a bit of a dilemma,

974
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,033
and I was wondering
whether you could help.

975
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,500
Sure.

976
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,466
What is this?

977
00:54:47,866 --> 00:54:50,320
You know Yoon-seo's
last day is this week, right?

978
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,153
So as a farewell present,

979
00:54:52,233 --> 00:54:54,686
I wanted to pick one of
her legendary moments

980
00:54:54,766 --> 00:54:56,733
and turn it into a gif file.

981
00:54:57,866 --> 00:54:59,053
And I wasn't sure
which one was the best.

982
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:00,420
Which one should I go with?

983
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,186
This is your dilemma?

984
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:04,366
Yeah.

985
00:55:07,966 --> 00:55:10,186
By the way, about Yoon-seo...

986
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:12,120
Don't you think she's beautiful?

987
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,533
Even her expression is different
already on the screen.

988
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:16,153
You know,

989
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:18,600
she sure shines the best
when she's acting.

990
00:55:18,933 --> 00:55:20,333
Look at her, smiling at me!

991
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:25,066
Gosh, there's really
not many days left.

992
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:28,153
In just a few days,

993
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:31,253
we'll have to send off
our Princess Ann from

994
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:34,420
Roman Holiday, back to her castle.

995
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,186
I'm curious.

996
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:37,300
About what?

997
00:55:38,266 --> 00:55:42,466
What happens to Princess Ann
in the end?

998
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,020
She returned to
where she ought to be.

999
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,233
Because she's a princess.

1000
00:55:49,733 --> 00:55:52,033
Though that's
what's expected, right?

1001
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,653
As an actress,

1002
00:56:10,733 --> 00:56:13,253
you get to experience
many lives, don't you?

1003
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:14,933
It sounds interesting.

1004
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,466
I was really happy, back then.

1005
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,153
There were more ups to it.

1006
00:56:22,233 --> 00:56:25,320
For example, I'd get excited
when I see a good script,

1007
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,886
and when I'm on the set,
with everyone on the move,

1008
00:56:28,966 --> 00:56:30,753
I felt like I was truly alive.

1009
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:31,986
And when your work is met
with rave reviews,

1010
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:33,620
then there's the sense of
achievement that comes with it.

1011
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,366
In all, I have way more
happy memories.

1012
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,966
Let's cheer for our
cosmic goddess' new start.

1013
00:57:09,966 --> 00:57:12,353
Gosh, thank you so much,

1014
00:57:12,433 --> 00:57:13,453
even holding a farewell party for me.

1015
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:15,220
No need to thank us!

1016
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,586
In fact, I should thank you for

1017
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:18,900
your successful 3 months at Always.

1018
00:57:19,266 --> 00:57:21,120
You know,

1019
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,353
I'm sorry that I won't be
seeing you anymore.

1020
00:57:23,433 --> 00:57:25,900
Why won't we ever see each other?

1021
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:27,953
I'm going going to drop by often.

1022
00:57:28,033 --> 00:57:29,800
Really? You promised!

1023
00:57:30,166 --> 00:57:32,720
Then please
excuse me for this, but...

1024
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,066
Promise me, alright?

1025
00:57:37,933 --> 00:57:38,966
Sure!

1026
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:44,733
Come on, photos for proof!

1027
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:47,666
One, two, three!

1028
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:52,520
Maybe I should've got this
notarized instead?

1029
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,253
Alright, then. Let's eat.
Yoon-seo, this way.

1030
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:55,333
Sure.

1031
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:59,433
By the way, there's no one else
here but us.

1032
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,033
You didn't rent out the
whole restaurant, did you?

1033
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,486
Of course!

1034
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:05,986
Yoon-seo said she loves meat,

1035
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,733
so I reserved this place
for her especially.

1036
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,886
I can guarantee that
this place serves quality meat,

1037
00:58:09,966 --> 00:58:11,500
so go ahead and help yourselves.

1038
00:58:12,666 --> 00:58:14,366
I'm so touched.

1039
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:17,566
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1040
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:23,386
By the way,

1041
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,353
I don't see Mr. Kwon.

1042
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:26,886
Oh, uh...

1043
00:58:26,966 --> 00:58:29,386
He said he has to see a client.

1044
00:58:29,466 --> 00:58:31,420
Gosh, couldn't he have
rescheduled it?

1045
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,386
I mean, this is your farewell party.

1046
00:58:33,466 --> 00:58:37,333
I guess he couldn't help it,
because it was a VIP.

1047
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,320
From how he's not here for
her farewell party,

1048
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,586
they can't be going out. Right?

1049
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:46,300
Please. Just stop it already!

1050
00:58:51,633 --> 00:58:55,820
Mr. Kwon, do you have long to go?

1051
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,753
Can we get more meat, please?

1052
00:58:57,833 --> 00:58:59,766
- Five more servings.
- Sure.

1053
00:59:00,266 --> 00:59:02,733
Here's to Yoon-seo!

1054
00:59:11,566 --> 00:59:12,900
Gosh, this place is great.

1055
00:59:13,933 --> 00:59:15,766
- It really is great.
- Help yourselves.

1056
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:18,886
The news about your new drama has

1057
00:59:18,966 --> 00:59:20,453
already made the headlines!

1058
00:59:20,533 --> 00:59:21,666
Look here.

1059
00:59:22,366 --> 00:59:24,520
I guess everyone's thinking
the same thing.

1060
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,333
Because I'm looking
forward to it as well.

1061
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:30,366
I will make sure to tune in.

1062
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:33,953
Please, enough already.

1063
00:59:34,033 --> 00:59:36,533
I'm really happy for you,
but why these tears?

1064
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,386
Yoon-seo,
don't forget about us, alright?

1065
00:59:40,466 --> 00:59:42,620
You're making her
want to forget about us.

1066
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,353
This is my first time crying
ever since I was born!

1067
00:59:44,433 --> 00:59:46,286
By the way, what's this
new drama about?

1068
00:59:46,366 --> 00:59:47,720
Did you say it's about law?

1069
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,253
Well, it's not entirely about law.

1070
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:54,333
The main setting's the court,
but it's a romantic comedy.

1071
00:59:54,566 --> 00:59:57,020
It still gives a realistic
portrayal of lawyers,

1072
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:00,586
but it's generally about
a guy and a girl

1073
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:03,766
who enter into
a contract relationship.

1074
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:05,800
That sounds like fun.

1075
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:09,666
- Should we order more meat?
- That's so cliched.

1076
01:00:22,533 --> 01:00:25,433
Contract relationship, huh?

1077
01:00:39,366 --> 01:00:41,053
Please go ahead first.

1078
01:00:41,133 --> 01:00:42,166
Thanks.

1079
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,386
Mr. Choi!

1080
01:00:46,466 --> 01:00:48,886
How about we enter into
a contract relationship?

1081
01:00:48,966 --> 01:00:49,966
Pardon?

1082
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,353
I'll be honest with you,
I'm interested in you.

1083
01:00:55,433 --> 01:00:56,753
So how about you date me
for just one month,

1084
01:00:56,833 --> 01:01:01,433
no more and no less?

1085
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,286
How about it?

1086
01:01:03,366 --> 01:01:05,086
She's talking about a contract

1087
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:07,086
that's not about my salary
or a new job...

1088
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:09,953
Yet she's making my heart beat fast
with that word "contract."

1089
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,966
How provocative...

1090
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:14,533
Just what am I to do with you?

1091
01:01:23,466 --> 01:01:25,120
There's no answer...

1092
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,133
Does that mean
you can't come tonight?

1093
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:34,800
(Mr. Kwon Jung-rok)

1094
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:45,166
Hey!

1095
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:48,220
Sorry I'm late.

1096
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,333
Mr. Kwon!

1097
01:01:55,466 --> 01:01:57,186
I didn't hear from you,

1098
01:01:57,266 --> 01:01:59,566
so I thought you were
too busy to come.

1099
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,186
You worked very hard
as my secretary,

1100
01:02:05,266 --> 01:02:07,533
so I thought you needed
a very special farewell party.

1101
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:12,233
That's why I was late, because
I was preparing my own version.

1102
01:02:13,366 --> 01:02:16,120
Your own version?

1103
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,233
Yes.

1104
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:26,486
Why a movie theater?

1105
01:02:26,566 --> 01:02:29,486
You said you found coming to
the cinema a little difficult,

1106
01:02:29,566 --> 01:02:31,653
so I rented out the entire place,

1107
01:02:31,733 --> 01:02:32,933
so you can enjoy the movie
in comfort.

1108
01:02:33,566 --> 01:02:35,086
What?

1109
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:36,333
Really?

1110
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,053
I also asked for your favorite,

1111
01:02:39,133 --> 01:02:40,600
and I hope you like it.

1112
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:43,433
Let's go.

1113
01:02:47,033 --> 01:02:48,233
Roman Holiday?

1114
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:19,086
I had so much fun today.

1115
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:22,120
That was a movie I've always
wanted to watch with you,

1116
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,386
and I'm glad we got to
watch it like this.

1117
01:03:26,466 --> 01:03:29,220
Then thank goodness.

1118
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,153
It was just so perfect!

1119
01:03:31,233 --> 01:03:34,920
My farewell party,
prepared by you.

1120
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,420
Actually, calling it a farewell
party sounds a little weird.

1121
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,553
It's like we're breaking up.

1122
01:03:40,633 --> 01:03:42,020
But it's just that we won't be
seeing each other at the

1123
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,786
law firm anymore, right?

1124
01:03:43,866 --> 01:03:46,000
Though that makes me sad, too...

1125
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,966
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo.

1126
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,333
Why are you calling me Yoon-seo?

1127
01:04:11,666 --> 01:04:14,786
Thanks to you,

1128
01:04:14,866 --> 01:04:16,133
I was very happy.

1129
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,400
Why are you saying this?

1130
01:04:25,733 --> 01:04:28,953
Just like that movie,

1131
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:31,700
I want you to return to
your place as Oh Yoon-seo,

1132
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:38,966
and me, to where I ought to be.

1133
01:04:44,166 --> 01:04:46,400
What do you mean, Mr. Kwon?

1134
01:05:01,533 --> 01:05:02,566
Let's...

1135
01:05:06,866 --> 01:05:08,200
...break up.

1136
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,533
(Touch Your Heart)

1137
01:05:49,733 --> 01:05:50,820
She looks much happier than

1138
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,386
when she was here with us.

1139
01:05:53,466 --> 01:05:56,720
You're like a workaholic these days,
and I like that.

1140
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,720
Let's start the filming!

1141
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,933
I'm ready.

1142
01:06:00,033 --> 01:06:02,086
Honey, how do I look today?

1143
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:03,420
Are you two...

1144
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,920
You can't fool me.

1145
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,886
Where's Kwon Jung-rok?
I said, where is he?

1146
01:06:07,966 --> 01:06:09,753
You're going to defend
Park Su-myung?

1147
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:11,053
You argued that
Mr. Park was the assailant,

1148
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,053
- I'm scared, too.
- so why are you going against...

1149
01:06:13,133 --> 01:06:16,166
That I'll no longer be qualified to

1150
01:06:17,866 --> 01:06:19,600
defend anyone, as their lawyer.

1151
01:06:22,033 --> 01:06:23,186
Cut! Alright!

1152
01:06:23,266 --> 01:06:25,933
Is it because
you can't forget about him?

1153
01:06:26,533 --> 01:06:28,366
I hope he's doing well.
