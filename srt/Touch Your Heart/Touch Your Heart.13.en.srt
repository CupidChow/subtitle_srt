1
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,200
(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:46,920
I had so much fun today.

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,920
That was a movie I've always
wanted to watch with you,

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,333
and I'm glad we got to
watch it like this.

5
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:56,233
Then thank goodness.

6
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,953
It was just so perfect!

7
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:02,686
My farewell party,
prepared by you.

8
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:06,253
Actually, calling it a farewell
party sounds a little weird.

9
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,386
It's like we're breaking up.

10
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:09,886
But it's just that we won't be
seeing each other at the

11
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:11,620
law firm anymore, right?

12
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,900
Though that makes me sad, too...

13
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:21,966
Ms. Oh Yoon-seo.

14
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:28,300
Why are you calling me Yoon-seo?

15
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:30,600
Thanks to you,

16
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,066
I was very happy.

17
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,433
Why are you saying this?

18
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,066
Just like that movie,

19
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,566
I want you to return to
your place as Oh Yoon-seo,

20
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:56,866
and me, to where I ought to be.

21
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:04,400
What do you mean, Mr. Kwon?

22
00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:20,433
Let's...

23
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,100
...break up.

24
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:35,286
Why are you saying that
all of a sudden?

25
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:37,433
Did I do something wrong?

26
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,153
Is it because I deceived you?

27
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:45,253
Did you feel betrayed,
now that you thought about it?

28
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,533
Or…

29
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,533
Did it bother you that our picture
was uploaded on the Internet?

30
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,086
You felt burdened by

31
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,633
all this unwanted attention?

32
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,666
Say something, please.

33
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:04,166
Why should we break up?

34
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,966
Yes.

35
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,966
It's because of all the
reasons you mentioned,

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,253
that I decided it was too much for
me to continue our relationship.

37
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,433
So…

38
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,933
I think it's best
we leave it here.

39
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:24,900
Mr. Kwon…

40
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:30,100
Thank you,

41
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,966
for everything up until now.

42
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,800
(Episode 13)

43
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,433
Yoon-seo!

44
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,400
Oh Yoon-seo!

45
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,133
Is she still in bed?

46
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,833
Yoon-seo!

47
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:15,966
Yoon-seo.

48
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,866
What's wrong?

49
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:22,133
Yoon-seo, have you been crying?

50
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,153
- Hyuk-jun…
- Sure, sure.

51
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:29,153
I'm here for you. I'm right here,

52
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:30,720
so tell me everything.

53
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,053
What's the matter, Yoon-seo?

54
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,533
Mr. Kwon wants to break up.

55
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,953
What?

56
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:42,466
He says it's best
we leave it here.

57
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:49,733
And he said he likes me…

58
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,333
And promised he'll always
be on my side…

59
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:02,633
So how could he change like this,
all of a sudden?

60
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:08,686
How could he just end this
with those few words?

61
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:11,986
This is my first time
breaking up with anyone,

62
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:15,333
so I just don't know what to do.

63
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:26,253
Uh… Yoon-seo, first of all,

64
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,820
you're supposed to pick up
your stuff from the office today,

65
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,666
but I'll do that for you instead.
You just rest.

66
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,920
No, no. I'll go.

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,086
No, Yoon-seo.

68
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,386
I don't think you're in the
right state to do that.

69
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:40,000
Still… I need to see Mr. Kwon.

70
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,833
But… Yoon-seo.

71
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,333
Yoon-seo!

72
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:54,686
Mr. Yeon,

73
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,366
why are you sighing like that?

74
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,853
It somehow feels
so dark in the office.

75
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:02,653
Did a bulb get blown?

76
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:05,386
No, Mr. Yeon. I don't think so.

77
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,620
All six lights are
working as they should,

78
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,020
each in their own place.

79
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,186
Really?

80
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,666
But why does it feel so
dark and gloomy in here?

81
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:18,000
Is it because Yoon-seo is
no longer here?

82
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:20,033
That's it.

83
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:21,920
With our sparkling goddess gone,

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,820
there's just no more life
in the office.

85
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,786
I have to agree. Somehow it…

86
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:27,786
It feels quite empty.

87
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:29,186
Even we're feeling it,

88
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:31,620
so imagine how it must be
for Mr. Kwon.

89
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,953
Yoon-seo's been exceptional
as his secretary,

90
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,520
so he must feel her absence a lot.

91
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,700
Much like…

92
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,953
…a young deer who is dejected that

93
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:43,733
he now has no place to return.

94
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,686
Well, I don't know about
this "young deer,"

95
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,653
but Ms. Yang, please do your best
to support Kwon.

96
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:51,800
- Sure, I'll do that.
- Thanks.

97
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:54,753
Huh? Yoon-seo!

98
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,266
Hey, Yoon-seo!

99
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,920
What brings you here?

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,800
I thought you weren't
coming in, starting today.

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,720
Well…

102
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,086
I'm here to pick up my belongings.

103
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,286
Oh, we could've
posted them to you.

104
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:09,820
No need to come all this way!

105
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,000
Just because…

106
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,433
Somehow, Yoon-seo looks
a little down today.

107
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,166
Mr. Kwon.

108
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:43,533
I, uh…

109
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:46,400
I'll get going, then.

110
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,566
I said, I'm leaving.

111
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,800
If you let me go like this,
then it's really over.

112
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,866
You're still not going to
look at me?

113
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,800
Thank you,

114
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,333
for everything up until now.

115
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,766
I wish you all the best for
your future.

116
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,366
(It's alright, anytime)

117
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:43,653
Hey.

118
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:46,620
If you're free tonight,
want to have a drink?

119
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,533
Sure, let's do that.

120
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,200
I was just in the mood, too.

121
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:56,666
Kwon Jung-rok.

122
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,866
Oh what? Why are you two together?

123
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,400
We decided to get back together.

124
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,286
Yeo-reum was just too clingy,

125
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:20,066
so I decided to take her back.

126
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,220
I really gave up at her

127
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,120
tenacity to win love back.

128
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,220
Don't start making a joke
in front of Jung-rok again.

129
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,253
You know he takes
everything seriously.

130
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,020
Hey, no.

131
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,820
You just don't know it yet.

132
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,253
He's not that serious,

133
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,620
hard-minded Kwon Jung-rok
he was before.

134
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,333
He's sure changed a lot.

135
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,986
Being in a relationship has
softened him up.

136
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:43,620
- Really?
- Of course.

137
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,700
I mean it!

138
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:50,400
If he was all dried up like
this dry squid before,

139
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,320
love has changed him
into a big softie,

140
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,966
so squishy like this folded egg.

141
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,386
What's with your expression?

142
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,486
You don't like my metaphor?

143
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:04,900
Well, I think Yoon-seo will
agree with me.

144
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,853
Now that we're on the topic,

145
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,753
why don’t you ask
Yoon-seo to join us?

146
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,120
Yes, ask her if she wants to
join us, if she's free.

147
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,486
You better hold onto your heart.

148
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:17,153
You'll be shocked to see

149
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,466
just how hard he's fallen for her.

150
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:22,386
Come on!

151
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:23,733
Call her already.

152
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,520
Wait a second.

153
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,953
Is this place to humble for
someone like Yoon-seo?

154
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:33,820
Should we go to
a fancy bar nearby?

155
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,686
Let's do that. It's too open here,

156
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:37,120
and that might make
Yoon-seo feel uncomfortable.

157
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,253
- Right?
- Right.

158
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,633
No need.

159
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,020
Why? Are you worried that
we might bully her?

160
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,186
Look at this.

161
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:47,500
This is how much
he cares for her, alright?

162
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:50,866
We broke up.

163
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:53,433
Just what…

164
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,886
What… But how?

165
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,453
I guess me being here today will

166
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:05,020
only make it awkward for you guys,

167
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,553
so I'll catch up with you later.

168
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:10,300
I'm off first, so enjoy the
rest of your evening.

169
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,266
Kwon Jung-rok!

170
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,720
Hey.

171
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,186
You can't just go like this.

172
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,086
Let's have some soju.

173
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,120
I told Yeo-reum to go ahead first.

174
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,000
- What for?
- What do you mean, what for?

175
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:42,420
I should've sensed
something was wrong

176
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,800
from your tone earlier…

177
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:48,133
Come on, hurry up!

178
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,686
Ma'am, can we get
another bottle here, please?

179
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:57,833
Sure.

180
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,420
So…

181
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,100
You let her go,
so she can be happy?

182
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,653
Why did you, when you knew
you'll have a hard time?

183
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:15,300
You should've just braced it all,
no matter what comes your way.

184
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,353
I knew all too well

185
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:21,833
just how much she wanted this.

186
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,466
And they say
I might get in the way of

187
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,033
her way there.

188
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:38,920
So there was nothing else
I could do to help.

189
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,166
Still…

190
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:46,220
Yoon-seo will now remember you
as that bastard who was

191
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,153
quick to have a change of heart,
without knowing anything.

192
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:50,333
And that's too…

193
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,566
So…

194
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,133
How did you bear it?

195
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:05,666
When you broke up with
Yeo-reum, I mean.

196
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:10,766
How did you bear it?

197
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:23,653
However, in determining the
amount of loss incurred from

198
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:27,020
copyright infringement, because
the software in question was

199
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,086
sold individually and separately,

200
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,786
the scope of compensation
should also reflect

201
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:34,753
the actual damage done.

202
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,620
In regards to the said
overseas development project,

203
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,186
while investigating the slush funds,

204
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,053
we came to discover that
because of the differences in

205
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,153
valuation methods used
at home and abroad,

206
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:45,433
in reality he only incurred
$5 million worth of damages.

207
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:09,820
As for the workers
who breached the law…

208
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,653
Your Honor, please
take into consideration,

209
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:13,320
that the software my client
developed during his time

210
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,086
at the company has generated
huge profit for the company.

211
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,086
We sincerely hope that
you will show as much

212
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,933
clemency as you can, for his case.

213
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,686
Alright, here's to Kwon,
who recorded top sales this month!

214
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:07,500
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

215
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:12,186
Kwon,

216
00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:14,053
you're like
a workaholic these days.

217
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,133
And I'm liking it!

218
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,753
I just wish you'd respond,
when I talk to you.

219
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,986
But…

220
00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:27,153
Is top in sales even
something to celebrate about?

221
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,386
Of course it's something!

222
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:30,886
It's the momentum to propel
Always to a better tomorrow!

223
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:32,286
Choi.

224
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:34,666
When will we ever see you
become that momentum?

225
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:37,286
You said you'll forget about
your sense of justice for

226
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:39,653
the time being, for the
sake of sales,

227
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,820
but rather, you've been making me
wanting to forget you.

228
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,786
What? Don't say such a thing!

229
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,320
That was just too harsh!

230
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,333
That should be my line.

231
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:51,286
Did I offend you in any way?

232
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:52,953
Is this your way of
protesting to me,

233
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:54,186
by terrorizing my eyes?

234
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:55,786
You looked really threatening
when you did just now.

235
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:59,920
Please, Mr. Yeon.
She looks just beautiful.

236
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,320
I couldn't have put it better.

237
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,753
You mind your own business.

238
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,633
For example,
you got sauce on your face.

239
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,300
Do I?

240
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,153
This is really nothing,
but now that mention it

241
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:14,400
in front of anyone,
it's kind of embarrassing.

242
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:16,620
Wait a minute.

243
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,066
What's with this atmosphere?

244
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:20,920
Just now, Dan was defending Choi,

245
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,886
and now Choi's come to
Dan's defense.

246
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:24,653
You can't fool me.

247
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:25,800
Don't tell me…

248
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,620
You've formed an alliance?

249
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,586
You've formed an alliance
as lawyers who don't sell,

250
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,420
and are looking out for
each other, aren't you?

251
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,553
No way, Mr. Yeon.

252
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,653
Still, I like the way
things are now.

253
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:39,720
Before, they used to bicker
like the worst of enemies

254
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,353
but now they've warmed up
to each other,

255
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:45,153
like those cherry blossoms
lining the train tracks.

256
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:47,553
You're quite a poet,
aren't you, Mr. Lee.

257
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:49,686
Though you probably don't
know it yourself. Am I right?

258
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:51,486
You might just become
a poet at this rate.

259
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:52,486
Huh?

260
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:56,053
Actually, that's my secret dream.

261
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:58,753
Really? Then why not write
a poem about me?

262
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,900
On the theme of charisma?

263
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:03,966
That's strong.

264
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:13,586
By the way, why aren't you
smiling, Kwon?

265
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,153
You're so hard-faced,

266
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,500
and it's killing the mood.

267
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:19,253
What if he doesn't smile?
At least he's competent.

268
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,586
As for you, Choi,
you can smile less and

269
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,653
bring me more results, alright?

270
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:24,020
Let's have a drink, Kwon.

271
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,153
With no smiles.

272
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,400
Oops, your glass is empty.

273
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,500
Alright, cheers, with no smiles!

274
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,600
Go on.

You dropped this.

00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,320
Why, thank you.

283
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,200
I really hate making
a faux pas like this one.

284
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,953
I hate people like that too,

285
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:09,220
and this is the first time that
I found it cute.

286
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,333
This is making me embarrassed.

But it's all fine when
it's for Yoon-seo, isn't it?

Ah!

00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:25,053
So she's doing well.

She looks beautiful in this photo.

Take a look.

Isn't Yoon-seo
beautiful, as always?

295

Wow.

296
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,420
For some reason,
she looks much happier than

297
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,386
when she was with us here.

298
00:23:33,466 --> 00:23:35,653
Is it because she's doing
what she really loves?

299
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:38,300
Man… I really miss Yoon-seo.

00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,086
Me too.

301

Maybe she's grown on me,
but I've been missing her.

Right? It's not just me
who misses her, right?

305
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,800
By the way, how come
you're not saying, Kwon?

306
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:58,500
Don't you miss Yoon-seo?

307
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,133
Can't you hear me?

308
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:04,586
Anyways, tsk.

309
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:07,353
You really have no heart.

310
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:08,820
Wait a second.

311
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,520
I don't see Dan or Choi.

312
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,833
I think they're both
seeing someone.

Honey.

314

How do I look today?

- What's wrong with her?

317

you said you like

Well, it's not bad.

319

Oh, Honey.

320

Have one of these.

324
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:48,186
It's alright.

325

And uh,

326
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:51,686
I've been trying to tell you this,

327
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:53,653
but even when we're in
a contract relationship,

328
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:57,753
I think calling each other
"Honey" is a bit too much.

329
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:00,886
Besides, there wasn't a clause
like that in the contract.

330
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,333
Oh, alright.

331
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:24,386
Ms. Dan.

332
00:25:24,466 --> 00:25:28,253
Or maybe you forgot about
its context already?

333
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,900
Then let me remind you again.

334
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:36,153
One. The term of the
relationship is set as one month.

335
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:37,553
There's still five days to go.

336
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:38,953
I haven't forgotten.

337
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:43,520
Two, no flirting with a third party
during the contract

338
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,520
relationship period.

339
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,033
Sure. I've no one else right now
besides you, Mr. Choi.

340
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,586
Three, during the contract period,
we are to go on at least

341
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:54,820
two dining dates a week.

342
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,453
Yes, and that's why we're
having lunch together, isn't it?

343
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:01,500
So what's the problem?

344
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:04,353
There's a clause about
annulment of contract.

345
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:06,753
"No touching."

346
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:09,286
Does that mean
our contract is annulled?

347
00:26:09,366 --> 00:26:11,453
Because I accidentally touched you
while reaching for the sauce?

348
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:14,520
Well, I guess
it wasn't intentional,

349
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,620
so I'll just end that
as a warning this time.

350
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,020
But be careful from now on.

351
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,166
Sure, I'll be careful.

352
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,600
One second.

353
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,900
Yes, this is Choi Yun-hyuk.

354
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,420
Gosh, that was close.

355
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,753
annulment of contract?

356
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,166
That was just too close.

357
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,053
Left hand, you be careful.

358
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:45,433
Warning, warning.

359
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,153
Does she like me that much?

360
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,066
While I do understand…

361
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,100
Still, her love is just too much.

362
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,933
Anyway, what do I do?

363
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,933
I get that she's nice and cute,

364
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:09,200
but my heart doesn't move.

365
00:27:10,466 --> 00:27:11,733
It just doesn't.

366
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:22,833
Jung-rok!

367
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:30,986
I thought it was weird that
you stopped driving to work.

368
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,353
Have you been taking the bus
all this time?

369
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:33,666
Yes, well…

370
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:39,420
Well, I guess this is fate.
How about a glass of soju?

371
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,100
No, let's just go home.

372
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,933
Hey, wait up!

373
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,520
Gosh, you're tired.

374
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,086
You're tired, aren't you?

375
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,253
You didn't get
any sleep last night?

376
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,653
I don't have time to sleep.

377
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:06,220
There's so much to memorize!

378
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,253
Exactly.

379
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,353
And with all those legal jargons,

380
00:28:09,433 --> 00:28:11,700
it's going to be real tough
memorizing it all, huh?

381
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:15,320
But uh…

382
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,786
Working at the law firm has
actually helped a lot.

383
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:20,753
I've heard most of the terms, so…

384
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:24,020
It's easy memorizing them,
and understanding it, too.

385
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,233
We're here.

386
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:27,786
What, already?

387
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:30,533
Too bad, it'll be dawn
when you're finished.

388
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:34,420
It's alright.

389
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,253
Ouch, my back!

390
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,466
I should get out and
stretch my back.

391
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,033
Huh? Hello!

392
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:43,320
Thank goodness.

393
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,533
She's back to where she was
so quickly.

(Oh Yoon-seo At Rehearsal for

397
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:11,666
I guess she's doing fine now.

398
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Cheers!

399
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,120
What's with that big bag?

400
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,266
This is a present for you.

401
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,033
These are masks to protect
your health from fine dust.

402
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,353
You mean not my health,

403
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:42,320
but me, from other women, huh?

404
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Yep!

405
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,586
Oh, and…

406
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:49,233
These are cosmetics to make
your silky skin even smoother!

407
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,353
And these are vitamins to

408
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:53,253
level up your charms!

409
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,753
And these are…

410
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:55,966
Hold on!

411
00:29:58,533 --> 00:30:00,286
Ms. Dan.

412
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,053
Do you like me that much?

413
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,520
I mean, I know very well that

414
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,353
I'm an homme fatale, but…

415
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:09,133
I'm starting to wonder if
you like me that much.

416
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:11,686
Yes.

417
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:14,853
You're so charming,
and the more I get to know you,

418
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:16,300
the more I'm smitten.

419
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,820
That's why it makes me sad.

420
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,453
I like you so much,

421
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:27,400
but this happiness will
expire in 5 days, right?

422
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,686
Tell me honestly.

423
00:30:36,766 --> 00:30:42,620
How has it been for you
this past month?

424
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,686
After the five days,

425
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:49,133
will you just end it with me,
without looking back?

426
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,900
Ms. Dan, you're a great person.

427
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,286
You take such good care of me,

428
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:03,200
and there are
very cute sides to you.

429
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:06,500
But how should I say this…

430
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:16,953
My heart just doesn't move.

431
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:18,100
What?

432
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,153
Are you alright, Ms. Dan?

433
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:31,533
Why did you drink so much?

434
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:34,053
Why, do you think?

435
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:35,686
I like you so much,

436
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:36,820
but when the contract term is up,

437
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,120
we'll just go back to being
what we used to be

438
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,933
and that's causing me grief.

439
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,400
But what can I do?

440
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,333
It's all my fault for
not being able to move your heart.

441
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:40,653
- Are you alright?
- Yes!

442
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm fine.

443
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,820
I'm relieved to hear that.

444
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,366
I'm sorry.

445
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:57,233
Uh…

446
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,120
What's that expression
on your face?

447
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,666
Don't tell me… You fell for him?

448
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:06,520
Yes. Isn't he just great?

449
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,820
But just now, you said
something about how you like me,

450
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,653
and that's causing you grief.

451
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:15,253
But you said you were
unmoved by me.

452
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,500
See, I'm very quick
when it comes to giving up.

453
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,653
Um, excuse me!

454
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:24,353
Ouch, my legs…

455
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:26,786
I think I hurt my legs.

456
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:27,986
So can I have your…

457
00:33:28,066 --> 00:33:30,433
I mean, can I have a ride?

458
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,300
Ohhh, my heart…

459
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,520
Why does my heart hurt?

460
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,153
See, I'm very quick
when it comes to giving up.

461
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:41,300
Huh?

462
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,033
Yes, Mother.

463
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:47,733
What, a marriage interview?

464
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,820
Mother, I told you that
I'm not interested.

465
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,833
Alright, I'm hanging up.

466
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,853
Mr. Lee, I see your mother is
trying to find someone for you.

467
00:33:56,933 --> 00:33:58,620
Yes.

468
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,586
But I have no intention of
going to a marriage interview.

469
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:04,086
Because I'm one of those people

470
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:07,453
you and your other half are
connected by destiny.

471
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:09,286
Oh what?

472
00:34:09,366 --> 00:34:10,486
About your client's guardian.

473
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:13,120
There's a limit to
how many times you can postpone.

474
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,320
I mean, this is just no manners.

475
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,653
Well, I'll reject their request

476
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:20,686
and write to the Court separately
about the current process.

477
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:21,986
Where's Kwon Jung-rok?

478
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:23,120
- Ma'am…
- I said, where is he?

479
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,653
Ma'am, please calm down.

480
00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:27,920
Where's Kwon Jung-rok?
Where is he?

481
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,233
Kwon Jung-rok!

482
00:34:30,266 --> 00:34:32,086
There you are.

483
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:35,286
You remember my son, don't you?

484
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:39,253
My son, whom you turned into
a murderer in split second!

485
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:40,800
Park Su-myung.

486
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,753
Who was it that killed
Mr. Kim Hyung-tae that night?

487
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:48,353
The person who stabbed him was...

488
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:49,720
The person who stabbed him was...!

489
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,553
Su-myung, no! Don't say anything!

490
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:52,953
Ms. Lim, please calm down.

491
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:54,920
Don't hit Yun-hee! Don't!

492
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,486
Don't hit her!

493
00:34:56,566 --> 00:35:01,186
I was so angry that
I came to see you.

494
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,753
Ma'am, please calm down.

495
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:03,786
Let go of me!

496
00:35:03,866 --> 00:35:05,286
Do you think I can calm down?

497
00:35:05,366 --> 00:35:08,200
When he turned my son
into a murderer?

498
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,033
My son, he…

499
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,820
He's not capable of
doing such a cruel thing,

500
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,833
stabbing a person to death!

501
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,520
Ma'am,

502
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,253
I understand how you feel,

503
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:32,220
but this wasn't Mr. Kwon's
sole judgment.

504
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,620
The Court has given
their verdict already.

505
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,766
Exactly!

506
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,286
Tomorrow's the last trial,

507
00:35:38,366 --> 00:35:40,386
so what will happen to my son?

508
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:44,120
What if he's never allowed
outside again?

509
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,133
I won't ever forgive you,
if that happens!

510
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:49,700
Ever!

511
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,933
Ma'am…

512
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,166
Kwon, don't take it to heart.

513
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:02,720
All parents are the same.

514
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,686
When they're driven to
a corner like this,

515
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:08,886
they desperately want to believe
their child's not guilty,

516
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,966
and they lose their
sense of judgment.

517
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,986
Am I not right, Ms. Yang?

518
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:16,520
Well, I have to agree.

519
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,220
Remember how my daughter was
framed last time?

520
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,486
Speaking from that experience,

521
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:24,686
when you find that
your child's in a tough situation

522
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,986
as a parent, you just can't
think rationally.

523
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:30,420
Your mind goes blank,
and you can't think of anything.

524
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,120
I'm sure she needed someone
to vent her anger out on.

525
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,120
Well… Though it's come to this,

526
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,686
I guess she won't be
able to hold on

527
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:41,166
unless she had you to
hate and blame.

528
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,933
So please understand.

529
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:55,533
Counsel, continue.

530
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:56,833
(Defendant)

531
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,420
Our defendant, Mr. Park Su-myung,

532
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,120
harbored feelings for Lim Yun-hee,

533
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,120
who is the wife of
Mr. Kim Hyung-tae, the victim.

534
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,920
On the night of the murder,
on January 21, 2019,

535
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,553
in order to save Lim Yun-hee

536
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:08,920
who was being beaten by
her husband at time,

537
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,553
Mr. Park picked up the knife.

538
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:14,520
But if he was truly to save
Ms. Lim from her husband,

539
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,486
he could have called the police,
or run away with her.

540
00:37:17,566 --> 00:37:20,266
There were plenty of
other options before him.

541
00:37:20,466 --> 00:37:23,420
However, Mr. Park turned to
the most extreme option,

542
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,353
and brutally murdered
the victim by stabbing him

543
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:29,266
once in the stomach,
and once in the chest.

544
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,120
Taking all these
into consideration,

545
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,820
we can deduce that
Mr. Park's actions were not defensive

546
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,653
or intended to help Lim Yun-hee from

547
00:37:34,733 --> 00:37:37,586
unexpected circumstances,

548
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:43,186
but a way of venting the violent
nature within him.

549
00:37:43,266 --> 00:37:44,886
This is why we deem that

550
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:46,720
Mr. Park must be isolated
from society for

551
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,366
a considerable amount of time,

552
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,520
and hereby

553
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,466
demand 20 years of imprisonment.

554
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:05,633
Counsel, final defense.

555
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:09,220
Your Honor, please
take into consideration that

556
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,220
my client has self-confessed to and

557
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,066
is showing remorse for his actions.

558
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,986
Case number 2019-173.

559
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:21,653
The Court rules as follows

560
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,520
for Mr. Park Su-myung,

561
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,666
who has been indicted for murder.

562
00:38:27,966 --> 00:38:32,466
The Court sentences the
defendant to 20 years in prison.

563
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:33,953
No!

564
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,220
No!

565
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,186
Su-myung didn't kill him.

566
00:38:37,266 --> 00:38:39,720
He's not a bad person!

567
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,186
Mom! Don't bully my mom!

568
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:43,486
- Su-myung… Su-myung!
- Don't bully my mom!

569
00:38:43,566 --> 00:38:47,353
- Don't bully my mom!
- No, no!

570
00:38:47,433 --> 00:38:48,420
Mom, take me home.

571
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,253
Mom, I want to go home! Mom!

572
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:54,133
Mom, I want to go home! Mom!

573
00:38:57,866 --> 00:38:59,633
My son didn't kill him!

574
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:09,133
My son didn't kill him!

575
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:34,233
Mr. Kwon.

576
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:36,853
Please save Su-myung.

577
00:39:36,933 --> 00:39:40,453
He didn't kill anyone.

578
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:43,386
It's all my fault.

579
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:46,420
I'm sure you got it wrong.

580
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,333
So please, will you defend him?

581
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,833
Ma'am, I understand how you feel.

582
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:58,753
However, Mr. Park Su-myung has

583
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:01,253
already confessed to
his sin at Court, and…

584
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:05,520
Then why won't they
let him finish his story?

585
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,000
Why won't they listen to him? Why?

586
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,053
My son says he stabbed him
just once.

587
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:18,100
Then it could be that Lim Yun-hee
is responsible for the other one.

588
00:40:19,866 --> 00:40:21,720
I may not know everything,

589
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,220
but I do know that
my son's not a liar.

590
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,366
That woman, Lim Yun-hee…
I find her suspicious.

591
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:32,186
She said she cares for Su-myung
so much that

592
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,153
she was ready to go to
prison for Su-myung,

593
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:37,333
but never once came to
visit my son!

594
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:41,766
She just disappeared from
the neighborhood!

595
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:07,266
(Affidavit: Lim Yun-hee)

596
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:08,700
(Mobile number)

597
00:41:17,066 --> 00:41:20,420
The number
you have called is invalid.

598
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,366
Please check and try again.

599
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:33,120
Yoon-seo, you're always beautiful,

600
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,820
but today, you're simply dazzling.

601
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,920
Even your makeup's done
so perfect.

602
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,620
Right, you're really
a goddess today.

603
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,286
I should take a picture later.

604
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:43,586
Why would you want to do that?

605
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:44,886
Are you here to hang out?

606
00:41:44,966 --> 00:41:48,253
Be quiet, she's looking forward to
a serious scene today.

607
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,020
So the least we can do is
to help her mentally

608
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,686
prepare for it.

609
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:52,900
Am I not right? Huh?

610
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:56,133
What? Are you ticked off now?

611
00:41:56,366 --> 00:41:58,620
- Ready for shooting.
- Sure!

612
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,066
We're all ready.

613
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:04,753
Alright.

614
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:05,933
Action!

615
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:10,553
What is it?

616
00:42:10,633 --> 00:42:13,100
What's with the hesitation?

617
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:19,320
What's this about?

618
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,466
Let's…

619
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,466
…break up.

620
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:26,266
I'm saying, let's break up.

621
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,466
Let's…

622
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:34,033
…break up.

623
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:50,666
Cut! Alright.

624
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,400
Ah, Yoon-seo. That was great!

625
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:01,066
I'm sorry.
Can you give me a second?

626
00:43:06,966 --> 00:43:08,386
Wow.

627
00:43:08,466 --> 00:43:11,333
Who knew Yoon-seo could
pull off such acting?

628
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:15,466
Right. I guess she was so into it,
that she can't help her tears.

629
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,153
She's improved a lot.

630
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:20,266
We won't have to worry about
her bad acting anymore.

631
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:22,320
What's bad acting?

632
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,033
Because you won't need to
worry about that anymore.

633
00:43:27,266 --> 00:43:29,133
- Excuse me, please.
- Oh, sure.

634
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,900
Yoon-seo, are you alright?

635
00:43:47,766 --> 00:43:48,966
Why are you crying like this?

636
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,920
Is it because
that reminded you of him?

637
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,400
I'm trying to forget him.

638
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,933
I'm trying my best, but…

639
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,453
When everything just keeps
reminding me of him,

640
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:08,466
I just don't know
what to do with myself.

641
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:11,820
I thought…

642
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,553
You were over it now.

643
00:44:13,633 --> 00:44:17,200
How can I? I loved him so much.

644
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,053
But I guess I can't help it.

645
00:44:24,133 --> 00:44:25,853
I'll have to think of those

646
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:29,133
who are working for me, and
who are awaiting my return.

647
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,100
Besides, if I continue to
have a hard time like this,

648
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:40,733
I'm sure Mr. Kwon won't like it.

649
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:45,800
I'm sorry, Hyuk-jun.

650
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:48,533
I'll try my best to…

651
00:44:50,366 --> 00:44:52,020
…control myself, somehow.

652
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,600
Don't worry.

653
00:44:55,366 --> 00:44:56,820
You know,

654
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,220
I'm sorry too, Yoon-seo.

655
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,200
Get some rest, then.

656
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,133
I wonder if he's doing well?

657
00:45:14,433 --> 00:45:15,386
It turns out

658
00:45:15,466 --> 00:45:17,320
Lim Yun-hee was released

659
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,153
after the entrance of
Park Su-myung,

660
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:21,053
the new suspect,
during the first hearing.

661
00:45:21,133 --> 00:45:23,466
And ever since then,
she's gone missing.

662
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:25,753
I asked around the neighborhood,

663
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:28,433
but no one has seen her since.

664
00:45:30,533 --> 00:45:32,320
And, uh… I checked just in case,

665
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,586
but there were a total of
11 insurance plans that were

666
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,853
under Mr. Kim's name, and
some were paid to Ms. Lim.

667
00:45:38,933 --> 00:45:43,366
That's $2.73 million, out of the
$4.94 million.

668
00:45:44,766 --> 00:45:46,486
By any chance, that payout…

669
00:45:46,566 --> 00:45:49,700
I think she withdrew it all in cash,
and disappeared.

670
00:45:51,133 --> 00:45:54,953
She hasn't received all the
payouts yet, but she went dark.

671
00:45:55,033 --> 00:45:56,420
Something's definitely
fishy, right?

672
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,866
Let's first meet with
the insurance companies.

673
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,520
When did you meet Ms. Lim Yun-hee?

674
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,853
February 27th.

675
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:09,386
We met briefly, because there was
something she needed to sign

676
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:10,700
regarding the payout.

677
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,386
Oh, this is the cafe
that we met at.

678
00:46:13,466 --> 00:46:16,120
Did she say anything
in particular?

679
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,386
For example, that she was going
somewhere or meeting someone.

680
00:46:21,466 --> 00:46:24,233
No, nothing special.

681
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,986
Oh, but…

682
00:46:29,066 --> 00:46:32,366
She kept looking outside.

683
00:46:33,033 --> 00:46:34,933
I wondered what
she was looking at, and…

684
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,033
There was a man waiting for her?

685
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,600
I clearly saw her
getting into his car.

686
00:46:47,533 --> 00:46:50,053
So I thought, she had
come with someone.

687
00:46:50,133 --> 00:46:52,153
I mean, it was a pretty big case,

688
00:46:52,233 --> 00:46:54,686
so I'd wondered
what she was like in person.

689
00:46:54,766 --> 00:46:57,933
But I didn't think she would
come here with a man.

690
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:13,020
Who do you think this man is?

691
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:17,353
Do you think she had a lover?

692
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:19,700
Because as far as we know,
she has no other family.

693
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,986
Anyway, Yoon-seo will be shocked

694
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,586
when she learns this.

695
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:28,933
She was so eager about
this case, right?

696
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,466
Why, she even visited
Lim Yun-hee's house with you.

697
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:35,220
And when Park Su-myung
hit you like that,

698
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,053
she'd been really worried…

699
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:38,720
Ms. Oh Jin-sim, are you alright?

700
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,886
What about you, Mr. Kwon?

701
00:47:40,966 --> 00:47:42,986
Oh no. You're still bleeding!

702
00:47:43,066 --> 00:47:44,433
Oh no...

703
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,766
Let's go.

704
00:47:58,133 --> 00:47:59,286
What?

705
00:47:59,366 --> 00:48:01,386
You want to defend Park Su-myung?

706
00:48:01,466 --> 00:48:03,553
It was you, Kwon, who put him
on the witness stand

707
00:48:03,633 --> 00:48:07,166
and accused him of
being the murderer!

708
00:48:07,633 --> 00:48:09,986
And now you tell me that
the murderer is someone else?

709
00:48:10,066 --> 00:48:12,566
What do you mean, you want to
defend Park Su-myung?

710
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:14,286
Oh, I don't know.

711
00:48:14,366 --> 00:48:16,020
Actually, I'll pretend
I didn’t hear this. So go.

712
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,220
Actually, I'll get out.

713
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,686
- Mr. Yeon.
- So why do you want to

714
00:48:18,766 --> 00:48:20,733
gamble about something
you're not even sure of?

715
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:25,066
You do realize this is against
our code of ethics, right?

716
00:48:27,433 --> 00:48:30,300
So there. You just can't.

717
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,986
I clearly told you no, alright?

718
00:48:33,066 --> 00:48:34,166
And that's final.

719
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:04,486
Jeez, I feel like I'm walking on
thin ice, because of Kwon.

720
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,466
I just don't know
what to do with him.

721
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,220
What if he ends up begging me that

722
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,486
he'll take on that case?

723
00:49:10,566 --> 00:49:12,400
Come on. No way!

724
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,500
Geez, he's giving me
so much trouble…

725
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,120
I'm back.

726
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,220
Welcome back!

727
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,033
Ms. Dan, did your trial go well?

728
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,120
Yes, somewhat.

729
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,920
By the way, I think Yoon-seo
will be filming her drama

730
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,253
in front of the court.

731
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:34,666
There was a sticker on the van
saying, "Love Is Bound to Hurt."

732
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,520
Hello? This is Dan Mun-hee.

733
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,020
It'll be so much fun,
if we all go to see her.

734
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,353
Should we?

735
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:47,386
Hae-young, Mr. Yeon has
a lot on his mind right now,

736
00:49:47,466 --> 00:49:49,986
so do you think
now is the time for that?

737
00:49:50,066 --> 00:49:52,353
- Because I think not.
- Oh, right.

738
00:49:52,433 --> 00:49:56,453
I guess I got too excited
and couldn't read the atmosphere.

739
00:49:56,533 --> 00:49:57,686
Right.

740
00:49:57,766 --> 00:50:00,420
This is no time to.

741
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,800
Nope, not at all.

742
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:10,653
Uh… I thought you wanted to
go for lunch, so why here?

743
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:11,720
Why else?

744
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,700
I thought we should try the
cafeteria at the court.

745
00:50:17,233 --> 00:50:19,786
It's supposed to be real good.

746
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:21,153
Really?

747
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:23,020
I've never heard anyone say that.

748
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,166
Well, now you know.

749
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,653
It's thanks to eating here
at this cafeteria that

750
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:32,786
I got all the positive energy to

751
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:34,666
win all those trials that I won.

752
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:40,353
Mr. Yeon, are you here to
see the filming, by any chance?

753
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:41,433
Yes.

754
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,186
- I mean, no.
- Was that a yes or a no?

755
00:50:44,266 --> 00:50:46,653
Uh… No.

756
00:50:46,733 --> 00:50:49,420
Well, rather than coming here to
see the filming,

757
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,853
I thought it wouldn't be bad to
have a look

758
00:50:50,933 --> 00:50:52,186
while we're passing by.

759
00:50:52,266 --> 00:50:53,853
It's not like I have
an ulterior motive.

760
00:50:53,933 --> 00:50:55,653
I mean, she was once our family,

761
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:58,333
so I thought we should
at least say hi.

762
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,586
Besides, did you or didn't you say
you wanted to see her or not?

763
00:51:02,666 --> 00:51:03,700
You did, right?

764
00:51:04,033 --> 00:51:05,886
So I thought I should make the
sacrifice to

765
00:51:05,966 --> 00:51:09,753
cheer up my employees.

766
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:12,400
Anyway, where is Yoon-seo?

767
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,920
Sorry, you can't come too close.

768
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,086
- Oh, sure.
- We could get you on camera.

769
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:20,853
Oh, right. The camera.
Sure, we know that.

770
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:23,566
But uh… We're not just
random passers-by.

771
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:28,886
See, I know Ms. Oh Yoon-seo
very well.

772
00:51:28,966 --> 00:51:31,186
Oh, sure.

773
00:51:31,266 --> 00:51:33,153
Everyone in this country

774
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:36,186
knows Ms. Oh Yoon-seo very well.

775
00:51:36,266 --> 00:51:39,386
We'll start shooting soon,
so please excuse us.

776
00:51:39,466 --> 00:51:41,153
Let's just go, Mr. Yeon.

777
00:51:41,233 --> 00:51:42,386
Ms. Yang…

778
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:43,553
All's under control,
and we're ready to start.

779
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:46,186
Must you make me say it that
I'm the representing lawyer of

780
00:51:46,266 --> 00:51:49,333
Always, the law firm that's
leading this industry?

781
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:52,186
I mean, he might not know me.

782
00:51:52,266 --> 00:51:53,820
So imagine how
shocked he might be.

783
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,353
No, that's not what I…

784
00:51:55,433 --> 00:51:57,966
Whatever, just stop it already.

785
00:51:58,733 --> 00:52:02,320
I didn't know your tongue
was so loose, Ms. Yang.

786
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,986
At this rate, you're going to
blab on about

787
00:52:05,066 --> 00:52:06,853
how I'm a highly respected lawyer,

788
00:52:06,933 --> 00:52:10,800
who's featured on many TV shows!

789
00:52:12,066 --> 00:52:16,220
Or why don't you just say that

790
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,633
the law firm Yoon-seo worked at,
is ours?

791
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,966
Mr. Yeon!

792
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:28,566
Yoon-seo…

793
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:32,186
Yoon-seo is running toward me,

794
00:52:32,266 --> 00:52:33,966
while calling out my name.

795
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:39,500
Ms. Yang! Hae-young!

796
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,853
How did you come here?

797
00:52:41,933 --> 00:52:44,486
I missed you guys so much.

798
00:52:44,566 --> 00:52:45,653
It's so good to see you!

799
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:46,800
Me too.

800
00:52:47,766 --> 00:52:49,686
So what brings you here?

801
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:50,900
All three of you?

802
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,200
I sometimes take a walk
in front of the court, like this.

803
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,953
While reminding myself of
the resolve I made,

804
00:52:56,033 --> 00:52:59,586
to fight on the side of the weak.

805
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:01,886
Today is one of those days.

806
00:53:01,966 --> 00:53:03,586
Today is one of those days?

807
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:05,620
Yes, it's one of those days.

808
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,786
Anyway, this is great.

809
00:53:06,866 --> 00:53:09,553
My shooting's been delayed
so I have some free time.

810
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:10,953
You're yet to have lunch, right?

811
00:53:11,033 --> 00:53:12,866
How about we all go for lunch?

812
00:53:19,433 --> 00:53:21,253
Why are you looking
at me like that?

813
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:22,420
Go on, eat.

814
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,820
I just can't believe this is real.

815
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,386
It feels like dining with
a celebrity right now.

816
00:53:26,466 --> 00:53:28,220
- What?
- Same here.

817
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,420
When I saw you on the set,

818
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,586
it finally sunk that
you are an actress, Yoon-seo.

819
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:34,620
I still can't believe that

820
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,620
we'd chat so casually back then.

821
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,386
Don't be like that,
it's so awkward.

822
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,286
And I feel like there's
a distance between us now.

823
00:53:41,366 --> 00:53:43,886
Besides, you've no idea
how much I missed you guys.

824
00:53:43,966 --> 00:53:45,033
Really?

825
00:53:46,566 --> 00:53:47,853
You even missed us?

826
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:48,933
Yes.

827
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,120
I knew you'd feel my absence,

828
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,766
but this is quite embarrassing,
hearing it directly from you.

829
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,520
You haven't changed
at all, Mr. Yeon.

830
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,600
No.

831
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,220
Is everyone else doing well?

832
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,520
Well, Mr. Choi and Ms. Dan
seem to be really busy.

833
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,820
I think they're both
seeing someone.

834
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,333
And Mr. Lee of course, is
as sentimental as always.

835
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:19,020
Mr. Kwon is doing well too, is he?

836
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,753
Well? Ha!

837
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:23,353
I'm worried that

838
00:54:23,433 --> 00:54:25,033
he'll cause trouble soon.

839
00:54:26,466 --> 00:54:30,833
I think he's going to say
he'll defend Park Su-myung.

840
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,233
What?

841
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,766
Park Su-myung…?

842
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,386
Mr. Kwon, how are you doing?

843
00:54:53,466 --> 00:54:57,266
I was just thinking about you,
and…

844
00:55:09,966 --> 00:55:12,366
(Corrections)

845
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:18,566
Do you remember me?

846
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:22,620
Yes, I remember you.

847
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:26,653
Your mother came to see me.

848
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:28,800
And asked me to help you.

849
00:55:29,733 --> 00:55:36,153
So please answer me honestly.

850
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,486
Alright, I will.

851
00:55:38,566 --> 00:55:43,653
I was told you only stabbed
Ms. Lim's husband just once.

852
00:55:43,733 --> 00:55:44,966
Is this true?

853
00:55:45,933 --> 00:55:47,653
That's right,

854
00:55:47,733 --> 00:55:49,753
I stabbed him once.

855
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,953
That man beat her every day,

856
00:55:52,033 --> 00:55:55,066
so I got so mad and stabbed him.

857
00:55:56,266 --> 00:55:58,020
And Yun-hee told me to run.

858
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,520
So I listened to her.

859
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,566
I ran away.

860
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,500
By the way, where's Mom?

861
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:09,620
Mom's having a hard time.

862
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,700
I need to help her.

863
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,853
I need to help Mom.

864
00:56:13,933 --> 00:56:15,620
I need to make deliveries…

865
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,686
Mom…

866
00:56:16,766 --> 00:56:20,200
I don't want Mom to
have a hard time anymore.

867
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:23,586
I honestly only stabbed him once.

868
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:25,566
Just once.

869
00:56:56,533 --> 00:56:58,133
Kwon, are you crazy?

870
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:02,766
Must you defend Park Su-myung?

871
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,600
Yes.

872
00:57:09,466 --> 00:57:11,886
Alright, let's say,

873
00:57:11,966 --> 00:57:15,953
you're right and the
real murderer is out there.

874
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:19,033
But you'll get hurt, for
accusing the wrong person!

875
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,186
But let's say Park Su-myung is
his murderer after all.

876
00:57:23,266 --> 00:57:24,520
Either way, you'll be hounded at.

877
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,720
For accusing someone when
you're not even sure.

878
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,220
They'll think you're blatant to
defend him after all this time.

879
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,820
And accuse you of
being inconsistent.

880
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:39,320
This will test the
public trust on lawyers.

881
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,366
I already gave him word
that I'll defend him.

882
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,920
I even notified the Court already.

883
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,033
What?

884
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,686
I'm sorry.

885
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:50,833
Oh, you're sorry?

886
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,553
If you're so sorry,
then why did you do it?

887
00:57:55,633 --> 00:57:59,186
This is serious matter, so
why did you decide on your own?

888
00:57:59,266 --> 00:58:02,286
I knew you'd oppose me to the end,

889
00:58:02,366 --> 00:58:03,320
so I had no choice.

890
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,300
You don't take my warnings
seriously, do you?

891
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,900
- Mr. Yeon.
- Ha!

892
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,420
Do you even see me as your boss?

893
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,153
Kwon.

894
00:58:14,233 --> 00:58:16,153
I mean, Jung-rok.

895
00:58:16,233 --> 00:58:18,453
Now the whole world will
point their finger at you.

896
00:58:18,533 --> 00:58:20,320
Do you think there will be
anyone out there who's on your side?

897
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,020
After accusing an innocent man
and turning him into a murderer,

898
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,986
now you're going back on your word
and admitting it was your mistake.

899
00:58:26,066 --> 00:58:27,220
But I have to.

900
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,733
It was my mistake, after all.

901
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,286
Though it's late,
I'd like to set things right.

902
00:58:34,366 --> 00:58:37,733
Right, you and
your sense of justice.

903
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,220
But there isn't anyone out there
who'll think that

904
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,453
you're doing this for justice.

905
00:58:41,533 --> 00:58:44,353
The world will brand you
as a lawyer

906
00:58:44,433 --> 00:58:46,100
who takes the Court for a show!

907
00:58:48,766 --> 00:58:51,220
As I told you, that is
solely my burden…

908
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,286
Then what about us?

909
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:54,286
What about everyone at Always?

910
00:58:54,366 --> 00:58:56,853
Don't you care about the
criticisms they'll face?

911
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,353
If you ever considered us family,

912
00:58:58,433 --> 00:59:01,686
or cared about us,

913
00:59:01,766 --> 00:59:03,266
you can't do this to me.

914
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,466
You can't do this to me,
do you understand me?

915
00:59:27,966 --> 00:59:31,953
I heard you were given the power
of attorney for that Park case.

916
00:59:32,033 --> 00:59:33,653
What happened?

917
00:59:33,733 --> 00:59:34,686
Well, that’s how it is.

918
00:59:34,766 --> 00:59:36,520
Tsk, you…

919
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,186
The risks may be
bigger than you think,

920
00:59:39,266 --> 00:59:41,133
so must you do this?

921
01:00:01,066 --> 01:00:02,866
I'm scared too.

922
01:00:05,233 --> 01:00:08,086
I still don’t know
what the truth is,

923
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:10,853
but I'm scared that
my rash judgments

924
01:00:10,933 --> 01:00:13,666
may have driven someone to
a corner.

925
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:17,866
I'm scared that

926
01:00:20,766 --> 01:00:23,886
I may leave a scar

927
01:00:23,966 --> 01:00:25,933
that will never heal,

928
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,600
in someone's heart.

929
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:37,753
But…

930
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:39,833
If I were to ignore this

931
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,933
and miss this chance to
correct my mistakes,

932
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,033
I may not have the confidence to

933
01:00:55,233 --> 01:00:58,233
represent anyone again.

934

(Kim Hae-young)

935
01:01:38,233 --> 01:01:39,586
Great picture, right?

936
01:01:39,666 --> 01:01:42,366
Come drop by sometime, Yoon-seo.

937
01:01:47,933 --> 01:01:52,786
By the way, Mr. Kwon will be
taking that case after all.

938
01:01:52,866 --> 01:01:54,520
So things have really been
scary between Mr. Kwon

939
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,286
and Mr. Yeon after they had a row.

940
01:01:57,366 --> 01:01:59,453
I can only imagine the
burden on Mr. Kwon's shoulders,

941
01:01:59,533 --> 01:02:02,400
when he now has
no secretary to support him.

942

(Prosecution Service)

943
01:02:12,966 --> 01:02:14,220
What?

944
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,286
Kwon Jung-rok will be
defending Park Su-myung?

945
01:02:16,366 --> 01:02:18,266
Yes, that's what I heard.

946
01:02:19,266 --> 01:02:22,986
Ha! When was the time

947
01:02:23,066 --> 01:02:25,253
he accused him of
being the murderer?

948
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:27,466
And now he wants to defend him?

949
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,866
Funny guy, isn't he?

950
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,300
Sir, I'm Koo Sung-gil from
Daehan Daily.

951
01:02:44,966 --> 01:02:48,253
I hear Mr. Park Su-myung
will be appealing.

952
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:49,366
Is this true?

953
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,153
Well…

954
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:54,700
Even if he does,
things won't change much.

955
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:58,166
By the way,

956
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,400
there's an interesting
rumor that I heard.

957
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,033
Mr. Kwon Jung-rok.

958
01:03:07,933 --> 01:03:09,686
Why did you go back on your word

959
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:11,153
after accusing
Mr. Park of being the offender?

960
01:03:11,233 --> 01:03:13,786
That means an innocent man is
being locked up in prison right now.

961
01:03:13,866 --> 01:03:15,086
Don't you feel guilty about it?

962
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,953
Some are even saying this is
against the lawyers' code of ethics.

963
01:03:17,033 --> 01:03:18,320
What do you have to say to that?

964
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,586
Is it true that you'll be
defending him for money?

965
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:22,886
A lawyer who will be defending
a man forced a confession out of

966
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:26,286
for his previous client…

967
01:03:26,366 --> 01:03:28,386
And once again,
they'll be pleading not guilty.

968
01:03:28,466 --> 01:03:29,786
What are your thoughts?

Article 22 of the
Lawyer Code of Ethics

970
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:33,453
states that where there is
a conflict of interest

971
01:03:33,533 --> 01:03:36,120
between two or more parties
involved in the same affair,

972
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,986
lawyers should refrain from
representing multiple parties.

973
01:03:38,066 --> 01:03:40,120
In other case,
this is just not on.

974
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,720
There's hardly a case like this
in the industry.

975
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,253
I think the Bar Association…

976
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:46,386
What do we do?

977
01:03:46,466 --> 01:03:49,400
Right, his decision hasn't been
met favorably.

978
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:55,966
Let's stop watching,
it'll only trouble you.

979
01:03:58,366 --> 01:04:00,720
When I was troubled,

980
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,900
Mr. Kwon would always
be there for me.

981
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,766
Um, Mr. Kwon?

982
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,353
Don't mind what others are saying.

983
01:04:32,433 --> 01:04:35,966
Because I believe
you're going to win.

Abetting Murder)

987
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:29,486
Mr. Kwon, how have you been?

988
01:05:29,566 --> 01:05:33,020
I think I know
what I want for my wish now.

989
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:37,820
My wish is to
never see you waiver.

990
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,686
And just like you always have,

991
01:05:39,766 --> 01:05:43,100
I'm sure you'll pull through this.

992
01:07:51,433 --> 01:07:53,300

his special cameo appearance)

(Touch Your Heart)

994
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,820
I may have ruined someone's life,

995
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,753
so I need to make
things right again.

996
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:31,453
- Here's my resignation letter.
- Do what you want.

997
01:08:31,533 --> 01:08:32,886
Because I don't need someone

998
01:08:32,966 --> 01:08:34,053
who's irresponsible like you.

999
01:08:34,133 --> 01:08:34,986
Do what you want.

1000
01:08:35,066 --> 01:08:36,053
You're not in
middle school anymore.

1001
01:08:36,133 --> 01:08:38,100
Why are you two fighting?

1002
01:08:38,866 --> 01:08:40,720
Going to work now, Mr. Kwon?

1003
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,053
I'm going to come see you
when I want to.

1004
01:08:43,133 --> 01:08:45,520
Mr. Kwon, do you want to
have dinner with me?

1005
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,286
Why are you doing this?

1006
01:08:47,366 --> 01:08:48,720
It's all just to save a life.

1007
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,786
Who else? Kwon, who's become
the national enemy.

1008
01:08:52,866 --> 01:08:56,420
My wish is to
never see you waiver.

1009
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,633
And just like you always have,
I'm sure you'll pull through this.
